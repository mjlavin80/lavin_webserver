      <p>Open data is the future of the scholarly field of digital humanities. A culture of openness and collective access
        to shared digital objects of study will enable digital humanists to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Collaborate more effectively</li>
            <li>Interrogate and invalidate insufficiently rigorous scholarship</li>
            <li>Verify and build upon excellent scholarship</li>
            <li>Avoid duplicating the intense labor of data creation and normalization</li>
            <li>Learn new methods and approaches at a pace that’s consistent with the speed at which DH moves</li>
            </li>
        </ol>

      <p>Currently, the open data movement in digital humanities is growing but not yet dominant. It’s all too common to
        publish data-driven humanities scholarship without making one’s data available to the public. Concerns about
        proprietary data, copyright, vendors’ terms and conditions, and long-term data curation are significant roadblocks
        and are not to be dismissed out of hand. In turn, an overall reticence about data for the humanities (or using the
        term <em>data</em> when discussing DH) creates a climate where discussions about open data are more difficult to
        have.</p>
      <p>Humanitiesdata.com seeks to help address some of these roadblocks by collecting and disseminating information about
        publicly available data and the people who are creating it. There are numerous places to find data of relevance to the
        humanities, including the Corpora listserv and the digital humanities Slack channel, but a more consolidated web-based
        clearinghouse for web-hosted resources can only increase visibility and help newcomers to digital humanities find their
        way. As a result, the mission of humanitiesdata.com is not to replace any existing resources but, rather, to
        increase the overall number of digital pathways to humanities data, and to make it easier to search for data by
        its relevance to specific subfields.</p>
