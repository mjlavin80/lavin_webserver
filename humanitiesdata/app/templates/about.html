      <big>
      <p>Humanitiesdata.com seeks to help collect and disseminate information about publicly available data of particular
        interest to digital humanities and humanities computing. It is founded on the premise that open data will be
        crucial for the future of digital humanities. A culture of openness and collective access
        to shared digital objects of study will enable digital humanists to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Collaborate more effectively</li>
            <li>Interrogate and invalidate insufficiently rigorous scholarship</li>
            <li>Verify and build upon excellent scholarship</li>
            <li>Avoid duplicating the intense labor of data creation and normalization</li>
            <li>Learn new methods and approaches at a pace that’s consistent with the speed at which DH moves</li>
            </li>
        </ol>
      <p>Currently, the open data movement in digital humanities is growing but not yet dominant. It’s all too common to
        publish data-driven humanities scholarship without making one’s data available to the public. Concerns about
        proprietary data, copyright, vendors’ terms and conditions, and long-term data curation are significant roadblocks
        and are not to be dismissed out of hand. In turn, an overall reticence about data for the humanities (or using the
        term <em>data</em> when discussing DH) creates a climate where discussions about open data are more difficult to
        have.</p>
      <p>There are numerous places to find data of relevance to the humanities, including the Corpora listserv and the digital humanities Slack channel,
        but a more consolidated web-based clearinghouse for web-hosted resources can only
        increase visibility and help newcomers to digital humanities find their way. As a result, the mission of
        humanitiesdata.com is not to replace any existing resources but, rather, to
        increase the overall number of digital pathways to humanities data, and to make it easier to search for data by
        its relevance to specific subfields.</p></big>

    Do you host datasets?
  </p>
  <p class="list-group-item">No, we do not. We only collect links to datasets and "recipes" that demonstrate some kind of data fetch operation (scraping, API, etc.).</p>
</div>
<div class="list-group">
<p class="list-group-item disabled">
  Then how can I host a dataset?
</p>
<p class="list-group-item">You can use <a href="http://ckan.org">CKAN</a> services like datahub.io, host your own
  data via Github or Github Large File Storage, and share recipes using Gist.
  If hosting your own data, you can use our metadata schema to make sure you've filled in the required and
  required-if-applicable data fields associated with
  <a href="https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/schema/">Project Open Data version 1.1</a>.
  These fields are specifically design to map to
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/">Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT)</a> and
  <a href="http://ckan.org">CKAN</a> sites.
  Some <a href="https://project-open-data.cio.gov/schema/">POD schema version 1.0</a>
  fields are also included in order to assure mappings.</p>

            <h4>Under the Hood</h4>
            <p><big>Humanitiesdata.com is one component of the webserver, which is represented by this
              <a href="https://github.com/mjlavin80/lavin_webserver">Github repository</a>.
              The webserver uses Docker to containerize a proxy server (nginx), and several other Docker containers.
              Humanitiesdata.com is container running Flask (Python for the web) with WSGI. The page design uses bootstrap3
              to achieve responsiveness (i.e., mobile website compatible). As the site grows in size, it would ideal to add elasticsearch to power
              a search engine but, for now, a lightweight javascript search (over json) seems to be performin adequately.
