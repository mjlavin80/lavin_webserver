        <p>Humanitiesdata.com is starting with two content types: datasets and recipes. We may expand to include additional
          resources types if there is interest.</p>
        <p>A dataset contribution should describe the data, provide a link to a web-based endpoint where the data can be
          found, and suggest at least three tags for the dataset. Our goal is to make it easy for users to search for data by keyword or by tag.</p>
        <p>Would-be contributors are encouraged to submit datasets and recipes.</p>
        <p>A recipe should also include a descrption, tags, and a link. The link to lead to a code snippet on a publicly available endpoint, such as
        Gist or JSfiddle. Code should not be pasted into the submission description. One of your tags should indicate the programming language of the snippet.</p>
