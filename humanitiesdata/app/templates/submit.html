  <p>Humanitiesdata.com is starting with two content types: datasets and recipes. We may expand to include additional resources types based on demand.</p>

  <p>A dataset contribution should describe the data, provide a link to a web-based endpoint where the data can be
    found, and suggest at least three tags for the dataset. Our current schema is designed to be compatible with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/">Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT)</a> and <a href="http://ckan.org">CKAN</a></p>
    <h3><a class="middle" href="submit/dataset">Submit a Dataset</a></h3>

<div class="col-lg-4 inner" >
<p>Our goal is to make it easy for users to search for data by keyword or by tag. Would-be contributors are encouraged to submit either. A name and email address are required. We hope to expand to accept Twitter or Githuib credentials in lieu of this information.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-lg-4 inner" >
  <p>A recipe should also include a description, tags, and a link. The link to lead to a code snippet on a publicly available endpoint, such as
  Gist or JSfiddle. Code should not be pasted into the submission description. One of your tags should indicate the programming language of the snippet.</p>
