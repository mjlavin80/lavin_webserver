•3*1 have differed from Mr. Sheridan in the sound of the first syllable of this word, as he seems to have adopted a vulgar pronunciation, which does not distinguish between the sound of /, succeeded by single or double r, not final; and the sound of / final, or succeeded by r and another consonant.

Mis, ntfs. An inseparable particle
used in "composition to mark an ill sense, or depravation of the meaning, as chance, luck; mischance, ill luck ; to like, to be pleased ; to mislike, to be offended. It is derived from mes, in Teutonick and French, used in the same sense.
(£/* What is remarkable in the pronunciation of this inseparable preposition is, that the j, whether the accent be on it or not, or whether it be followed by a sharp or flat consonant, always retains its sharp, hissing sound, and never goes into z, like dis and ex. The reason seems to be, that the latter come lo us compounded, and ha\ e their meaning so mingled with the word as to coalesce with it, while mis remains a distinct prefix, and has but one uniform meaning.
