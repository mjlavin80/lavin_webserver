DIFFERENT SOUNDS OF THE LETTER 0.
served, that the pure sound of i like e in these words is as much the mark of ai elegant speaker as that of the u in singular, educate, Sic. See No. 179.
O.
161.	Grammarians have generally allowed this letter but three sounds. Mi
Sheridan instances them in noty nr>u*y prove. For a fourth, I have added the o ii tovtj dove, &c.; for the fifth, that in or, nory for ; and a sixth, that in *tvomai\ tuolf, Sec.	'
162.	The first and only peculiar sound of this letter is that by which it i named in the alphabet: it requires the mouth to be formed, in some degree like the letter, in order to pronounce it. This may be called its long opei
' sound, as the o in prorve may be called its long slender sound. (65.) This soun* we find in words ending with silent e, as tone* bone, alone ; or when ending a syl lable with the accent upon it, as mo-tion,po-tent, Sec.; likewise in the monosylla bles, go, sOy no. This sound is found under several combinations of other vowel with this letter, as in moan, grcan, bow (to shoot with), low (not high), an before st in the words host, ghost, post, most, and before ss in grow.
163.	The second sound of this letter is called its short sound, and is foum in noty got, lot, See.; though this, as in the other short vowels, is by no mean the short sound of the former long one, but corresponds exactly to that of a ii nvhat, with which the words noty got, loty are perfect rhymes. The long sounc to which the o in no/ and sot are short ones, is found under the diphthong au ii naught, and the ou in sought; corresponding exactly to the a in hall, bally Sec The short sound of this letter, like the short sound of a in father (78) (79), i frequently, by inaccurate speakers, and chiefly those among the vulgar, lengtl ened to a middle sound approaching to its long sound, the o in or. This soum is generally heard, as in the case of a, when it is succeeded by two consonants thus Mr. Smith pronounces broth,frothy and moth, as if writen brawtiufraxvtl and niawth, Of the propriety or impropriety of this, a well-educated ear is th best judge; but as was observed under the article A (79), if this be not th sound heard among the best speakers, no middle sound ought to be adinittec as good orators will ever incline to definite and absolute sounds) rather tha such as may be called non-de scripts in language.
164.	The third sound of this letter, as was marked in the first observatior may be called its long slender sound, corresponding to the double o. Th words where this sound of o occurs are so few, that it will be easy to give a c<j talogue of them: Prcn>e, move, belvr^r, and their compounds, lose, do, ad' Home, poltrony ponton^ cponton, whoy whorriy unntby tomb, ilpmton is not in John son ; and this and the two preceding words ought rather to be written with o in the last syllable. Gold is pronounced like goolJ in familiar conversation but in verse and solemn language, especially that of the Scripture, ought aJ ways to rhyme with old, fjd, &c. Sec Encore, Gold, and Wind.
165.	The fourth sound of this vowel is that which is found in lovr, dove, kc. and the long sound, which seems the nearest relation to it, is the first sound o o, in notcy toney ^ov^y Sec. This sound of o is generally heard when it is shortens by the succeeding liquids ?/, m, r, and the semi-vowels v, r, th: and as Mr. Nare has given a catalogue of those w ords, I shall avail myself of his labour.
