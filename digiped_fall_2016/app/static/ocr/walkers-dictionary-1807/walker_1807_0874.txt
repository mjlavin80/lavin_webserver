but that he and hi# literary acquaintance pronounced in the other manner. Dr. Johnson likewise thought I was right, but that the greater number of speakers were against me; and Dr. Lowth told me, be was clearly of my opinion, buttbat he could get nobody to follow bim. I was much flattered to find my sentiments confirmed by so great a judge, and much more flattered when I found my reasons were entirely new to him.
But, notwithstanding tbe tide of opinion was some years ago so much agaiust me, I have since liad the pleasure of finding some of tbe most judicious philologists on my side.
. Mr. Elphinston, Dr. Kenrick, and Mr, Perry, mark the word as I have dojie; and Mr. Nares is of opinion it ought to be so pronounced, though for a reason very different from those I have produced, namely, in order to keep it as distinct as may be from the word society. While Mr. Fry frankly owns, it is very difficult to determine tbe proper pronunciation of this word.
Thus I have ventured to decide where “ Doctors disagiee,” aijd have been induced to spend so much time on the correction of this word, as the improper pronunciation of it does not, as in most other cases, proceed from an evident caprice of custom, as in busy and bury, or from a desire of drawing nearer to the original language, but from an absolute mistake of the principles on which we pronounce our own.
Satin, s&t'tln. s. A soft, close, and shining silk. Satire, s&'ttir, s&t'&r, si'tlre, or s&t'-ire. s. A poem in which wickedness or folly are censured.
The first mode of pronouncing this word is adopted by Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Scott, Dr. Ash, and Mr. Smith. The short quantity of the first vowel is adopted by Mr. Nares, Mr. Elphinston, Buchanan, and Entick;
‘ but the quantity of the second syllable they have not marked.—The third is adopted by Mr. Perry and Dr. Kenrick i aud for the fourth we have no authorities.
But though the first mode of pronouncing this word is the most general, and the most agreeable to an English ear, the second seems to be that which is most favoured by the learned, bccause, say they, the first syllable in tbe Latiu Satyr a is sbojrt. But if this reasQning were to hold good, we ought to pronounce the first syllable of si-Icnce, local, label, libel, locust, paper, and many others short, because silcnlium, loca-lis, labeilum, libellvs, lorusta, papyrus, &c. have all the first syllable short in Latin. Bnt to furnish tbe ^earned with an argu-
ment which perhaps may not immediately occur to them, it may be said, that in tbe instances 1 have adduced, none of tbe Latin words have the initial syllable* accented ms well as short, which is the case with the word satyra: but it may be answered, if we were to follow tbe quantity of tbe Latin accented vowel, we must pronounce foetid, mimic, frigid, squalid, comic, resin, credit, spirit, aud lily, with tbe first vowel long, because it is the case in the Latin words foelidus, mmicustfrigidus, squalidut, coaucus, resina, credit is, spirit us, and I ilium.
The only shadow of On argumeut therefore that remains is, that though we do not adopt the Latin quautity of the accented antepenultimate vowel when it is long, we do when it is short. For though we bav* many instances where an English word of two syllables has the first short, though derived from a Latin word where tbe two first syllables are long; as civil, legate, jotew*, &c. from chilis, iegat'is, solempitt &c. yet we have no instance in the language where a word of three syllables in Latiu with tbe two first vowels short, becomes an Eugfish dissyllable with the first syllable long, except the vowel be w.—See Principles, No. 507, 508, 509. Hence the shortness of tbe first syllables of pfatane, zephyr, atom, 5tc. from plalanus, xephyrns, alomus, &c. which are short, not only from the custom of car -rying the short sound we give to the Latia antepenultimate vowel, into tbe penultimate of the English word derived from it; but from the affectation of shortening the initial vowel, which this custom has introduced, in order to give our pronunciation a Latin air, aud furnish us with an opportunity of showing our learning by appealing to Latin quautity; which, when applied to English, is so vague aud uucer* taiu, as to put us out of all fear of detection if we happen to be wrong. The absurd custom, therefore, of shortening our vowels, ought to be discountenanced as
( much as possible, sinc^ it is support* d by such weak aud desultory arguments; and ourowu analogy in this as well as in similar words, ought to be preferred to such a shadow of analogy to the quantity of the Latiu language, as 1 have charitably afforded to those who are ignuraut of it.—^k^e Principles, No. 544.
Though poets often bend the rhyme to their verse, when they canuot bring their verse to tbe rhyme; yet, where custom is equivocal, they certainly are of some weight In this view we may look upon Pope’s couplet iu his Essay on Criticism:
