Dr. Johnson, Dr. Ash, Dr. Kenrick, Mr. Barclay, Mr. Nares, Mr. Scott, Mr. Fry, apd Entick, accent this word on the second syllable; Mr. Sheridan aud Bailey on the last; and Fenning only on the first. But notwithstanding so many authorities are againbt me, I am much deceived if the analogy of pronunciation be not decidedly iu favour of that accentuation which 1 have given. We have but few instances in the language where we receive a word from the Latin, by dropping a syllable, that we do not remove the accent higher than the Original. (503). Thus recondite, derived from reconditut, may with as much propriety remove the accent from the long penultimate, as carbuncle from cnrbuneulut; calumny from calumn'ta, detriment from dc-trimenlum, innocenfy from innocentta, controversy from controver*ia* and a thousand others. Besides, it may be observed, that Mr. Sheridan and Bailey, by accenting tbis word on the last syllable, do not decide against the accent on the first; for all words of three, syllables which may be accented on the last, may also have an accent ou the fir*t, though not inversely. (524). -The antepeuultiinale accent, to which our language has such a tendency, ought, in my opinion, to be indulged in tbis word, notwithstanding the numerous authorities against it. The word Incon-elite mu*t certainly follow the fortunes of the present word ; and we find those or-thoepists who have the word, accent it as they do recondite, Mr. Sheridau on the last syllable, but Mr. Fenning inconsistently on the second.

(£/■ The noun record was anciently, as well as at present, pronounced with the accent either on the first or second syllable : till lately, however, it generally conformed to the analogy of other words of this kind \ and we seldom heard the accent on the second syllable, till a great luminary of the law, as remarkable for the justness of his elocution as his legal abilities, revived the claim this word anciently had to the ultimate accent; and since his time this pronunciation, especially in our courts of justice, seems to have been the most general. We ought, however, to recollect, that tliis is overturning one of the most settled analogies of pur language in the pronunciation of dissyllable nouns and verbs of the same form. See Principles, No. 492.
