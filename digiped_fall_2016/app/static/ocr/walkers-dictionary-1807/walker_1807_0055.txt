DIFFERENT SOUNDS OF THE LETTER Z
Iq this point, will be, to show the general rule, and mark the exceptions; though these are sometimes so numerous as to make us doubt of the rule itself; therefore the'best way will be to give a catalogue of both.
140.	There is one rule , of very great extent, in words of this termination, which have the accent on the penultimate syllable, and that is, that the i in the final syllable of these words is short ? thus servile, hostile,, virile, respite, dcjusite, adamantine, amethystine, Sec. are pronounced as if written servil, It Mil, re spit, defiosit, &c. The only exceptions in this numerous class of words seem.to be the following: Exile, senile, r dile, em/tire, umpire, vampire, finite, Jcline, ftriue, a? -chives; the substantives confine and supine: while the adjectives saline and contrite have sometimes the ixcent on the first, and sometimes on the last syllable ; but in cither case the i is long. Quagmire and pismire have the i long also; Uk wis has the i long, but otherwise has it more frequently, though very improperly, short. Myrrhine, vulpine, and gtntile, though marked with the i long by Mr. Sheridan, ought, in my opinion, to conform to the general rule, and be pronounced with the
i	short. Vulfiine, with the i long, is adopted by Mr. Scott; and W. Johnston, Mr. Scott, and Buchanan, agree with Mr. Sheridan in the last syllable of gmtil- ; and this seems agreeable to general usage, though not to analogy See the word.
141.	But when the accent is on the last syllable but two in words of this termination, the length of the vowel is not so easily ascertained.
142.	Those ending in ice have the i short, except sacrifice and cockatrice.
143.	Those ending in ide have the i long, notwithstanding we sometimes hear suicide absurdly pronounced, as if written suicid.
144.	Those ending in ife have the i long, except housemanfe, pronounced huzzvriff', according to the general rule, notwithstanding the * in wife is always long. Midvrif? is sometimes shortened in the same manner by the vulgar; and tfrrmght for sevennight is gone irrevocably into the same analogy ; though fortnight for fourteenthnight is more frequently pronounced with the i long.
145.	Those ending in ile have the i short, except reconcile, chamomile, estipile. Juvenile^ mercantile, and puerile, have the i long in Sheridan’s Dictionary, and short in Kenrick’s. In my opinion the latter is the much more prevalent and polite pronunciation; but infantile, though pronounceable both ways, seems inclinable to lengthen the i in the last syllable. See Juvenile.
146.	In the termination ime, pantomime has the i long, rhyming with time; and maritime has the i short, as if written maritim.
147.	Words in ine, that have the accent higher than the penultimate* have the quantity of i so uncertain, that the only method to give an idea of it will be to exhibit a catalogue of words where it is pronounced differently.
