A most absurd custom has prevailed in pronouncing this adjective, as if it were formed from springe, a gin, rhyming \ritl fringe, when nothing can be plainer than its formation from spring, an elastick body, and that the addition of y ought no more ro alter the sound of g in this word, than il does in stringy, full of strings. It is certainly thus we ought to pronounce the substantive formed from this adjective, which we meet witji in Mr. Foster: " In genera),
“ that nervous springiness, (if I may soex-" press it) so very observable in Mr.
“ Pope’s metre, is often owing chiefly to a “ Trochee beginning his line. *— Esxry on Accent and &hqntiia, p. 59. But the'absurdity-is still increasedv when this vicious pronunciation is given to the adjective formed from spring, a fountain ; this, however, is so contrary both to custom and analogy, that nothing but an oversight in Mr. Sheridan could have prevented his making ^ the distinction.—See Principles, No. 409.°
