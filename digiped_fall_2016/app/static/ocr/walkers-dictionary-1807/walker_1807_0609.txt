I know not if I am excmsable for in-
serting this word, which has not as yfet found its way into any other Dictionary: but the frequency of seeing the French ■Pieces Justificative* seems to have familiarised it to our ears, and to invite us to the adoption of it. The distance of the accent from the end of the word can be no objection to an English speaker who has so many similar words, such as significa- * five, purificative, &c.: and as we have no single word that will exactly stand in its place, it seems* to have a better tight to admission than many other words which 9 are found no-where but in a Dictionary.-— See Principles, No. 512.

Dr. Kenrick, Mr. Scott, and Mr. Per-y, pronounce the i short in the last sylla-le of this word; and Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Buchanan, and W. Johnston, make it long. The former mode is, in my opinion, the more correct. If it should be urged that the i is long in the Latin Juvenilis, it may be answered, that the same letter is long in the Latin HostHis, Scroll is, and Subtilis, and yet the i in Hostile, Servile, and Subtile, is by Mr. Sheridan marked short.
