PRONUNCIATION OF THE CONSONANT TH. xcvii
TH.
465.	This Hsping sound, as it may be called, is almost peculiar to the English. (41) (50) (469). The Greek 0 was certainly not the sound we give it: like its principal letter, it has a sharp and a flat sound; but these' are so little subject to rule, that a catalogue will, perhaps, be the best guide.
466.	Th, at the beginning of words, is sharp, as in thank, think, Sec. except in tbe following words: Thu, that, than* the, thee, their, thnn, then, thenee, there, thete, they, thine, thither, thane, thou* though, thus, thy, and their compounds.
467.	Th, at the end of words, is sharp, as death, breath, fee. except in beneath^ booth, vi'h ; and the verbs to wreath, to loath, to tmelcath, to secth to smooth, to 900th. to mouth : all which ought to be written with the e final; not oniy to distinguish some of them fiom the nouns, but to show that th is soft: for though th, when final, is sometimes pronounced soft, as in to loath, to ni nth* he. yet the at tbe end of words is never pronounced hard. There is as obvious an analogy for this sound of the th in these verbs, as for the z sound of * m verbs ending in *(437); and why we should write some verbs with e, and others without it is inconceivable. The best way to show the absurdity of our orthography in this particular, will be to draw out the nouns and verbs as they stand in Johnson's Dictionary.

Surely nothing can be more evident than the analogy of the language in this cr.se. Is it not absurd to hesitate a moment at writing all the vert>s with the e final ? This is a departure from our great lexicographer, which he himself would approve, as nothing but inadvertency could have led him into this unmeaning irregularity ^-It may not be improper to observe here, that those substantives which in the singular end with th sharp adopt the th flat in the plural, *3 fiath< par us ; bath, barhs* See. Such a propensity is there to slide into the Sat sound of s, that we frequently hear this sound in the genitive case, as My vxvc'm portion, for my wife's portion. In the same manner we hear of paying much for houze~rent and taxes, instead of house-rmt and taxes ; and shopkeepers tell us they have goods of all /vrizes, instead of all prices. Nay, some go so far tt to pronounce the plural of truth, trurm ; but tlus must be cqrefully avoided.
468.	Th is hard in the middle of words, either when it precedes or follows
a consonant, as panther, nepenthe, orthodox, orthography, ortho py, thwart, athwart, ethnic, misanthrope, philanthropy, &c. except brethren, farthing, farther, northern, wthu, burthen, marther, where the th is flat 5 butnUe two last words are better *ritttnburden and murder.	.
