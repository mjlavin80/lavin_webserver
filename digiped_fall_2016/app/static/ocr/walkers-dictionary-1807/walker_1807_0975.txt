gj- I have met with this word no where but in Mason’s Supplement to Johnson, and there I find it accented in a different way from what I have always heard it in conversation. In those circles which I have frequented, the accent has been placed on the first syllable; and if we survey the words of this termination, we shall find that izc is added to every word without altering1 the place of the accent; and that consequently Systematize ought to have the accent on the first syllabic. This reasoning' is ^pccious v but when we consider
btdl611;—p64nd;—/Ain, this.
that this word is not formed from the English word System, but from the Greek Iwrm/ia, 0r the latter Latin Systema9 we shall find that the accent is very properly placed on the second syllable according to the general rule. If we place the accent on the first, we ought to spell the word Systemize, and then it would be analogically pronounced; but as our best writers and speakers have formed the word on the Greek and Latin plan, it ought to be written and pronounced as Mr. Mason has given it.

QCT Buchanan is the only orthoepist that has this word who pronounces the a long. This is indulging the genius of our own pronunciation in dissyllables of this form ; but as we pronounce the a short in tabidus, though long in Latin, we carry this wrong pronunciation into ourowri language.
