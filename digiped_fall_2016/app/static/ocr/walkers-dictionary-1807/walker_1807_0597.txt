Ct Mr. Sheridan, Dr. Kenrick, Mr. Nares, Buchanan, W. Johnston, Mr. Perry, and Mr. Barclay, place the accent on the second syllable of this word; and Dr. Johnson, Dr. Ash, Mr. Scott, Bailey, and En-tick, on the first I do not hesitate a moment to pronounce this the best accentuation : for as this word roust be derived from the noun insterstitium, and not from the verb inters to, the rule so often mentioned of changing the secondary accent of the Latin woro when shortened into the principal accent of the English word must take place here.—See Academy and Incomparable.	.
It is not easy to conjecture what could be the reason why this majority of orthoepists should be found on the side of the penultimate pronunciation of this word. It is certain that the greatest part do but copy from former Dictionaries; but when an uncouth and uncommon pronunciation is adopted, it is generally for some learned reason from the dekd languages, which the common inspector is utterly incapable of conceiving. In the present instance, however, there is not the shadow of a reason, from the original Latin, why we should place the accent on the second syllable pf interstice, which would not oblige us to lay the stress on the same syllable of interfere, intervene, intercourse, interval, tupcrflux, &c.

(& This word is sometimes pronounced with the accent on the third syllable * because the i in intestinum is long j but Dr Johnson more properly makes it a formative of our own, from intestine ; and even if we were to allow this adjective to be derived immediately from the Latin substantive of the same number of syllables, we may see in Principles, No. 503, A, how many exceptions there are to this rule, and how probable it is that this word is one.
