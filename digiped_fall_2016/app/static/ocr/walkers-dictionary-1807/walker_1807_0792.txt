(Jj* Mr. Elphinston is the only orthbcpist who gives the shirt sound to i in this word. Perhaps no one understands the analogies of our language better; but in this and several other words he overturns the very foundation of language, wliich is general custom. Iam well acquainted with the shortening power of the antepenulti* mate accent (535) ; and if custom were wavering, this ought to decide ; but in this word, and primary, custom is uniform, and precludes all appeal to analogy.
