QCj* The common pronunciation of London is the first sound given to this word ; but in Ireland and the different counties of England, it is generally pronounced regularly so as to rhvme with hut, rmt, See. W. Johnston has adopted this sound, and Mr. Perry gives it both ways, but seems to prefer the regular sound. Mr. Nares is decidedly in favour of this sound; and as this word, when a noun, is always so pronounced, it seems a needless aepaiture from rule, and embarrassing the language, to have the same word differently pto-' nounced. This is an inconvenience to which perhaps all languages are subject; but it ought in all languages to be avoided as much as possible.—See Bowl.
Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Elphinston, Mr. Scott, Dr. Kenrick, and Mr. Smith, adopt the first sound.	*
