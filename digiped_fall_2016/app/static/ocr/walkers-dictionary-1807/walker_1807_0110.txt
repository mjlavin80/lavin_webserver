ACCENT ON DISSYLLABLES.
498.	This analogy will appear still more evident if we attend to the accent ^ of those nouns and verbs which are compounded of tw6 words. Every dib^rl-
labie compounded of words which, taken separately, have a meaning, may be deemed a qualified substantive ; and that word which qualifies or describes the other, is that which most distinguishes it, and consequently is that which ought to have the accent: accordingly we find that inkhorn, outrage, chairman, Jrcth Idy sand-box, book<a*e, pen»knifi, have the accent on the first syllable, which is the specifying part of the word ; while gainsay, forrsee, overtook, undersell have the accent on the last syllable, which is the least distinguishing part of the word. Tliis rule, however, is, either by the caprice of custom, or the love of harmony, frequently violated, but is sufficiently extensive to mark the general tendency of the language. Akenside brings the verb to comment under this analogy:
««-----------------The sober ze*l
4< Of age, commenting on prodigious things.”
Pleasures of the Imagination
And Milton in the same manner the verb to commerce :
* ■ ;
** And looks commercing with the skier,
Thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes.”--------11 Penscroso*
499.	Something very analogous to this we find in the nouns we verbalize, by
changing the s sharp of the noun into the * flat, or z of the verb (437), as a use, and to use ; where we may remark, that when the word in both parts of speech is a monosyllable, and so not under the laws of accent-, the verb, however, claims the privilege of lengthening the sound of the consonant, when it can, as well as when it cannot, prolong the accentuation : thus we not only find grass altered to graze, brass to braze, glass to glaze, price to prize* breath to breathe, &c. but the c or % sharp altered to the s flat in advice to advise, excuse to excuse, device to devise, See. The noun adopting the sharp hissing sound, and the verb the soft buzzing one. without transferring the accent from one syllable to another. The vulgar extend this analogy to the noun practice, and the verb to practise, pronouncing the first with the i short and the c like sharp «, as if written practise, and the last with the i long and the s like z, is if written prac* tize: but correct speakers pronounce the verb like the noun; that is, as if written practise. The noun prophecy and the verb to prophesy follow this analogy, only by writing the noun with the c and the verb with the *, and without any difference of sound, except pronouncing the y in the first like e, and in the last like i long ; where we may still discover a trace of the tendency to the barytone pronunciation in the noun, and the oxytone in the verb. (467).	.
500.	This seems to be the favourite tendency of English verbs ; and where we find it crossed, it is generally in those formed from nouns, rather than the contrary: agreeably to this, Dr. Johnson has observed* that though nouns have often the accent on the latter, yet verbs have it seldom on the former syllable; those nouns which, in the common order of language, must have preceded the verbs, often transmit this accent to the verbs they form, and inversely: thus th© noun water must have preceded the verb to water, as the verb to correspond must have preceded the noun correspondent; and to tiurme must claim priority to pursuit. So that we may conclude, whenever verbs deviate from this rule, it is seldom by chance, and generally in those words only where a superior law of accent takes place.
