The confusion observable among our authors in this word suffieieutly shows how inconvenient it is to make the same letters sound differently wben a different seiAe is conveyed. Dr. Johnson seems aware of this when he recommends a different orthography for this word, as it acquires a different meaning; but he does not tell us whether rase is to be pronouuced like race or raze; nor do any of our orthoepists make this distinction of sound according to the sense. With great deference to Dr. Johnson, perhaps such a distinction, both iu sound and spelling, is unnecessary and embarrassing. The best way, therefore, in my opinion, will be always to spell this word with the
2	as in razor, and to pronounce it with the z when it is written rase.—See Bowl.

Dr. Johnson tells us, that tbis word it the comparative of rath, a Saxon word, signifying soon, and that it still retains its original signification; as we may say, “ I ** would sooner do a thing,** with as much propriety as ** I would rather do it.” Some very respectable speakers pronounce this word with the first syllable like that io lla-ven; and Mr. Nares has adopted this pronunciation. Dr. Ash and Bailey sem to be of the same opinion; bat all the other orthoepists, from whom we can certainly know the quantity of the vowel, as Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Elphiuston, Mr. Scott, Df. Kenrick, \V. Johnston, Mr. Perry, Buchanan, and Kntick, make it short. There is a pronunciation of this, aud some fe* other words, which may not improperly be called diminutive. Thus in familiar conversation, when we wish to express very little, we sometimes lengthen the vowel, and pronounce the word as if written lep-tlt\ In the same manner, when rather*ie-niftes just preferable, we lengthen the first vowel, and pronounce it long aud slender, as if written raytlu r; and this, perhaps, may be the reason why the long slender sound of the vowel has so much obtained, for usage seems to be clearly on the side c* the other pronunciation, and analogy requires it, as this word is but tbe oid co®-parative/of the word rath, soon.
