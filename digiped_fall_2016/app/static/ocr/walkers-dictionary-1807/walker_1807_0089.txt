PRONUNCIATION OF THE CONSONANT G. lxxxiii
' » pronounces the vowel shorthand spells them impung and oppimg. Barclay, under the word impugn, says the g in this word and its derivatives is mute, without noticing the quantity of the vowels, but spells oppugn, ofifiun ; and of impregn, only says the g is mute ; but writes pH)pugn, propung, in the manner that W. Johnston does imftugn and oppugn-• but Mr. Nares observes, that analogy seems to require a similar pronunciation in all these words, and that the vowel should be long. The same inconsistency is observable in Mr. Sheridan’s pronunciation of the verbal nouns ; for he expunges the g in impugner, and writes it im-fiwer, but preserves it in oppugrter and propugner. Mr. Scott has only the word propugner, which he very properly, as well as consistently, spells propuner. Mr. Perry has proptmner and impiumer, and Barclay impurmer onlyThe inconsistency here remarked arises from not attending to the analogy of pronunciation, which requires every verbal noun to be pronounced exactly like the verb, with the mere addition of the termination: thus singer is only adding er to the verb sing, without suffering the g to articulate the e as it Aoesmjinger and linger, &c. The same may be observed of a signer, one who signs: and as a corroboration of this doctrine, we may take notice that the additional er and est, in the comparatives and superlatives of adjectives, make no alteration in the sound of the radical word: this is obvious in the words bemgner, benignest, See. except younger, fonjrr, and stronger. See No. 381.	,
387.	But in every other compound where these letters occur, the « articulates the latter syllable, and g is heard distinctly in the former, as sig-mjy, malignity, assrg-nation, &c. Some affected speakers, either ignorant of the rules for pronouncing English, or over-complaisant to the French, pronounce physiognomy, cognizance, and recognizance, without the g; but this is a gross violation of the first principles of spelling. The only words to keep these speakers in countenance are poignant and champignon, not long ago imported from France, and pronounced pomumt, champimon. The first of these words will be probably hereafter written without the g; while the latter, confined to the kitchen, may be looked upon as technical, and allowed an exclusive privilege. See Cognizavce.
388.	Bagnio j seignior, seraglio, intaglio, and og&o, pronounced ban-yo, seen-yur, sertd-yo, intal-yo, and ole-yo, may be considered as foreign coxcombs»and treated with civility, by omitting the g, while they do not pervert the pronunciation of our nadve English words.

3S9.	What has been said of gn is applicable to gm, We have but one word in the language where these letters end a word with the accent on it, and that ta phlegm ; in this the g is always mute and the e according to analogy, ought to be pronounced long, as if the word were written Jleme; but a short pronunciation of the e has generally obtained, and we commonly hear it Jlem ; it is highly prcbable Pope pronounced it properly, where he says,

Essay on Criticism,
Perhaps it would not be difficult to reduce this word to analogy, as some speakers still pronounce the e long: but in the compounds of this word, as hi those where gn occur, the vowel is shortened, and the# pronounced as in phleg-ww, phleg*monott8, phleg-matic, andphleg-magoguee; though Mr. Sheridan, for no
