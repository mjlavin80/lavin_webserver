DIFFERENT SOUNDS OF THE LETTER J.
xlvii
124.	Di before the accented syllabic, beginning with a consonant, has the i almost always short; as digest, digestion, digress, digression, dilute, dilution, dilu-viar., dimenxon, dimensive, dimidiation, diminish, diminutive, diploma, direct, direction, diversify, diversification, diversion, diversity, dive rt, divertisement, divertive, direst, divesture, divide, dhidable, dividant, dinnne, divinity, divisible, divisibility, divorce, divulge. To these, I think, may be added, dcacity, didactic, di lacerate, dilacerction, d lanlate, dilapidation, dilate, dilatable, dilatability, dilution, dih/cid, di~ luc? .'ate, die*, in dot ion, dineiical, dinumcration, dtveige, divergent, divan; though Mr. Sheridan has marked the first i in all these words long; some of then! may undoubtedly be pronounced either way ; but why he should make the i in drfiloma long, and W. Johnston should give it both ways, is unaccountable ; as Mr. Scott, Buchanan, Dr. Kemick, Mr. Perry, and the general usage, is against them. Diuresis and dioptrics have the i long, according to the general rule f 116), though the last is absurdly made short by Dr. Kenrick, and the diphthong is made long in the first by Air. Sheridan, contrary to one of the most prevailing idioms in pronunciation ; which is, the shortening power of the antepenultimate accent. (503). Let it not be said that the diphthong must be always long, since Caesarea and Dadafus have the a always short.
125.	The long i in words of this form, seems confined to the following: Digiadiatiun, dijudication, dinumeration, divaricate, direption, diruptim, lioth Johnson and Sheridan, in my opinion, place the accent of the word didascalic improperly upon the second syllable ; it should seem more agreeable to analogy to class it with the numerous terminations in ic, and place the accent on the penultimate syllable (509) ; and, in this case, the i in the first will be shortened by the secondary accent, and the syllable pronounced like did. (527). The first / in dimissory, marked long by Mr. Sheridan, and with the accent on the second syllable, contrary' to Dr. Johnson, are equally erroneous. The accent ought to be on the first syllable, and the i short, as on the adjective dim. See Possessory.
126.	Fi before the accent ought always to be short: this is the sound we g£s nerally give to the i in the first syllable of fidelity ; and why we should give the long sound to the i in fiducial and fiduciary, as marked by Mr. Sheridan, I know not: he is certainly erroneous in marking the first i \n frigidity long, and equally so in placing the accent upon the last syllable of finite. Finance has the / short universally.
127.	Gigantic has the i in the first syllable always long.
128.	IJ has the i generally long, as li-ba'ion, li-branan, li-bration, li-ccntioiis, Kjiolhymu, liquescent, lithography, li-thotomy. Litigious has the i in the first syllable always short. The same may be observed of iibidinous, though otherwise marked by Mr. Sheridan.
129.	Mi has the i generally short, as in minority, militia, monographer, rrxinaci~ minority, mivaruhnis ; though the four last are marked with the long i by
Mr. Sheridan; and what is still more strange, he marks the i which has the accent on it long in minatory; though the same word, in the compound commi-natirry, where the i is always short, might have shown him his error. The word mimetic* which, though in very good use, is neither in Johnson nor Sheri-ought to be pronounced with the first i short, as if written mim-et-ic. The
*	is generally long in micrometcr, micography, and migrafi>m.
\o0. ,\7 has the i long in nigrescent. The first i in nigrification, though marked long by Mr. Sheridan, is shortened by the secondary accent (527), and aught to be pronounced as if divided into nig-nTfi-cation.
131.	Phi has the i generally short, as in philanthropy, jJiilippic, philosopher*
