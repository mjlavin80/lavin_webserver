PRONUNCIATION OF THE CONSONANT &	«i
€? z, heard in is, Ms, was: and these two sounds, accompanied by the aspirate, or A, form all the varieties found under this letter. (41).
421.	«S has always its shaxp hissing sound, at the beginning of words, as 0007?, sm, &c. and when it immediately follows any of the sharp mutes, f k, p, t, as
Nocks, hips, fats, or when it is added to the mute c after any of these letters, as strifes, fiakes, pipes, mites.
422.	5 is sharp and hissing at the end of the monosyllables yes, this9 us, thus, pu: and at the end of words of two or more syllables, if it be preceded by any a the vowels but e, and forms a distinct syllable: thus es in pipes and mites do not form a distinct syllable; and as they arc preceded by. a sharp mute, the s is sharp likewise: but in jmces these letters form a syllable, and the s is pronounced like z, according to the general rule.
423.	The only exception to this rule is, the words as, whereas, has, his, was ; Sor bias, dowlas, jitlas, metropolis, basis, chaos, trijiusf pus, chorus, Cyprus, &c. have the final« pronounced sharp and hissing.
424.	Agreeably to this rule, the numerous terminations in ous, as pious, superfluous, kc. have the t sharp, and are pronounced exactly like the pronoun us: and every double «in the language is pronounced in the same manner, except in the words dissolve, possess, and their compounds, scissors, hussy, and hussar.
425.	S in the inseparable preposition dis, when either the primary or secondary accent is on it (522), is always pronounced sharp and hissing: the word dismal, which seems to be an exception, is not so in reality; for, in this word, dis is not a preposition: thus dissolute, dissonant, &c. with the primary accent on dis i and disability, disagree, 8cc. with the secondary accent on the same letters, have the s sharp and hissing; but when the accent is on the second, syllable, the * is either sharp or flat, as it is followed either by a vowel, or a sharp or flat consonant; thus disable, disaster, disease, disinterested, dishonest, disorder, disuse, have all of them the * in dis fiat like z, because the accent is not on it, and a vowel begins the next syllable; but discredit, disfavour, diskindness, dispense, dis-
have the t sharp and hissing, because a sharp consonant begins the succeeding accented syllable; and disband, disdain, disgrace, disjoin, disvalue, have the
*	flat like z, because they are succcedcd by a flat consonant in the same situation. (435).
426.	S, in the inseparable preposition mrs, is always sharp and hissing, wbe-tlier the accent be on it or not; or whether it be followed either by a vowel, or a sharp or flat consonant, as miscreant, misaim, misapply, misorder, misuse, mis-byo1, misdeem, misgovern, 8cc. See the prefix Miss.
