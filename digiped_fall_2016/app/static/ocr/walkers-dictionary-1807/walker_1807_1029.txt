This word is perfectly anglicised, and therefore ought to have its last syllable pro-
•	nounced according to English analogy, like Centre, Sceptre, Mitre,kc,—See Principles, No. 416. There is a common mistake in the use ofthe Latin word from which this is derived, which it may not be improper to rectify. Vertebra is not unfrequently used to signify the whofe collection of joints which form the back bone, while in reality it means only owe of those joints; the plural is Vertebra, and this ought to be used for the whole spine, if \re denomi nate it by a Latin word; but if we speak English, it ought to be Vertebra, and pronounced as if written Verteburs.

(Cj* This word is exactly under the same predicament us Serpigo and Lentigo* If we pronounce it learnedly, We must place the accent in the first manner. (503). If we pronounce it modishly, and wish to smack ofthe French or Italian, we must adopt the second; but if we follow the genuine Eng-lisli analogy, we must pronouncc it in the last manner.—See Principles, No. 112.
The authorities for tbe first pronunciation are, Mr. Elphinston, Mr. Sheridan, Bailey, and
b&ll611poftnd;—t/im, this.
Entick; for the second, Dr. Kenricflc, Mr. Nares, Mr. Scott, and W. Johnston ; and for the third, Dr. Johnson, Dr. Ash, flfr. Perry, Buchanan, Barclay, and Fenning. This too was S will’s pronunciation, as we see by Dr. Johnson’s quotation;
•* And that old vertigo in’s head,
“ Will never leave him till he’s dead.” -In this word we see tbe tendency of the accent to its true centre in its own lan guage. Vertigo with the accent on the i, and that pronounced long as in title, has soLatin a sound that we scarcely think we are spe&king English : this makes us the more readily give into the foreignsound of «, as in fatigue. This sound a correct English ear is soon weary of, and settles at last with the accent on the first syllable, with the J sounded as in indigo, portico, &c.
