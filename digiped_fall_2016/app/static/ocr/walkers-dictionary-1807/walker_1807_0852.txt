(£j* This word seems as nearly balanced between the accent on tbe first and second syllable as possible; but as it is of the same form and origin as avenue aud retinue, it ought to follow the same fortune. Retinue seems to have been long incoming to accent the first syllable, and avenue has decidedly done so, since Dr. VVaits observed that it was sometimes accented on the second: and by this retrocession of accent, as it may be called, we may easdy foresee that these three words will uniformly yield to the antepcnultimote accent, tbe favourite acrent of our language, conformably to the general rule, which accents simples ot thn^e syllables upon the first. Dr. Johnson, Mr.. Nares, and Bailey, arc for the accent on the second syllable; but Dr. Ash, Dr. Kenrick, Buchanan, W. Johnston, Perry, Barclay, Penning, and Entick, accent the first. Mr. Sheridan gives both, but places tbe antepenultimate acceut first. (503). See Conversant and Rstikue,
