QCj* This word is frequently pronounced as if written Sattan / but making the first syllable long is so agreeable to analogy that it ought to be indulged wherever custom will permit, and particularly in proper names. Cato, Plato, &c. have now universally the penultimate a long and slender ; and no good reason can be {pven why the word in question should not join this class: if the shortjquantity ofthe a in the origi-nul be alleged, for an answer to this see Principles, No. 544, and the word Satire. Mr. Nares and Buchanan only adopt the second sound; and Mr.Elphin-ston, Mr. 'Sheridan, Dr. Kenrick, Mr. Scott, W. Johnston, Mr. Perry, Entick, and, if we may judge by the position of the accent, Dr. A9h and Bailey, the first.— See The Key to the Classical Pronunciation of Greek, Latin, and Scripture Proper Names, under the word.
