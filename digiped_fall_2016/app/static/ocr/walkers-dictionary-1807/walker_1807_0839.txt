In the first edition of this Dictionary I apprehended that this word was a tiew coinage of the House of Commons; but upon consulting Mr. Elphinston, a complete judge in this case, 1 find it has long been a jurisprudential word, as he calls it, in Scotland, meaning inferential, or co»-clusive t and that it lias only been transferred from the Scotch Bar to the British Parliament. But that this is not the sense -of the French relevant, or the Latin rclevo, is certain ; and that relevant in this sense seems nearly the same as relative or related. To say nothing of the impropriety of introducing technical words in a general assembly of the nation, it may be observed, that using the word in this sense, which is that which it generally has in our parliamentary debates, tends to overturn the most settled meaning of words, and, instead of precision and accuracy, to create obscurity and confusion.
