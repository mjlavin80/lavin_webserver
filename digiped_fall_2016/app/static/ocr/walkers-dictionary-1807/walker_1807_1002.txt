OCj* My experience fails me if this word is not slowly conforming to the true English sound of the vowels heard in- thou. Tbe
smart traveller to France and Italy, m* fear we should never suppose he had been out of England, were he not to pronounce it so as to rhyme with poor ; and the sober English critick sees infinite advantage in this pronunciation, as it prevents oar . mistaking taking a tour for taking atoxaer. But plausible as this latter reason maybe, it is far from being sufficient to induce a philosophical grammarian to approve it.— Coincidence in the sound of words signify ing different things,* is the case in all languages ; but while these words are differently written, their different meanings will be sufficiently preserved without departing from the general analogy of pronunciation.—See the word Bowl.

I am much mistaken if genera] usage does not incline to the short sojmd of die dipht’ong in these words $ and that this sound ought to be indulged, is palpable to every English ear; which finds a repug* nance at giving the French sound to any word that is not newly adopted. Journey nourish, courage, and many other woroa from the French, have long been angficis-ed; and there is no good reason why this word should not fall into the sam^ class. Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Scott, Dr. Kenrick, and Mr. Perry, give the first sound of tins word; and Buchanan and W. Johnston* the second. Junius and Skinner spell tbr word Tvrnmrtent.
