Qjr* Why Mr. Sheridan shotdd pronounce Dialogue with the last syllable like log, Prologue with the same syllable like lug, and Monologue rhyming with vogue, I cannot conceive. The final syllable of all words of this termination, when unac« cented, are, in my opinion, uniformly like that in Dialogue.

Logomachy and Sciomachy; the first of which he accents on the first syllable, and the last on the second. Mr. Scott has none of them.
