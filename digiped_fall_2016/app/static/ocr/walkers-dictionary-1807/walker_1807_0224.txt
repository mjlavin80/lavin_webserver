This^word, from the propensity of our language to the antepenultimate accent,is often pronounced with the stress on the first syllable, as if' written bit'u-me* ; and this last mode of sounding the word may be considered as the most common, though not the most learned pronunciation. For Dr. Ash is the only orthoepist who places the accent on the first syllabic ; but every one who gives the sound of the unaccented vowels, except Buchanan, very improperly makes the * long, as in idle ; but if this sound bo long, itoughtto be slender, as in the second syllable of visible, terrible, &c.
