it/ Mr. Sheridan* Mr. Scott, W. Johnston, Mr. Smith* *nd Mr. Frj^ pronounce this word so as to rhyme wifch nay, pay, &c. But Steel or Brigtrtiand, Dr, Jones who wrote TAe Art of Spelling in Queen Anne’s time, TDr. Kenrick, and Mr. Perry, pronounce it like the pronoun ye. Though so many are Against fne, I do not hesitate to pronounce the hitter mode the best; first, as it hs more dgreCable to the general sound of the diphthong’; netft, as it is more related to4tsfami1iarsubstitute7e* „• and last* ly, unless my memory greatly fails me, because itis always sopronounced when contrasted with nay ; as in that precept of the Gospel,Let your commumcatiOh bey*at yea, and nayy ndy*	«

^ is commonly pronounced, says Johnson, and often written Yolk. To which we may add, tlmt when the word is so written, the I is silent, and the word ]>ro-nounced Yoke.

Skinner aays it may be derived from the Anglo-Saxon Gem*nc, or the Teutonic Gemeht, a common man, or one ofthe commonalty ; or from E&meman, a shepherd 5 from Goodman, an appellation given to inferiour people ; #ron Gematut, a companion ; from Geongmau, a young man; from %*9»on, an ordinary man, or any body, like the Spanish Midalgo ,* but he prefers its derivation from the Anglo-Saxon £u-tno, a painiiil or laborious man.
