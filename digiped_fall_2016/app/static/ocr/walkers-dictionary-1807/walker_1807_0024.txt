if this is the case, a teacher, if he understands these slides, ought to direct his instruction so as to remedy the imperfection. But as avoiding the wrong, and seizing the right at the same instant, is, perhaps, too great a task for human powers, I would advise a native of Ireland, who ha» much of the accent, to pronounce almost all his words, and end all his sentences, with the rising slide ; and a Scotchman in the same manner, to use the falling inflection: this will, in some measure, counteract the natural propensity, and bids fairer for bringing the pupil to that nearly equal mixture of both slides which distinguishes the English speaker, than endeavouring at first to catch the agreeable variety. For this purpose the teacher ought to pronounce all the single words in the lesson with the falling inflection to a Scotchman, and with the rising to an Irishman ; and should frequently give the pauses in a sentence the same inflections to each of these pupils, where he would vary them to a native of England. But while the human voice remains unstudied, there is little expectation that this distinction of the slides should be applied to these useful purposes.
Besides a peculiarity of inflection, which I take to be a falling circumflex, directly opposite to that of the Scotch, the Welsh pronounce the sharp consonants and aspirations instead of the flat. (See Principles, No. 29, 41.) Thus for big they say pick; for bloody ploot; and for good, coot. Instead of virtue and vice, they sayjirtue and ficc ; instead of zeal and praise, they say seal and prace; instead of these and those* they say thece and thoce ; and instead of azure and ohier, they say aysher and osher; and for jail* chail. Thus there are nine distinct consonant sounds which, to the Welsh, are entirely useless. To speak with propriety, therefore, the Welsh ought for some time to pronounce the flat consonants and aspirations only; that is, they ought not only to pronounce them where the letters require the flat sound, but even where they require the sharp sound : this will be the best way to acquire a habit; and when this is once done, a distinction will be easily made, and a just pronunciation more readily acquired.
There is scarcely any part of England remote from the capital where a different system pf pronunciation does not prevail. As in Wales they pronounce the sharp consonants for the flat, so in Somersetshire they pronounce many of the flat instead of the sharp : thus for Somersetshire, they say Zomersetshire; for father, vathcr; for Mink, mink, and for sure, zhure *.
There are dialects peculiar to Cornwall, Lancashire, Yorkshire, and every distant county in England ; but as a consideration of these would lead to a detail too minute for the present occasion, I shall conclude these remarks with a few observations on the peculiarities of my country men, the Cockneys ; who, as they are the models of pronunciation to the distant provinces, ought to be the more scrupulously correct.
First Fault of the Londoners.-—Pronouncing s indistinctly after st.
The letter * after st, from the very difficulty of its pronunciation, is often bounded inarticulately. The inhabitants of London, of the lower order, cut the knot, and pronounce it in a distinct syllable, as if e were before it; but this is to be avoided as the greatest blemish in speaking; the three last letters in posts, fists* m(sts, &c. must all be dinstinctly heard in one syllable, and without permitting the letters to coalesce. For the acquiring of this sound, it will be proper to select nouns that end in st or *te ; to form them into plurals, and pronounce them forcibly and distinctly every day. The same may be observed of fhe third person of verba ending in st* or stes* as persists, wastes, hastes, &c.
