cxxviii QUANTITY OF THE UNACCENTED VOWELS.
arc to this rule (see No. 503, b.) Or, perhaps, the English word, though anglicised, retains the same number of syllables. This, indeed, may be said to be a general rule for preserving the Latin accent, but so general as to be neglected in a thousand instances. (See No 508, f, gy A, i, k.) But if the scholar, as is * often the case, huddles quantity and accent together, and infers the English quantity from the Latin; the Englisfc scholar needs only to refer him to the selections here given, (No. 544) (545,) to show the inanity of such a plea. Upon the whole, therefore, I flatter myself that men of learning will be gratife fcd to see the subject in a clearer point of view than any in which it has ever been exhibited; and the plain Engish scholar will be indebted to me for giving him as clear and distinct an idea Of the connexion between the Greek and Latin accent and quantity vand the accent and quantity of his native tongue, as if he bad Homer and Horace by heart; and for placing him out of the reach of those pert minor critics, who are constantly insulting him with their knowledge of the dead languages.
Of the Quantity of the Unaccented Vowels not in the same Syllable with Consonants.
«547, Accented syllables, as we have before observed, (179), are so strongly marked as to be easily comprehended when tliey are once Settled bv custom or analogy; but those immediately before or after the accent are in a state of uncertainty, which some of our best judges find themselves unable to remove. Some grammarians have called all the open vowels before or after the accent short, though the ear so evidently dictates the contrary in the u in utility, the o in obedience, &c. Some have saved themselves the trouble of farther search by comprehending these vowels under the epithet obscure; nay, so unfixed do the sounds of these vowels seem, that Dr. Kenrick, whose Rhetorical Dictionary Shows he was possessed of very great philological abilities, seems as much at a loss about them as the meanest grammarian in the kingdom ; for when he comes to mark the sound of the vowel o in the first syllable of a series of words with the accent on tbe second, he makes the o in promulge, propel, and prolix, long, as fhey ought to be; ?nd the same letter in proboscis, proceed, and procedure, short. Dominion, do-meftic, donation. and domain, are marked a-- if pronounced dom-inion, dom-estic, don-at on, and dom-ain, with tne o short; while the first of docility, potential, and monotony, have the o marked long, as in donor, potent, and modish; though it is certaiu to a demonstration, that the ety-itiology, accent, and letters, being the same, the same sound must be produced, unless where custom has precisely marked a difference ; and that the first syllables of promutge, prop?/, and prolir, and those of proboscis, proceed, and procedure, have no such difference, seems too evident to need proof*.
i H VS. I know it may be demanded with great plausibility, how do I know that there is not this very inconsistency in custom itself? What right have 1 to suppose that custom is not as vague and capricious in these syllables as in those under the accent? To which I answer: if custom hasdetermined the sound of these vowels, the dispute is at an end. 1 implicitly acquiesce in the decision; hut if professors of the art disagree in their opinions, it is a shrewd sijrn that custom is uet altogether so« lear in its sentence; and I must insist oil recurring to principles till custom has unequivocally decided.
549. Every vowel, that is neither shortened by the accent, nor succeeded by a double consonant, naturally terminates a syllable i and this terminating vowel, though not so properly long as if the accent were on it, would oe very improperly termed short, if by ^sliort* as is often the case, be meant shut. (6M. According to this idea of syllabication it is presumed that the word opinion would fall into three distinct parts, and every part be terminated by a consonant but the first, thus o-pin-ion,
*	T am aware that this ingenious writerseems to.avoid this incon istencv, bv premisiug, ia bis Rhetorical fJrammar, pase 4^, that he ha« sometimes marked the o in words beginning with a preposition with theoratorial,and sometimes with the colloquial pronunciation: thus, in commune, communicate, ficc. the oratorial sound is given as in the first syllable of common, wfyile the colloquial sound changes the ointo»/, as if the words wetv written cumnmne9 mm-muntiale, &c.: but the distinction in these examples does not touch the point: here there is a chansre only of one short sound for another, and not any promiscuous use of a long* and short, or open and shut sound ofthe same letter. Dr. Kenrick himself, when he marks the
o	in hrohoscis* proceed, and procedure, does not adopt the short w, as he does in commune* co*»-municate, A^c.; nor is he aware of the essential ditVerenc** with respect to the quantity ofthe vowel, in th$ double consonant in one set of words, and the single one in the other.
