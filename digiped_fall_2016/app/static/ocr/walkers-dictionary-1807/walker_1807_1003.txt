(£j* Notwithstanding our poets almost universally accent this word on the first syllable, and the poets are pretty generally followed by good speakers, there are some, and those not of the lowest order, who still place the accent on the second. These should be reminded, that as inwards, out-wards, backwards, forwards, and every other word of the same form, have the accent on the first syllable, there is not the least reason for pronouncing towards with the acccnt on the last. All our orthoepists place the accent upon the first syllable of toward when an adjective, Towards, being always a preposition, has the accent on the first syllabic by Mr. Scott; but Mr. Perry, Barclay, and Fenning, place it on the sccond. From the coalescence of the
o	with the w, this word is pronounced generally in one syllabic, though Dr. Kcnrick says otherwise. Mr. Sheridan so pronounces it; Mr. Nares and Mr. Smith rhyme it with boards: Bailey accents the first syllable of toward, bnd Entick the same syllable on the same word, and on towards as a preposition.
