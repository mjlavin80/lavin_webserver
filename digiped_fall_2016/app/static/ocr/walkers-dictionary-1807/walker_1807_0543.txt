C? This word and its companion favour, the two servile attendants on cards and notes of fash ion, have so generally dropped the «, that to spell these words with that letter is looked upon as gauche and rustic in the extreme.

o	sounds m, even when the accent is on it, as honey, money, See. we need not be in much pain for the sound of u in words of this termination, where the final r brings all the unaccented vowels to the same level; that is, to the short sound of ui—Sec Principles, No. 4-18.
