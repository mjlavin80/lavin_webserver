(C? Dr. Kenrick says, this word is sometimes, but improperly accented on the first syllable; but it may be observed, that this impropriety is become so universal, that not one who has the least pretension to politeness dares to pronounce it otherwise. It is, indeed, to be regretted, that we are so fond of Latin originals as entirely to neglect our own; for this word can now have the accent on the second syllable, only when it means one who confesses his crimes: a sense in which it is scarcely ever used. Mr. Sberidan and Entick have the accent on the first syllable of this word, Mr. Scott on the first and second; Dr. Johnson, Mr. Perry, Buchanan, W. Johnston, Ash, Bailey, and Smith, on the second : but notwithstanding this weight of authority, the best usage is certainly on the other side.	•
Confest, k6n-f£st'. a. Open, known, not concealed. *
C? Dr. Kenrick tells us, that this is a poetical word for Confused: and, indeed, we frequently find it so written by Pope and others:
“ This clue thus found unravels all the rest;
“ The prospect clears, and Clodio stands su confest”
But that this is a mere compliance with the prejudices of the eye, and that there is not the least necessity for departing from the common spelling, see Principles of English Pronunciation, No. 360.

(Xj* This word, very unlike most others from the same source, has been made to alter its French orthography, in order to approach a little nearer to the English pronunciation of it Some affected speakers on the stage pronounce the first syllable like cone, as it is marked in the first edition of Mr. Sheridan’s Dictionary; and this is perfectly of a piece with the affectation which has altered the spelling of the last. By Dryden and South, as quoted by Dr. Johnson, we find this word spelled like the adjective confident: and it is more than probable that its French' pronunciation is but of late date ; but so universal is its use at present, that a greater mark of rusticity cannot be given than to place the accent on the first syllable, and to pronounce the last dent instead of dant.
