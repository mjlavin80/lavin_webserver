(Ej* The second manner of pronouncing this word is more general; but the first is more analogical. If, when we pronounce a Latin or Greek word of two syllables, having a single consonant between two vowels, we always make the first vowel long; it is very natural, when such a word is transplanted whole into our own language, to pronounce it in tlie same manner. That the quantity of the original
Mill6TLpA&nd;—/Ain, this.
has very' little to do m this case, may be seen under the word Drama (544) ; and yet nothing but an absurd regard to this could have influenced the generality of speakers to pronounce this word with the first vowel short, contrary- to the old genuine analogy of our own language, as Dr. Wallis calls it, and contrary to the manner in which we pronounce the word in the original ? for though local, favour, and labour, have the first vowel short in tlie Latin localis, favor, and labor, we pronounce them both in Latin and English according to our own analogy, with the o and a long and open. The same may be observed of words from tlie Greek. lit the word in question, therefore, the au- ‘ thority of Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Scott, and Dr. Ash, who make the first vowel long, ought to outweigh that of Dr. Kenrics, Mr. Perry, Entick, and Buchanan, who make it short.
