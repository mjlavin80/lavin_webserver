OC? Dr* Johnson tells us, that this word is originally and properly talf; which having talve* in the plural* the singular, in time, was borrowed from it: *calf Saxon, undoubtedly from salvus, Latin. There is some diversity among our Orthdepists about the I in this word and its verb. Mr. Sheridan marks it to be pronounced; Mr. Smith, W. Johnston, and Barclay, make it mute; Mr. Scott and Perry give it both ways; and Mr. Nares says it is mute in the noun, but sounded in the verb. The mute I is certainly countenanced in this word by calve and halve: but as they are veiy irregular, and are the only wotds where the I is silent in thi9 situation, for valve, delve, solve, Sec. have the / pronounced { and as this word is of Latin original, the I ought certainly to be preserved in both words: for to have the same word sounded differently, to signify different things, is a defect’in language that ought as much as possible to be avoided. —See Bowl and Fault.
