With respect to the pronunciation of a in the first syllable ofthis word, Mr.Sheridan says, that in England the first syllable is pro* nounced like far, and in Ireland like fare. But if this be really the case,the two nations seem to have changed dialects; for nothing can be more evident to the most superficial
' observer, than the tendency in Ireland to pronounce the a like that in fartas\d in England like that in fare. Not that I think the ronunciation ofthefirst syllable o ffarewell, ke far, either vicious or vulgar: I am convinced many good speakers so pronounce it; but the other pronunciation I think the more eligible, as well as more general; Dr. Kenrick and Mr. Scott pronounce it with the second sound of a, and W. Johnston and Mr. Perry with the first.
