ttxH ORGANIC FORMATION OF THE CONSONANTS.
ing one, we shall nearly describe its fellow; by which means the labour will be lessened, and the nature of the consonants better perceived. The consonant*, that fall into pairs are the following:
fi	f	t	m	*h	Ik	k	ch	chair
b	v	d	z	zh	dh	g	j	jail,
42.	Holder, who wrote the most elaborately and philosophically upon thi^ subject, tells us, in his Element* qf S/ieech, that when we only whisper we cannot distinguish the first rank of these letters from the second. It is certain the difference between them is very nice; the upper letters seeming to have only a smarter, brisker appulse of the organs than the lower; which may not improperly be distinguished by sharp and flat. The most marking distinction be* tween them will be found to be a sort of guttural murmur, which precedes the latter letters when we wish to pronounce them forcibly, but not the former. Thus if we close the lips, and put the fingers on them to keep them shut, and strive to pronounce the A, no sound at all will be heard: but in striving to pronounce the b we shall find a murmuring sound from the throat, which seems the commencement of the letter; and if we do but stop die breath by the appulse of the organs, in order to pronounce with greater force, the same may be observed of the rest of the letters.
43.	This difference in the formation of these consonants may be more dis-tincdy perceived in the * and z than in any other of the letters; the former is sounded by the simple issue of the breath between the teeth, without any vibration of it in the throat, and may be called a hissing sound; while the latter cannot be formed without generating a sound in die throat, which may be calied a vocal sound. The upper rank of letters, therefore, may be called breathing consonants ; and the lower, vocal ones.
44.	These observations premised, we may proceed to describe the organic formation of each letter.
45.	P and B are formed by closing the lips till the breath is collected, and then letting it issue by forming the vowel c.
46.	F and V arc formed by pressing the upper teeth upon the under lip, and sounding the vowel c before the former and after the latter of these letters.
47.	T and D are formed by pressing the tip of the tongue to the gums of the upper teeth, and then separating them, by pronouncing the vowel c.
48.	5 and Z are formed by placing the tongue in the same position as in T and Dy but not so close to the gums, as to stop the breath: a space is left be* tween the tongue and the palate for die breath to issue, which forms the hissing and buzzing sound of these letters.
49.	SH heard in mission, and zh in evasion^ arc formed in the same seat of sound as * and z ; but in die former, the tongue is drawn a little inwards, and at a somewhat greater distance from the palate, which occasions a fuller effusion of breath from the hollow of the mouth, than in the latter, which are form** ed nearer to the teeth.
50. 77/in think, and the same letters in that, arc formed by protruding the tongue between the fore teeth, pressing it against the upper teeth, and at the same time endeavouring to sound the * or z ; the former letter to sound th in think, and the latter to sound th in that.
51.	JTand G hard are formed by pressing the middle of the tongue to the roof of the mouth near the throat, and separating them a litde smartly to forty die first; and more gendy to form the last of these letters.
