(O* The former pronunciation of this word is adopted by Dr. Johnson, Dr. Kenrick, |4r. Sheridan, Mr. Scott, and Entick; and the latter by Mr. Nares, W. Johnston, Buchanan, and Perry. That the latter is more fashionable cannot be denied; but that the former is more correct is evident, from similar words which have been anglicised ; thus Bipeds and Quadrupeds have dropped their Latin final syllable; and why the word in question should retain it, cannot be conceived. Besides, though seldom used in the singular, there is no reason why it should not be so used; and then it mijst necessarily become a Milliped: Centipede, properly Centiped, is adopted ; and by forming Centipede in the plural, shows us how we ought to form and pronounce the word in question; and if Antipodes has not yet submitted to this analogy, it is because, like Cantharides, Caryatides, Manet > &c. it is never used in the* singular.—See Antipodes.

QCj* This word is in no piptionaiy that I have met with; but as it i? regularly derived from the Greek	and is
adopted by good speakers, there is no reason why it should not be inserted^ especially as it seems to convey a different idea from similar words • for the adjective roi-mick seems to imply the act of imitating 4 and imitative, the power, capability^ or habit of imitating; while mimetic signifies a proneness or tendency to imitation. Besides, mimetic seems to imply a ludicrous imitation of the actions and passions of living* creatures; but imitative is applied to any objects, and generally implies serious and respectable imitation. Thus we say : “ Painting is an imitative art, and “ that apes are very mimetic;” and “ it is “ observable, that those who are very mi-“ metic are seldom imitative of grand and ** noble objects.” Harris, therefore, seems to have used this word rather inaccurately, when he says, *• The mimetic art of “ poetry has been hitherto considered as “ fetching its imitation from mere natural “ resemblance. In this it has been shown “ much inferior to painting, and pearly “ equal to music£”—£[arriis Three Treatises, ch. iv.
