ACCENT ON POLYSYLLABLES.
Cy*
^■il languages, they are generally to be pronounced with the same accents thst is, mth the same accent as the first person present of the indicative mood active voice, or as the present participle of the same verb. The reality of this rale will best appear by a selection of such classes of words as have an equal number of syllables in both languages.	.
(f)	Words which have a in the penultimate syllable:
prevalent,
equivalent,
adjacent,
ligament,
prsev&lens,
sequivalens,
adjacens,
ligamen,
infamous,
pr6pagate,
indagate,
stiffragan,
inf&mis,
propago,
indigo,
suffragans.
In this small class of words we find ail but the two first have a different ao cent in English from that of the Latin. The rule for placing the accent in that laqguage being the simplest in the world: if the penultimate syllable is long, the accent is on it; if short, the accent is on the antepenultimate.
(gj Words which have e in the penultimate syllable:
penetrate,
discrepant,
precedent,
tlegant,
exuberant,
panetro,
discrepans,
praecedens,
elggans,
exupgrans,
exuberant,
Eminent,
Excellent,
Alienate,
delegate,
exubgrana, emfaens, excellent alleno, delego.
In this class we find the penultimate e accented in English as in Latin, ex* cept in the three last words. The word alienate departs from the Latin accentuation, by placing the stress on the first syllable, as if derived from the English noon, alien. The e in fierutro is either long or short in Latin, and in this case wt generally prefer the short sound to the long one.
