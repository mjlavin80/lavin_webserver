5t9. Some of these Greek compounds seem to refuse the antepenultimate Accent, for-the same reason as orthodoxy ; such as necromancy, chiromancy, hydro nancy; and those terminating in archy, as hierarchy, oligarchy, patriarchy ; all of which have the accent on the first syllable, which gives the organs time to Recover their force upon the third, and to pronounce the two consonants with inuch more ease than if the accent immediately preceded them; but periphrasis tth&tintiphrasis, besides their claim to the accent of their originals, readily admit of the aeecht on the second syllable, because the consonants in the two last syllables do not come together, and are therefore easily pronounced after the accent; Words of more than two syllables ending in ogur, as pedagogue, dialogue, 8cc. have the accent on the antepenultimate. Orthoepy having no consonant in the antepenultimate syllable, naturally throws its accent on the first. See MtwofliACHY.
*	530. By this view of the end Weal terminations we may easily perceive hovr readily our language falls into the antepenultimate accent in these compounded polysyllables ; and that those terminations which seem to refuse this accent, do it father from a regard to etymology than analogy : thus words ending in am, «S periphrasis, apophasis, hypostasis, anftpcristasis, Sec. have the antepenultimate ttccerit of their originals. The same may be observed of those ending in esis, as hypothesis, antithesis, parenthesis, he.; but exegesis, ma*hesis, anvesis, catachresis, paractntesis, aposhpesis^ have the accent on the penultimate syllable, because the vowel in this syllable is long in Greek and Latin. But all words ending in om haVe the accent on the penultimate, except metamorphosis and apotheosis, which desert the acccnt of th<*ir Latin originals, while those in ysis are accented regularly on the antepenultimate in Gre* k, Latin, and English, as analysis, paralysis, &c. AVe may note too, that every » in all these terminations is sharp and ’hissing. See the words Exostosis and Apotheoses.
521. Words of three syllables ending in ator have the accent on the penultimate, as spectafor% collator, dr'a'or, &c. except orator, senator, bgator, and barrator. But words in this termination of more than three syllables, though they have generally the accent on the penultimate, are subject to a diversity not easily reduced to the rule: thus navigator, propagator, dedicator, See. are
