OF THE NATURE OF ACCENT.
Z.
483.	Z is the flatand bears the same relation to it as b does to //, d to tf ham g to *, and v to f Its common name is izzard, which Dr. Johnson explains into * hard; if, however, this be the meaning, it is a gross misnomer: for the z is not the hard, but the soft s*: but as it has a less sharp, and therefore not so audible a sound, it is not impossible but it may mean 8 surd. Zed> borrowed from the French, is the more fashionable name of this letter; but, in my opinion, not to be admitted, because the names of the letters ought to have no diversity.
484.	Z, like a, goes into aspiration before a diphthong, or a diphthongal vowel after the accent, as is heard in vizier, glazier, grazier, kc. pronounced vizh-i-cr, glazh-i-rr, grazh-i^r, See. The same may be observed of azure, razure, &c.
485.	Z is silent in the French word rendezvous; and is pronounced in the Italian mapner, as if t were before it* in mczzotinto, as if written metzotinto.
Thus have we endeavoured to exhibit a just idea of the principles of pronunciation, both with respect to single letters, and their various combinations into Syllables and words. The attentive reader must have observed how much the sounds of the letters vary, as they are differently associated, and how much the pronunciation of these associations depends upon the position of the accent. This is a point of the utmost importance, and a want of attending to it has betrayed several ingenious men into the grossest absurdities. This will more fully appear in the observations on accent} which is the next point to be considered.
OF THE NATURE OF ACCENT.
486.	The accent of the ancients is the opprobrium of modern criticism. Nothing can show more evidently the fallibility of the human faculties than the total ignorance we are in at present of the nature of the Latin and Greek accentf. This would be still more surprising if a phenomenon of a similar kind did not daily present itself to our view. The accent of the English language, which is constantly sounding in our ears, and every moment open to investigation, seems as much a mystery as th:.t accent which is removed almost two thousand years from our view. Obscurity, perplexity, and confusion, run through every treatise on the subject, and nothing could be so hopeless as an attempt to explain it, did not a circumstance present itself, which at once accounts for the confusion, and affords a clew to lead us out of it.
487.	Not one writer on accent has given us such a definition of the voice as acqu<ants us with its essential properties: they speak of high and low, loud and soft, quick and slow, but they never once mention that striking property which
*	Professor Ward, speaking* of the reason for doubling the * at the end of words, says,
9 doubled retains its proper force, which, when single at the end of words, is toftcned “ into 2, as his. his*” A’nl Dr. Wallis tells us, that it is almost certain when a noun has m hard in the last syllable, and becomes a verb; that in the latter case the t becomes soft, as a home is pronounced with the hard «, and to houtc with the t soft.
