DIFFERENT SOUNDS OF THE LETTER Y.	lvfc
as the letter i in the same situation, and nothing but a catalogue will give us any idea of the analogy of the language in this point.
186.	The y is long in chylaccon*, but shortened by the secondary accent in chySfaction and chyBJactive, (530:) though, without the least reason from analogy, Mr. Sheridan has marked them both long.
187.	Words composed of hydro, from the Greek i$«p, water, have the y before the accent generally long, as hydrography, hydrtgrapher, kydromet^y, hyd* opic ; all which have the y long in Mr. Sheridan but hydrography, which must be a mistake of the press; and this long sound of y continues in hydrostatic in spite of the shortening power of the secondary accent. (530.) The same sound of y prevails in hydraulic*, and hydatides. Hygrometer and hygromctry, seem to follow the same analogy, as well as hyperbola and hyperbole ; which are generally heard with the y long; though Kenrick has marked the latter short. Hypotaxis and hjpotermte ought to have the y long likewise. In hypothesis the y is more frequently short than long; and in hypothetical it is more frequently long than short; but hypocrisy has the first y always short. Myrabolan and myropolist may have the y either long or short. Mythology has the first y generally short, and mythological, from the shortening power of the secondary accent, (530), almost always. Phytivorousy phytography, phytology, have the first y always long. In phylactery, the first y is generally short, and in physician always. Pylorus has the y long in Mr. Sheridan, but I think, improperly. In pyramidal he marks the y long, though, in my opinion, it is generally heard short, as in pyramid. In pyrites^ with the accent on the second syllable, he marks the y short, much more correctly than Kenrick, who places the accent on the first syllable, and marks the y long, (see the word.) Synodic, synodical, synonima, and synopms, have the y always short: ayncchdoche ought likewise to have the same letter short, as we find it in Perry’s and Kenrick’s Dictionaries; though in Sheridan’s we find it long. Typography and typographer ought to have the first y long, as we find it in Sheridan, Scott, Buchanan, W. Johnston, Kenrick, and Perry, though frequently heard short; and though tyrannical has they marked short by Mr. Perry, it ought rather to have the long sound as we see it marked by Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Scott, Buchanan, W. Johnston, and Kenrick.
188.	From the view that has been taken of the sound of the i and y immediately before the accent, it may justly be called the most uncertain part of pronunciation. Scarcely any reason can be given why custom prefers one sound to the other in some words; and why, in others, we may use either one or the other indiscriminately. It is strongly to be presumed that the i and y, in this situation, particularly the last, was generally pronounced long by our ancestors, but that custom has gradually inclined to the shorter sound as more readily pronounced, and as more like the sound of these letters when they end a syllable after the accent; and, perhaps, we should contribute to the regularity of the language, if, when we are in doubt, we should rather incline to the short than th© long sound of these letters.
W final
189.	That w final, is a vowel, is not disputed (9); when it is in this situation* it is equivalent to oo; as may be perceived in the sound of vow, tow-d, kc. where it forms a real diphthong* composed of the a in wa-ter. and the oo in woo and coo. It is often joined to o at the end of a syllable, without affecting the sound of that vowel; and in this situation it may be called servile, as in bow to shoot with* crew, low (not high), See.
