THY	I
—o&, m6wty n6r, n6t ;~^t6be, tftb,
. eacttsafele in the fallowing speech of Pontius, in the first scene of the same tragedy:
** Thou see’st not that thy brother is thy ri--" val;	,
“ But I must hide it, for I know'tAy temper.
*	Now, Marcus, now thy virtue’s on the
“proof;
•	“ Put forth thy utmost strength, work every
“ nerve,
** And eaH up all thy father in thy soul.”
As this pronoun is generally pronounced on the stage, it would be difficult for the ear to distinguish whether the words are,
“ Thou know’st not that thy brother is thy “ rival,” or,
“ Thou know’st not that the brother is the “ rival,” Sec.
And this may be one reason why the slender pronunciation of thy should lie avoided as much as possible.
Perhaps it will be urged, that though these passages require thy to be pronounced so as to rhyme with high, there are other instances in tragedy where the subject is low and familiar, which woutd be better pronounced by sounding thy like the: to which it may be answered, that when tragedy lowers her voice, and descends into the mean and familiar, as is frequently the case in the tranches of Shakspeare, the slender pronunciation of thy may be adopted ; because, though the piece may have tbe name of a tragedy, the scene may be really comedy. The only rule, therefore*, that can be given, is a very indefinite one; namely, that thy ought always to be pronounced so as to rhyme with high when the subject is raised, and the personage dignified; but when the subject is familiar and the person we address, witliout dignity or importance, if thy be the personal pronoun made use of,it ought to be pronounced like thethus, if, in a familiar way, we say to a friend, Give me thy hand, we never hear the pronoun thy sounded so as to rhyme with high: and it is always pronounced like the when speaking to a child; we say, Mind thy book, hold up thy Jiead,or, 7a*e off thy hat. The phraseology we call thee and thouing is not in so common use with us as the tutoyant among the French : but as the second personal pronoun thou, and its possessive thy are indispensable in composition, it seems of some importance to pronounce them properly.—See Rhetorical Grammar, page 32.
