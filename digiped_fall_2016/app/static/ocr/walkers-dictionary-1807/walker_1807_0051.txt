DIFFERENT SOUNDS OF THE LETTER J.
slavish imitation of the French and Italians, there is little doubt but these words would have the accent on the first syllable, and that the i would be pronounced regularly like the short r, as in Indigo and Portico. See Vertigo.
113.	There is a remarkable alteration in the sound of this vowel, in certain situations where it changes to a sound equivalent to initial y. The situation that occasions this change is,^vhen the i precedes another vowel in an unaccented syllabic, and is not preceded by any of the dentals: thus we hear iary in w'wu' bil-mry, Sec. pronounced as if written mil-yary, bil-yary, &c. Min-ion* and ,7i as if written min-yon and firn-yon. In these words the i is so totally altered to //, that pronouncing the ia and io in separate syllables would be an error the most palpable ; but where the other liquids or mutes precede the i in this situation, the coalition is not so necessary: for though the two latter syllables of cwivial, fiarticifiiul, See. are extremely prone to unite into one, they may, however, be separated, provided the separation be not too distant. The same observations hold good of r, as malleable, pronounced mal-ya-hle.
114.	But the sound of the ?, the most difficult to reduce to rule, is when it ends a syllable immediately before the accent. When either the primary or secondary accent is on this letter* it is invariably pronounced either as the long i in title, the short / in tittle, or the French i in magazine; and when it ends a syllable after the accent, it is always sounded like <*, as scn-si-blc, ru-ti-fyy &c. But when it ends a syllable, immediately before the accent, it is sometimes pronounced long, as in vi-ta-li-ty, where the first syllable is exactly like the first of \'i-al; and sometimes short, as in di-gcst, where the i is pronounced as if the word were written de-gest. The sound of the /, in this situation, is so liuie reducible to rule, that none of our writers on the subject have attempted it; and the only method to give some idea of it, seems to be the very laborious one of classing such words together as have the i pronounced in the same manner, and observing the different combinations of other letters that may possibly be the cause of the different sounds of this.
115.	In the first place, where the i is the only letter in the first syllable, and
the accent is on the second, beginning with a consonant, the vowel has its long diphthongal sound, as in idea, identity, idolatry, idoneous, irascible, ironical, isos-Kirs, itinerant, itinerary. Imagine and its compounds seem the only exceptions. But to give the inspector some idea of general usage, I have subjoined examples of these words as they stand in our different Pronouncing Dictionaries ^ idea.	Sheridan, Scott, Buchanan, W.

mencing with a vow'el, it generally preserves its long open diphthongal sound Thus in di-ameter, di-urml,	the first syllable is equivalent to the verb to
