DIFFERENT SOUNDS OF THE LETTER U.
nant, as falcon, pronounced./^wk'n. The o is likewise mute in the same situation whan preceded by d in pardon, pronounced pard’n, but notin Guerdon : it is mute when preceded by p in weapon, capon, &c. pronounced wcap’n, cap'n, &c.; and when preceded by s in reason, season, t reason% orat ion, benison, (U nison, uvi-•on, foison, poison, prison, damson, crimson advowson, pronounced reaz’n, treaz'n, &c.; and mason, bason, garrison, lesson, caparison, comparison, disinherison, parson, and person, pronounced masn, bas9n, Sec. Unison, diapason, and cargason, seem, particularly in solemn speaking, to preserve the sound of o like u, as if written unisun, diapazun, &c. The same letter is suppressed in a final unaccented syllable beginning with t, as Seton, cotton, button, mutton, glutton, pronounced as if written Set9n, cott'n, Sec. When x precedes the t, the o is pronounced distinctly, as in Sexton. When I is the preceding letter, the o is generally suppressed, as in ;the proper names Stilton cheese, Wilton carpets, and Milton Mowbray, &c. Accurate speakers sometimes struggle to preserve it in the name of our great cpic poet Milton; but the former examples sufficiently show the tendency of the language; and this tendency cannot be easily counteracted. This letter is likewise suppressed in the last syllable of blazo?i, pronounced blaz’n ; but is always to be preserved in the same syllable of horizon. This suppression of the o must not be ranked among those careless abbreviations found onJy among the vulgar, but must be considered as one of those devious tendencies to brevity, which has worn itself a currency in the language, and has at last become a part of it. To pronounce the o in those cases where it is suppressed, would give a singularity to the speaker bordering nearly on the pedantic ; and the attention given to this singularity by the hearer would necessarily diminish his attention to the subject, and consequently deprive the speaker of something much more desirable.
U
171.	The first sound of tt, heard in tube, or ending an unacccnted syllable, a$ in cu-bic, is a diphthongal sound, as if e were prefixed, and these words were spelt tewbe and kewbic. The letter u is exactly the pronoun you.
172.	The second sound of u is the short sound, which tallies exactly with the o in done, son, See. which every ear perceives might, as well for the sound's sake, be spelt dun, sun, &c. Sec all the words where the o has this sound, No. 165.
173.	The third sound of this letter, and that in which the English more particularly depart from analogy, is the u hi bull, full, pull, Sec. The first, or diphthongal u in tube^ seems almost as peculiar to the English as the long sound of the i in thine, mine, he. but here, as if they chose to imitate the Latin, Italian, and French tt, they leave out the e before the u, which is heard in tube* mule, Sec. and do not pronouncc the latter part of u quite so long as the oo in pool, nor so short as the w in dull, but with a middle sound between both, whicb is the true short sound of the oo in coo and wo-, as may be heard by compelling woo and wool; the Litter of which is a perfect rhyme to bull.
174.	This middle sound of so unlike the general sound of that letter, exists only in the following wo;xL: bull, full, frail; words compounded of full, as wonderful, dreadful, See. biilijck, hullu,bullet, huhvark, fuller, fuiling^jiill, fiullt’u,pallet, push,bush, bwihel, pul fat, puss, buU:on,bu?chh', ciishion,nich)0,]iuddhigytwgarJiits-sar, huzza, and put when a verb: but few as they are, except full, which is a very copious termination, they arc sufficient to puzzle Englishmen who reside at any distance from the capital, and to jmake the inhabitants of Scotland and
