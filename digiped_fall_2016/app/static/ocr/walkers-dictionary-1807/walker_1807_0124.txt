ment, but the latter does not imply a repetition of a commendation : thus, rc* petition would signify to petition again; while rtp-ettiion signifies ody au iteration of the same act, be it what it will. The same may be observed of the words re-create and recreate, reformation and reformation.
532.	That this is perfectly agreeable to the nature of the language, appears from the short pronunciation oi' the vowel in the first syllable of preface, prelate, prelude, prologue, &c. as if divided into prtfaee, prel-ate, prel-ude, firol-'jgue, &c. It is much to be regretted, however, that this short sound of the penultimate vowel has so much obtained in our language, which abounds too much in these sounds ; nor can etymology be always pleaded for this pronunciation; for in the foregoing words, the first vowel is long in the Latin prafatio, prelcutu^ pr&ludi-tim, though short in prUogus: for though in words from the Greek the preposition wpo was short, in Latin it was generally long; and why we should shorten it in progress, project, kc. where it is long in Latin, cap only be accounted for by the superficial application of a general rule, to the prejudice of the sound of our language. (543).
533.	It will be necessary, however, to observe, that in forming a judgment of the propriety of these observations, the nicest care must be taken not to confound those prepositions which are under the primary and secondary accent, with those which immediately precede the stress; for preclude, pretend, &c. are under a very different predicament from prologue, preposition, 8cc.; and the very same law that obliges us to pronounce the vowel short in the first syllable of prov-i-dence, prov-o-ca'ion, and prof-a-nation, obliges us to pronounce the vowel open, and with some degree of length in pro-vide, pro-v jkeymA pro-fane. The same may be observed of the e in re-pair and reparation, re-ply and rep-ft-cation, re-peat and repartition, the accent making the whole difference between the quantity of the vowel in one word and the other.
534.	The only exception to the shortening power of the secondary accent is the same as that which prevents the shortening power of the piimary accent, (503), namely, the vowel u, as in lucubration, or when any other of the vowels are succeeded by a semi-consonant diphthong, (196): thus mediator and mediatorial have the e in the first syllable as long as in mediate : deviation has the e in the first syllable as long as in deviate, notwithstanding the secondary accent is on it, and wh; h would infallibly have shortened it if it had not been for the succeeding diphthong ia ; and even this diphthong in gladiator has not the power of preserv ing the first syllable long, though Mr. Sheridan, by his marking it, has made it so.
535.	From what has been seen of accent and quantity, it is easy to perceive how prone our language is to an antepenultimate accent, and how naturally this accent shortens the vowel it foils upon : nay, so great a propensity have vowels to shrink under this accent, that the diphthong itself, in some words, and analogy in others, are not sufficient to prevent it, as valiant, retaliate. Thus, by the subjoining only of al to nation, with the a long, it becomes national, with the o short, though contrary to its relation with occasion and congregation, which do not shorten the a upon being made occasional and congregational: in like manner the acquisition of the same termination to the word nature, makes it nat-u-ral; but this, it may be presumed, is derived from the Latin naturali*, and not from adding al to the English word, as in the foregoing instances; and thus it comes under ihe shortening power of the antepenultimate acccnt, notwithstanding the semi-consonant diphthong u.
536.	The same shortening power in the antepenultimate accent may be ol> served in rational and ratiocinate, where the first a in the first word, and the 0 if
