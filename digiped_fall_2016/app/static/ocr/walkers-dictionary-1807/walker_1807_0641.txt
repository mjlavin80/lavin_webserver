§3* Whether this word comes from the Dutch loeren, to look askance, or from the English word lower, signifying to look low, as the sky seems to do when it is heavy, and thick with clouds, (which is the much, more probable derivation;) it certainly cries aloud for a different spelling from lower,to make low. For the reasons,see the words Flavor and Flour ; Bowl and Form.
