PRONUNCIATION OF THE CONSONANT D.
It may be observed too, that when the verb ends in a liquid, or a liqukl and mute t, the participle d always preserves its pure sound; as blamed joined filled, barred, pronounced blam'd jUn'd, fill'd* barr'd. This contraction of the participial t d, and the Verbal en (103) is so fixed an idiom of our pronunciation, that to alter it, would be to alter the sound ol the whole language. It must* however be regretted, that it subjects our tongue to some of the most hissing, snapping, clashing, grinding* sounds that ever grated the cars of a Vandal : thus rapped* scratched, zv, < nch d, triditd, fang lid, bircium. hardened strengthened quickened, See. almost frighten us when written as they are actually pronounced, as ra*fit, scatcht, wrench:* bridl'd* fungi'd, birch'n* strengthen'd, quick9. 9d, &c.: they become sull more formidable when used corrtractedly in the solemn style, which never ought to be the case; lor here, instead of thou strengh*n96t or strength* n'd'st, thout/uick'n'xt or qukk'n'd'at, we ought to pronounce, thou stretigih9-nest or strength*nedst, thou ytnck'neat or yuick'nedst, which are sufficiently harsh of all conscience. (See No. 405.) But to compensate for these Gothic sounds, which, however, are not without their use, our language is full of the smoothest and most sonorous terminations oi the Greeks ami Romans. ^
360.	By the tbregoing rule of contraction, arising from the very nature of the letters, we see the absurdity of substituting tlie t for ed, wht*n the verb ,ends in a sharp consonant; for, when the pronunciation cannot be mistaken it is folly to alter the orthography; thus the Distressed Mother, the title of a tragedy, needs not to be written Distrest Mother, as we generally find it, bc-
*	cause, though we write it in the former manner, it must necessarily be pronounced in the latter.
361.	By this rule, too, we may see the impropriety of wilting blest for blcs-tedy when a participle.
“ Blest in thy genius, in thy lovt; too blest.”—Pop*.
But when the word blessed is an adjective, it ought always to be pronounced, even in the most familiar conversation) iii two syllables, as tliis is a blessed day, the blessed thistle, &c.
362.	This word, with Ira'-ned, cursed, and %ving<d, are the only participial adjectives which arc constantly pronounccd in two syllables, where the participles are pronounced in one: thus a I a 'tied man, a cu &eu thi.ig, a winged ho 'se, preserve the ed in a distinct syllable; while the same words* when verbs, as he Icaimed to write, ht: cursed the day, they wing d fheijiight, are heard in one syllable, as if written learnd, curst, and «7 gd: the d in cursed changing to /, from its following the sharp consonant v. (358).
363.	Poetry, however,1 (wluch has been one great cause of improper ortho-
graphy), assumes the privilege of using these words* when adjecthes, either as monosyllables or iiksyii ;b!cs; but correct prose rigidly exacts the pronunciation of (d in thc^e words, when ;.djceti\cs, as a distinct syllable. The ed in aged and winged, always make a distinct syllable as an og*d man ; the winged courser: but when this word is compounded with .nother, the ed does not form a syllabic, as ajuiUig'd ho .se, a	f wl.
S64._ It is, perhaps, worthy of notice th»t when adjectives are changed into adverbs by the addition of the termination /■', we o .en lind the participial termination ed preserved lonjr and distinct, even in those very words wThe; c it was contracted when used adjcctivcly: thus though we always hear cc / profess'd, design'd, Sec. we as constantly hear con-fm.-rtf-h, firo-few-; V . dt-sign-?d-!y, Z<c. The same may be observed of the following list of words,
