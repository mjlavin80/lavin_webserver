•IFFERENT SOUNDS OF THE LETTER A.
xxxi*
seems, says Dr. Lowth, to be the true and genuine preposition on, a little disguised by familiar use and quick pronunciation: the same indistinctness, irom rapivity and coincidence of sound, has confounded the pronunciation oi this xnutikted preposition to the ear, in the different questions what'* o'clock, when we wouid know the hour, and what'a a clock, when we would have the description of that horary machine; and if the accent be kept strongly on the first syllable of the word tolerable, as it always ought to be, we find scarcely any distinguishable difference to the ear, if we substitute u or o instead of a in the penultimate syllable. Thus tolerable, toleroble, and toleruble, are exactly the surac word to the ear, if pronounced without premeditation or transposing the accent, for the real purpose of distinction; and inwards, outwards, kc. might, with respect to sound, be spelt inwurds, outwurds, &c. Thus the word man, when not under the accent, might be written mun in nobleman, husbandman, woman ; and tertian and quartan, tertiun and quartun, See. The same observation will hold good in almost every final syllable where a is not accented, as medal, dial, giant, bias, kc. d*fiance, temfierance, See.; but when the final syllable ends in age, ate, or ace, the a goes into a somewhat different sound. See 90 and 91.
89.	There is a corrupt, but a received pronunciation of this letter in the vords any, many, Thames, where the a sounds like short e, as if written enny, mttmy, Terns. Catch, among Londoners, seems to have degenerated into Ketch ; and says, the third person of the verb to say, has, among all ranks of people, and in every part of the united kingdoms, degenerated into sez, rhyming with Fez.
90.	The a goes into a sound approaching the short t, in the numerous termination in age, when the accent is not on it, as cabbage, village, courage, fecc. and are pronounced nearly as if written cabbige, vtUige, courige, Sec. The exceptions to this rule are chiefly among words of three syllables, with the accent on the first; these seem to be the following: Adage,presage, scutage, hemorhage, vassal-cge, cartilage, guidage, pudlagc, mucilage, cartilage, pupilage, orphanage, villanage, cfpanage, concubinage, baronage, patronage, fiarsonage, personage, equipage, om/rage, saxifrage, umpirage, embassage, hermitage, heritage, parentage, me suage.
91.	The a in the numerous termination ate, when the accent is not on it, is pronounced somewhat differently in different words. If the word be a substantive, or an adjective, the a seems to be shorter than when it is a verb : thus a sood ear will discover a difference in the quantity of this letter, in delicate and dedicate ; in climate, primate, and ultimate ; and the vowels to calculate, to regulate* and to speculate, where we find the nouns and adjectives have the a considerably shorter than the verbs. Innate, however, preserves the a as long as if ihe accent were on it: but the unaccented terminations in ace, whether nouns or verbs, have the a so short and obscure as to be nearly similar to the u in us ; thus palace, solace, menace, pinnace, populace, might, without any great departure from their common sound, be written fiallus, sollus, See. while furnace almost* changes the a into /, and might be written fumiss.
92.	When the a is preceded by the gutturals, hard g or c, it is, in polite pronunciation, softened by the intervention of a sound like <% so that card, cart, guard, regard, are pronounced like k -ard, ghe-ard, n-gfa-ard. When the a is pronounced short, as in the first syllables of candl\ gander, he the interposition of the e is very perceptible, and indeed unavoidable: for though we cun pronounce guard and cart without interposing the e. it is impossible to pronounce garrison and carriage in the same manner. This sound of the a is taken notice of io Steele’s Grammar, page 49, which proves it is not the offspring of the present day (160) ; and 1 liave the satisfaction to find Mr. Smith, a very accurate inquirer into the subject, entirely of my opinion. But the sound of the a}
