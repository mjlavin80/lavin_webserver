(£3* There is an incorrect pronunciation of this and similar words, chiefly among the vulgar, which is sounding the word as if it were written mo-oold. This sound is often heard among incorrect speakers, where there i s no diphthong, as in cold, hold, sold, &c. pronounced co-oold, bo-oold, so-oold, &c. while the true pronunciation of these words has nothing of the u or oo in it, but is exactly like Toal'dr sol'd, cajol'd, &c. the preterits of the verbs tofoal, to sole, and to cajole, &c. For there is no middle sound between ovil and hole ; and the words in question must either rhyme with horvPd or foal’d; but the last is clearly the true pronunciation.
This worn, before Dr. Johnson wrote his Dictionary, was frequently written mold, which was perfectly ag» eeable to its Saxon derivation, and was less liable to mispro-
nunciation than the present spelling* -The word has three significations ; Afould, concretions occasioned by decay; from whence to moulder, to waste away: mould, or earth; that to which decay reduces bodies : ami a mould, a form to cast metals in. A diversity of pronunciation haa, endeavoured to distinguish the first of these senses from the rest by sounding it so as to rhyme with howl'd; but these distinctions of sound under the same spelling ought to be as much as possible avoided. For the reasons, see Bowl.
