How Dr. Johnson could be guilty of so gross an oversight as to spell this word and its compounds with one dis inconceivable*
By the general rule of English pronunciation , as the word stands here, it ought to be pronounced with the o long, the first syllable rhyming with go, no, and *0. False and absurd, however, as this spelling is, the veneration 1 have for Dr. Johnson’sau-thoritv forbids me to alter it in this Dictionary, though I shall never follow it inprac-	,
tice. Perhapsthe same veneration induced Mr. Sheridan to let this word stand as he found it in Johnson. Dr. Kenrick has ventured to insert another d in the verb; but in the substantive, derived from the present participle Codling, lets it stand witk one d. Some will be apt to think that when d ends a syllable, and a consonant follows
the d, whicKbeeins another, that the business is done, ana that the quantity of the vowel is sufficiently securea: but this is a mistake; for unless we previously understand the simple, the 0 in the compound, by the general rule, must be long. Now the first principle of orthography is, that, if possible, the letters should ofthemselvespoinfc out the sound of the word, without the necessity of recurring to etymology to find out the sound of the letters; and that we should never have recourse to etymology, but where fixing the sound woula unsettle the sense. Thus Coddling, a kind of apple, ought to be written with double d, both because it determines the sound of the o, and shows its derivation from the verb to Coddle. And Codling, a small cod-fish, ought to have but one d, because putting two, in order to fix the sound of 0, woukl confound it with another word. To wnte Saddltr, therefore, with one d> as we frequently see it on shops, is an error against the first principles of spelling; as, without necessity, it obliges us to understand the derivation of the word before we are snre of K#
