QCJ* Dr. Johnson, Dr. Ash, Dr. Kenrick, and Buchanan, accent this word on the second syllable ; and Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Nares, Mr. Scott, W. Johnston, Perry, Entick, and Bailey, on the first. That this is in possession of the best usa^e, I have not the least doubt; and that it is agreeable to the analogy of accenting words from the learned languages which we naturalize by dropping
Ml;—611;—p6imd*Ain, this.
a syllable, is evident from the numerous class of words of the same kind. See Academy, Incomparable,&c. A collateral proof too that this is the true pronunciation is, that Mesentery, a word of the same form, is by all the above-mentioned exi-cographers \*ho have the vord, except Bailv, accented on the first syllable.
