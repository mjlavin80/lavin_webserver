DIFFERENT SOUNDS OF THE LETTER U.
Ireland) (who, it is highly probable, received a much more regular pronuncia*-
Hon from our ancestors,) not unfrequently the jest of fools.	, v
175.	But vague and desultory as this sound oi the u may at first seeih, on a , closer view we find it chiefly confined to words which begin with the mute labials, 4,/;,./) and end with the liquid labial /, or the denials and d, as in bull, \ ftdLpulL, btuJi, fu#h, pudding, puss, put, &c. Whatever, therefore, was the cause of this whimsical deviation, we see its primitives are confined to a very v narrow compass: put has this sound only when it is a verb ; for putty, a paste for glass, has the common sound of u, and rhymes exactly with nutty, (having the qualities of a nut;) so put, the game at cards, and the vulgar appellation of twntry put, follow the same analogy. All Bull's compounds regularly follow their primitive. But though fuller, a whitener of cloth, and Fulham, a proper name, are not compounded offull, they are sounded as if they were; while Putney follows the general rule, and has its first syllable pronounced like the noun pul. Pulpit and /rnllet comply with the peculiarity on account of their resemblance to Jmll, though nothing related to it; and butcher and pus* adopt this sound of u for no reason but the nearness of their form to the other words: and when to these we have added cushion, sugar, cuckoo, hussar, and the interjection huzza, wt have every word in the whole language where the u is thus pronounced.
176.	Some speakers indeed, have attempted to give bulk and punish, this obtuse sound of u, but luckily have not been followed. The words which have already adopted it are sufficiently numerous; and we cannot be too careful to check the growth of so unmeaning an irregularity. When this vowel is preceded by r in the same syllabic, it has a sound somewhat longer than this middle sound, and exactly as if written oo: thus rue, true, &c. are pronounced nearly as if written roo, troo, See. (339.)
177.	It must be remarked, that this sound of u, except in the word fuller,
never extends to words from the learned languages; for fulminant, fulmination, ebullition, repulsion, sepulchre, See. sound the u as in dull, gull, &c. and the u in put and pustule is exactly like the same letter in thus. So the pure English wrfe,fulsome, buss, bulge, bustle, bustard, buzzard, preserve the u in its second sound, as in us, hull, and custard. It may likewise not be unworthy of remark, that the letter u is never subject to the shortening power of either the primary or secondary accent; but when accented, is always long, unless shortened by a double consonant. See the words Drama and Muculbnt, and No. 503, 534.	'
Irregular and Unaccented Sounds.

178.	But the strangest deviation of this letter from its regular sound is in the words busy, business, and bury. We laugh at the Scotch for pronouncing these words, as if written btwsy, bewsiness, and bewry; but we ought rather to blush for ourselves in departing so wantonly from the general rule as to pronounce them bir.zy, bizness, and berry.
179.	There is an incorrect pronunciation of this letter when it ends a syllable not under the accent, which prevails, not only among the vulgar, but is sometimes found in better company; and that is, giving the u an obscure sound* which confounds it with vowels of a very different kind: thus we not infrequently hear singular, regular, and particular, pronounced as if written
reg-e~lar, and par-tick-c-lar ; but nothing tends more to tarnish and vulgarize the pronunciation than this short and obscure sound of the unaccented w.
