(£/* Though I have agreed with all our or-thoepists in making the first syllable of prefect long, I cannot follow them so implicitly in the accent and quantity of this word. All but Mr. Sheridan, W. Johnston, ami Mr. Perry, place the accent on the second syllable ; and the two first of these writers make the first syllable long, as in prefect. Mr. Pern' alone has, in my opinion, given this word its true prouunci-ation, by placing the "accent on the first
. syllable, and making1 that syllable short. This is agTeeable to that general tendency of our language to an antepenultimate accentuation, and a short quantity on every vow^l but u.
