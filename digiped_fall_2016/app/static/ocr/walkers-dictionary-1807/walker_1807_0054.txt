xlviii
DIFFERENT SOUNDS OF THE LETTER J,
philosop/ry, philosophize ; to which we may certainly add, philologer, philologist, philology, philological, notwithstanding Mr. Sheridan has marked the i in these last words long.
132.	Pi and pli have the i generally short, as pilaster, frituitous, pilosity, plication. Piaster, and piazza*, being Italian words, have the i short before the vowel, contrary to the analogy of words of this forn* (116), where the i is long, as in pi-acular, priority, See. Piratical has the i marked long by Mr. Sheridan, and short by Dr. Kenrick. The former is, in my opinion, more agreeable both to custom and analogy, as the sound of the i before the accent is often determined by the sound of that letter in the primitive word.
133.	Pri has the \ generally long, as in primn'a!, primcvous, firimitiaL pri-
mero, primordial^ pr;vylo, privation^ privative^ but always short in primitive, and primer.	*
134.	Ri has the i snort, as in ridiculous. Rigidity is marked with the i long by Mr. Sheridan, and short by Dr. Kenrick: the latter is undoubtedly right. Rivality has the / long in the first syllable, in compliment to rival, as piratical has the i long, because derived from pirate. Rhinoceros has the i long in Sheridan, Scott, Kenrick, W. Johnston, and Buchanan; and short in Perry.
135.	Si has the i generally short, as similitude, siriasis, and ought certainly to be short in silicious, (better written cilicious,) though marked long by Mr. Sheridan. Simultaneous having the secondary accent on the first syllable, does not come under this head, but retains the i long, notwithstanding the shortening power of the accent it is undej\ (527).
136.	Ti has the i short, as in timidity.
137.	Tri has the i long, for the same reason as bi\ which see. (118) (119).
138.	Vi has the i so unsettled as to puzzle the correctcst speakers. The i is
generally long in vicarious, notwithstanding the short i in vicar. It is long in vibration, from its relation to vibrate. Vitality has the i long, like vital. In vivijick, vivijicate, and vivijiaroux, the first i is long, to avoid too great a sameness with the second. Vivacious and vivacity have the i almost as often long as short; Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Scott, and Dr. Kenrick, make the i in vivacious long, and Mr. Perry and Buchanan short; Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Scott, and W. Johnston, make the i in the first of vivacity long, and Perry and Buchanan short: but the short sound seems less formal and most agreeable to polite usage. Vicinity, vicinal, vicissitude, vituperate, viminecus, and virago, seem to prefer the short though Mr. Sheridan has marked the three last words with the first vowel long. But the diversity will be best seen by giving the authorities for ail these words-Vicinity.	Dr. Kenrick.
Vicinity.	Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Scott, Buchanan, W. Johnston, and Perry.
Vicinal. Mr. Sheridan.
Vicissitude. Mr. Sheridan, Dr. Kenrick, W. Johnston, Buchanan, and Perry. Vituperate. Mr. Sheridan, Dr. Kenrick, W. Johnston.
Vituperate. Mr. Perry.
Vtmineous. Mr. Sheridan.
Virago. Mr. Sheridan, and W. Johnston.
Virago. Dr. Kenrick, Mr. Scott, Buchanan, and Perry.
I have classed vicinal here as a word with the accent on the second syllable as it stands iu Sheridan’s Dictionary* but think it ought to have the accent on the first. See Medicinal.
139.	The same diversity and uncertainty in the sound of this letter seem to reign in those final unaccented syllables which arc terminated with the mute e. Perhaps the best way to give some tolerable idea of the analogy of the language
