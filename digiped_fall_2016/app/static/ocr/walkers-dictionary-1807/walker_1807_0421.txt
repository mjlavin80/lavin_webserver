Xy Before Johnson published his Dictionary, these words were universally spelled indict and indite. That great Reformer of our lan. guage seems to have considered, that as the Latin indietre came to us through the French enditer, we ought to adopt the French rather than the Latin preposition, especially as we have conformed to the French in the sound of the latter pail of this word. But not withstanding his authority, to indict) signifyingto charge, stands its ground, and to indite i* used only when we mean to draw up or compose ; in thi*> sense, perhaps, it may not be improper to spell it endite, as it may serve to distinguish it from the other word, so different m signification.
