PRONUNCIATION OF THE CONSONANT D.
Ixxvii
ckdy, chcmtit, (if derived from the Arabic, and chymiat, if from the Greek,) cfu -soneie, chimera, chirogra/ihijy chiromancy, chlorosis, choltr, chorus, chords c/ioro-grafihj, chyle and its compounds; anchor, anchoret, cachexy, catechism, catechise, catechetical, catechumen, ech echinus, ep.ch, efijcha, ich jT, machination, machinal, mechanic mechanical, orchestra, orcheatre, technical, anarch, anarchy, c.nch, cochlea-n/, dutich, hemistich, mm stich, eunuch, m^rarch, m narchial, hierarch, hiTei-iarch, prniatcuch,at.rnach,stomachic, scheme, achM, scholar, sefvsis, mastich, seneschal, and in all words where it is followed by r, as Christ, Chilian, chronohgy, chronicle, See. To these may be added the Celtic word loch (a lake). The exceptions arc charity, archer, and archery.
354.	When arch, signifying chief, begins a word from the Greek language, and is followed by a vowel, it is always pronounced a*'k, as in archangel, archipt-kg., architcct, archives, archetype, archaism, archiepiac opal, a r chidia c.naly arc hit ra v e, archai Lgy. But when we prefix arch to a word of our own, and this word begins with a consonant, we pronounce it so ?.s to rhyme with march, as archduke, orchdiacjn, archbish p; and sometimes, when the following word begins with a vowel, if it is a composition of our own, and the word does not come to us compounded from the Greek or Latin, as arche nemy.
355.	The word ache, (a pain,) pronounced ake, comes from the Greek, and was by Shakspeafe extended to two syllables, aches with ch, as in watches; but this is obsolete. It is now almost universally written ake and akes, except where it is compounded with another word, as head-ach, heart-ach, See. and by thus absurdly retaining the ch in the compound we are puzzled how to form the plural, without pronouncing aches in two syllables.
356.	In choir and chorister the ch is almost universally pronounced like yu (300): in ostrich, like dge, as if spelled ostiidge. It is silent in schedule, schism, and yacht; pronounced aeddule, sizm, and yot. It is sunk in drachm, but heard in drachma ; pronounced dram and drackma.
357.	When c comes after the accent, either primary or secondary, and is followed by ea, ia, ie, io, or eous, it takes the sound of sh; thus vcean, social, Ph:-ntmyaapanaceouaxfaacination^negociation, are pronounced as if written ozhean,Qrjt,hal, Pkixhion* xaponashemts, See. (196). Financier has the accent after the c, which on that account does not go into 4/i.
D.
358.	In order to have a just idea of the alterations of sound this letter un-tlergoes. it will be neccssary to consider its near relation to T. (41). These consonants, like p, and b^f, and vt k, and hard g, and s, and r, are letters of the same organ; they differ by the nicest shades of sound, and are easily convertible into each other; t, ptJ, k, and s. may, for the sake of distinction, be called sharp, and d, b, v, g, and z, may be called flat. For this reason, when a singular ends in a sharp consonant the a, w hich forms the plural, preserves its shas ]> sound, as in cuffs, packs, lips, hats, deaths; and when the singular ends with a licit consonant, the plural s has the sound of z, as drabs, bags, beads, lives, See. pronounced drabz, bagz, See.
359.	In the same manner when a verb ends with a sharp consonant, the d, in the termination ed, assumed by the preterit and participle, becomes sharp, and is sounded like t: thus stuffed, trifiped, cracked, passed, vouched^faced, (where the e is suppressed, as it always ought to be, (except when we are pronouncing the language of Scripture) (104) change the d into t, as if written stuft, tript, erarkt,
voucht, jfaste. So when the verb ends in a flat consonant, the d preserves Us true ffalsamnd, qls drubbed, pegged, Mved, buzzed, where the e is suppressed, and the words pronounced in one syllable, as if written drubb’d, pegg'd, liv’d, buzz'd.
