too remote or too insignificant to be produced : and indeed, if a diversity of names to vowels did notcoufoundusinonr spelling, or declaring to each other the component letters of a word, it would be entirely needless to enter into so trifling a question as the mere name of a tetter; but when we find •urselves unable to convey signs to each •ther on account of this diversity of names, and that words themselves are endangered by an improper utterance of their component parts, it seems highly incumbent on us to attempt a uniformity in this point, which, insignificant as it may seem, is undoubtedly the foundation of a just and regular pronunciation.
The first rule for naming a letter, when pronounced alone, seems to be this: Whatever sound we give to a letter when terminating a syllable, the same sound ought to be given to it when pronounced alone; because, in both cases, they have their primary, simple found, uninfluenced by a succeeding vowel or consonant; and therefore, when we pronounce a letter alone, it ought to have such a sound as does not suppose the existence of any other letter. But wherever a terminates a syllable with the accent upon it, (the only state in which it can be said to be pure,) it has always the Engli^i sound of tbat letter. The only exceptions to this role are, the wordsfa-thcr, master, and water ; and that these are merely exceptions, appears from the uniformity with which the a is pronounced otherwise in parent, papal, taper, fatal, &c. The other vowels have their names exactly similar to the sound they have in a similar situation, as the e like that in me-grim, the t like the i in li-tle; the o as the o in no-ble, and the u like the u in tu-tor. Thus, as it appears from the general analogy of pronunciation, that the sound of the a, which the English adopt, is the only one ,that does not necessarily suppose the existence of any other sqund, it inevitably follows that theirs only is the proper appellation of that letter.
But there is another analogy by which we may determine the true sound of the vowels when pronounced singly; and that is, the sound they have when preserved long and open by the final e. Thus we call the letter « by the sound it has in theme, the letter i as it sounds in time, the letter o as heard in tone, and the u as in tune'j and why the letter ALshould not be pronounced as heard in fate, cannot be conceived j as each of the other vowels has, like a, a variety of other sounds, as they are united with letters which, in some measure, alter their quality.

ifea of the a, when pronounced in the alphabet, we* see the natives of Ireland very prone to a different pronunciation of th? words where this letter occurs ; and, indeed, it is quite consistent with their doctrine of the sound of a, that the words pa- ^ rent, papal, taper, and fatal, should be pronounced pah-rent, pah-pal, lah-per, and fah-tal. We find the Scotch likewise inclinable to the same pronunciation of a, when in word*, as when alone. Thus we hear Savctan . for Satan, sawcred for sacred, and law-ity for laity ; and this is perfectly consistent with the manner in which they pronounce the letter a, when alone: there is no medium.
I f th is be not the true pronunciation of these words, the a is certainly to be sounded as the English do: for, whenever the English give the Italian sound, as it may be called, to the a, except in the words father and mas- ' ter, it is.always in consequence of ltsjunc-tion with some consonant, which determines it to that sound; as in monosyllables terminating in r, as bar,carxfar; but where -it is not affected by a succeeding consonant, as i$ the words parent, papal, natal, fatal, we then hear it pronounced as the slender English a,'both in and out of composition.
It will, perhaps, be objected, that the most frequent short sound of a, as heard in cat, rat, mat, carry, marry, parry, is the short sound of the Italians in father, car, mar, par, and not the short sound of the a in care, mare, and pare: but it may be answered, that this want of correspondence between the name of the letter, and the most frequent short sound, is common to the rest of the vowels: for the o, as heard in cot, not, rot, is not the short sound of the o in coat^r note, wrote, but of the a in water, or of the dipthongs in caught, naught, and wrought; and if we ought to call the a, ah, because its short sound corresponds to ah, for the very same reason we ought to call the o, au; and a similar alteration must take placc with the rest of the vowels. As therefore, from the variety of sounds the vowels have, it is impossible to avoid the inconvenience of sometimes sounding the letter one way in a syllable, and another way in a word, we must either adopt the simple long sound when we would pronounce the letter alone, or inveut new names for every different sound in a different word, in order to obviate the difficulty.
It must not be dissembled, however, that the sound of a, when terminating a syllable not under the accent, seems more inclined to the Irish than the English a, and that the ear is less disgusted with the sound of Ah-mer-i-cah than of A-mer-i-cay: but to this it may beanswered, that letters not under the ac-
