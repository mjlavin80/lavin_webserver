(Ej*This word, as well as Frenitis, is pronounced by Mr. Sheridan with the accent on the first syllable; in which, though he is contrary to analogy, he is consistent. But Dr. Johnson, Dr. Kenrick, and Mr. Barclay, pronounce Frenetick with the accent on the first syllable, and Phrenitis, with the accent on the second. That the penultimate accent is the true pronunciation in both can scarcely be doubted, if we consult analogy (509) ; and that it is most in use, may appear from the additional suffrages of Dr. Ash, Mr. Jfares, Mr. Scott, Mr. Perry, W. Johnston, Entick, Bailey, and Fenning.

£j* For the propriety of pronouncing the « in these words like th, we need only appeal to analogy. S before a diphthong beginning with *, and having the accent before it, either primary or secondary, always goes into zh, as may be seen, Principles, No. 451. The secondary accent on the first syllable of these words gives a feebleness to the second, which occasions the aspiration of a as much as in evasion', adhesion, &c. where the * is preceded by the primary accent.. It must, however, be acknowledged, that this is far from being the most general pronunciation.—See Ecclesxastick.
Physiognomy, flzh-i-og'no-mi. s. The art of discovering the temper and foreknowing the fortune by the features of the face ; the face, the cast of the look.
dj* There is a prevailing mispronunciation of this word, by leaving out the g, as if the word were French. If this arises from ignorance of the common rulea of spelling, it may be observed, that g is always pronounced before n when it is not in the same syllable ; as, tig-nify, indig-nity, &c.; but if affectation be the cause ofthis aprour, Dr; Young’s Love of Fame will be the best cure for it—See Pathognomonic*.
