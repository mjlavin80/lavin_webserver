Him, the Almighty Power,
“ Hurl’d headlong flaming from th* ethereal “ sky,	#
With hideous ruin and combustion, down “ To bottomless perdition, there to dwell u In adamantine chains and penal fire, u Who durst defy th' Omnipotent to arms.”
Milton.
In these examples, we see the particle the may either form a distinct syllable, or not In the third line from Pope the first the forms a distinct syllable, but the second is sunk into the succeeding; noun. The same may be observed of this particle in the first, second, and sixth lines of the passage from Milton : but what appears strange is, that though the particle the before a vowel, and shortened by an apostrophe, does not augment the number of syllables, it is really pronounced longer than where it forms a syllable, and is not thus shortened by elision. This is apparent in the third line from Pope,
K< But of the two, less dangerous is th9 of-“ fence.”
The reason why the first the, though pronounced shorter than the second, forms a syllable, and the second does not, seems to arise from the coalescence of the vowels, which, though lengthened in sound, may still be pronounced with one impulse of the breath. Thus, when a consonant follows the particle the, we find two distinct impulses, though the e is drppped ; but when a vowel follows the, the impulse on the particle slides over, as it were, to the consonant of the succeeding syllable, "without forming two distinct impulses, nearly as if *y were interposed, and the words were written th^ offence, th'Yom-nipotent, &c.
I would not, however be supposed to disapprove of the practice of eliding the e before a vowel to the eye when the verse requires it; this practice is founded on good sense ; and the first line in the passage from Milton shows the necessity of mak ing the distinction, when it is, and when it is not, to be elided; ;what 1 wish to reform is, the practice of shortening the to the car, and thus mincing and impover ishing the sound of the verSe without necessity.
