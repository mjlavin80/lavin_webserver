Dr. Johnson tells us this word is of uncertain etymology. It is certain, however, that it comes from the French;,, and Menage tells us it arose among them from the Croat*, who, being in alliance with France against the Emperor, came to Paris, and were remarked for the linen they wore about their necks. This soon became a fashion, and was called after the original wearers Croat, which, by a small alteration, became Cravat. This word is sometimes, but improperly, pronounced with the accent on the first syllable. This pronunciation is adopted only by Dr. Ash, and Buchanan, while Dr. Johnson, Mr Elphin-ston, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Nares, Mr. Scott, W. Johnston, Kenrick, Entick, and Bailey, are uniformly for the accent on the last syllable.
