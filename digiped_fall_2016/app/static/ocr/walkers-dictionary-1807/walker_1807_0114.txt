In this list the difference of the English and Latin accent is considerable. The six*last words desert tne Latin penultimate lor the English antepenultimate accent, and condAcncc fails into an accentuation diametrically opposite.

Here we find the general rule obtain, with, perhaps, fewer exceptions than in anj^other class. Adjuxate, peculate, and indurate, are the only absolute deviations ; for obdurate has the accent frequently on the second syllable. See the word.
(I) To these lists, perhaps, might be added the English words ending in turn, 8ion, and ity: for though tion and sion are really pronounced in one syllable, they are by almost all our orthoepists generally divided into two ; and consequently nation, pronunciation, occasion, evasion, 8tc. contain the same number of syllables as natio, pronunciation occash, evasio, 8cc. and have the accent in both English and Latin, on the antepenultimate syllable. The game may be observed of words ending in ity, as diversity, variety. See. from •diversitas, varietas, &C.
(m) By this selection (which, though not an exact enumeration of every particular, is yet a sufficient specimen of the correspondence of Latin and English accent), we may perceive that there is a general rule running through both languages, respecting the accent of polysyllables, which is, that when a single vowel in the penultimate is followed by a single consonant, the accent is on the antepenultim?te. This is so agreeable to English analogy, that in words derived from the Latin, where the penultimate vowel, followed by a single consonant, is long, and consequently has the accent, we almost always neglect this exception, as it may be called, in the Latin language*, and fell into our own general rule of accenting the antepenultimate. Nor is it unworthy of being remarked, that when we neglect the accent of the original* it is almost
