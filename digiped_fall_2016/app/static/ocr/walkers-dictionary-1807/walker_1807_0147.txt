Jfeemsbest to unite the compound into one Srord : bat academy being a simple, is sab-ject to no such rale, and seems naturally to ineline to a di fie rent analogy of pronunciation. Thus Dr. Johnson seems to have decided justly in saying the word academy oaght to have the accent on the first syllable; though present usage, it must be confessed, seems to lead to the contrary pronunciation-

This word is in no English Dictionary I We met with; but, conniving its formation to be perfectly agreeable to the analogy ef English adjectives, and finding it used by several very respectable authors, I have ventured to insert it. Mr.Foster.inhisEssay •a Accent and Quantity, says, “ When a “ high note succeeds a low one,or rises above " the grave tone of voice, the perception of “ it is sudden and instantaneous, before the " continuance of the note is determined one " way or the other for long or short. This ** I more clearly conceive, than I can per* haps express. I can however engage to
*	make it perceptible to a common English

Within these twenty years this word hat shifted its accent from the second to the first syllable. There are now few polite speak* ers who do not pronounce it acceptable * and it is much to be regretted that this pro* nunciation is become so general; for where consonants of so different an organ as p and t are near tbe end of a word, the word is pronounced w ith much more difficulty whe* tbe accent is removed higher than when it is arrested by these letters; for, in this case, the force which accompanies the accent facilitates the organs in their transition from the formation of the one letter to the other. As nature, therefore, directs us ta place the accent upon these consonants in all words ending in active, ective, kttve, octbe, and uctive; actible, eciible, octible, and uctibleg so we ought to listen to the same voice ia pronouncing acceptable, susceptible, corruptible, with the accent on tbe second syllable.—See Commendable.
