Advertise- C dd-ver'tlz-mdnt. ? ment,	14d-v£r-tizeWnt. J *'
Intelligence; information ; notice of any thing published in a paper of intelligence. fcF As nouns ending in ment always follow I the accentuation of the verbs from which they are formed, we frequently hear adcer-tisement taxed with the grossest irregularity for having the accent on a different syllable from advertise. The origin of this irregularity seems to have arisen from a change which has taken place in tbe pronunciation of the verb since tbe noun has been formed ; advertise and chastise were, in Shakspeare’s time, both accented on the penultimate, and therefore advertisement ami chastisement were formed regulai-ly from them.

‘‘Oh, then how quickly should this arm t'of mine,

*' And ch ustisemenl doth therefore hide its hedd?*	'	Jul. Casar.
Bat sindc that tinge the verbs advertise and chattist ha ve fallen into an analogy more agreeable to verbs of the same form—for the verbs to promise, practise, franchise, mortise, a*d divert ise, are the only words
where the termination ise has not the ac~ cent either primary or secondary; and if an alteration must be made to reconcile the pronunciation of the simple with that of the compound, we should find it much easier to change advertisement and chastisement into advertisement and chastisement, than advertise and chastise into advertise aod chastise; but the irregularity seems too inveterate to admit of any alteration.
