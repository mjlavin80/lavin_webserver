CT In pronouncing the Lord’s Prayer, we sometimes hear the participle of this word pronounced like that of the word to Hollow. This arises from not attending1 to the distinction made by syllabication between the single and double I: the double /in the same syllable deepens the a to the broadest sound, as in tall ,• but when one of the liquids is carried off*to the next syllable, the a has its short and slenderer sound, as tallow.• the same may be observed of hall and hallow, &c.—See Principles, No. 85.

(£j* A critic in the Gentleman’s Magazine gives the following etymology of this word, which we do not find in any of our Dictionaries:
•* When coaches and chariots were first introduced, our frugal ancestors used to load
t;—m£, m£t;—pine, pin
the carriage with provisions for the family when they came to London. The hamper9 covered with a cloth, was a convenient repository, and a seat for the coachman. This was afterwards converted into a box. Hammer-cloth is therefore very probably a corruption of hamper -clot h.”
If the derivation of this word were worth spending a thought upon,I should think that as the seat ol the coachman is not boarded, but slung like a hammock, the word is rather a corruption of hammock-cloth.
