ha	Different sounds of the diphthongs ob,**.
which soUnd as if written brawd, abrawd, grawt. Oatmeal is sometimes pronounced ot-meal, but seems to be recovering the long sound of o, as in oat.
OjE.
296.	Whether it be proper to retain the o in this diphthong, or to banish it from our orthography, as Dr. Johnson advises, certain it is, that in words, from the learned., languages it is always pronounced like single e1 and comes entirely under the same laws as that vowel: thus, when it ends a syllable, with the accent upon it, it is long, as in Jn-toe-ci, Peri-oe-ci: when under the secondary accent, in oec-umenicoL, occ-onomics, it is like e short: it is long e in jbe-tus, and short e in fbe-tid and assafoet-ida: in doc, foe, sloe, toe, throe, hoe (to dig), and bilboes, it is sounded exactly like long open o: in canoe and shoe, like oo, as if written canon and shoo; and in the vert) does, like short u, as if written duz.
OEI.
297.	There is but one word where this triphthong occurs, and that is in Shakspeare’s King Lear, in the word ociliads (glances), and, in my opinion* it ought to be sounded as if written e-il-yads.
oeu;
tS98. This diphthong is from the French, in the word manoeuvre; a word, within these few years, of very general Use in our language. It is not in Johnson, and the oeu is generally pronounccd by those who can pronounce French, in the French manner; but this is such a sound of die u as docs not exist in English, and therefore it cannot be described. The nearest sound is oo: with which, if this word is pronounced by an English speaker, as if written monoovre, it may, except with very nice Frcach cars, escape criticism.
or.
299.	The general, and almost universal sound of this diphthong, is that of« in water, and the first e in me-tre. This double sound is very distinguishable in boil, toil, spoil, joint, fioint, anoint, &c. which sound ought to be carefully preserved, as there is a very prevalent practice amoi^g the vulgar of dropping the o, and pronouncing these words as if written bile, tile, spile, &c.
300.	The only instance which admits of a doubt in the sound of this diphthong, when under the accent, is in the word choir; but this word is now 90 much more frequently written quire, that uniformity strongly inclines us to pronounce the oi in choir like long i, and which, by the common orthography, seems fixed beyond recovery. But it may be observed, that either the spelling or the pronunciation of Chorister, commonly pronounced QuirUter, ought to be altered. See the words.
501.	When this diphthong is not under the accent, it is variously pronounced. Dr. Kcnrick places the accent on the first syllable of turcoia, and, for I know not what reason, pronounces it as if written turkiz ; and turkois with the 9i broad, as in boys. Mr. Sheridan places the accent on the second syllable, and gives the diphthong the French sound as if the word was written turkaze. In my opinion the best orthography is turquoise, and the best pronunciation with The accent on the last syllable, and the oi sounded like long r, as if written tvr-
