It is a scandal to seminaries of learning that the latter pronunciation of this word should prevail there. Those who ought to be the guardians of propriety are often the perveiteis of it. Hence Accidence for Accidents, Prepostor for Prepositor, and Con-stur for Construe ; for it must be carefully noted, that this last word is under a different predicament fiom those which end with r and mute e: heie the vowel u must have its long sound, as in the word true ; this letter cannot be sunk or transposed like e in Centre, Sceptre, &c.
