gj* The .vowel w, in the first syUable of this and similar words, forms a remarkable exception to the shortening power of the antepenultimate and secondary accent; any other vowel but u, unless followed by a diphthong, would have been short. This arises from no regard to the Latin quantity in the word Muculentus, for the u in Culinary and Mutilate, &c. is long in English, though short in the Latin Culi-narius, Mutilo, 8cc. So that the long u in this and similar words is an idiom of our own pronunciation. (508) (511) (530).

dj6* It is highly probable that this word it a corruption of Murky, which Johnson and other writers explain by dark, cloudy, &c.; but Skinner tells us it is used in Lincolnshire to signify darkness, accompanied by heat; and as this temperament of the weather is commonly accompanied by moisture, the word is generally used to signify a dark, close, warm, and moist state of the air. As this word is not very legitimately derived, it is seldom heard among the learned and polite; but as it affords us a new complex idea, and is in much use among the middle ranks oflife, it seems not unworthy of being adopted.
