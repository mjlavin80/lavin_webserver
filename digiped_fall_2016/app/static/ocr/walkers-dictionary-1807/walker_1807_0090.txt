lxxxiv PRONUNCIATION OF THE CONSONANTS GH, Sec.
reason I can conceive, sinks the g in the last word. When these letters end a syllable not under the accent, the g is silent, but the preceding rowel is shortened : thusfioa adigm, pa rapegm, diaphragm, afiofihthegm, are pronounced ftaradim, parapem, diaphram, apothem.
GH.	.
390.	This combination, at the beginning of a word, drops the h, as in ghost, ghastly, aghast, gherkin, pronouncedgwf,.rhyming with mo8t,gastly,agast, gurrkin ; but when these letters come at the end of a word, they form some of the greatest anomalies in our language; gh, at the end of words, is generally silent, and consequently the preceding vowel or diphthong is long, as high, nigh, tlngh, neigh, weigh, inveigh, eugh (the obsolete way of spelling yew, a tree), bough, doughy though, although, clough (a cliff), pi ugh, furlough, slough (a miry place), through, throughout, thorough, borough, usqut baxigh,pugh !
391.	GH is frequently pronounced like f as laugh, laughter, cough, chough, dough (an allowance in weight), slough (the cast skin of a snake or sore), enough, rough, tough trough.
392.	Gh is sometimes changed into ck, as hough, shough, lough, pronounced hock, shock, lock; sometimes we hear only the g sounded, as in burgh, burgher, and burgher ship.
GHT.
393.	Gh in this termination is always silent, as fight, night, bdught, fought, &c. The only exception is d'aught ; which, in poetry, is most frequently rhymed with caught, taught, &c.; but in prose, is so universally pronounced as it written drafu that the poetical sound of it grows uncouth, and is becoming obsolete. Draughts, the game, is also pronounced drafts. Drought, (dryness) is vulgarly pronounccd drowth: it is even written so by Milton ; but in this he is not to be imitated, having mistaken the analogy of this word, as well as that of height, which he^pells hrighih^ and which is frequently do pronounced by the vulgar See the words Height and Drought.
H' *
394.	This letter is no more than breathing forcibly before the succceding vowel is pronounced. At the beginning of words, it is always sounded, except in heir, hdress, honest, honesty, honour, honourable, herb, herbage, hospital, hostler, hour, humble, Immour, humorous, humorsome. Ben Johnson leaves out the h in host, and classes it in this respect with honest.
395.	H is always silent after r, as rhetoric, rhapsody, rheum,rheumatism, rhinoceros, rhomb, rhubarb, myrrh, catairh, and their compounds,
396.	//final, preceded by a vowal, is always silent, as ah ! hah I oh! foh! sir* rah, hallelujah, Mrun ah.
307.	This letter is often sunk after w, particularly in the capital, where we
*	do not find the least distinction of sound between while and wile, whet and where and wear. Trifling as this difference may appear at first sight, it tends great iy to weaken and impoverish the pronunciation, as well as sometimes to confound words of a very different meaning. The Saxons, as Dr. Lowth observes. placed the h before the as hwat; and this is certainly its true place; for in the pronunciation of all words beginning with wh, we ought to breathe t
