Ixsx PRONUNCIATION OF THE CONSONANTS D, F.
$ealed, screened, clcaned, and reeled; but custom has not only annexed t to the prete -Tit of these verbs, but has changed the long diphthongal sound into a short one ; they are therefore doubly irregular. Weep, sleep. and creep, would not have required t to form their preterits, any more than /leeficd, and steeped; but custom, which has shortened the diphthong in the former words, very naturally annexed t as the simplest method of conveying the sound.	'
371.	The only two words which occasion some doubt about classing them are, to learn and to spell. The vulgar (who are no contemptible guides on this occasion) pronounce them in the preterit learnt and spelt: but as n and I will readily admit of d after them, it seems more correct to favour a tendency to .regularity, both in writing and speaking, which the literary world has given into, by spelling them learned and speked, and pronouncing them learn*d and tspell’d: thus earned, the preterit of to earn, has been recovered from the vulgar earns, and made a perfect rhyme to discerned.
372.	To these observations may be added, that, in such irregular verbs as have the present, the preterit and participle the same* as cau, cost, cut, Scc^the second person singular of the preterit of these verbs take ed before the eat, as
I	cast, or did cast; Thou castedst, or didst cast, &c. for if this were not the case, the second person of the preterit might be mistaken for the second person of ihe present tense.
373.	I have been led insensibly to these observations by their connexion with ' pronunciation; and if the reader should think them too remote from the subject, I must beg his pardon, and resume my remarks on the sound of the letter d.
374.	The vulgar drop this letter in ordinary, and extraordinary: and make them or'*nary and cxtr'or'nan/; but this is a gross abbreviation; the best pronunciation is sufficiently short, wliich is ordinary and extr'o^d*nary: the first in three and the lost in four syllables : but solemn speaking preserves the /, and makes the hitter word consist of five syllables, as if written extr*ordinary.
375.	Our ancestors, feeling the necessity of showing the quantity of a vowel followed by ge, when it was to be short, inserted d, as wedge, ridge, badge*, Sec. The same reason induced them to write eolledge and alledge, with the d; but modern reformers, to the great injury of the language, have expelled the d, and left the vowel to shift for itself; because there is no d in the Latin words from which these are derived.
376.	U iike t, to which it is so nearly related, when it comes after the accent, and is followed by the diphthong ie, io, ia, or eon, slides into gzh, or the consonant/; thus soldier is universally and justly pronounced as if written scl~ jer; grawkur, g>'an-j-ir'; and vt'rdure (where it must be remembered that u is a diphthong), ture: and for the same reason, education is elegantly pronounced eu*j:icu(i<*n. I>ut dub' and r-dure. pronounced juke and re-juce, where the acccnt is after the d, cannot l>e too much reprobated.
F.
377.	F h is Us pure sound in often, off, Slc. but, in the preposition of, slides inf*) its new relation 7*, as if written ov. But when this preposition is in composition at the end of a wmxU the/becomes pure; thus, though we sound of singly Vs wc pronounce it as if the./* were double in where-f
378.	There is a strong tendency to change the /*into t* in some words wluch confounds the ^lural nu and the genitive case : thus we often hear of a a wiv"' ; jointure, a cube's head, and houze rent, for wife'* jointure, a calf s head, and house rent.
