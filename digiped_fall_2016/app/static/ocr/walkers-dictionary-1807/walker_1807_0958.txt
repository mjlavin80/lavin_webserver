(£j* Mr. Sheridan is the only orthoepist who has accented this word on the first syllable, as I have done ; for Dr. Johnson, Dr. Ash, Dr. Kenrick, Barclay, Fenning, Bailey, and Entick, accent the second. Its companion, Desultory, is accented on the first syllable by Mr. Sheridan, Dr. Johnson, Mr. Nares, Mr. Smith, and Fencing ; but on the second by Dr. Ash, Dr. Kenrick, Mr. Scott, W. Johnston, Mr. Perry, Buchanan, Bailey, and Entick. As these two words must necessarily be accented alike, we see Dr. Johnson and Fenning are inconsistent. But though the majority of authorities are against me in both these words, I greatly mistake ifanalogy is not clearly on my side. See Principles, No. 512.

That the first sense should extend itself to the latter, is not to be wondered at, as words have a tendency to fall into a bad sense ; witness knave, villain, &.c.; but if custom has marked this dificrencc of sense by a difference of spelling and pronunciation, it should seem to be an effort of nature to preserve precision in our ideas. If these observations are just, the abstracts of these words ought to be kept as distinct as their concretes; from	ougbt
to be formed subtilty, and from subtle, subtlety i the b being heard in the two first, and mute in the two last Subtlety, sflt/tl-t£. s. Artfulness, cunning.
