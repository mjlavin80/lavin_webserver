lie scattered without bounds, a learner is bewildered and discouraged from attempting to distinguish them; but when they are all classed, arranged, and enumerated, the variety seems less, the number smaller, and the distinction easier. What an inextricable labyrinth do the dipthongs * a and ou form as they lie loose in the language! but classed and arranged as we find them, No. 226, kc. and 313, See. the confusion vanishes, they become much less formidable, and a learner has it in his power, by repeating them daily, to becomc master of them all in a very little time.
The English accent is often an unsurmountable obstacle to foreigners, as the rules for it are so various, and the exceptions so numerous; but let the inspector consult the article Accent in the Principles, particularly No. 492, 505, 506, he. and he will soon perceive how much of our language is regularly accented, and how much that which is irregular is facilitated by an enumeration of the greater number of exceptions.
But scarcely any method will be 90 useful for gaining the English accent asr the reading of verse. This will naturally lead the ear to the right accentuation ; and though a different position of the accent is frequently to be met with in the beginning of a verse, there is a sufficient regularity to render the pronouncing of verse a powerful means of obtaining such a distinction of force and feebleness as is commonly called the accent: for it may be observed, that a foreigner is no less distinguishable by placing an accent upon certain words to which the English give no stress, than by placing the stress upon a wrong syl-labie. Thus if a foreigner, when he calls for bread at table, by saying, give me bowte bread, lays an equal stress upon every word, though every word should be pronounced with its exact sound, we immediately perceive he is not a native. An Englishman would pronounce these four words like two, with the accent on the first syllable of the first, and on the last syllable of the last, as if written gweme *omebrM ; or rather gwme nanbrtd; or more commonly, though vulgarly, gimme tomrbrfd. Verse may sometimes induce a foreigner, as it does sometimes injudicious natives,-to lay the accent on a syllable in long words which ought to have none, as in a couplet of Pope's Essay on Criticism:
“ False eloquence, like the prismatic glass,
u It* gaudy colours spreads on every place.’*
Here a foreigner would be apt to place an accent on the last syllable of eloquence as well as the first, which would be certainly wrong; but this fault is so trifling, when compared with that of laying the accent on the second syllable, that it almost vanishes from observation; and this misaccentuation, verse will generally guard him from. The reading of verse, therefore, will, if I am not mistaken, be found a powerful regulator, both of accent and emphasis.
