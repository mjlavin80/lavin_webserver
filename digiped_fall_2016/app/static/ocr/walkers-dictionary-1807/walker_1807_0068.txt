httl DIFFERENT SOUNDS OF THE DIPHTHONGS AW, &c.
JW.
\
219.	Has the long broad sound of a in ball, with which the word bawl is perfectly identical. It is always regular.
AY.
220.	This diphthong, like its near relation ai, has the sound of slender a in flay, day, &c. and is pronounced like long c in the word •;uay, which is now sometimes seen written key; for if We cannot bring the pronunciation to the spelling, it is looked upon as some improvement to bring the spelling to the pronunciation: a most pernicious practice in language. See Bowl.
221.	To flay, to strip off the skin, also, is. corruptly pronounced flea ; but the diphthong in this word seems to be recovering its rights.
222 There is a wanton departure from analogy in orthography, by changing the y in this diphthong to i in the words pa:d, said, laid, for payed, sayed, and layed. Why these words should be written with i and thus contracted, and played, prayed, and delayed, remain at large, let our wise correctors of orthography determine. Stayed also, a participial adjective singnifying shady, is almost always written stcdd.
223.	When ay comes immediately after the accent in a final syllable, like d, it drops the former vowel in the colloquial pronunciation of the days of the week. Thus as we pronounce captain, curtain, &c. as if written eaptin, curtin, See. so we hear Sunday, Monday, &c. as if written Sundy, Mundy, 8cc. A more distinct pronunciation of day, in these words, is a mark of the northern dialect. (208).
224.	The familiar assent ay for yes, is a combination of the long Italian a in the last syllable of papa, and the first sound of <*. If we give the a the sound of that letter in ball, the word degenerates into a coarse rustic pronunciation. Though in the House of Commons, where this word is made a noun, we frequently, but not correctly, hear it so pronounced, in the phrase the Ayes have it.
AYE.
225.	This triphthong is a combination of the slender sound of a, heard in pa-per, and the e in me-tre. The word which it composes, signify big ever, is almost obsolete.
EA.
226.	The regular sound of this diphthong is that of the first sound of e in here\ but its irregular sound of short e is so frequent, us to make a catalogue of both necessary; especially for those who are unsettled in the pronunciation of the capital, and wish to practise in order to form a habit.
227.	The first sound of ea is like open r, and is heal'd in the following words: Afcard, afftar, anneal, appeal, appear, appease, aread, at rear, beacon, beadle, bead• roll, beads, beadsman, beagle, beak, beaker, beam, bean, beard, bearded, beast, beat, beatm, beaver, bel‘%aguer, beneath, bequeath, bereave, besmear, bespeak bleach, bleak, blear, bleat, bohca, breach, bream, to breathe, ccftse, cheap, ch at, clean, clean• ly (adverb), clear, clearance, cleave, cochineal, colleague, conceal, congeal, cream, creak, crease, creature, deacon, deal, dean, deanery, dear, decease, defeasance, defeasible, defeat, demean, demeanor, decrease, dream, drear, dreartt, each, eager, eagle, eagre, car, east, caster, easy, to eat, eaten, eaves, entreat, endear, escheat,
