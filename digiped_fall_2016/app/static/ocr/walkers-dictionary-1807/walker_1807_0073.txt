DIFFERENT SOUNDS OF THE DIPHTHONGS EW, See. fcvu
EW.
265.	This diphthong is pronounced like long u, and is almost always regular. There is a corrupt pronunciation of it like oo chiefly in London, where we sometimes hear dew and new pronounced as if written doo and noo ; but when r precedes this diphthong, as in brew, crew, drew, fee. pronouncing it like oo, is scarcely improper. See 176, 339.
266.	Shew and strew have almost left this class, and by Johnson’s recommendation are become show and straw, as they are pronounced. The proper name Shrewsbury, however, still retains the e, though always pronounced Shrewsbury. Sew, with a needle, always rhymes with no ; and sewer, signifying a drain, is generally pronounced shore: but sewer, an officer, rhymes with fewer. See 'Sewer.
267.	Ew is sometimes pronounced like aw in the verb to chew ; but this is gross and vulgar. To chew ought always to rhyme with new, view, &c.
EWE.
266. This triphthong exists only in the word ewe, a female sheep; which is pronounced exactly like yew, a tree, or the plural personal pronoun you. There is a vulgar pronunciation of this word as if written yoe, rhyming with doe, which must be carefully avoided. See the word.
EY.
869. When the accent is on this diphthong, it is always pronounced like ay, er like its kindred diphthong ei, in vein, reign, &c.: thus bey, dey, grey, prey, they, trey, whey, obey, convey, purvey, survey, hey, eyre, and eyrey, are always heard as if written bay, day, See. Key and ley are the only exceptions, which always rhyme with sea. (220).
270.	Ey, when unaccented, is pronounced like ee : thus galley, valley, alley,
barely, &c. are pronounced as if written gallee, vallee, See. The noun survey, therefore, if we place the accent on the first syllable, is anomalous. See the word.	-
EYE.
271.	This triphthong is only found in the word eye, which is always pronounced like the letter L
IA.
272.	This diphthong, in the terminations ran, ial, iard, and iate, forms but one
syllable, though the i in this situation, having the squeezed sound of perfectly similar to y, gives the syllable a double sound, very distinguishable in its nature from a syllable formed without the i: thus Christian, filial, poniard, conciliate, sound as if written Christ-yan, fil-yal, Jum-yard, conciliate* and have in the last syllable an evident mixture of the sound of y consonant- (113).	^
273.	In diamond, these vowels are properly no diphthong; and in prose, the word ought to have three distinct syllables; but we frequently hear it so pronounced as to drop the a entirely, and as if written dimontL This, however, ia a corruption that ought to be avoided.
