As this word, when it signifies a rank or row, is universally pronounced like tetir a drop from the eye, it ought always to be written tier ; which would prevent a gross irregularity. This is the more to be wished, not only as its derivation from the old French tiere seems to require this spelling, but to distinguish it from the word tiered head-dress; which probably,being a corruption either of the word tiara, an ornament for the head, or of the English word attire, ought to be written and pronounced like the .word tire, to fatigue. Dr. Kenrick is the only orthoepist who has attended to this distinction.---See Bowl.
