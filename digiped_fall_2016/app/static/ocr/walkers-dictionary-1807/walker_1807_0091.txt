PRONUNCIATION OF THE CONSONANTS J, K, L. lxxxv
forcibly before we pronounce the w, as if the words were written hoo*at, hoodie, fcc. and then we shall avoid that feeble, cockney pronunciation, which is so disagreeable to a correct ear.
J.
393.	J is pronounced exactly like soft g, and is perfectly uniform in its sound, except in the word hallelujah, where it is pronounced like y.
K.
399.	JThas exactly the sound of hard c: it is always silent before n in the
same syllable, as knee, kneel, knack, knight, know, knuckle, knab, knag, knap, knare, knave, knit, knock, knot, knoll.	-
400.	It has been a custom within these twenty years to omit the k at the end of words when preceded by c. This has introduced a novelty into the language, which is that of ending a word with an unusual letter, and is not only a blemish in the face of it, but may possibly produce some irregularity in futurf fbrmatives: for mimicking must be written with the k, though to mimic is without k. If we use colic as a verb, which is not uncommon, we must write colicking and coticked; and thoughphysicking and physicked are not the most elegant words, they are not quite out of the line of formation. This omission of k is, however, too general to be counteracted, even bv.the authority of Johnson: but it is to be Imped it will be confined to words from the learned languages: and indeed, as there is not the same vanity of appearing learned in the Saxon as in the Latin and Greek, there is no great fear that thick and stick will lose their k, though they never had it in the original.
401.	Ben Johnson says L melteth in the sounding, and is therefore called a liquid. This, however, cannot be the reason that r is called a liquid: for no two letters can, in this respect, be more opposite. See No. 21.
L is mute in alnumd, calf, half, calve, halve, chaldron, falcon, folk, yolk (better written yelk with the I sound ed), fulfil, halser, malmsey, salmon, salve, talbot (a species of dog). See Salve.
402.	L is mute also between a and k in the same syllable, as balk, chalk, talkf stalk, walk.
403.	L is silent likewise between a and m in the same syllable, as alms, balm, coim, fialm, psalm, qualm, shatm ; but when the in i& detached from the I by commencing another syllable, the I becomes audible. Thus, though the / is mute in fisaim, it is always heard in psal-mist, psal-ntody, and pal-mistry ; but in balmy and palmy, where the y is an adjective termination of our own, no alteration is made in the sound of the substantive which sinks the /. (386.) Calmer and calmest ought to have the / mute, as they are only degrees of comparison; and palmer and palmervform (except in the language of scripture, where the / in palmeraorm ought to be heard), are only a sort of verbal nouns, which never alter the sound of the original word, and therefore ought to have the I mute. But though I is sometimes mute in the noun salve, and in the verb to salve, it is always heard in salver (a kind of plate). See Salve.
404.	L ought always to be suppressed in the auxiliary verbs would, could should: it is sometimes suppressed in fault; but this suppression is become vulgar, (see
