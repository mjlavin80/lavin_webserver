the word). In soldier, likewise, the / is sometimes suppressed, and the word pronounced so*jer; but this is far from being the most correct pronunciation : / ought always to be heard in this word, and its compounds soldierly, soldicrs/ii/i, &c.	*	.
405.	Ly preceded by a mute, and followed by e, in a final syllable, has an imperfect sound, which does not do much honour to our language. The /, in this situation, is neither sounded like cl nor le, but the e final is suppressed, and the preceding mute articulates the /, without either a preceding or a succeeding vowel; so that this sound may be called a monster in Grammar—a syllable without a vowel 1 This will easily be perceived in the w^ds able, table, circle, &c. which are pronounced as if written abl, tabl, circl, See. and in those sdll more Gothick and uncouth abbreviated participial terminations, peopled, bridled, saddled^ trifles, gaffes, &c, pronounced pec-fifd, bri-dl'd, tad-dCd, tri-jlz, gaf-jlz, &c. (359) (472).
406.	This letter has not only, like / and s, the privilege of doubling itself at the end of a word, but it has an exclusive privilege of being double where they remain single; though by what right cannot well be conceived. Thus, according to the general rule, when a verb ends in a single consonant, preceded by a single vowel, and the accent is on the last syllable, the consonant is doubled when apardcipial termination is added, ns,abet, abetting, beg, begging, begin, beginning» See. but when the accent is not on the last syllable of the verb, the consonant remains single, as suffered) suffering, ben efiting, Sec. but the I is doubled, whether the accent be on the last syllable or not, as duelling, levelling, victualling, travelling, traveller, Sec. This gross irregularity, however, would not have been taken nodce of in this place, if it had not suggested an absurdity in pronunciadon, occasioned by the omission of /. Though the latter / is useless in traveller, victualler, Sec. it is not so in controller: for as 11 is a mark of the deep broad sound of a in ball, tally all, See. (84); so the same letters are the sign of the long open sound of o in boll (a round stalk of a plant), to joll, noli (the head), knoll (a litde hill), poll, clodpoll, roll, scroll, droll, trolly stroll, toll: for which reason, leaving out one / in bethraU catcal, misca!, overfal, forestal, reinstal, downfal, withal, control, and unrol, as we find them in Johnson's Dictionary, is an omission of die utmost importance to the sound of the words; for as die pronunciadon sometimes alters the spelling, so the spelling sometimes alters the pronunciadon*. Accordingly we find some speakers, chiefly the natives of Ireland, inclined to give the a its middle sound, to words commencing with al, followed \yy another consonant, because they do not see the U in the all with which these words are compounded: thus we sometimes hear Almighty,-albeit, so pronounced as to make their first
, syllable rhyme with the first of al-ley, vaNetj ; and extol is pronounced by the ^ 'Scotch so as to rhyme with coal; and with just as much reason as we pronounce control in the same manners For though compounds may, in some cases, be allowed to drop such letters of their sitnples, as either are not necessary to the sound, as in Christmas ; or might possibly lead to a wrop.3 one, as in Reconcile* able (which see) ? yet where, by omitting a letter, die sound may be altered, the omission is pernicious and absurd. (84). The same observations, might be ex* tended to the numerous termination/w//, where, in compounds, one / is omitted, though nothing can be more certain, diait diat/a/, with a single I, has not the same sound as when this letter is doubled; for who could suppose, without be-
