ACCENT ON POLYSYLLABLES.
always to place it at least a syllable higher; as adjacent and condolence are the aniy words in the whole selection, where the accent of the English word is pkced lower th*n in the Latin.
(n) There is, indeed, a remarkable coincidence of accent between Latin verbs'of three syllables commencing with a preposition, and the English words of two syllables, derived from them, by dropping a syllable,* as excedo, rebello, tngmroj cotftno, confuto,consumedesiro, expioro,procedo,proclamo, have the accent in Latin (Hi the second syllable; and the English verbs excel, rebel, inquire, eonfi.e, confute, consume, desire^ explore, proceed\ proclaim, have ^he accent cm the same syllable. This propensity of following the Latin accent in these words, perhaps, in this, as well as in other cases, formed a general rule, which at last, neglected the Latin accent, in words of this kind; as we find prefer, confer, defer, desert, ccmpare, complete, congeal, divide, dispute, prepare, have the accent on the second syllable, though prqfbro, defero, confero, desero, comparo, compleo, congtlo, divido, dispute, preparo, have the accent on the first; and this propensityi perhaps, laid the foundation of that distinction of accent which is so remarkable between dissyllable nouns and verbs of the same form. (492).
(o) But when English polysyllables are derived from the Latin by dropping a syllable, scarcely any analogy is more apparent than the coincidence of the principal accent of the English word, and the secondary accent (522), we give to the Latin word, in the English pronunciation of it. Thus parsimony, ceremony, matrimony, melancholy, See. have the accent on the first syllable, because, in pronouncing the Latin words parsimonia, cxremonia, matritnonia, melancholia, kc. we are permitted, and prone in our English pronunciation of these words, to place a secondary accent on that syllable. See Ac AnEMy, Irreparable, tcc.
(ft) With respect to the quantity of the antepenultimate syllable in polysyllables, it may be observed, that, regardless of the quantity of the original, we almost, without exception, follow the analogy of our own language. This analogy uniformly shortens the vowel, unless it be u, followed by a single con-son<att, or any other vowel, followed by a single consonant, succeeded by a semi-consonant diphthong: thus the first u in dubious is pronounced long, though *hort in the Latin word dubtus: the same may be observed of the e and o in 7w£-dium and emporium ; and the first i in delirium, and the first e in delicate, are pronounced short in English, according to our own analogy, (507), though these letters are long in the Latin delirium and del? cat us. For the quantity of English dissyllables derived from the Greek and Latin, See Syllabication, No. 543. 544, See.
.	Terminational Accent.
504.	We have seen that the Saxon terminations, regardless of harmony, always leave the accent where they found it, let the adventitious syllables be ever so numerous. The Saxons, attentive chiefly to sense, preserved the same simplicity in the accentuation, as in the composition of their words; and if sense yere the only object of language, it must be confessed, that our ancestors were, in this respect, superior to‘ the Greeks and Romans. What method could so
„ *	Jonson seem« to have had a faint idea of this coincidence, where he says, “ all verbs
«i	fr°m *be Latin, either of the supine or otherwise, hold the accent as it is found in the
“ fir»t person present of those Latin verbs, as dnimo, Animate, cHebro, celebrate; except words ** compounded offaeio, as liqur-facio, iq'tefy; and of stabto, as constit/o, constitute.” JSnglisk jraauBtr. Of the extent and justness oC these observations, the critical reader will be the judfe.
