€t Something, whose truth, convinc’d at " si^ht 3ye find,
€€ That gives us back the image of our mind.” Here we find the a so obscured so as to approach nearlyto short u; and, without any perceptible difference in the sound, the word might be written thut.

OCj* What has been observed of tbe pronunciation of this word, when a relative pronoun, is perfectly applicable to it when a conjunction: in either case it never has the accent, and necessarily goes into an obscure sound like short 11. Thus in tlie following passage from Pope’s Essay on Criticism :
€€ The vulgar thus through imitation err:
** As oft’ tne If arn\l, by being singular:
** So much they scorn tlie crowd, that if the <c throng
** By chance go right, they purposely go “ wrong.”
Here the conjunction that is pronounced with exactly the same degree of obscurity as when a relative pronoun.
The word that, by being sometimes a demonstrative pronoun, sometimes a relative, and sometimes a conjunction, may produce a quadruple repetition of the same word, which,though not elegant, is strictly grammatical; a repetition which is, perhaps, peculiar to the English language.— This is humorously exemplified by Mr. Steele in the Spectator, No. 80, in tlie just remonstrance of affronted that, where he brings in this word, declaring, how useful it had been to a great orator, who, in a speech to the Lords, had said, “ My Lords, with humble submission, “ that that I say, is ; that that that that ** gentleman has advanced is not that that “ lie should have proved to your Lord** ships.” In the pronunciation of this passage, it is plain that the word that which is not printed in Italicks, is pro* nounced nearly as if written thut. 1 am sensible of the delicacy of the obscure sound of this a, and therefore do not offer « as a perfect equivalent, but as the nearest approach to it, and as the means of pointing out the power of the accent and “ its importance in ascertaining the sense ; for if all these words were pronounced equally distinct, it is plain the sense would be obscured: and so liable are the relative, tlie conjunctive, and the demonstrative, to be confounded, that some writers have dis-
tinguished the latter by printing it in Italicks. Those who wish to see the most profound and ingenious investigation of the grammatical origin of these words, must consult Horne Tooke’s Diversions of Pur Icy.

The, th£, or th£. art. (466). The article noting a particular tiling: before a vowel, E is commonly cut off in verse.
33* Mr. Sheridan has given us these two modes of pronouncing this word, but has not told us when we are to use one, and when the, other. To supply this deficiency, therefore, it may be observed, that when the is prefixed to a word beginning with a consonant, it has a short sound, little more than the sound of th without the e ; and when it precedes a word beginning with a vowel, tlie e is sounded plainly and distinctly. This difference will be perceptible by comparing the pen, the hand, &c. with the oil, the air, &c.; or the difference of this word before ancients and moderns in the following Couplet of Pope.
“ Some foreign writers, some our own de* ** spise;
" The ancients only, or the modems prize.”
A very imperfect way of pronouncing this word very frequently arises in verse, where the poet, for the preservation of tlie metre, cuts offe by an apostrophe, and unites the article to the following word. This pronunciation depraves the sound of the verse without necessity, as the syllable, formed by e is so short as to admit of being sounded with the preceding syllable, so as not to increase tlie number of syllables to the ear, or to hurt the melody.
“ ’Tis hard to say if greater want of skill
u Appear in writing or in judging ill:
“ But of the two, less dung’rous is th* offence
“ To tire our paticnce, tlian mislead our “ sense.”	P0??'
