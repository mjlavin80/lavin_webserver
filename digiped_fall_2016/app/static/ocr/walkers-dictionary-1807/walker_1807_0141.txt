cant, in a thousand instances deviate from their true sound ; that the vowel a, like several other vowels in a final syllable not accented , has an obscure sound, borderiugon %; but if the a, in this situation, were pronounced ever so distinctly, and that this pronunciation were clearly the a in father, it would be nothing to the purpose: wben the c is pronounced alone, it may be said not only to be a letter, but a distinct character, and a noun substantive; and, as such, has tbe same force as the letters in an accented syllable. Tbe letter a, therefore, as the first character in tbe alphabet, may always be said to have tbe accent, and ought to have tbe same long, open sound, as is given to that letter when accented in a syllable, and aot influenced in its sound by any preceding or succeeding consonant.
We may therefore conclude, that if all Towels, wben pronounced alone, are accented and long, if spelling be the pronunciation of letters alone, (as it would be absurd to suppose ourselves acquainted with the d ifferent consonants that determine the sound of the vowels before they are pronounced,) it follows, that in spelling, or repeating tbe com’ poneat parts of a word, we ought to give those parts their simple and uncombined sound: but there is no uncombined sound of the vowel a, except tbe sleuder sound contended for, unless in tbe words father and master ; and therefore, when we repeat letters singly, in order to declare the sound of a word, we most undoubtedly give the first letter of the alphabet the sound we ever give it in the first syllable of the numerous class la-dy, pa-gan, tfia-son, b*~son, &c.
Thus, after placing every objection in its strongest light, and deducing our arguments from the simplest and clearest principles, this importantquestionseems at last decided in favour of the English; who, independent of the arguments in their favour, may be presumed to have a natural right to determine the name of the letter in question, though it has been so oftenlitigated by their formidable and learned, though junior relations. For though, hi some cases, the natives of Ireland and Scotland adhere rather more closely to analogy than the English themselves, yet in this we find the English pronounce perfectly agreeable to rule; and that the sleuder pronunciation of the letter a, as they pronounce it in the alphabet, is no mpre than giving it t)iat simple sound, it ever has, when unconnected with vowels or consonants that alter its power.
