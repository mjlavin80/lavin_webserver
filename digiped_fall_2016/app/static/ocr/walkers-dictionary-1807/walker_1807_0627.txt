Cj* Mr. Sheridan has marked the e in the 6rst syllable of this word long, without even the flimsy plea of Latin quantity' to support it. Mr. Perry, Entick, and Dr. Ash, are the only other orthbepists from whom we can gather the pronunciation of this letter. The two first are for thershort sound, and the last for the long one.
