As there is sometimes an erroneous pronunciation of this word by making the * short, as in the first syllable of idiot 9 I Jiave thought it necessary here to quote the authorities for pronouncing it long, as in idle; namely, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Scott, Mr. Perry, Buchanan, and Entick; Dr. Ash, Barclay, and Fenning, do not distinguish it by the position of the accent from the i in idiot; and Dr. Kenrick, as is usual with him when any thing difficult occurs, does not mark it, or divide it into syllables. But the authorities I have produced are sufficient to vindicate the lon^ sound of i9 without recurring to the diphthong in H^vXXiovy as the Greek and Latin quantity are very uncertain and fallacious guides to the quantiiy of English words. See Principles, No/544, 545, &c.
