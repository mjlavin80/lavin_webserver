DIFFERENT SOUNDS OF THE LETTER h
his Grammar, page 4: and it is highly probable that the simple shire acquired this slender sound from its tendency to become slender in the compounds, where it is at a distance from the accent, and where all the vowels have a natural tendency to become short and obscure. See Shi he.
107.	The short sound of this letter is heard in him, thin, See. and when ending an unaccented syllable, as van-i-ty, qual-i-ty, See. where, though it cannot be properly said to be short, as it is not closed by a consonant, yet it has but half its diphthongal sound. This sound is the sound of e, the last letter of the diphthong that forms the long I; and it is not ajittle surprising that Dr. Johnson should say that the short i was a sound wholly different from the long one. (551).
108.	When tlus letter is succeeded by r, and another consonant notin a final syllable, it has exactly the sound of e in vermin, vernal, &c. as virtue, virgin, &c. which approaches to the sound of short u; but when it comes before r, followed by another consonant in a final syllable, it acquires the sound of u exactly, as &>:/, dirt, shirt, squirt, etc. Mirth, birth, gird, girt, .skirt, girl, whirl, and fain, are the only exceptions to this rule, where i is pronounced lik$ e, and as if the words were written, nurth, berth, and ferm.
109.	The letter r, in this case, seems to have the same influence on this vowel, as it evidently has on a and o. When these vowels come before double r, or single r, followed by a vowel, as in arable, carry, marry, orator, horrid, forage, &c. they are considerably shorter than when the r is the final letter of the word, or when it is succeeded by another consonant, as in arbour, car, mar, or, nor, for. In the same manner the i, coming before either double r, or single r, followed by a vowel, preserves its pure, short sound, as in irritate, rfiirit, conspiracy, See.; but when r is followed by another consonant, or is the final letter of a word with the accent upon it, the i goes into a deeper and broader sound, equivalent to short e, as heard in virgin, virtue,
So fir, a tree, is perfectly similar to the first syllable of ferment, though often corruptly pronounced like fur, a skin. Sir and stir are exactly pronounced as if written Sur and stur. It seems, says Mr. Nares, that our ancestors distinguished these sounds more correctly. Bishop Gardiner, in his first letter to Cheke, mentions a witticism of Nicholas Rowley, a fellow Cantab with hinv, to this effect: “ Let handsome girls be called virgins, plain ones vurgins”
** Si pulchra est, virgo, sin turpis, vvr *o vucetur.”
Which, says Mr. Elphinston, may be modernized by the aid of a far more celebrated line :
“ Sweet virgin can alone the fuir press,
“ Fmr by iL”recs, and .'>■ <. ut.Jnilij Ins .•
“ But let tlir hoyden, homely, rou^h-hewn vur^h,
Engross the homage ot a	Xtirgeon.”
i 10. The sound of U in this situation, ought to be the more carefully attended to, as letting it fall into the sound of u, where it should have the sound o? f, has a grossness in it approaching to vulgarity. Perhaps the only exception to tliis rule is, when the succeeding vowel is u ; lbr this letter being a serai-consonant,	has some influence on the preceding /, though	not	so much	as
a perfect consonant would have. This makes Mr. Sheridan’s pronunciation	of
the i in virulent and its compounds, like that in virgin, less exceptionable than I at first thought it; but since we cannot give a semi-sound of short / to correspond to the semi-consonant sound of u, I have preferred the puip sound
