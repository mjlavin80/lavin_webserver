|ry In judging of the propriety of this pronunciation, we must not confound the participles impugning, impugned, and t he verbal noun impugner, with such words as we do not form ourselves, as, repugnant,'m«-lirnant, 8cc. The former are mere branches ofthe verb impugn, and therefore no alteration in the root; the latter we receive already fonnedfrom the Latin or ;he French, and pronounce the g as we do in signify and signet, though ii is lUent in signed, signing, or signer. For it iwuifi be carefully observed, that the analogy oi pronunciation admits of no alteration in the sound of the verb, upon its toeing forme d info a participle or verbal noun; nor in the sound ofthe adjective, upon its acquiring . a comparative or superlitfive termination.
