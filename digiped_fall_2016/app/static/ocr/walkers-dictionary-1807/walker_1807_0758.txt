I must retract my former pronunciation of the first syllable of this word with Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Peny, and join Dr. Kenrick and Mr. Scott, who make the e long. In all words of this form we ought * to incline to this pronunciation, frbm its being so agreeable to analogy. Letjt not be pretended that the e in the Latin peta-lum is short; so is the a in labellunv, and the i in libeltus, which yet in the English label and Ubel we pronounce long. But however right the long sound of t may be by analogy, I am apprehensive that, as in Pedal*, the short sound is in more general use.—See Pedals.
