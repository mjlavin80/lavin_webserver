Xj> The diphthong ia, in this word, does not draw the preceding t to uh as in pite• ous, and the reason seems to be the same as that which preserves the same letter pure in Mightier, Weightier, &c. that is, the termination able, though derived from . the Latin, is often used in composition with pure English words, like the personal and comparative terminations er, etk, &c.
-	and therefore the general rule in English composition is adhered to, which is, that simples preserve their sound and accent, whatever terminations are annexed to them.
