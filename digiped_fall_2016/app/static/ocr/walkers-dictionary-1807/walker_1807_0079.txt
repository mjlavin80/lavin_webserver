DIFFERENT SOUNDS OF THE DIPHTHONG OW. Ixxiii
powder, prowess, prow, frrowl, vowel, towel, bower, rowel, cowl, scowl, crowd, shower, tower, sow (a swine), sowins, sowl, thowl, low (to bellow as a cow). This word is generally pronounced as low, not high; but if custom, in this case, lias not absolutely decided, it ought, in my opinion, to have the fii*st sound of this c iph-thong, rhyming with h„w, as much more expressive of the noise it bi^idfies ; which, where sounds are the ideas to be expressed, ough to have great weight in pronunciation. (241) 251) See the word.
324.	The second soupd of this diphthong is heard in blow, dew, crow, grow, Jlorc, glow, bow (to shoot with), k iow, low (not high), wow (to cut grass), row, tihow, sow (to scatter grain), strow, slow, snow, trow, below, slow, btst .w, owe, mm, owner, f own, grontm, grow'h, know, known, sown, lower (to bring low), throwy thrown; in all these words the ow sounds like long o in go% no, so ficc.
325.	The noun //row, signifying the forepart of a ship, rhymes with gv in Air. Sheridan, and with n*w m Dr. Kcnrick. The latter is> in my opinion, the preferable sound: while the verb to fir-.wl (to seek for prey), rhymes with owl according to Mr. Sheridan, and with soul according to Dr. Kenrick: the latter has the old spelling fir-le to plead, but the former has, in my opinion, l»th analogy and the best usage on its side. Both these writers unite in giving the first sound of this diphthong to prowess ; which is unquestionably the true pronunciation. Sec to Prowl.
326.	The proper names //.w, Howrl, Howard, and Pwel, generally are
heard with the first sound of this diphthong, as in h>w, new, 8cc. but H wet and ^;W (the historian) commonly rhyme with kn^ws and knw It ward, among people of rank, is generally pronounced with the second sound, rhyming with fr .-wa^d ; and Grosvrnor, as if written Graven jr. Sn^wd^nis frequently pronounced with the first sound of jw ; but the second sound seems preferable ; as it is not improbable that these mountains had their name, like the Alps, from the snow on their tops.	.
327.	When this diphthong is in a final unaccented syllable, it has always
the second sound, like long o, in borrow, sorrow, fellow* willow, Sec. The vulgar shorten this sound, and pronounce the o obscurely, and sometimes as if followed by r, as winder and filer, for window and f l!ow ; but this is almost too despicable for notice. Good speakers preserve	the	diphthong in this situation,	and	give it the full sound of open o, rhyming	with	no,	*o,	Sec.
323.	This diphthong, in the \voi*d know! ig *, has of late years undergone a considerable revolution. Some speakers, who had the regularity of their lan-pua^e at heart, were grieved to see the compound depart so far from the sound of the simple, and with heroic fortitude have opposed the multitude by pronouncing the first syllable of this word as it is heard in the verb to know. The Pulpit and the Bar have for some years given a sanction to this pronunciation; but the Senate and the Stage hold out inflexibly against it; and the Nation at lar^e seem insensibie of the improvement. They still continue to pronounce,
as in the old ludicrous rhymes--------
