to spell the word ho-v (to shoot with), and Hit verb to bo-g (to bend sideways), with the final e; this slight addition will relieve a reader from the embarrassment he is under at first sight, where he is not th >roughlv acquainted with the circumstances of a relation, and does not know how to pronounce the word till lie has read the context. For the propriety of this additional <?, see the words Bo'A’l and Form.	^
I cannot refrain from quoting Mr. Nares on this word, as his opinion has great authority :—“ A bow for arrows, and to bow, when ** it signifies merely to bend any thing, “ have o'o like o long. This distinction I “ believe to be right, though our great “ Lexicographer has not noticed it. He “givesto bozo, in every sense, the regular ** sound of o'jd, (that is rhyming with coo.) “ But of this iustance the first and fourth appear to be erroneous; the third is “ doubtful; and in the second, the word is “ used to express an inclination of the bo-“dy, but metaphorically applied to trees. 4t See the four instances from Shakspeare, u Dryden, and Locke, under To bo'v, v. a. " No. l.»
A want of attending to the different ideas the word bo~vconveys, as it is differently sounded, has occasioned the inconsistent sea terms; the //o*o of a ship, rhyming with cow ; and un anchor, called the best botvtr, rhyming with ho'tr ; and bow, in the word boiosprii, rhyming with qo, no, &c.

(£j*Many respectable speakers pronounce this word so as to rhyme with the noise made by a dog. Dr. Johnson, Mr. El phi list on, and Mr. Perry, declare for it; but Mr. Sheridan, Mr.Scott, Dr. Kenriefc, and Mr. Smith, pronouuce it as the vessel to hold liquor, rhyming with hole. I remember having been corrected by Mr. Garrick for pro-
nouncing it like ho ol; and am upon tlie whole of opinion, that pronouncing’ it as f have marked it is the prererable mode, though the least analogical. But as the vessel has indisputably this sound, it is rendering the Unguage still more irregular to give the ball a different one. The incon-venieure of this irregularity is often perceived in the word hov ; to have the satne word signify different things, is the fate of all languages; but pronouncing the same word di:Terentiy to signify different things, is multiplying difficulties without necessity ; for though it may be alleged that a different pronunciation of the same word to signify a different thing is in sotne measure remedying the poverty ambitruity of language, it may be answered, that it is in reality increasing the ambiguity by setting the eye and ear at uriance, and obliging the reader to unde and the context before he can pronounce the word. It may be urged, that the Grce’^ nnd Latin languages had these ambign tics m words iv hi eh were only distinguishable by their quantity or accent- But it is highly probable that the Greek Inngn.ige had a written accent to distin^uisn such words as were pronounced different ly to siguify different things, and this is equivalent to a different spelling; and though the Latin word le^o signified either to read or to tend, according to the quantity with which the first syllable was pronounced, it was certainly an imperfection in that language which ought not to be imitated. Ideas and combinations of ideas will always be more numerous than words; a id therefore the same word will often stand for very different ideas: but altering the sound of a word without altering the spelling, is forming an unwritten language.
