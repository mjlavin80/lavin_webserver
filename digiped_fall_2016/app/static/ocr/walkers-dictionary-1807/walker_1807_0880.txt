coming1 from Greek words with %, ought always to be pronounced like k; and I believe the woixl in question is almost the only exception throughout the language. However strange, therefore, skism may sound, it is the only true and analogical pronunciation; and we might as well pronounce scheme,seine,as schism, sizvi,there being exactly the same reason for both.— But when once a false pronunciation is fix-cd as this is, it requires same daring spirit to begin the reformation: but when once begun, as it has, what seldom happens, truth, novelty, and Jfie appearance of Greek erudition on' its side, there is no doubt of its success Whatever, therefore, may be the late of its pronunciation, it ought still to retain its spelling. This must be held sacred, or the whole language will be metamorphosed : for the very satrie reason that induced Dr. Johnson to spell Sceptick, Skeptick, ought to have made him spell schism, skism, and schedule, sedulc.
