Though the first g in Exaggerate is, by a carelessness of pronunciation, assimilated to the last, this is not always the case
' in the present word. For though we sometimes hear it sounded as if written *ud-je*t, the most correct speakers generally preserve the first and last g in their distinct and separate sounds.
Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Scott, and Mr. Nares, pronounce the g in both syllables soft, as if written tud-jetu Dr. Kenrick, Mr. Perry, and Barclay, make the first g hard, and the second soft, as if written sug-jest, as 1 have done; for as the accent is noton these consonants, there is not the same apology for pronouncing the first soft as there is in exaggerate; which see.

(Xj* This word has long been a vagabond in conversation, and was not to be found in any of our Dictionaries till it was lately admitted to a place in Entick’s, and, from its very frequent use, may now bo considered as a denizen of the language. Mr. Column had, many years ago, made use of it in hi» prologue to “ The Wife in the Eight,1n where he says——
“No sulky critick to the Playhouse drawn,
“ Whom modern comedy provokes to yawn.^ And this writer’s authority alone is a suf-« ficient proof of the propriety and utility of the word. It may perhaps be objected, that tbe word sullen is perfectly equivalent, and renders this werd useless. Those, however, who consider language phtloso-phically, know that there are no wonts perfectly synonimous, and consequently that there are no useless words. If it be asked what is the difference between these words, I would answer, that sullenness seems to be an habitual sulkiness, and sulkiness a temporary sullen ness. The former may be an innate disposition ; the latter a disposition occasioned by recent injury. The one has a malignancy in it threatening danger; the other an obstinate averseness to pleasure. Thus we are in a sullen mood, and in a sulky fit; Men and Women pre said to be sullen, and Children sulky; sullenness may be predicated of inanimate objects, sulkiness only of such as are anio mated.
“ No cheerful breeze this sullen region knows; “ The dreadful East is all the wind that “ blows.”	Po[>e.
If these distinctions are just, there is good reason for receiving tbe word in question, and incorporating it into the .language, even though it had not been adopted by tfce respectable writer I have quoted.
