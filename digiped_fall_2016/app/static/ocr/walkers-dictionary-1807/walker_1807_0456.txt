Dr. Johnson tells us, that the I in this word is sometimes sounded and sometimes mute, and that in conversation it is generally suppressed. To this Dr. Kenrick adds, that it is needlessly suppressed. None of our lexicographers have marked this letter mute, but Mr. Sheridan. Mr. Nares says, the Word is pronounced both ways, and leaves it undetermined; but Mr. Elphinston decides positively against retaining the / even in writing: his reasons are, that as the French have left out the / in their -antiquated faulte, we ought to leave it out of our English word, which was derived from their ancient one. This reasoning, however, I think is not conclusive. If after deriving words from the living languages, and using them for cen-
turies, we were to alter them as the parent language happens to alter, our own language would have no stability. The truth is, the French language is much more altered within the two last centuries than the English, and is greatly enfeebled by dropping its consonants. Its nasal vowels too have added to its weakness, by rendering both vowels and consonants less distinct. The I in question has nothing harsh or uncommon in its sound, and it it were mute, would desert its relation to the Latin falsitas, and form a disgraceful exception; and if poets have sometimes dismissed it to rhyme the wordwithf bought % sought, 8cc. they have as readily admitted it to rhyme with nnoLt, salt, and assault.
