ORGANIC FORMATION OF THE CONSONANTS. xxxP
ucm of breath, widens itself to the cheeks, raises itself nearer the palate, and by these means a less hollow sound than either of the former is produced.
36.	The e in e-qual is formed by dilating the tongue a little mere, and ad* fencing it nearer to the palate and the lips, which produces the slenderest vowel in the language; for the tongue is, in the formation of this letter, as close to the palate as possible, without touching it; as the moment the tongue touches the palate, the squeezed sound of et in thfc and meet is formed, which, by its descripdon, must partake of the sound of the consonant y.
■ S7. The * in i-dol is formed by uniting the sound of the Italian a in father and the e in e-qual, and pronouncing them as closely together as possible. See Directions to foreigners at the beginning of this book, page xxi.
38.	The o in o-fien is formed by nearly the same position of the organs as the a in vaster; but the tongue is advanced a little more into the middle of the mouth, the lips are protruded, and form a round aperture like the foi-m of the letter, and the voice is not so deep in the mouth as when a is formed, but advances to the middle or hollow of the mouth.
39.	The u in u-rde is formed by uniting the squeezed sound ee to a simple vowel sound, heard in woo and coo; the oo in these words is formed by protruding the lips a little more than in o, forming a smaller aperture with them, and, instead of swelling the voice in the middle of the mouth, bringing it as forward as possible to the lips.
40.	Y final in try is formed like i: and w final in now, like the oo, which ha& just been described.
In this view of the organic formation of the vowels we find that a, e, and <7, are the only simple or pure vowels: that i is a diphthong, and that u is a semiconsonant. If we were inclined to contrive a scale for measuring the breadth or narrowness, or, as others term it, the openness or closeness of the vowels, we might begin with e open, as Mr. Elphinston calls it, and which he announces to be the closest of all the vocal powers. In the pronunciation of this T tetter we find the aperture of the mouth extended on each side; the lips almost closed, and the sound issuing horizontally. The slender a in waste opens the mouth a little vider. The a in father opens the mouth still more without contacting the corners. The German a heard in wall, i ot only opens the mouth wider than the former a, but contracts the comers of the mouth so as to make the aperture approach nearer to a circle, while the o opens the mouth still more, and contracts the comers so as to make it the os rotundum, a picture of the letter it sounds. If, therefore, the other vowels were, like o, to take their forms from the aperture of the mouth in pronouncing them, the German a ought necessarily to have a figure as nearly approaching the o in form as it does in «ound; that is, it ought to have that elliptical form which approaches nearest to the circle ; as the a of the Italians, and that of the English in father, ought to form ovals, in exact proportion to the breadth of their sounds; the English a in waste ought to have a narrower oval; the e in the ought to have the curve of a parabola, and the squeezed sound of ee in seen a right line ; or to reduce these lines to solids, the o would be a perfect globe, the German a an oblate spheroid like the figure of the earth, the Italian a like an egg, the English slender a a Dutch skittle, the e a rolling-pin, and the double e a cylinder.
