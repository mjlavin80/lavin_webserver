lm	DIFFERENT	SOUNDS	OF	THE	DIPHTHONGS.
DIPHTHONGS,
190.	A diphthong is a double vowel, or the union or mixture of two vowels pronounced together, so as only to make one syllable; as the Latin a e or <r, o e or ce, the Greek «, the English ax, au^ &c.
191.	This is the general definition of a diphthong: but if we examine it closely, we shall find in it a want of precision and accuracy*. If a diphthong tye two vowel sounds in succession, they must necessarily form two syllables, and therefore, by its very definition, cannot be a diphthong: if it be such a mixture of two vowels as to form but one simple sound, it is very improperly called a diphthong; nor can any such simple mixture exist.
192.	The only way to reconcile this seeming contradiction, is to suppose that two vocal sounds in succession were sometimes pronounced so closely together as to form only the time of one syllable in Greek and Latin verse. Some of these diphthongal syllables we have in our own language, which only pass Cor monosyllables in poetry: thus hire (wages) is no more than one syllable in verse, though perfectly equivalent to higher (more high), which generally passes for a dissyllable: the same may be observed of dire or dyer, hour and flower, 8tc. This is not uniting two vocal sounds into one simple sound, which is impossible, but pronouncing two vocal sounds in succession So rapidly and so closely as to go for only one syllable in poetry.
193.	Thus the best definition I have found of a diphthong is that given us by Mr. Smith, in his Scheme for a French and English Dictionary. w A diph-“ thong (says this gentleman) I would define to be two simple vocal sounds “ uttered by one and the same emission of breath, and joined in such a man-“ ner that each loses a portion of its natural length; but from the junction “ produceth a compound sound, equal in the time of pronouncing to either of “ them taken separately, and so making still but one syllable.”
194.	“ Now if we apply this definition (says Mr. Smith) to the several
“ combinations that may have been laid down and denominated diphthongs “ by former orthiiepists, I believe we shall find only a small number of them “ meriting this name.” As a proof of the truth of this observation, we find, that most of those vocal assemblages that go under the name of diphthongs emit but a simple sound, and that not compounded of the two vowels, but one of them only, sounded long: thus fiain and flane, flail and flale, hear and here, are perfectly the same sounds.	•
195.	These observations naturally lead us to a distinction of diphthongs into proper and improper: the proper are such as have two distinct vocal sounds, and the improper such as have but one.
196.	The proper diphthongs are,
ea ocean	io	question	ou boy
eu feud	oi	voice	va assuage
ew jewel	ou	pound	ue mansuetude
ia poniard	ovj	now	ui languid.
ie spaniel
In this assemblage it is impossible not to see a manifest distinction between those which begin with c or /, and the rest. In those beginning with either of these
*	We see how many dispute** the simple and ambiguous nature of vowels created among grammarians, and how it ha- hes?ot the mistake concerning diphthongs: all that are properly
So are syllables, and not diphthongs, as intended to be signified by that word. Holder.
