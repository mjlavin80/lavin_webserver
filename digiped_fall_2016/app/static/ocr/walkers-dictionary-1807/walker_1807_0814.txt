It has been observed in the Principles, No. 85, 86, &c. tbatw, by articulating the a, gives it the deep broad sound equivalent to the diphthong au* and that u, preceded by qt has exactly the same effect. (414). This is evident from the sound of a in this and similar words, which, till lately, was always pronounced broad. Some innovators have attempted to give the a in this word its slender sound; but the publick ear seems in opposition to it, nor ought it to be admitted. The broad sound is the genuine English pronunciation, as appears m every word whefe it is succeeded by r. As this consonant, when final, or followed by another consonant, gives every a that precedes it the Italian sound heard in father ; so, when these letters are preceded by qut or w, the a falls into the broad fcOund heard in trater. Thus, as we hear bar^ dart, barrel, with the sound of the Italian a, 6o we hear war, quart, and quarrel, with the German a. Equator, quaver, and words ending with hard c, g, and f have departed from this rule; but sufficient number of words are left to indicate plainly what is die analogy, and to direct us where nsarge is doubtful.
