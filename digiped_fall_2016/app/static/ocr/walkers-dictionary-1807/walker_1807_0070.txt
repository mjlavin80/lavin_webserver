bdv DIFFERENT SOUNDS OF THE DIPHTHONGS EA, fcc.
236.	Heard, the past time and participle of hear, is sometimes corruptly pronounced with the diphthong long, so as to rhyme with rear'd: but this is supposing the verb to be regular; which, from the spelling, is evidently not the
case.	.	#	#
237.	It is, perhaps, worth observation, that when this diphthong comes before r, it is apt to slide into the short u, which is undoubtedly very near the true sound, but not exactly: thus pronouncing earl, earth, dearth, as if written url, urth, durth, is a slight deviation from the true sound, which is exactly that of i before r, followed by another consonant, in virtue, virgin; and that is the true sound of short e in vermin, venial, &c. (108).
238.	Leant, the past time and participle of to lean, is grown vulgar: the regular form leaned is preferable.
239.	The past time and participle of the verb to leap, seems to prefer the irregular form; therefore, though we almost always hear to leap rhyming with reap, we generally hear leaped written and pronounced leapt, rhyming with
wept.	,	%
240.	Ea is pronounced like long slender a in bare, m the following words: Bear, bearer, break, forbear, forswear, great, pear, steak, swear, to tear,
wear.	.	#
241.	The word great is sometimes pronounced as if written greet, generally by people of education, and almost universally in Ireland; but this is contrary to the fixed and settled practice in England. That this is an affected pronunciation, will be perceived in a moment by pronouncing this word in the phrase, Alexander the Great ; for those who pronounce the word greet, in other cases, will generally in this rhyme it with./a/<\ It is true the ee is the regular sound of this diphthong; but this slender sound of e has, in all probability, given way to that of a as deeper and more expressivo of the epithet great.
242.	The same observations are applicable to die word break; which is much
more expressive of the action when pronounced brake than breek, as it is sometimes affectedly pronounced.	#	.
243.	Ea is pronounced like the long Italian a m father, m the following
words: Heart, hearty, hearten, hearth, hearken.	^
244.	Ea, unaccented, has an obscure sound, approaching to short u, in vengeance, serjeant, pageatit, and pageantry.
EAU.	.
245.	Tlii^is a French rather than an English triphthong, being found only, in words derived from that language. Its sound is that of long open o, as beau, bureau, fambcau, portmanteau. In beauty and its compounds, it has the first sound of u, as if written bewty.

$46 This diphthong, in all words except those that end in r, has a squeezed sound of long open <? formed by a closer application of the tongue to the roof of the mouth, than in that vowel singly, which is distinguishable to a mce ear, in the different sounds of the verbs to fl*- and to meet, and the nouns and meat. This has always been my opinion; but, upon consulting some good sneakers on the occasion, and in particular Mr. Garrick, whc could find no difi fercnce in the sound of these words, I am less confident in giving it to the bjiJ*
