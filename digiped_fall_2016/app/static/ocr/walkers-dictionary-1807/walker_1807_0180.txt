This word, like Metamorphosis, has deserted its Latin accentuation on the penultimate syllable, and returned to its original Grees accent on the antepenultimate. See Princi-, pies, No. 503, page 49. The other words of this termination, as Anadiplosis, Antiptottt,
&c. retain the Latinaccent^though all these
words in Greek have the accent on the antepenultimate. This accentuation on the antepenultimate is so agreeable to the genius of our own tongue, that it is no wonder it w
so prevalent. Johnson, Sheridan, Kenncs,
