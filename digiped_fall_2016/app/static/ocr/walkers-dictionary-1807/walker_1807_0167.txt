U* This word is divided into three syllables by Mr. Sheridan, and but into two by Dr. Kenrick, Mr. Perry, Mf. Scott, and W. Jobnstou. The latter is, in my opinion, preferable. My reason is, that though this plural word is perfectly Latin, and in that language is pronounced iu three syllables; yet as we have the singular aloe in two syllables, we ought to form the plural according to our own analogy, and pronounce it in two syllables likewise.—See Antipodes.

The first syllable of this wor J, and of the sixteen that follow it, except although, are subject toa double pronunciation, between which it is not very easy to decide. There is a general rule in the language, that/, followed by auother consonant, gives the preceding a its broad sound, as in salt. This rule is subject to several exceptions (84); and if we take iu these words into the exceptions, there is some doubt of the exception’s becoming the general rule. But the a in question is now so generally pronouuccd, as in the first syllable of alley, valley, &c. that we should risk the imputation ot iuac-curacy to sound it otherwise. Mr. Sheridan, Dr. Kenrick, and Mr. Scott, are uniformly for this latter sound of a. Mr. Perry marks all in tbe same manner, except altercate and altercation; and W. Johnston has only the wcr*ls alienation and alternative,
