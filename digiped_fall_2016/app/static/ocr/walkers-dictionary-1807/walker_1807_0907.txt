fCj* A very extraordinary pronunciation of this word prevails in London, and what it more extraordinary, on the Stage, so different from every other word of the same form as to make it a perfect oddity in the language. This pronunciation approaches to the word scythe ; aud the only difference is, that scythe has the flat aspiration as in this ; aud sigh the sharp one, as ia thin. It is not easy to conjecture what could be the reason of this departure from analogy, unless it were to give the word a sound ivhich seems an echo to the sense; and if this intention had gone no (farther than tbe lengthening or shortening of a vowel, it might have been admitted, as in fearf tl, chetrf'rt, pierce, fierce, great, leisure, snd some others; but pronouncing gh like th in this worrl in too palpable a contempt of orthography to pass current without the stamp of the best, the most ' universal and permanent usage on its side. The Saxon combination gh, according to tbe general rule, both in the middle and at the end of a word, is silent. Lt had au-ciently a guttural pronunciation, which is still retained in jrreat part of Scotland, and in some of the northern parts of England: but every guttural sound has been long
;—p66nd;—Min, this.
since banished from the language; not, however, without some efforts to continue, by cbangiug these letters, sometimes into the related guttural consonant i, -as in lough, hough, 6lc. and sometimes into a con-'souant entirely unrelated to them, as in laugh, cough, &c. These are the only transmutations of t'*ese letters; and these established irregularities are quite sufficient without admitting such as are only candidates for confusion. If it be pleaded that sithe better expresses the emission of breath in the act of sighing, it may be aii'Wered, that nothing can be more erroneous, as the tongue aud teeth have uothiugto do in thiii action. Mr. Sheridan has, indeed, to assist this expression, spelled the word sih, as an aspiration must necessarily accompany tbe act of sighing; but (to take no notice that, in this case, the h ought to be before the i,) (397), though such expression may be very proper in oratory, when accompanied by passion, it would be as affected to give it this aspiration in ordinary speech, as to pronounce the word fearful with a tremour of tbe voice, and a falteriug of the tougue, or to utter the word laugh with a convulsive motion of the breast ami lungs* To these reasons may be added the laws of rhyme j which necessarily exclude this affected pronunciation, and oblige us to give the word its true analogical sound:
