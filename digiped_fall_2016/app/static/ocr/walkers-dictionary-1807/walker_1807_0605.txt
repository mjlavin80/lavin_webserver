the fourth syllable from the last, as in warieomeneu, service ableneee, &c. (501); and a probable reason is given, under tne word Academy, why we accent so many words from the Latin in the same manner ; but be the reason what it will, certain it is that this custom has prevailed. This prevalence of custom i9 sufficiently exemplified in the positive of the word in question; Rcfragablc is accented by Johnson, Ash, ana Bailey, on the first syllable, and would probably have been accented in the same manner by the rest if they had inserted the word. Buchanan ana Barclay, indeed, have the word, and accent it on the second; but their authority is greatly outweighed bj the three others. Convinced, therefore, that pronouncing this word with the accent on the second syllable is following that path which the best usage has pointed out, I do not hesitate to dissent from so many authorities, especially when 1 find the best of these authorities inconsistent; for if we are to place the accent on the first syllable of Rcfraga-ble, why we should remove the accent In Irrefragable I cannot conceive.—See Academy and Disputable.

Irrefutable, lr-rt-fb'tA-bl. a. Not to be overthrown by argument.
XT AH our Dictionaries place the accent on the third syllable of this word; nor do I mean to affront such respectable authority, by placing it on the second, as in irrefragable, though there is the same reason for both. Let it not be pleaded that we have the verb refute in favour of the first pronunciation; this has not the least influence on the words indisputable, irrevocable, incomparable, &c. Tne reason why Corruptible and Refractory ought not to have the accent on the first syllable, arises from the difficulty of pronouncing the un-combinable consonants pt and ct in syllables not under the stress.—See Prind-pies, No. 5X7; also the words Accept able and Refractory.

CT This is one of the annual productions of the House of Commons (where new words and money bills naturally originate^; but it certainly deserves reception, as it con* veys a new idea, which is, that the object to which it relates is supposed to be in a fallen and abject state, and incapable of relief; whereas Unastitting may relate to an object which indeed wants assistance, but which is still in a militant state, and * not overcome. Every new shade of thought, however nice, enriches a lan* guagc, and may be considered as a real acquisition to it: but this word, as it is generally used in Parliament, seems to signify nothing more than merely unrelated g and if this had been expressed by irrelative, though not strictly classical, yet a very allowable formation, it would have been of real use; but as it is used at present, it is a pedantic encumbrance to the language.—See Relevant.

Xj* This word and its simple Reparable come from the Latin Reparabilis and /r-reparabilis, and are pronounced with the accent on the pre-antepenultimate syllable, according to the analogy of words angli* cised from the Latin, by dropping a syTla* ble; which is, to place the acccnt on that syllable which has a secondary stress
