(£)* Mr* Sheridan has adopted the other spelling from the French oration ; but Dr. Johnson and aUthe writers he quotes,spell the word in the manner I have done. Dr. Johnson tells us this word is variously accented ; that Shakspeare has the accent both on tlie first and second syllables, Milton and Crash aw on the first, and others on the second.	^

Mr. Nares tells us he has no doubt that Milton’s accentuation is right. This too is my opinion. Poets are not the best authorities, even when they are unanimous; but much worse when they differ from others, and even from themselves. We must therefore leave them tlie liberty of accenting both ways, either for tlie sake of the verse, the rhyme, the humour, or the affectation of singularity, and bring our reason for accenting1 this word in prose on the first syllable, from the very general rule in Principles', No. 503. Accordingly Mr. Elphin-ston, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Scott, Dr. Ken-rick, Buchanan, W. Johnston, Barclay, Bailey, Perry, and Entick, uniformly place the accent on the first syllable ; and Dr. Ash says it is sometimes accented on tlie second.
Ornament, dr'dUm£nt. s. Embellishment, decoration; honour, that which confers dignity.
