QC/*This word and its companion Concrete one would have supposed should have the same accentuation in all our Pronouncing Dictionaries, and yet scarcely any two words are more differently accented. The accent is placed on the last syllable of Concrete by Dr. Ash, Buchanan, Perry, Entick, and Bailey ; and on the first by Sheridan, Dr. Johnson, Smith, W. Johnston, and Dr. Kenrick. Scott nccents the last syllabic of this word when an adjective, and the first when a substantive, a distinction %*cry agreeable to analogy (494) ; but Entick, directly contrary to this analogy, reverses this order. Discrete is always usea as an adjective,buthas scarcely less diversity ofaccentuation than Concrete. Dr. Johnson, Dr. Kenrick, Mr. Nares, Mr. Scott, Perry, and Entick, accent it on the last syllable; and Dr. Ash, Mr. Sheridan, and Bailey, on the first. When I wrote the Rhyming Dictionary I accented both these words on the first syllable ; but this accentuation I imagine arose from contrasting them, which often places the accent on the opposing parts, as in internal and ex'ter nal: but upon maturer consideration 1 apprehend th© accent ought o be placed on the first syllable of Concrete when a substantive, aad on the last of both words when adjectives. Discretion, dis-kr6sh'&n. s. (507). Prudence, knowledge to govern or direct one’s self; liberty of acting at pleasure, uncontrolled and unconditional power.
