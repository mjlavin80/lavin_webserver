Consonants enumerated and distinguished into Classes
18.	The consonants are divisible into mutes, semi-vowels, and liquids.
19.	The mutes are such as emit.no sound without a vowel, as by fat, d, k, and c and g hard.
20.	The semi-vowels are such as emit a sound without the concurrence of a vowel, as f, i>, *, z, x,g soft or j.
21.	The liquids are such as flow into, or unite easily with the mutes, as (
n, »*.
22.	But, besides these, there is another classification of the consonants, of great importance to a just idea of the nature of the letters, and that is, into suck as are sharp or flat, and simple or aspirated.
23.	The sharp consonants are, fi,J t, *, A*, c hard.
24.	The flat consonants are, b, r, </, z, g hard.	.
25.	The ample consonants are those which have always the sound of one letter unmixed with others, as, b> fi,/ v? k, g hard, and g soft, or j.
26.	The mixed or aspirated consonants are those which have sometimes a hiss or aspiration joined with them, which mingles with the letter, and alters its sound, as f in motion, d in soldier, s in mission, and z in azure.
27.	There is another distinction of consonants arising either from the seat of tircir formation, or from those organs which are chiefly employed in forming them. The best distinction of this kind seems to be that which divides them toto labials, dentals, gutturals, and nasals.
