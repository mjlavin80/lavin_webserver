“ These, after tl*e closest attention, are all the words, not included in the			
des before laid down, that I have been able to collect, in ited natives of Ireland differ from those of England.”			which the well-edu-
I shall make no observations on the accuracy of this list, but desire my reader to observe, that the strongest characteristics of the pronunciation of Ireland is the rough jarring pronunciation of the letter K, and the aspiration or rough breathing before all the accented vowels. (For the true sound of /f, see that letter in the Principles, No. 419.) And for the rough breathing or aspiration of the vowels, the pupil should be told not to bring the voice suddenly from the breast, but to speak, as it were, from the mouth only.
It may be observed too, that die natives of Ireland proncuncc rm at the end •f a word so distinctly as to form two separate syllables. Thus storm and farm seem sounded by them as if written at aw-ritmyfa-rum ; while the English sound the r so soft and so close to the m, that it seems pronounced nearly as if written foam.
Nearly the same observations arc applicable trylm. When these letters end a word, they are, in Ireland, pronounced at such a distance, that helm and realm sound as if written M-um and real-um; but in England the / and m are pronounced as dose as possible, and so as to form but one syllable. To remedy this, it will be necessary for the pupil to make a collection of words terminating wiib th^se consonants, and to practise them over till a true pronunciation is acquired.
