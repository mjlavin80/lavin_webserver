(fy There are few words better confirmed by authority in their departure from the sound of their simple than this and the following word. Dr. Ash and Bflfdev are the onlv
lexicographers who (if we may judge by the position of the accent) gi^ethe long sound to this word, as in zeal; and even these give the short sound to zealous.
