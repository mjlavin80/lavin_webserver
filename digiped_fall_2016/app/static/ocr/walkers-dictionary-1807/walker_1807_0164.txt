There is a strong propensity in undisci-p! ined speakers to pronounce th ’ s word with the accent on e in the penultimate; but this cannot he too carefully avoided, as all the compounds of alien have invariably the accent on the first syllable. But whether the a in this syllable be long or short, is a dispute amongourbestOrthocpists. Mr.Perry,Mr. Buchanan, W. Johnston, Dr. Kenrick, and Mr. Elphinstone, join it with the consonant, and make itshort; but Mr. Sheridan separates it from the /, and makes it long and slender: and though Mr. Elphinstone’s opinion has great weight with me, yet I here join with Mr. Sheridan against them all; not only because 1 judge his pronunciation of this word the most agreeable to the best usage, but because it is agreeable to an evident rule which lengthens every vowel with the accent on it, cxcept * when followed by a single consonant and a diphthong. See Principles, No. (505) (534).
