DIFFERENT SOUNDS OF THE DIPHTHONGS 10, &c. lxix
frounced, as it usually is in this situation) like short w, as if written marshunesa. (352).
239.	In cushion the o is sunk, and the word pronounced cushm. See the word.
290.	In the very numerous termination ion, these vowels are pronounced in one syllable tike short u ; but when they are preceded by a liquid, as in million, modcny clarion, See. (113), the two vowels, though they make but one syllable, are heard distinctly: the same may be observed when they are preceded by any of the other consonants, except s and t, as champion, scorpion, See. where the vowels are heard separately: but the terminations tion and don are pronounced m one syllable, like the verb shun.
291.	The only exception to this rule is, when the t is preceded by a: in this case the t goes into tch, and the i is in a small degree audible like short e. This may be heard in question, mixtion, digestion, combustion, and what is an instance of the same kind in Christian, as if written ques<hun, mix-chun, See. quest-yuiu mxt-yun, &c. (464) (272).
IOU.
292.	This triphthong, when preceded by a liquid, or any mute but a dental, is heard distinctly in two syllables, as in bilious, various, glorious, abstemious, ingenious, copious; but when preceded by the dentals /, soft c and *, these vowels coalesce into one syllable, pronounced like shus: thus firecious,factious, noxious, anxious, are sounded as if written prcsh-us,facshus, nock-shus, ang-shus. (459).
^ 293. The same tendency of these vowels to coalesce after a dental, and draw it to aspiration, makes us hear tedious, odious, and insidious, pronounced as if written tc-je-wi, o-jee-us, and iiusid-je-us; for as d is but flat t, it is no wonder it should be subject to the sam£ aspiration, when the same vowels follow: nay, h may be affirmed, that so agreeable is this sound of the d to the analogy of English pronunciation, that, unless we are upon our guard, the organs naturally slide into it. It is not, however, pretended that this is the politest pronunciation } for the sake of analogy it were to be wished it were: but an ignorance oi the real powers of the letters, joined with a laudable desire of keeping as near as possible to the orthography, is apt to prevent the d from going into j, and to make us hear o-dc-us, te-dc-us, See. On the other hand, the vulgar, who in this case are right by instinct, not only indulge the aspiration of the d, which the language is so prone to, but are apt to unite the succeeding syllables too closely, and to say o-jtis and te-jus, instead of o-je-us and te-jc-us, or rather ode-y us and tede^yus.
294. If the y be distinctly pronounced, it sufficiently expresses the aspiration of the d, and is, in my opinion, the preferable mode of delineating the sound, as it keeps the two last syllables from uniting too closely. Where analogy, therefore, is so dear, and custom so dubious, we ought not to hesitate a moment at pronouncing odious, tedious, perfidious, fastidious, insidious, invidious, compendious, melodious, commodious, fireludious, and studious, as if written o-je-owt, te-jc-ous, See. or rather ode-yus, tede-yus. See. nor should we forget that Indian comes under the same analogy, and ought, though contrary to respectable usage, to be pronounced as if written Indyan, and nearly as In-je-an. (376).
OA.
. *95. This diphthong is regularly pronounced as the long open sound of o, as in boat, reat, oat, coal, loaf, See. The only exceptions are, bread, abroad, groat,
