ORGANIC FORMATION OF THE CONSONANTS, aaoriii
53.	CH m cfudry and J in jail, are formed by pressing t to «A, and dtozh.
5fl. Mis formed by closing the lips, as ini* and 22, and letting the voice
issue by the nose.
54.	*V is formed by resting the tongue in the same position as in T or and breathing through the nose, with the mouth open.
55.	L is formed by nearly the same position of the organs as t and d, but more with the dp of the tongue, which is brought a little forwarder to the teeth> while the breath issues from the mouth.
56.	1< is formed by placing the tongue nearly in the position of but at such a distance from the palate as suffers it to jar against it, when the .breath is propelled from the throat to the mouth.
57.	.MG in ring, sing, 8c c. is formed in the same seat of sound as hard g; but while the middle of the tongue presses the roof of the mouth, as in (r, the voice passes principally through the nose, as in N.
58.	Y consonant is formed by placing the organs in the position of r, and squeezing the tongue against the roof of the mouth, which produces ee> which is equivalent to initial y. (36).
59.	IV consonant is formed by placing the organs in the position of oo, described under «, and closing the lips a little more, in order to propel the breath upon the succeeding vowel which it articulates,
60.	In this sketch of the formation and distribution of the consonants, it is curious to observe on how few radical principles, the almost infinite variety of combination in language depends. It is with some degree of wonder we perceive that the slightest aspiration, the almost insensible inflection of nearly similar sounds, often generate the most different and opposite meanings. In this view of nature, as in every other, we find uniformity and variety very conspicuous. The angle fiat, at first impressed on the chaos, seems to operate on languages; which, from the simplicity and paucity of their principles, and the extent and power of their combinations, prove the goodness, wisdom, and omnipotence of their origin.
61.	This analogical association of sounds is not only curious, but useful: it gives us a comprehensive view of the powers of the letters; and, from the small number that are radically different, enables us to see the rules on which their varieties depend: it discovers to us the genius and propensities of several languages and dialects, and, when authority is silent, enables us to decide agreeably to analogy.
62.	The vowels, diphthongs, and consonants, thus enumerated and defined, before we proceed to ascertain their different powers, as they are differently associated with each other, it may be necessary to give some account of those distinctions of sound in the same vowels which express their quantity as long or short, or their quality as open or close, or slender and broad. This will appear the more necessary, as these distinctions so frequently occur in describing the sounds of the vowels, and as they are not unfrequently used with too little precision by most writers on the subject.
Of the Quantity and Quality of the VoweU,
63.	The first distinction of sound that seems to obtrude itself upon us when utter the vowels, is a long and a short sound according to the greater or less
duration of time taken up in pronouncing them. This distinction is so obvious f8 to have been adopted in all languages, and is that to which we annex clearer *kas than to any other; and though the short sounds of some vowels have not
