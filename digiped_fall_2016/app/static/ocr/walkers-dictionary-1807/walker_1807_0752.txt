Xj* There is a wanton deviation from rule in the pronunciation of this word and its derivatives, which calls aloud for re forma-tibn. Pronouncing the last syllable like form, a seat, is a gross departure from analogy; as will appear by comparing it ■with the same syllable in reform, conform, inform, deform, transform, &c. This errour seems chiefly confined to tlie stage, where it probably originated. It is not unlikely that some affected actor, to give the word a foreign air, first pronounced it in this manner; though, in justice to the stage, it ought to be observed,.that it has less of this affectation than any theatre of elocution in the kingdom.
