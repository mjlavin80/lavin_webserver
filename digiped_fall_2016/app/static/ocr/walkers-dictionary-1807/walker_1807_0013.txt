**rds tvhich are generally noticed in the following Dictionary, and the words iim e comes before r, followed by another consonant, as merchant, service,^cc. tig pronunciation of the language is probably in the same state in which it was a century ago; and had the same attention been then paid Jo it us now, it is not fifed* even that change would have happened. The same may be observed of those words which are differently pronounced by different speakers: if the analogies of the language had been better understood, it is scarcely conceivable that so many words in polite usage would have a diversity of pronunciation, which is at oace so ridiculous and embarrassing; nay, perhaps it may be with confidcnce asserted, that if tb£ analogies of the language were sufficiently known, and so Dear at band as to be applicable on inspection to every word, that not only many words which are wavering between contrary usages would be settled in their true spund, but that many words, which are fixed by custom to an improper pronun* dation, would by degrees ^row regular and analogical j and those which are so already would be secured in their purity, by a knowledge of their regularity and analogy. ^	•
But the utility of a work oftliis kind is not confined to those parts of language where the impropriety is gross and palpable; besides such imperfections in pro-nuadation as disgust every ear not accustomed to them, there arc a thousand insensible deviations, in the more minute parts of language, as the unaccented syllables may be called, which do not strike the ear so forcibly as to mark any direct impropriety in particular words, but occasion only such a general imper-fetfjoit as gives a bad impression upon the whole. Speakers wifji these imperfections pass very well in common conversation; but when they are required *> pronounce with emphasis, and for that purpose to be more distinct and detoe in their utterance, here their ear fails them; they have been accustomed to loose cursory speaking, and, for want of firmness of pronunciation, are 5ke those painters who draw the muscular exertions of the human body without knowledge of anatomy. This is one reason, perhaps, why we find the ele-wjan of so few people agreeable when they read or speak to an assembly, so few offend us by their utterance in common conversation. A thousand koks lie concealed in a miniature, which a microscope brings to view; and it is by pronouncing on a larger scale, as publick speaking may be called, that we
