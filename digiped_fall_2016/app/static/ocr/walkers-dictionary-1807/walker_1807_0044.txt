txxviii DIFFERENT S0UND9 OF THE LETTER A.
$4. The long sound of the deep broad German a is produced bf U after if?
as in all, wall, call; or, indeed by one i, and any other consonant* except the. mute labials fa b,f, and v, as salt, bald, faUt, falchion, falcon, Sec. 'Ihe exceptions to this i*ule are generally words from the Arabic and Latin languages, as Alps, sJlbioni asphaltic, falcated, salve, calculate, amalgamate, Alcoran, and snjrt d, Sec.; the two last of which may be considered as ancient proper names which have been frequently latinized, and by this means have acquired a slenderer sound of a. This rule, however, must be understood of such syllables only a$ have the acccnt on them ; for when al, followed by a consonant, is in the first syllable of a word, having the accent on the second, it b then pronounced as in the first syllables of al-ley, val-ley, Sec. as alternate, balsamic, fcUcade, falcationf See. Our modern orthography, which has done its utmost to perplex pronun ciation, has made it necessary to observe, that every word compounded of a monosyllable with U, as albeit, also, almost, downful, &c. must be pronounced as if die two liquids were still remaining, notwithstanding our word-menders have wisely aken one away, to the destruction both of sound and etymology ; for, as Mr. Elphinston shrewdly observes,“ Every reader, young and old, must w now be so sagacious an analyst as to discern at once not only what are com-“ pounds and what their simples, but that al in composition is equal to all out
*	of it; on in other words, that it is both what it is, and what it is not.'* Prin. Eng. language, vol. I. pape 60. See No. 404.
85.	The w has a peculiar quality of broadening this letter, even when prepositive : this is always the effect, except when the vowel is closed by the sharp or flat guttural k or g,x,ng, nk, or the sharp labial f, as wax, waft, thwack, twang, twank : thus we pronounce the a broad, though short in wad, wan, want, was, what, Sec. and though other letters suffer the a to alter its sound before M, when one of these letters goes to the formation of the latter syllable, as tall, tal-low ; hall, hal4ow ; call\ cat-low, &c.; yet we see w preserve the sound of this vowel before a single consonant, as wal4ow, swalUow, Sec.
86.	The q including the sound of the w, and being no more than this letter preceded by k, ought, according to analogy, to broaden every a it goes before like the w; thus quantity ought to be pronounced as if written kwontity, and quality should rhyme with jollity ; instead of which we frequently hear the iv robbed of its rights in its proxy; and quality so pronounced as to rhyme with Legality ; while to rhyme quantity, according to this affected mode of pronouncing it, we must coin such words as filantity and comoncmtity. The a in Quaver and Equator is an exception to this rule, from the preponderancy of another which requires a, ending a syllable under the accent, to have the slender sound of that letter; to which rule, father, master, and water, and perhaps, quadrant, are the only exceptions.
87.	The short sound of this broad a is heard when it is preceded by w, and succeeded by a single consonant in the same syllable, as wallow, »wal-low, Sec. or by two consonants in the same syllable, as want, want, waxfa 8cc. but when
4	or r is one of the consonants, the a becomes long, as walk, swarm, Sec.
Irregular and unaccented Sounds,
88.	But besides the long and short sounds common to all the vowels, there is a certain transient indistinct pronunciation of some of them, when they are not accented, that cannot be so easily settled. When the accent is not upon it, no vowel is more apt Jo run into this imperfect sound than the a; thus the particle a before participles, in the phrases a-going, rz-walking, <z-shooting, Seer
