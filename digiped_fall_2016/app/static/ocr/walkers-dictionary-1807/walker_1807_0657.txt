I have excluded Mr. Sheridan's pronunciation, which makes the two first syllables of this word exactly like* matron,
' because the word is a primitive in our language, derived from the Latin matronalis, and therefore, according to English analogy, when reduced to three syllables, ought to have the accent on the antepenultimate (see Academy) ; and this accent has, in simples, always a shortening power (503) (535) : The second pronunciation, though not so strictly agreeable to analogy as the first, is still preferable to Mr. Sheridan’s. Matronish and matronly ought to have the first vowel and the accent as in matron, because they are compounds of our own; but we do not subjoin al to words as we do uh and ly, and, therefore, words of that termination are under a different predicament. Something like this seems to have struck Mr. Sheridan and Dr. Johnson when they accented the word Patronal: for though this word is exactly of the same form,and is perfectly similar in the quantity of the Latin vow-•Is, we find matronal marked with the accent upon the first syllable, and patrenai on the second. From Dr. Johnson s accentuation we cannot collect the quantity of the vowel; his authority, therefore, in the word in question, is only for the accent on the first syllable. To him may be added, Mr. Scott, Mr. Perry, and Entick, who accent and sound the a as Mr. Sheridan has done. Dr. Ash alone seems to favour the pronunciation I hare given.
