PRONUNCIATION OF THE CONSONANTS Q, R. lxxxix
dp only is heard; and the h is mule likewise in naphtha, ophthalmick, kc. In apophthegm both letters are dropped. The same may be observed of phthisis, phthisic, and phthisical. In sapphire the first p slides into ph, by an accentual coalkioQ of similar letters, very agreeable to analogy. See Exaggerate.
Q-
414.	Q has always the sound of k: it is constantly followed by u, pronounced like vf; and its general sound is heard in quacks quill, queen, See. pronounced kwackj hmll,hween, kc. That the u subjoined to this letter has really the power of w, may be observed in the generality of words where a succeeds; for we find the vowel go into the broad sound in quarts quarrel, quantity, See. as much as in «ar, warrant, ivant, See. (85.) But it must be carefully noted, that this broad sound is only heard under the accent; when the a, preceded by qu, is not accented, it has die sound of every other accented a in die language. (92). Thus the a in quarter, quarrel, quadrant, See. because it has the abcent* is broad: the some may be observed when the accent is secondary only (522) (527J, as in quadragesimal, quadrisyllables Sic.; but when the accent is on the succeeding syllable, as in qua-d rati ck, qua-drangular, kc. die a goes into the obscure sound approaching to die Italian a. (92). ^
4is. As a great number of words, derived from the French, have these letters in them, according to our usual complaisance for that language, we adopt the French pronunciadon : thus in coquet, doquet, etiquette, masquerade, harlequin, oblique, antique, opaque, fiique, inquant, piquet, burlesque, grotesque, casque, muque, qua drill** qua ter-cousin, the qu is pronounced like k. Quoifi and quoit ought to be written and pronounced coif, coit. Paquet, laquey, chequer, and ritqttc, have been very properly spelled by Johnson as they are pronounced packet, lackey, checker, and risk. Quoth ought to be pronounced with the u, as if written burnth, and therefore is not irregular. Liquor and harlequin always lose the u; and conquer, conquerable, and conqueror, sometimes, particularly on the Stage. This deviation, however, seems not to have gone beyond recovery; and concjuest is sdll regularly pronounced conk west. Quote and quotation are perfectly regular, and ought never to be pronounced as some do, cote and cota-tion. Cirque, contracted from circus, and cinque, cinquefoil, cinque-ports, cuu.ue-tyo'ted, are pronounced sirk and sink ; and critique, when we mean a criticism, to distinguish it from critick, is pronounced criteek, rhyming with speak. See Quoit and Quotation.
R.
416.	This letter is never silent, but its sound is somedmes transposed. In a
final unaccented syl.able, terminating with re, the r is pronounced after the e, as acre, lucre, sabre, fibre, ochre, eagre, maugre, scpulchre, theatre, spectre, metre, fyetre, mitre, nitre, antre, lustre, accoutre, massacre ; to which we may add, centre and sceptre ; sometimes written center and scepter; but, in my opinion, very improperly, as this peculiarity is fixed, and easily understood ; while reducing meagre to meager disturbs the rule, and adds another anomaly to our pronunciation, by making the g hard before e. (98).	^
417.	The same transposition of r is always perceived in the pronunciation of apron and iron ; and often in that of citron and sa ffron, as if written apum, ium, citum, saffum : nor do I think the two first can be pronounced otherwise without a disagreeable stiffness ; but the two last may preserv e the r before the vowel
