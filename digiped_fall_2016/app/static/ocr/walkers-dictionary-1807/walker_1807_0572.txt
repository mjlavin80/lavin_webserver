(tj* This is among* some of the words in our language, whose accentuation astonishes foreigners, and sometimes puzzles natives. What can be tfie reason, say they, that comparable and incomparable have not the same accent as the verb compare ? To which it may be answered : One reason is, that the English are fond of appearing in the borrowed robes of other languages ; and as comparable and incomparable may possibly oe derived from comparabilis and incomparabilis, they seem desirous of laying the stress on the first syllable, both to show their affinity to the Latin words (see Academy J, and to distinguish them from the homespun words formed from our own verb. When this distinction is pnce adopted, the mind, which is always labouring to
-	express its ideas distinctly and forcibly, finds a sort of propriety in annexing different ideas to the different accentuation ; and thus the distinction becomes accurate and classical. If we may compare small things with great, it may be observed, that the evils of language, like other eVils . in nature, produce some good. But it may be likewise observed, that pr6ducing different meanings by a different accentuation of words, is but a bungling way of promoting the copiousness of languages, and ought as much as possible to be discouraged; especially when it adds to the difficulty, and takes away from the harmony or pronunciation. Besides, there is
a petty criticism which always induce coxcombs in pronunciation to carry these distinctions farther than they ought to go. Not content with accenting acceptable,, admirable, commendable, comparable, /a-mentable, &c. on the first syllable, which implies not a mere capacity of being* accepted, admired, &c. but a worthiness of being accepted, admired, &c.: corruptible and susceptible are sometimes accented in this manner, without the least necessity from a difference of signification. In short, all these refinements in language, which are difficult to be understood, and productive of perplexity, ought to be considered rather as evils than advantages, and to be restrained within as narrow bounds as possible.—See Bowl.
