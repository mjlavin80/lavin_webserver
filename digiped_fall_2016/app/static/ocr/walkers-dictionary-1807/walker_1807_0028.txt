French & and the diphthong ou; and the English sounds of thou and now may be expressed -to a Frenchman by spelling them thaou and naou.
W is no more than the French diphthong ou; thus West is equivalent to Oursf, and wall to ouall.
Y	is perfectly equivalent to the French letter of that name, and may be supplied b^ i; thus yoke, you, &c. is expressed by ioken iou, &c.
or / consonant, must be pronounced by prefixing d to the French j : thus . jayi jony &c. sound to a Frenchman as if spelled dje, djai, &c. If any difficulty be found in forming this combination of sounds, it will be removed by pronoun cing the dy ed, and spelling these words edjt> edjai, See.	•
C/h in English words not derived from the Greek, Latin, or French, is pronounced as if! were prefixed; thus the sound of chair, cheese^ chain, Sec. would be understood by a Frenchman as if the words were written tchere, tchize, tchSne.
Sh in English is expressed by ch in French; thus shame, share, gcc. would be spelled by a Frenchman cheme, chSre, &c.	.
The ringing sound ng in long. aortg, See. may be perfectly conceived by a pupil who can pronounce the French word Encore, as the first syllable of this word is exactly correspondent to the sound in those English words; and for the formation of it, see Principles, No. 57 ; also the word Encore.
But the greatest difficulty every foreigner finds in pronouncing English, is the lisping consonant th. This, it may be observed, has, like the other consonants, a sharp and fiat sound; sharp as in thin, bath ; fiat as in that, with. To acquire the true pronunciation of this difficult combination, it may be proper to begin with those words where it is initial: and first, let the pupil protrude his tongue a little way beyond the teeth, and press it between them as if going to bite the tip of it; while this is doing, if he wishes to pronounce Mm, let him hiss as if to sound the letter s; and after the hiss, let him draw back his tongue within his teeth, and pronounce the preposition in. and thus will the word thin be perfectly pronounced. If he would pronounce that, let him place the tongue between the teeth as before; and while he is hissing as if to sound the letter z9 let liim withdraw his tongue into his mouth, and immediately pronounce the preposition at. To pronounce this combination when final in bath, let him pronounce ba, and protrude the tongue beyond the teeth, pressing the tongue with them, and hissing as if to sound *; if he* would pronounce with, let him first form w*\ put the tongue in the same position as before* and hiss as if to sound r. It will be proper to make the pupil dwell some time with the tongue beyond the teeth in order to form a habit, and to pronounce daily some words out of a Dictionary beginning and ending with these letters.
•	These directions, it is presumed, if properly attended to, will be sufficient to give such Foreigners as understand French, and have not access to a master, a competent knowledge of English pronunciation ; but to render the sounds of the vowels marked by figures in this Dictionary still more easily to be comprehended, with those English words which exemplify the sounds of the vowels, I have associated such French words as have vowels exactly corresponding to them, and which immediately convey the true English pronunciation. These should be committed to memory, or written down and held in his hand while the pupil is inspecting the Dictionary.
Perhaps the greatest advantage to foreigners and provincials will be derived from the classification of words of a similar sound, and drawing the line ^ between <he general rule and the exception. This has been an arduous task ; but it is hoped the benefit arising from it will amply repay it. When the numerous varieties of sounds annexed to vowels, diphthongs, and consonants,
