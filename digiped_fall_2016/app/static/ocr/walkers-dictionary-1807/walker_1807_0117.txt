TERMINATIONAL* ACCENT.
tod the accent invariably placed on the preceding syllable, as in diversity, con. gnaty, kc. On a closer inspection we find every vowel in this antepenultimate syllable, when no consonant intervenes, pronounced long- as deity, piety. &c. A nearer inspection shows us, that, if a consonant precede this termination, the preceding accented vowel is short, except it be u, as severity, curiosity, impunity, kc.: we find too, that even u contracts itself before two consonants, as in curvity, taciturnity, &c. and that scarcity and rarity (signifying uncommonness ; for rarity, thinness, has the a short), are the only exceptions to this rule throughout the language. The same observations are applicable to words ending in ify, as justify, clarify, See. The only words where the antepenultimate accent in words of this termination does not shorten the vowel, are glorify and notify. The y in these words is always long, like the first sound of i ; and both accentand quantity are the same when these words take the additional syllable able, as justifiable, rarefiable, See. (183).
512.	To these may be added the numerous class of words ending in arms, rrous, and orous, as barbarous, vociferous, and humorous ; all which have the accent on the antepenultimate syllable, except canorous and sonorous; which some unlucky scholar happening to pronounce with the accent on the penultimate syllable, in order to show their derivation from the Latin adjectives, canorus and tortorus, they stand like strangers amidst a crowd of similar words, and are sum to betray a mere English scholar into a wrong pronunciation.
To polysyllables in these terminations might be added those in atrve, atory, rtrt*, 8cc.; words ending in ative can never have the accent on the penultimate syllable, if there is a higher syllable to place it on, except in the word creative $. and when this is the case, as it is seldom otherwise, the accent seems to rest on the root of the word ; or on that syllabic which has the accent on the noun, adjective or verb, with which the word in ative corresponds : thus copulative, esti* native, alterative, 8cc. follow the verbs to copulate, to estimate, to alter, &c. When derivation does not operate to fix the accent, a double consonant will attract it to the antepenultimate syllable, as appellative; and two consonants have sometimes this power, in opposition to derivation, as adversative and argumenta-the, from adverse and argument. Indicative and interrogative are likewise exceptions, as they do not follow the verbs to indicate and interrogate: but as they we grammatical terms, they seem to have taken their accent from the secondary accent we sometimes give to the Latin words indicativus and ifUerroga-tfp<?(aee the word Academy). Words ending in ary, ery, or ory, have generally the accent on the root of the word ; which, if it consists of three syllables, must necessarily be accented on the first, as contrary, treachery, factory, &c.; if of four or five, the accent is generally on that syllable which has the accent in the related or kindred words ; thus expostulatory has the accent on the same radical syllable as expostulate ; and congratulatory as congratulate: interrogatory rod derogatory are exceptions here, as in the termination ative ; and if pacifica-tint* murrificatory,* sign\/ica(ory, vesicatory, See. have not the accent on the first* syllable, it seems to arise from the aversion we seem to have at placing even secondary accent on the antepenultimate a, (which we should be very apt to do if the principal accent were on the first syllable), and the difficulty there
*	These words ought certainly to be accented alike; and accordingly we find Dr. Hinson, Mr. Sheridan. Mr. Barclay, and Mr. Smith, place the accent on the second *yfl*blc; but though Fenning accents tignificatory in the same manner, he places the ac-on the antepenultimate of pacificatory; and Kenrick likewise accents the second syllable of tignificatorj, but the first of pacificatory •• the other orthoepists who have not Ufa these words have avoided these inconsistencies.
