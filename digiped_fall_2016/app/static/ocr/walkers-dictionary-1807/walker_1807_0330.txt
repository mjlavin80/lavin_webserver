Tjr* in the pronunciation of this word and its compounds, Mr. Sheridan has adofite I a vulgarism, of which one could scarcely have suspccted him; but pronouncing covets hus for covetous is not only a v dga -ism, but contrary to analogy. AH these diphthongs and diphthongal vowels which draw the preceding cons juh.rs to aspiration are such as commence with the sound of<*,* which, from its nearness to the sound of double e, and the nearness of this sound to the commencing sound ofy% apprviach-es to the hissing sound of s, zy and soft c, and in the absence of accent coalesces with them, rand D being formed in the same seat of sound as the.j, z, and soft r, when the accent is before them, easily slide into the same sound before similar vowels, but never before any other r for we might with as much propriety pronounce calamitous and necessitous, attain-itshus and necesaitshus, as covetous, covet-shtu.
