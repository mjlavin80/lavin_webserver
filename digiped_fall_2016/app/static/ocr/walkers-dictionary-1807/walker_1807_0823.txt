dj* Tlie difference in the pronunciation of these words is not only necessary to convey their different signification, but to show their different etymology. The first comes to us from the French raret6, and the last from the Latin rarita* ; which therefore, according to tlie most settled analogy of our language, ought to have the antepenultimate syllable short. See Principles, No. 511; also the word Chastity. Rascal, r&s'k&l. s. (88). A mean fellow, a scoui drcl.

To Rase, r&ze,or r&ce. v. a. See Raze, To skim, to strike on the surface; to over. throw, to destroy, to root up; to blot out by rasure, to erase.
rr There seeuis to be no small difficulty in settling the orthography and pronunciation of this word. Dr. Johnson advises, when it signifies to strike slightly, to write it rase ; and when H signifies to ruin, raze. Whatever may be the utility of this distinction to tbe eye, the ear seems to have made no such distinction in the sound of the s ; as graze, which is evidently formed, from this word, and seems to have been adopted for the purpose of signifying to strike slightly, has preserved the z ; while erase, which means to destroy, to expunge, to take aWay entirely, is, by all our orthoe-pists, except Dr. Kenrick, pronounced with the s pure. But rase, whether signifying to strike slightly, or to overthrow, has been so generally pronounced with the s like 3, that most of our writers have adopted the latter character; and this souud, it may he observed, *eems more agreeable to the analogy of verbs in this termination thun that in eruse. (437) (407). But as nothing seems to be more fixed iu the language than the sharp hissing sound of j in erase, so if ai.h-logy and usage were to compound the difference, perhaps it would be easier to bring rase to the sound of race, as Mr. Elphin~ ston has done, than eruse to the sound of eraze, as Dr. Kcnrick has done: but to sound it with the hissing / when it is written raze, as Mr. Sheridan has done, is a solecism in pronunciation; for though s often goes into the sound of r, z never goes into that of s.
