C?A very improper, though a very prevailing tpisacceBtuation of the passive participle of the word to subject, has obtained, which ought to be corrected. AH the autho-
a.
rities in Johnson place the accent of subjected on the same syllable as the verb, except one from M ilton :
“ He subjected to man’s service angel wings.” fiutiu another passage Milton accent? this word as it ought to he, even when aA adjective :
"-----------------------------The angel
“ Led them direct and down the cliff as fast “ To the sutyected plain.”
But as the word subject is ao adjective a| well as a verb, and when an adjective it has always the accent on the first syllable, so the participle has not only caught the ac" cent of the adjective, but, as one errour commonly generates another, -teems to have communicated the impropriety to the verb; which we sometimes hear, contrary to all analogy and authority, accented on'the first syllable likewise. These improprieties are easily corrected at first, and they are not yet so rooted as to make correctness look like pedantry.
