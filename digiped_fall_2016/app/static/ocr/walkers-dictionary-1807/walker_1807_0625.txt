tj* This word seems to haVe the accent on the last syllable, the better to distinguish it from its correllative Legatee.

Cj* This word is sometimes pronounced with the vowel in the first syllable short, as if written Fd-jend. This has the feeble lea of the Latin word Lego to produce ; ut with what propriety can we make this plea for a short vowel in English, when we pronounce that very vowel long in the Latin woid we derive it from ? The genuine and ancient analogy of our language, as Dr. Wallis observes, is, when a woi*4 of two syllables has the accent on the first, and the vowel is followed by a single consonant, to pronounce the vowel long. It is thus we pronounce all Latin words of this kind ; and in this manner we should certainly have pronounced all our English words, if an affectation of following Latin quantity had not disturbed the natural progress of pronunciation. See Drama. But besides this analogy, the word in question has the authority of Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Scott, W. Johnston, Baily, Entick, Peny, and Buchanan, on its side. Dr. Kenrick and Dr. Ash are the only abettors of the short sound-
Legendary, l«Jd'j£n-d&-r£. a. Pertaining to a legend.
As the preceding word has, by the •clearest analogy, the vowel in the fim syllable long, so this word by having the accent higher than the antepenultimate,' has as clear an analogy for having the same vowel short (530) (535). This ana-howeve •, is contradicted by Dr. Ash,
W. Johnston, Mr. Scott, Entick, Buchanan, and Perry, who make the vowel e long, as in Legend. As Dr. Johnson’s accentuation does wot determine the quantity of the vowel, his not inserting this word is, in this case, no loss ; but Mr. Sheridan’s omission of it deprives us of a valuable opinion.

0C/* Some respectable speakers in the House of Commons pronounce the e in the first syllable of this word long, as if written LeegUlature, and think they are wonderfully correct in doing so, because the first syllable of all Latin words, compounded of Lex, is long. They do not know that, in pronouncing the word in this manner, they ^*e cpntrsuljcting one of
