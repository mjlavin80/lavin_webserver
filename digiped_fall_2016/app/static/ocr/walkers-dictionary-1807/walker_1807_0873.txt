Pope has, by the licenfce of his art, accented ^tbe plural of this word upon the second syllable, and like the Latin plural, lias given it four syllables :

The Round of the second syllable of this word has been grossly mistaken by the generality of speakers; nor is it much to be wondered at. 77, with the acrent on it, succeeded by a vowel, is a very uncommon predicament for an Knglish syllable to be under; and therefore it is not surprising that it has been almost universally confounded with an apparently similar, but reatiy different assemblage of accent, vowels, and consonants. So accustomed is the ear to the aspirated sound of /, when followed by two vowels, that whenever these appear we are apt to annex the very same sound to that letter, without attending to an essential circumstanc^in this word, which distinguishes it from every other tn the lani'u:iue. There is uo English word ofexauiy the same form with satifty, and therefore it cannot, like most other words, be tried by its peers; but analogy, that grant! resource of reason, u ill as clearly determine, in this case, as if the most positive evidence were produced. .
In the tii.'t pit ce, then, the sound commonly gi\en to the second syllable of this word, which is that of the first of si-lence, as if
written sa-si-e~ty, is never found annexed to the same letters throughout the whot? language. T, when succeeded by two vowels, in every instance but! the word in question, sounds exactly like sh ; thus satiate, expatiate, &c. are pronounced as if writteu sa-she-ale, ex-pa-she-ate, &c. and not sa-se-ate, er-pa-se-ate, &c. and therefore if the t must be aspirated in this word, it ought at least to assume that aspiration which is found ainoug similar assemblages of letters, and instead of sa-si-e-ty, it ought to be sounded sa-siu-e-ty: in-this mode of pronunciation a greater parity might be pleaded; nor should we introduce a new aspiration to reproach our language with needless irregularity. But if we once cast an eye on those conditions, on which we give an aspirated sound to the dentals (26), we shall find both these methods of pronouncing this word equally remote from analogy. In almost every termination where the consonants, /, d, c, and s, precede tfic vowels ea, ia,ie, io, See. as in martial, soldier, suspicion, confusion, anxious, prescience, <Scc. the accent is on the syllable immediately before these consouants, and they all assume the aspiration j but iu JEgyptiacum, elephantiasis, kendiadts, society, anxiety, science, &c. the accent is immediately after these consonants, and /, d, c, and x, are pronounced as free from aspiration as the same letters in tJar, diet, cion, Iaion, &e. the position of the acceut makes the whole difference. But if analogy in our own language were silent, the uniform pronunciation of words from the learned languages, where these letters occur, would be sufficient to decide the dispute. Thus in < lephantiasis, Milliades, sa-tivtas, &c. the antepenultimate syllable li is always pronounced like the Knglish noun tie ; nor should.we dreain of giving ti the aspirated sound in the-** words, though therewould be exactly the same reason for it, as iu satiety : for, except in very few instances, as' we pronounce Latin in the analogy of our own language, no reason can !>e given why we should pronounce the antepenultimate syllable in satictas one way and that mi satiety another.
I should have thought my time thrown away in so minute an investigation of the pronunciation of this word, if I had not found the best judges disagree about it. That Mr. Sheridan supposed it ought to be pronounced sa-si-e-tif, is evident from his giving this word as an instance of the various sounds of
*	t, and telling us that here it sounds s. Mr. Garrick, whom 1 consulted on this word, told me, if there were any rules for pronunciation, 1 was certainly right in mine;
