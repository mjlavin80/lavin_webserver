ttnor,
'rom this survey of our Dictionaries we find them uniform only in the Word fenor. They are nearly equally divided on the word fc-nrf ,* and if similitude were to decide, it would be clearly in favour of the short vowel, in this word, as well as in tenor.— They are both Latin words, and both have the vowel short in the original. This, however, is no reason with those who understand the analogy of English pronunciation, (for tremor, minor, have the first vowel short in Latin) (544) ; but it sufficiently shows the partiality of the ear to the short vowel in words of this form, as is evident in the word tenant. The word tenable seems rather derived from the ¥rench tenable than the Latin teneof and, being of a different form, comes under a different analogy. The termination able, though derived from the Latin ability is frequently annexed to mere English words, as pleasurable, pasturable, Scc.and therefore makes no alteration in the accent or quantity of the word to which it is subjoined. (501). But as tenable must be considered as a simple in our language, the shortening power ofthe antepenultimate accent alone seems to determine the quantity of the first syllable of this word, which, like gelable,
.probable, &c. has the short quantity of the original Latin to plead; a plea which seems to have some weight in words of this termination, where tne antepenultimate accent appears to have less influence than in most of the other classes of words. See Placable. The word tenure seems inclined to lengthen the first vowel, in order to distinguish itself from tenor ; and as there are no good reasons for shortening it, this reason seems sufficient to turn the ^balance in its favour, even if it had not an analogy and such a weight of usage on its side.
