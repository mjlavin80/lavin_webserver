Cj* Dr. Johnson observes, that of English, as or all living- tongues, there is a double pronunciation, one cursory and colloquial, the other regular and solemn. He gives no instances of this double pronunciation ; and it is at first a little difficult to conceive what are the words in which this observation is verified. Solemn speaking seems to have no*ffect trpon the accented vowels; for, let us pronounce them as rapidly or as solemnly as we will, we certainly do not make any change in trie quantity or quality of them. The only part of the language in which Dr. Johnson’s observation seems true is some of the vowels when unaccented; and of these the o seems to undergo the greatest change in consequence of solemnity or rapidity. Thus the o in obey is, in solemn speaking, pronounced as long and full as in the first syUftble of open ; but in rapid and cursory speaking, as short as the o in oven. This latter sound, however, must not be riven as a model; for let the pronunciation t>e ever so rapid and familiar, there is a certain ele-Jpwce in giving the o, in this situation, its fuU, opeiv sound, approaching to that which it has, when un<ler the accent; and though nothing but a delicacy of ear will direct us to the degree of openness with which we must

(. 47) (548).
The same observations seem to hold good of the unaccented © in every word ending in oryt as transitory, dilatory, &c. The o in rapid speaking certainly gt>es into short u, as • if wiitten transitory, dilotury, &c.; but in solemn proi unciution approaches to the* accented open sound of o in glory, story,
&.c.; but as the o in these terminations never acini its of being pronounced quite so open as when ending a syllable before the accent,! have,like Mr. Sheridan,given it the colloquial sound of short «. (512). —See Command.
