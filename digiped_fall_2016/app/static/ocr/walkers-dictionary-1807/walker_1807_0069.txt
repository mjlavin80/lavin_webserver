228.	In this catalogue we find drarrf and bearded sometimes pronounced as if written for*/ and herded: but this corruption of the diphthong, which Mr. Sheridan has adopted, seems confined to the Stage. Sec the word.	.
2^9. The preterimperfect tense of «*/ is sometimes written ate, particularly by Lord Boiingbroke, and frequently, and. perhaps, more correctly* pronounced 'f, especially in Ireland ; but rafrw always preserves the ea long.
230.	in fearfid is long when it signifies timorous, and short when it signifies terrible, as if written fe fid. See the word.
231.	To ~ead is long in the present tense, and short in the past and participle* which are sometimes written red.	'
232.	Teat a dug, is marked by Dr. Kenrick. Mr Elphinston, and Mr. Nares) tith short e like tit; but more properly by Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Scott, W. Johnston, Mr. Perry, and Mr. Smith, with the long e, rhyming with meat.
233.	Beat* the preterimperfect tense, and participle of to beat, is frequently pronounced in Ireland like bet (a wager): and if utility were the only object of language, this would certainly be the preferable pronunciation, as nothing tends more to obscurity than verbs which have no different form for their present and past times; but fashion in this, as in many other cases, triumphs over use and propriety; and bet, for the past time and participle of beat must be religiously Voided.
234.	Ea is pronounced like the short e in the following words; Abreast, ohead, already, bedstead, behead, bespread, bestead, bread, breadth, breakfast, breast, breath, cleanse, cleanly, (adjective), cleanUly, dead, deadly, deaf, deafen, dearth, deaths tzrl, earldom, ecurlu, earn, earnest, earth, earthen, earthly* endeavou'\featherjiead, heady, health* heard, hearse, heaven, heavy,jealous* impearl, instead, lead, leaden, It ant, (the past time and participle of to lean), learn, learning, leather, leaven, *ieadow* meant, mra.sure, pearl, peasant, pheasant, pleasant, pleasantry, pleasure, rt&d (past time and participle), readily, readiness, ready, realm, rehearsal, rehearse, ^search, seamstress, searce, search, spread, stead, steadfast, steady, stealth, stealthy,

235.1 have given the last three words, compounded of zeal, as instances of short sound of the diphthong, because it is certainly the more usual sound; tot some attempts have lately been made in the House of Commons to pronounce them long, as in the noun. It is a commendable zeal to endeavour to reform the language as well as the constitution ; but whether, if these words were ahcrcd, it would be a real reformation, may admit of some dispute. See incHtUai Termination, No 515, and the word Zealot.
