w^€*fc see great preponderance of authority for the short sound of o in aU these WQrds of three syllables, not because this
letter is short in the l»atin words whence they are derived; for risible and visible, which have the i short with us, are rlsibi-i	lis&nd vlsibilis in Latin; but because the
i	accent in our English word is antepenulti-
;	mate, and because this accent has a short-
I	ening power in all words of this form*
which may be called simples (503), unless j the antepenultimate vowel be v, and then ! it is always lon£, (509) (511) (537). Thus the antepenultimate vowels in credible^ clavicle, vesicle, &c. are short, tliongh derived from credibilis, clavicula, vcsicula* &c.; but the a in tamable, debatable, &c. is long, because they are fbrmatives of our own, from tame, debate, &c.
