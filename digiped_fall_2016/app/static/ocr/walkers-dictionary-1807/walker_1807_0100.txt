PRONUNCIATION OF THE CONSONANT 6.
the s is always sharp and hissing, as tipsy, tricksy: thus in the pronunciation of the word Glasgow, as the & is always sharp and hissing, wc find the g inv«*ri.u>ly slide into its sharp sound k ; and this word is always heard as it written Giatkuw. We sec, therefore, that a preceding sharp consonant makes the succeeding * sharp, but tiot inversely.
449.	5 is always sharp and hissing when followed by c, except in the word discern.
S	aspirated, or sounding like sh, or zh.
450.	S, like its fellow dental /, becomes aspirated, and goes either into the sharp sound sh, or the flat sound zh, when the accent is on the preceding vowel, and it is followed by a semi-consonant diphthong, as nauseate, or a diphthongal vowel, as pleasure, pronounced nausheate and plezhure. (195).
451.	in the termination sion, preceded by a vowel, goes into the flat aspiration zh, as evasion, cohesion, decision, confusion, pronounced evazhkm, 8cc.; but when it is preceded by a liquid or another «, it has the sharp aspiration sh, as expulsion, dimension, reversion,N pronounced expulsion, &c.
452.	The same may be observed of s before u ; when a vowel precedes the s, with the accent on it, the s goes into the flat aspiradon, as pleasure, measure, treasure, rasure, pronounced plezhure, &c.; but when preceded by a liquid, or another it is sounded sh, as sensual, censure, tonsure, pressure, pronounced sen-shual, censhure, &c.
453.	From the clearness of this analogy, we may perceive the impropriety •f pronouncing Asia with the sharp aspiration, as if written Ashia ; when, by the foregoing rule, it ought undoubtedly to be pronounced Azhiay rhyming with Arpasia, euthanasia, &c. with the flat aspiration of z. This is the Scotch pronunciation of this word, and unquestionably the true one: but if I mistake not, Persia is pronounced in Scotland with the same aspiration of *, and as if written Perzhia ; which is as contrary to analogy as the other is agreeable to it.
454.	The tendency of the s to aspiration before a diphthongal sound has produced several anomalies in the language, which can only be detected by recurring to first principles: for which purpose it may be necessary to observe, that the accent or stress naturally preserves the letters in their true sound ; and as feebleness naturally succeeds force, so the letters, immediately after the stress, have a tendency to slide into different sounds, which require less exertion oi the organs. Hence the omission of one of the vowels in the pronunciation of the last syllable offountain, mountain, captain, 8cc. (208): hence the short sound of
*	in respite, servile, 8cc. hence the s pronounced like z in disable, where the accent is on the second syllabic; and like s sharp and hissing in disability, where there is a secondary stress on the first syllable; and hence the difference between the x in exercise, and that in exert; the former having the accent on it, being pronounced cks, as if the word were written ecksercise; and the latter without the accent, pronounced gz* as if the word were written egzert. This analogy leads us immediately to discover the irregularity of sure, sugar, -and their compounds, which are pronounced shure and shugar, though the accent is on the first syllabic, and ought to preserve the s without aspiration ; and a want of attending to this analogy has betrayed Mr. Sheridan into a series of mistakes in the sound of s in the words suicide, presume, resume, kc. as if written shooicids, pre-zhoom, rc-zhoom, &c. but if this is the true pronunciation of these words, it may be asked, why is not suit, suit-
