CCj* This word and the following were in Dr. Johnson’s third edition, foiio, accented on the second syllable; but in the sixth edition, quarto, they have the accent on the first. This latter accentuation, it must be allowed, is more agreeable to Ensrlish analogy, (see Principles, Xo. $03,6.) but there is an analogy that the Learned are very fond of adopting, which is, that when a word from the Latin contains the same number of syllables as the origiual, the ac* cent of the original should then be preserved ; and as the acct nt of rent tens is on the second syllabic, the word renilettt ought to have the accent 011 the second likewise. For my own part, I approve of our own analogy, both in accent and quantity ; but it is the business of a pro»odist to give the usage as well as analogy: and were this word and its formative renitency t be brought into common u*e, 1 Jiave no doubt but that the Latin analogy, that of accent* ing this word on the second s> liable, would generally prevail. This may tairly be presumed from the suffrages we have for it j namdy, Mr. Sheridan, Dr, Keurick, Dr. Ash, Buchanan, and Eutick, w ho are opposed by no Dictionary I have consulted, but by Scott’s Bailey.
