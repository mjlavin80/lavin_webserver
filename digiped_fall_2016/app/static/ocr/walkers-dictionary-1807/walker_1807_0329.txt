Cj* Some affected speakers have done all in their power to remove the accent of this \rord from the second to the first syllable; thanks to the difficulty of pronouncing it ia this manner, they have not yet eftected their purpose. Those who have the least regard for the sound of their language, ought to resist this novelty with all their might; for if it once gam ground, it is sure to triumph. The difficulty of pronouncings it, and the ill sound it produces, will recommend it to the fashionable world, who are as proud to distinguish themselves by an oddity in language as in dress.—See Incomparable.
