Besides, the alteration produced a change in the pronunciation, which, from its being but slight, is the less likely to be attended to; ana therefore the probability is, that, let us write the word as we will, we shall
•	still continue to pronounce the old way; for in no English word throughout the language doe3 the c sound like y, or i short, when the accent is on it.
This improvement, therefore, in our spelling, would, in all probability, add a new irregularity to our pronunciation, already incumbered w ith too many. Warburton, in his Edition of Pope’s Works, seems to have been the first writer of note who adopted this mode of spelling from Boer-liaavc, and the German critics; and he seems to have been followed by all the inscriptions on the chymists shops in the kingdom. But till the voice of the people lias more decidedly declared itself, it is certainly the mpst eligible to follow Dr. Johnson and our established writers in the old orthography.—See Mr. Narcs’s English Orthoepy, page 285, where the reader will see judiciously exposed the folly of altering settled modes of spelling for the sake of far-fetched and fanciful etymologies.
