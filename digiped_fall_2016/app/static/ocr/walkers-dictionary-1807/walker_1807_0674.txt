gj* The accent on the fint syllable of this wordy which is the accentuation of all our orthtfepists, except Dr. Kenrick, is a proof of the tendency to follow the secondary accent of the original Latin word, notwithstanding the double consonant in the middle. Thus Mitcellanea, in our pronunciation of it, having a stress on the first, bedomes the accent when the word is anglicised by dropping a Syllable. Sec Acadxmy, Mamillary, and Medullary.

There is an accentuation of this word upon the second syllable, chiefly confined to the vulgar, which, from its agreeable -ness to analogy, is well worthy of being adopted by the learned. Analogy certainly requires that the verb formed from the noun mischief should be mirthieve, as from thief, thieve ; grief, grieve ; belief, believe, &c. with the accent on the second syllable (492) ; and from such a verb would naturally be formed the adjective in question. But what analogy can give sanction to a
vulgarism ? What Pope observes of the learned in another case, is hut too applicable in this :
“ So much they scorn the crowd, (hat if the throng
“ By chance g* right, they porpoeetf go
** wrong.’*
To which we may add, that m htngvage, as in many other cases, it is safer to be wrong with the polite than right with the vulgar.	t
