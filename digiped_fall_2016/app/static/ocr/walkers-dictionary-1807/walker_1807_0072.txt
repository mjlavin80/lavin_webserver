Ixvi DIFFEREN'T SOUNDS OF THE DIPHTHONGS MO, ate.
the sound of a is the more general sound, and therefore ought to be called the regular; but where there are so many instances of words where this diphthong has the long sound of e, and custom is so uniform in these words, there can be no doubt which is the true sound.
253.	Ei has the sound of long open /, in height and sleight, rhyming with ivhitc and right. Height is, indeed, often heard rhyming with eight and weighty and that among very respectable speakers ; but custom seems to decide in favour of the other pronunciation, that it may better tally with the adjective highj of which it is the abstract.
254.	Ei has the sound of short e, in the two words heifer and nonpareil, pronounced hrffer and nonpareil.
255.	This diphthong, when unaccented, like ai (208), drops the former vowel,and is pronounced like short/, \n foreign, foreigner, forfeit, forfeiture,aove-reign, sovereignty, surfeit, counterfeit.
EO.
256.	This diphthong is pronounced like e long in peofde, a3 if written peeple; and like e short in leopard and jeopardy, as if written leppard, and jeppardy ; and in the law tenm feoffee, froffer, and fevffment, as if vtn\\sx\fi'ffec,feffer, and feffment.
257.	We frequently hear these vowels contracted into short o in g ography and geometry as if written joggraphy and jommetry ; but this gross pronunciation seems daily wearing away, and giving place to that which separates the vowels into two distinct syllables, as it is always heard in geographical, geometer, geometrical, and geometrician. Georgic is always heard as if written jorgic, and must be given up as incorrigible. (116).
258.	Eo is heard like long umfiod, feodal, feodatory, which are sometimes written as they are pronoufrced, feud, feudal, feudatory.
259.	Eo, when unaccented, has the sound of u short in surgeon, stui geon, dud-gcon, gudgeon, bludgeon, curmudgeon, dungeon, luncheon, puncheon, truncheon, burgeon, habergeon, but in scutcheon, escutcheon, pigeon, and widgeon, the co sounds like short i.
260.	Eo sounds like longo in yeoman and yeomanry ; the first syllable of which words rhyme with go, no, so. See the words.
261.	Eo in galleon, a Spanish ship, sounds as if written galloon, rhyming witlv
moon.
EOU.
262.	This assemblage of vowels, for they cannot be properly called a triph-
tnong. is often contracted into one syllable in prose, and poets never make it go for two. In cutaneous and vitreous, two syllables are palpable ; but in gorgeous and outrage m the so kg coalescing with c seems to drop a syllable, though polite pronunciation will always preserve it.	.
263.	This assemblage is never found but in an unaccented syllable, and generally a final one ; and when it is immediately preceded by the dentals d or t, it melts them into the sounds of j and tch : thus hideous and piteous are pronounced as if written hfjeous and pitrheous. The same may be observed oi righ'eouH, plenteous, bounteous, courteous, beauteous, and duteous* (293)(294).
eu;
261. This diphthong is always sounded like long u or ew, and is scarcely ever irregular; thus feud, deuce,are pronounced as if written fevtd, dewee, See.
