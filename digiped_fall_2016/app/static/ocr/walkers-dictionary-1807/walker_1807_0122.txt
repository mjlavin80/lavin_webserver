SECONDARY ACCENT.
“ It if a dir6ct demonstration of the Copemican system ”
In this sentence, as an accent is necessarily upon the last syllable of direct, we seldom lay a stress on the first syllable of demonstration, unless we mean to be uncommonly emphadcal; but in the following sentence,
i
“ It is a d&ncmstritioii of the Copemican system.’*
Here, as no accented word precedes demonstration, the voice finds a rest, and the ear a force, in placing an accent on the first, as well as on the third syllable.
526.	But though we may, or may not, use the secondary accent at pleasure, it is by no means a matter of indifference on what syllable we place it: this is fixed with as much certainty as the place of the principal accent itself; and a wrong position of one would as much derange the sound of the word, as a wrong position of the other: and it must be carefully noted, that though we lay no stress upon the syllable which may have the secondary accent, the consonants and vowels have exactly the same sound as if the doubtful syllable (as it may be called) were accented. Thus, though I lay no stress upon the second syllable of negotiation, pronunciation, ecclesiastic, See. the c and s go into the sound of sh and zh, as if the secondary accent were on the preceding syllable. (357) (4511(459).
527.	It may be observed, in the first place, that the secondary accent is always two syllables, at least, distant from the principal accent: thus in demon-stratum, lamentation, provocation, &c. the secondary accent is on the first syllable, and the principal on the third; and in arteriotomy, meteorology, and hypochondriacal, the secondary accent is on the first, and the principal on the fourth syllable: and in the word indivisibility we may place two secondary accents, one upon the first, and the other on the third.
528.	In the next place it may be observed, that though the syllable on which the principal accent is placed, is fixed and certain, yet we may, and do frequently make the-secondary principal, and the principal secondary: thus caravan, complaisant, violin, repartee, referee, privateer, domineer, courtezan, artizan9 charlatan, may all have the greatest stress on the first, and the least on the last syllable, without any violent offence to the ear: nay, it may be asserted, that the principal accent on the first syllable of these words, and none at all on the last, though certainly improper, has nothing in it grating or discordant; but placing an accent on the second syllable of these words would entirely derange them, and produce an intolerable harshness and dissonance. The same observations may be applied to demonstration, lamentation, provocation, navigator, propagator, alligator, and every similar word in the language. But, as we have observed, No 526, the consonants t, d, c, and s, after the secondary accent, are exactly under the same predicament as after the primary; that is, if they are followed by a diphthong or diphthongal vowel, these consonants are pronounced like sh, tsh, zh, or j, as aentcntiosity, partiality, 8cc. (526).
QUANTITY.
529.	In treating this part of pronunciation, it will not be necessary to enter into the nature of that quantity which constitutes poetry; the quantity here considered will be that which relates to words taken singly; and this is nothing
