qtJ» This word has been in vrry general use for near twenty years, and has not yet found its wav into any of our Dictionaries. From the recent introduction of this word, one should be led to believe, that England was, till lately, a stranger to this species of fraud j but that it should be im|>orted to that country bv so honest a people as the Germans, is still more surprising. That a language is a map of the science and manners ofthe people who speak it willscarce-1v be questioned tf> those who consider t he origin and .progress of the hitman understanding ; ami if so, it is impossible that the manners should not influence the language, ami that the language should not correspond to the manners. From this reasoning therefore we may conclude, that the faith of traffick was more sacred in England than in Germany, though Gcr-. moiiy-niigbt in other respects be less vicious than England.
