AU our lexicographers, except Dr. Johnson, place tfie accent on the sccond syllable of this word; and this accentuation, it must be confessed, is agreeable to the best usage. But Dr. Johnson’s accentuation on the first syllable is unquestionably the most agreeable to English analogy; first, because it is a trisyllable and a simple (503) ; next, because it is derived from the I-atin De-crctalis ; which, in our pronunciation of it, has an accent on the first and third syllable ; and therefore, when adopted into our language, by dropping the last syllable* takes the accent on the first See Academy. That this is the general analogy of accenting words from the Latin which drop the last syllable, is evident from the words Decrement, Increment, Interval, &c.
