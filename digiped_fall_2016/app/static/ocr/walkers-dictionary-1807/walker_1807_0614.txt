QCj* Scarcely any word has occasioned more altercation among verb.v; criticks than this. A great appearance oi prop ’eij seems to favour the second pronunciation, till we observe a great number of similar words, where the long vowel 111 the sim-* pie is shortened in the com^o>.nd, and then we perceive something like an idiom of pronunciation, which, to correct, would, in some measure, obstruct the current of the language. To preserve tiie simple without alteration, in the compound, is certainly a desirable thing in language ; but when the general tvuie of the language, as it may be called, crosses this analog}, we may depend on the rectitude of general custom, and ought to acquiesce in it That t**e secondary accent shortens the vowel, which was long in the original, appears throughout the language in proclamation, provocation, Sec. (530) : That the primary accent does the same in prtjace, prelate, prelu te% Sec. is evident; and as ledge is no general termination of our own, which is applicable to several words, why should we not consider knowledge as a simple, and pronounce it independently on its original quantity I The patrons for the first pronunciation are, Mr. Sheridan, Dr. Kenrick, Mr. Nares, Mr. Barclay, Mr. Elphinston, and Mr. Scott; and for the second, W. Johnston, and Mr. Buchanan. Mr. Peny gives both, but seems to allow the first the preference.—See Principles, No. 328,515. Knuckle, nfik'kl. s. (399) (405).
