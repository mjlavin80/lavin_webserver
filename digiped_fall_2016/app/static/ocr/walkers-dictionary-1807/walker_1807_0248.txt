Mr. Sheridan is the only orthoepist who accents this word on the first syllable as I have done; and yet every other lexicographer, who has the word, accents Anorexy, Ataxyy and Artaraxy, on the first syllable, •xcept Mr. Sheridan, who accents Anorexy, and Baily Ataxy on the penultimate.— Whence this variety and inconsistency should arise, it is not easy to determine. Or-thodory and Apoplexy had sufficiently chalked out the analogy of accentuation in these words. The terminations in axy and e.ry do not form a species of words which may be •ailed enclitieal, like/og^ and %raphy(5 17), but seem to be exactly under the predicament of those Latin and Greek words, which, when adopted into English by dropping their last sy liable,remove the accent at least two syllables higher.—See Academy.
