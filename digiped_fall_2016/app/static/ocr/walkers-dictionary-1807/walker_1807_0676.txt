(£j* Dr. Johnson says this word has a kind of reciprocal sense. I mistake is like the French Jc me trompe: I am mistaken9 means I misconceive, 1 am in an errovr, more frequently than I am ill understood; but, my opinion is mistaken, means my opinion is not rightly understoodWhatever may have been the cause of- this irregularity, it has long been an eye-sore to our Grammarians, but has got such possession of the languge as to render it almost incurable. Let us avoid it as much as we will in speaking and writing, it will still remain upon our books as a part of the language.
