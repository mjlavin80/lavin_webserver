PRONUNCIATION OF THE CONSONANT	xciii
accent: thus we see why busy, bousy, lousy, and drowsy, have the s like z, and jealousy the sharp hissing s.
439.	S, in the termination sidle, when preceded by a vowel, is pronounced
like z, as persuasible, risible, visible, divisible, infusible, conclusible ; but if a liquid consonant precede the s, the * then becomes sharp and hissing, as sensible, responsible, tensible, reversible, &c.	'
440.	in the terminations aary and *on/, is sharp and hissing, as dispensary, adversary, smsory, fiersuasory, decisory, incisory, derisory, depulsory, comftulsory, incensory, compensory, suspensory, sensory, resfiomory, cursory, discursory, lusory, elusory, delusory, illusory, coltusory. Rosary and misery, which have the * like
2,	are the only exceptions.
441.	S, in the termination i*e, is pronounced like z, except in the adjectives
before mentioned, and a few substantives, such as paradise,	, nw, gr/tfe, ver-
digrise, mortise, travise.
442.	in the terminations «o/ and «?/, when preceded by a vowel, is pronounced like z, as nasal, ousel, housel, nousal, reprisal, proposal, refusal, and sharp and hissing when preceded by a consonant, as mensal, universal, &c.
443.	in the terminations sow, sen, and «?n, is pronounced like z, as reason, seusoti, treason, cargason, clia/iason, orison, benison, venison, deiuson, foison, poison, prison, damson, crimson, chosen, rew’w, r&«/«, raisin, cousin. But the « in mason, bason, garrison, caparison, comparison, parson, and person, is sharp and hissing.
W .	.	.	.
444.	after the inseparable prepositions //re and /iro, is sharp, as in presage9 preside, presidial, preseance, presension, prosecute, prosecution, prosody, firosopo-peia, but flat like z in presence, president, presidency, presume, presumfitivc, presumption ; but where the /ire is prefixed to a word which is significant when alone, the * is always sharp, as presuppose, pre-surmise, See.
445.	5 after the inseparable preposition re, is almost always pronounced like r, as resemble, resent, resentment, reserve, resen>ation, reservoir, residue, resident, residentiary, reside, resign, resignment, resignation, resilience, resiliency, resilition, resin, mrV, resistance, resolve, resolution, resolute, result, resume, resumption, resurrection.
446.	5 is sharp after re in resuscitation, resupination, Etc. and when the word added to it is significant by itself, as research, resiege, reseat, rcsurvey. Thus to
with the # like z, signifies to yield up ; but to re-sign, to sign again, has the * sharp, as in : so to resound, to reverberate, has the a like z ; l)ut to resound, to sound again, has the « sharp and hissing.
447.	Thus we see, after pursuing this letter through all its combinations, how difficult it often is to decide by analogy, when we are to pronounce it sharp and hissing, and when flat like z. In many cases it is of no great importance : in others it is the distinctive mark of a vulgar or a polite pronunciation. Thus
*	detign is never heard with the s like z but among the lowest order of the people ; and yet there is not the least reason from analogy why we should not pronounce it in this manner, as well as in resign: the same may be observed of fireside and demt, which have the s sharp and hissing; and reside and resist, where the same letter is pronounced like z. It may, however, be remarked, that re has the s like z after it more regularly than any other of the prefixes.
448.	It may, perhaps, be worthy of observation, that though s becomes sharp or flat, as it is followed by a sharp or flat consonant, or a liquid, as cosmetic, dismal, disband, disturb, &c. yet if it follows a liquid or a flat consonant, except in the same syllable, it is generally sharp. Thus the s in tubs, suds, 8cc. is like z ; hut in subserve, subside, subsist, it is sharp and hissing : and though it is flat in absolve, it is sharp in absolute and absolution ; but if a sharp consonant preccde,
