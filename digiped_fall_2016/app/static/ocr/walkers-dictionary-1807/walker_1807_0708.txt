ridan, Dr. Kenrick, Mr. Scott, W. Johnston, Barclay, and Entick, place the accent on the first syllable ! and my observation fails me if there is not a strong propensity in custom to place the accent on the first syllable of the word in question. This propensity, as there is a plain analogy in favour of it, ought, in my opinion, to be indulged. To indurate is a verb derived from the Latin induro, forming its participle in atus ,* and words of this kind are generally anglicised by the termination ate, and have the accent at least as high as the antepenultimate : thus from depur o, prop ago, desolo, 8cc. are formed to depurate, to propagatef to desolate, &c.; and, without recurring to the Latin induratus, we form the regular participle indurated, from the verb to indurate. But though there is the Latin verb obduro, we have not formed an English verb from it in as in the former case, butclerivethe adjective obdurate from the Latin participial adjective obduratus ; ancl no analogy can be more uniform than that of removing the accent two syllables higher than in the original: thus desperate, profligate, and defecate, have the accent on the first syllable : and desptratus, profiga-tus, drfcccatus, on the third. Agreeably, therefore, to every analogy of derivation, Muratc ought to have the accent on the first syllable ; and as poets have adopted the other accentuation, we must, as in medicinal, and some other words, admit of a poetical and prosaic pronunciation, rather than cross so tlear an analogy in favour of poetry, which is so frequently at variance with prose, and sometimes with itself—See Academy and IncomparaBLE.

(O* The o which forms the first syllable of this word, though not under the accent, may occasionally be pronounced as long and open as the o in ovaI, oxter, &c. (see E f face) i and though in rapid pronunciation it admits of a short obscure sound, common to some of the other vowels when unaccented, yet its radical sound, or that which it acquires on the loast distinctness

or solemnity, is undoubtedly the long* open
o	before mentioned. Thus in that fugitive pronunciation which has no existence but in the ear, and can hardly be expressed to the eye by a correspondent sound, we perceive very little difference in the sound of the initial vowels of abound, upbraid, and obedience yet the moment we dwell with the least distinctness on these letters, the a in abound verges to the a in father; the u has the short sound we hear in the preposition up; and the o in obedience becomes open, SB the first Bound of that letter in the aljphabet. The same may be observed of the o in opaque, opinion, and every initial o ending a syllable immediately before the accent.-—See Principles,No. 98* Obedient, 6-b&'j£-£nt a.

Xj* I must retract my former pronunciation of this word which made the diphthongei like e in obedience, and adopt the sound of a as in the ey of obey. For the former sound we have Mr. Sheridan, Hr. Kenrick, and Mr. Perry ; and forthc latter, Mr. Nares,. Mr. Elphinston, Mr. Scott, and W. Johnston. But if the authorities for this pronunciation were less weighty than they ore,, analogy would be clearly on the side I have adopted, as a, when under the accent, is imieh more frequently pronounced like ey in obey, than Kke ey in key .• the latter word and ley being the only exceptions to tlie general rul£ of pronouncing ey when accented ; and these letters we know arc perfectly equivalent to ei.
