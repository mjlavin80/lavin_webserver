PRONUNCIATION OF THE CONSONANTS J?, &
with great propriety. Children and hundred have slid into this analogy, when used colloquially, but preserve the r before the e in solemn speaking.
418.	As this letter is but a jar of the tongue, sometimes against the roof of the mouth, and sometimes at the orifice of the throat, it is the most imperfect of all the consonants ; and, as its formation is so indefinite, no wonder, when it is not under the accent, that the vowels which precede it should be so indefinite in their sounds, as we may pcrceive in the words friar, tier, elixir, nadir, mayor, martyr, which, with respect to 90und, might be written frrur, liur, eKxury nadurr mayitr, martur. (98). These inaccuracies in pronunciation, says an ingenious writer, 4 we seem to have derived from our Saxon ancestors. Dr. Hicks ob-« serves in the first chapter of his Saxon Grammar, that “ Comparativa apud
eos (Anglo-saxones) indifferenter exeunt in ar, er, er, ir, or, ur, yr * et Su-“ pcrlativa in a&t, eat, eat, iat, oat, uat, yat ; participia praesentis temporis in and, “ end, endjind, ond, und, ynd; prsetcriti vero in adr ed, id, od, ud, yd ; pro vario u scilicet vel xvi vel loci aialecto.” ‘ Upon various other occasions also they 6 used two or more vowels and diphthongs indifferently; and this not always 4 from difference of age or place, because these variations are frequently found
4	in the same page. This will account for the difference between the spelling 6 and pronunciation of such anomalous words as busy and bury, now pronounced
4	as if written biay and bery, (the i and e having their common short sound,) and c formerly spelt indifferently with e, u, or y * Eeaay on the Harmony qf Language. Robson, 1774.
419.	There is a distinction in the sound of this letter, scarcely ever noticed by any of our writers on the subject, which is, in my opinion, of no small importance ; and that is, the rough and smooth r. Ben Jonson, in his Grammar, says it is sounded firm in the beginning of words, and more liquid in the middle and ends* as in rarer, rifier ; and so in the Latin. The rough r is formed by jarring the tip of the tongue against the rough of the mouth near the fore teeth: the smooth r is a vibration of the lower part of (he tongue, near the root, against the inward region of the palate, near the entrance of the throat. This latter r is that which marks the pronunciation of England, and the former that of Ireland. In England, and particularly in London, the r in lard, bardy card, regard, &c. is pronounced so much in the throat as to be little more than the middle or Italian a, lengthened into baad, baad, caad, rcgaad; while in Ireland the r, in these words, is pronounced with so strong a jar of the onguc against the forepart of the palate, and accompanied with such an aspiration or strong breathing at the beginning of the letter, as to produce that harshness we call the Irish accent. But if this letter is too forcibly pronounced in Ireland, it is often too feebly sounded in England, and particularly in London, where it is sometimes entirely stink ; and it may. perhaps, be worthy of observation, that, provided we avoid a too forcible pronunciation of the r, when it ends a word, or is followed by a consonant in the same syllable, we may give as much force as we please to this letter at the brginning of a word, without producing any harshness to the ear: thus Rome, river, rage, may have the r as forcible as in Ireland ; but ben bard, card, hardy &c. must have it nearly as soft as in London.
420.	As the former letter was a jar, this is a hiss; but a hiss which forms a much more definite and complete consonant than the other. This consonant, like the other mutes, has a sharp and a flat sound; the sharp sound is heard in the name of the letter, and in the words mme, tin, tkh ; the flat sound is that
