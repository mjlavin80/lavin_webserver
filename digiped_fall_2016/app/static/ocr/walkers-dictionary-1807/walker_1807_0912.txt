It It is with some reluctance I have given this word, as Dr. Johnson has written it, a place in this Dictionary ; not brcause it is not generally pronounced in this manner, but that I think conforming our spelling to a prevailing pronunciation, when this pronunciation is contrary to analogy, is pregnant with the greatest evils thal can happen to a language. While the original landmark is standing, the true proprietor may claim his rights ; but when once that is effaced, there is no hope of a resumption. How Dr. Johnson could remove this landmark is astonishing. It is one of those unaccountable absurdities that sometimes enter into the cbaractcrs of men, whose understandings are os much above the rest of the world in 6ome things, as they are below them in others. The truth is, tbi* great man troubled himself little about pronunciation, he seems to have cared as little for etymologies; and even grammatical disquisitions seem not to have been his favourite study ; but when words were to be precisely defined, when the boundaries of their significations were to be fixed, and their most delicate shades of meaning to be distinguished and exemplified; this task, so difficult to the strongest mind, seemed to present him with an operation worthy of his powers: in this labour he was, indeed, a literary Hercules, and in this he has toiled with honour to himself, and to the essential improvement of the English language.
