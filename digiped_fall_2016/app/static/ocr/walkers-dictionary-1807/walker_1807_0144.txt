I have differed from Mr. Sheridan in marking tbe ss in this word; and, I think, with the best usage on my side. Though double*is almost always pronounced sharp and hissing, yet when a sharp s precedes, it seems more agreeable to the ear to pronounce tbe succeeding t flat. Thus, though the termination ition is always sharp, yet ^because the * iu transition is necessarily sharp, the t goes into tbe flat sound, as if written transizhion, which see.

lu the first edition of this Dictionary I followed the acceutuationof Johnson and Ash in this word, and placed the stress upon the tirst syllable, contrary to what 1 had done some years before in the Rhyming Dictionary, where 1 bad placed the accent on the second, and which was the accentuation adopted by Mr. Sheridan. Upotf a nearec inspection ot the analogies of the language, J lind this the preferable mode of marking it, as words ia this termination, though very irregular, generally follow the stress of the corresponding noun or verb; and consequently this word ought to have tbe q«nu» accent as absolve, which is the more immediate relation of the word in question, and not the accent of absolute, which is the most distant. (612). Kenrick, W. Johnston, Entick, and Nares, have not inserted this word ; aud Mr. Perry very improperly accents it upon the third syllable. Absonant, &b's6-nant. a. (544). Con* trary to reason.
