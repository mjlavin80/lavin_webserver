407.	M preserves its sound in every word, except comptroller ; comfit and ac-cmfit are now universally written as they are pronounced v count and account; and tnough m and p are preserved to the e> e in the oliicer called a com/uroller^ the word is pronounced exacUy like the noun controller, one who controls.
M *
408.	-Vhas two sounds; the one simple and pure, as in mart, net, fee.; the
other compounded and mixed, as in hang, thank, &c. i ho latter sound is heard when it is followed by the snarp or Hat guttural mutes g hard, or k; or its representatives c uard, or x: but it may be observed, that so prone is our language io Uie Hat mutes, that when n is. followed oy k ; or its repie&entatives, the fiat mute g seems interposed between them: thus thank, banquet, anxious, are pronounced as if written, not than-k, banquet, anxious, but thangk, bungquet, mgk*hu*. But this coalition of the sound ol n and g, or hard c, is only when the accent is on them; for when the g or hard c articulates the accented syllable, the n becomes pure : thus, though congress and congregate are pronounced as if written cong-gress and congregate, yet the first syllable ot congratulate, and cwigrcwve, oug ht to be pronounced without the ringing sound oi n, and exactly like the same syllable in contrary. The same difference may be observed in the words concourse and concur; the first word, which has the accent on the first syllable, is pronounced as if written cong-coursc: and the last, which has the accent on the second syllable, with n pure. It must, however, be carefully ob-ttnred, that the secondary accent has the same power oi melting the n into the succeeding hal'd £ or c as the primary (522;; thus cong, gation and concreination bave the first syllable pronounced as if written cong.	*
409.	It may, perhaps, be worthy of notice, that when n is followed by ky the k has a finished or complete sound, as hi link, think, &c.; but when n is followed by hard g, the g has an unfinished or imperfect sound, as in hang, bang, kc. where we may observe the tongue to rest upon the palate in the sound of I; but whea this letter is carried off to articulate another syllable, its sound is completed, as in anger and hangor (the name of a town), where the sound of g may be perceived to be very different from the noun hanger (a sword j, and kuigcr (one who beats or bangs). This perfect sound of^ is heard in all simples, as anger, angle,finger, linger, conger, a iguish, Languish, distinguish, extinguish, unguent: but in words derived from verbs or adjectives, ending in ng, the g continues imperfect, as it was in the theme. Thus a svger (one who sings), does dot finish the g likz finger, but is merely er added to sing ; the Suine may be observed of singling, bring-i;g, and hanging. So adjectives formed by the addition of y have the imperfect sound of g, as in the original word: thus ^ringy, stringy, dungy, and vringy, are only the sound ot e added to sprit g, stri g, dung, and vtiug ; but the comparative and superlative adjectives,longer, strongtr, and younger; longest, strongest, and youngest; have the g hard and perfectly sounded, as if written long-ger, stronger, \ov?ir-L' % 8cc. where the /? is hard, as in
tin-ger, fee. And it may be looked upor, as a general rule, that nouns,
