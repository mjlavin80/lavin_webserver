1	DIFFERENT	SOUNDS	OF	THE	LETTER	/.
149.	In these words I do not hesitate to pronounce, that the general rule inclines evidently to the long /, which, in doubtful cases, ought always to be followed; and for which reason I shall enumerate those words first where I judge the i ought to be pronounced long: Cannabinc, carrabine, columbine, bizan-tine, gelatine, legatine, oxyrrhodine, concubine, muscadine, incarnadine, celandine, almanaine, secundine, amygdaline, crystalline, vUuUney calamine, asinine, saturnine, saccharine, adulterine, viperine, uterine, lamentine, armentim•, serpentine, turpentine, vespertine, belluine, porcupine, countermine, leonine, sapphirine, and metalline, v 150. The words of this termination, where the i is short, are die following: Jacobine, medicine, discipline, masculine, jessamine, feminine, heroine, nectarine, //&r-ft'ne, genuine, hyaline, palatine. To these, I think, ought to be added, alkaline, aquiline, coralline, brigantine, eglantine: and to this pronunciation of the t, the proper names, Valentine and Constantine, seem strongly to incline ; and on the stage, CymbeHne, has entirely adopted it. Thus we see how little influence the Latin language has on the quantity of the t in the final syllable of these words. It is a rule in that language, that adjectives ending in £&? or derived from animated beings or proper names, to the exception of very few, have this i pronounced long. It were to be wished this distinction could be adopted in English words from the Latin, as in that case we might be able in time to regularize this very irregular part of our tongue; but this alteration would be almost impossible in adjectives ending in n>c, as relative, vocative, fugitive, See. have the
i	uniformly short in English, and long in the Latin rciativus, vocativus, fagitb vus, See.
151.	The only word ending in m*, with the accent on the antepenultimate syllable, is acrospire, with the i long, the last syllable sounding like the s/are of a church.
152.	Words ending in we have the / short, when the accent is on the last syllable but one, as franchise, except the compounds ending in wwe, as likewise, lengthwise, &c. as marked by Mr. Scott, Mr. Perry, and Buchanan: but even among these words we sometimes hear otherwise pronounced otherwiz, as marked by Mr. Sheridan and W. Johnston; but, I think, improperly.
153.	When the accent is on the last syllable but two in these words, they arc invariably pronounced with the i long, as criticise, equalise.
154 In the termination ite, when the accent is on it, the i is always long, as requite. When the accent is on the last syllable but one, it is always short, as respite (140), pronounced as if written respit, except contrite ; but when the accent is on the last syllable but two, the i is generally long: the exceptions, however, are so many, that a catalogue of both will be the best rule.
155.	The tis long in expedite, recondite yincondite, hermaphrodite, Carmelite,theodolite,cosmopolite, chrysolite, eremite, aconite, wargarite, wareasite, parasite,appetite, bipartite, tripartite, quadnfiartite, convertitr, anchorite, fntmte, eaulliie. As the word stands in Kenrick’s Dictionary sa-tell-it, having the i short, and the accent on the second syllabic, it is doubly wrong. The i in the last syllable is shortened also by W. Johnston and Perry, but made long, as it ought to be, by Air. Sheridan, Mr. Scott, and Mr. Nares. Sec Recondite.
156.	The i is short in cucurbite, bigcriite, definite, indfjinitc, infinite, hypocrite, favourite, requisite, prerequisite, p('reunite, exanbite, apposite, and opposite. Hcterodite has the i long in Sheridan, but short in Kcnrick. The former is, in my opinion, the best pronunciation, (see the word in the Dictionary ;) bur ite, in what may be called a Gentile termination, Ms the i always long, as in Hrvite,
am nit (, cosmopvlite, bedlamite, 'See.	t
157.	The termination ive, when the accent is cn it, is always long, as in
