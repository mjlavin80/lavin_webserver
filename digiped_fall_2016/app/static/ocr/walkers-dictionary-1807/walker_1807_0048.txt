DIFFERENT SOUNDS OF THE LETTER I.
Sec.; nay, even when preceded by a liquid in the words fallen and stolen, where the c is suppressed, as if they were wdtten falCn and stoll’n: garden and burden, therefore, are very analogically pronounced gard'n and burd*n: and this pronunciation ought the rather to be indulged, as we always hear the e suppressed in gardener and burdensome, as if written gardener and burd’nxome. Sec No. 472.
104.	This diversity in the pronunciation of these terminations ought the more careiully to be attended to, as nothing is so vulgar and childish as to hear swivel and heaven pronounced with the e distinctly, or novel and chicken with the c suppressed. But the most general suppression of this letter is in the preterits of verbs, and in participles ending in ed: here, when the e is not preceded by d or /, the e is almost universally sunk (362), and the two final consonants are pronounced in one syllable: thus loved, lived, barred, marred, are pronounced as if written, lervd, livd, bard, mard. The same may be observed of this letter when silent in the singulars of nouns, or the first persons of verbs, as rheme, make, Sec. which form themes in the plural, and makes in the third person, kc. where the last e is silent, and the words arc pronounced in one syllable. When the noun or first person of the verb ends in y, with the accent on it, the e is likewise suppressed, as a reply, two re/dies,'he replies, Sec. WThen words of this form have the accent on the preceding syllables, the e is suppressed and the y pronounced like short /, as cherries, marries, carries, See. pronounced cherriz, marriz, carriz, Sec. In the same manner, earned, married, embodied, See. are pronounced as if written earn'd, nam’d, enibodid, See. (282). But it must be carefully noted, that there is a remarkable exception to many of these conti*actions when we are pronouncing the language of Scripture : here every participial ed ought to make a distinct syllabic, where it is not preceded by a vowel: thus, w W'ho hath believed our report, and to u whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?” Here the participles arc both pronounced in throe syllables ; but in the following passage, “ Whom he did “ predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justiji-u ed; and whom he justified, them he also glorifiedcalled preserves the ef and is pronounced in two syllables; and justified and glorified suppress the t, ;jnd are pronounced in three.

105.	This letter is a perfect diphthong, composed of the sounds of a in fa~
•	her, and e in //<■, pronounced as closely together as possible (37). When these sounds are openly pronounced, they produce the familiar assent ay: which, by the old English dramatic ^liters, was often expressed by I: hence we may' observe, that unless our ancestors pronounced the vowel I like the o in oil, the present pronunciation of the word ay in the House of Commons, in the phrase the Ayes have it, is contrary to ancient as well as to present usage : such a pronunciation of this word is now coarse and rusde. This sound is heard when the letter is lengthened by final ey as time, thine, or ending a syllable with the accent upon it, as tM*, di-il; in monosyllables ending vuth nd, as bind, find, mind, Sec.; in three words ending with Id, as child, mud, wild; and in one very irregularly ending with nt* as pint. (37).
106.	There is one instance where this letter, though succeeded by final e, does not go into the broad English sound like the noun eye, but into the slender foreign sound like e. This is in the word shire, p’ronounced as if written sheer, both when single, as a knight of the shire ; or in composition, as in ^•Itmgbmmsbire, Leicestershire, &c. This is the sound Dr. Lowth gives it in
