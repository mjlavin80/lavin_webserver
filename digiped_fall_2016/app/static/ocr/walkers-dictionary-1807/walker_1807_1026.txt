%y In the first edition of this Dictionary 1 accented this word on the first syllable, contrary to the example of Dr. Johnson, Dr. Ash, and Mr. Sheridan; but, upon a fevisal of the various analogies x>f accentuation, was inclined to think this accentuation somewhat doubtful. The word 'ccne-no, from which this is formed, has the penultimate long1; and in verbs of this termination, derived from the Latin; and preserving the same number of syllables, we often preserve the same accent, as in mrietate, coacervate, denigrate, &c.; but this is so often neglected in favour of the antepenultimate accent, as in decorate, de-Jatigate, delegate, desolate, &c. that general usage seems evidently leaning to this side; and as in perpetrate and emigrate, from perpetro, and emigro, where the penultimate vowel is doubtful, we' always place the accent on the antepenultimate ; so in this and similar words, where custom does not decide, I would always recommend a similar accentuation. .

Mr. Sheridan pronounces H in three; Dr. Kenrick gives it in three, but tells us it is usually heard in two. Mr. Scott gives it both ways i Mr. Perry only as it is contracted; and Mr. Elphinstofi supposes the i in this word, as much lost as in buxine**.
It is highly probable this corruption is of long standing; for though Shakspeare, in A* You Like It, says,
" Come, shall we go and kill us veniroa 7* Yet Chapman pronounces this word in two syllables.
"	“ To our ven*on9* store	‘
“ We added wine till we could wish no “ more.”
And Dryden after him,
“ JUe for the feast prepar’d, u In equal portions with the ven’son shar’d.v To these instances we may add an excellent poet of our own time:
“ Gorgonius sits abdominous and wan,
“ Like a fat squab upona Chinese fan;
“ He snuffs far off th* anticipated joy;
“ Turtle and venVoa all his thoughts employ." Poetry will ever consider this word like many othere either as of two or three syllables i but solemn prose, such as the language of scripture, will always give the word its due length. For however we may be accustomed to hear ven’tcn in common conversation, what disgust would it not give us to hear this worxl in the pulpit, when Isaac says to his son :
" Now therefore take I pray thee, thy wea-u pons, thy quiver, and thy bow, and . ** go out to the field, and ta!:e me some wiW. /”
