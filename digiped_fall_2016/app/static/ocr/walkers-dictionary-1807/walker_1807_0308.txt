QCj* Dr. Johnson tells us, that the substantive conjinc was formerly pronounced with the accent on the last syllable. The examples, however, which he gives us from the poets, prove only that it was accented both ways. But, indeed, it is highly probable that this was the case ; for instances are numerous of the propensity of latter pronunciation to place the accent higher than formerly; and when by this accentuation a noun is distinguished from a verb, it is supposed to have its use.—See Bowi..
