tffThe general sound of this word is like tbe verb to bug ; but we not unfrequently tew it pronounced like tbe verb to 6*. This latter sound, however, i' only tolerable in colloquial pronunciation, and then only when used as s preposition; as when we ay, Do you travel by land or by water ? Bat in reading these lines of Pope:
“ By land'iy water, they renew tbe charge j n They stop the chariot, and they board tbe barge.”
