DIRECTIONS to FOREIGNERS,
In order to attain a Knowledge of the Mark* in this Dictionary, and to acquire a right Pronunciation of every Word in the English Language.
As the sounds of the vowels are different in different languages, it would be endless to bring parallel sounds from the various languages of Europe ; but, as the French is so generally understood upon the Continent, if we can reduce the sounds of the English letters to those of the French, we shall render the pronunciation of our language very generally attainable ; and this, it is presumed) will be pretty accurately accomplished by observing the following directions:

The French have all our vowel sounds, and will therefore find the pronunciation of them very easy. The only difficulty they will meet with seems to be which, though demonstrably composed of two successive sounds, has passod for a simple vowel with a very competent judge of English pronunciation *. The reason is, these two sounds are pronounced so closely together as to require some attention to discover their component parts: this attention Mr. Sheridan t never gave, or he would not have told us that this diphthong is a compound of our fullest and slenderest sounds k and £ ; the first made by the largest, and the last by the smallest aperture of the mouth. Now nothing is more certain than the inaccuracy of this definition. The third sound of o, which is perfectly equivalent to the third sound of o. when combined with the first sound of e9 must inevitably form the diphthong in Aoy, joy See. and not the diphthongal sound of the vowel / in id e« and the personal pronoun I; this double sound will, upon a close examination, be found to be composed of the Italian a in the last syllable of fut**a^ and the first sound of' - pronounced as closcly together as possible |; and for the exactness of this definition, I appeal to every just English ear in the kingdom.	’
The other diphthongal vowel u is composed of the French r\ pronounced as closely as possible to their diphthong ou. or the English ££ and 6, perfectly equivalent to the sound the French would give to the letters you* and which is exactly the sound the English give to the plural of the second personal pronoun.
The diphthong oi or ou is composed of the French a and i; thus toy and boy would be exactly expressed to a Frenchman by writing them tax and bdi.
The diphthongs ou and env, when sounded	like ow,	are	composed of the

syllable, or part of a syllable,) composed of	/, or e,	/, and not	a	simple original vowel.”
