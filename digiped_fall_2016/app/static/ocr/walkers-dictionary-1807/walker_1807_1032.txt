In this tribe of words we find a manifest difference between the simple villain and the compounds villany, villanous, &c. Dr. Johnson tells us, these words are derived From tlie French villain, or the low Latin villanu*. Sometimes we find the word in question written villanny »• and it is certain, that it either ought to be writ' ten so from the old French villqnnie, with double I and double n, or from the modem French with these letters single : or if we must form it from our own word villain, (which we seldom choose to do if we can discover tlie most remote relation to other languages ;) in this case*, I say, we ought according to our own analogy, to spell the word villainy.	,
