£3* We frequently hear disputes whether this word should be pronounced in four syllables# as it is here, with the accent on the second ; or in three, as if divided into an-ti-}>o lrst with the accent on the first syllable, and the last rhyming with abodes. To solve the difficulty, it must be observed, that the word is pure Latin; and that when we adopt such words into our own languasro, we seldom alter the accent. It', indeed, the singnlar of this word were in use like saleUife (155), then we ouzht to form the plural regularly, and pronounce it in three syllables only; but as it is always used in the plural, and is perfect Latin, we ousht to pronounce it in four.
