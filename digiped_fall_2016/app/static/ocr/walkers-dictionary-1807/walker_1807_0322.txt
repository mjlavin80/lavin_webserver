In the first edition of this Dictionary I followed Mr. Sheridan’s accentuation of this word upon the first syllable, as I apprehended it was more agreeable to polite usage, though less agreeable to the ear than the accent on the second; but from a farther inquiry, and a review of the authorities for hot: , I am strongly persuaded in f avour of the latter accentuation. For the former we have Sheridan, Ash, W. Johnston, and Entick ; and for the latter, Dr. Johnson, Kertrick, Nares, Scott, Per-
1 ry, Buchanan, and Bailey. The other accentuation seems chiefly adopted by the poets, who should not be deprived of their privilege of altering the accents of some words to accommodate them to the verse : “ For ’twere a sin to rob them of their mite.”	Pope.

There are such considerable authorities for each of these pronunciations as rendee a decision on that ground somewhat difficult. Dr. Johnson, Dr. Ash, Dr. Ken.-nek, Mr. Perry, Buchanan, and Bailey, place the accent on the second sellable ; and Mr. Nares, W. Johnston, and Entick, accent the first. Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Scott place it on both, and consequently leave it undecided. Analogy seems to demand the stress on the second syllable j perhaps not so much from the relation th© word bears to the verb to converse, since it may possibly be derived from the noun converse, (492), as from the very general rule of accenting words of three syllables, that are not simples in our language, on the second syllable when two consonant* occur in the middle. This rule, however, is frequently violated in favour of the antepenultimate accent, (the favourite accent of our language), as in Aggrandize, Amnesty, chAracter, cSnvertite, Ancestor, mAgistrate, pr6testant9 8tc.; and where there is but one consonant in the middle, nothing is more common than to find the accent of the dissyllable verb neglected, and the trisyllable noun adopting tlie antepenultimate accent. Thus the words Cen-Jidenty President, Provident, &c. are not accented like the veibs Confide, Preside, &c. See. but are considered as simples, and follow the general rule; which is, that all simples of three syllables, with but one consonant in the middle, have the accent on the first, and that the vowel in this syllable is short. (503). Upon the whole, therefore, since authorities are so equal and analogy so precarious, usage must be the umpire; and my observation fails me if that which maybe c ailed the best usage does not decide in favourof the accent on the first syllable.
