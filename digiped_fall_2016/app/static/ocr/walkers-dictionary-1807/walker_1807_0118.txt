cxii	ENCLITICAL	ACCENT.
would be in pronouncing such long words with so many unaccented syllables at the end, if we were to iay the accent on the first Word? ending in ctrvr have the accent regularly on the penultimate syllable, except adjective, which, like indicative, being a grammatical word, seems to have taken its accent in>m,the secondary stress of the Latin adjectivus (see Academy) ; and every word ending in tive, preceded by a consonant, has the accent on the penultimate syllable likewise, except wJbetontive ; and, perhaps, for the reason just given. After all, it must be owned, that words ending in ative and atory are the most irregular and desultory of any in the language ; as they are generally accented very far from the end, they are the most difficult to pronounce ; and therefore, whenever usage will permit, we should incline the stress as much as possible to the latter syllables: thus refractory ought never to have the accent on the first syllable ; but refectory, with the accent on the first, is a school term, and, like *ub-ttantive, adjective, indicative, and interrogative, must be left in quiet possession of their Latin secondary accent.
Enclitical Accent.
513.	I have ventured to give the name of enclitical to the accent of certai*
words, whose terminations are formed of such words as seem to lose their own accent, and throw it back on the last syllable of the word with which they coalesce, such as theology, orthography, 8tc. The readiness with which these words take the antepenultimate accent, the agreeable flow of sound to the ear, and the unity it preserves in the sense, are sufficient proofs of the propriety of placing the accent on this syllable, if custom were ambiguous. I do not remember to have heard the accent disputed in any word ending in ology; but orthography is not unfrequently pronounced with the accent on the first syllable, like orthodoxv. The temptation we are under to discover our knowledge of the component parts of words, is very apt to draw us into this pronunciation; but as those words which are derived from the Greek, and are compounded of Xoyo* have universally given into this enclitical accentuation, no good reason appears for preventing a similar pronunciation in those compounded of	as by placing the
accent on the antepenultimate syllable the word is much more fluent and agreeable to tho ear. It is certain, however, that at first sight the most plausible reasoning in the world seems to lie against this accentuation. When we place the accent on the first syllable, say our opponents, we give a kind of subordinate stress to the third syllable graph: by which means the word is divided into its primitives o^0os* and	and those distinct ideas it contains are preserved,
wliich must necessarily be confounded by the contrary mode ; and that pronunciation of compounds, say they, must certainly be the best wliich best preserves the import of the simples.
514.	Nothing can be more specious than this reasoning, till we look a little higher than language, and consider its object; we shall then discover, that in uniting two words under one accent, so as to form one compound term, we do but imitate the superior operations of the mind, which, in order to collect and convey knowledge, unites several simple ideas into one complex one. w The end of language,” says Mr. Locke, u is by short sounds to signify with
11	ease and dibpatch general conceptions, wherein not only abundance of par* “ ticulars are contained, but also a great variety of independent ideas are col* u lected into one complex one, and that which holds these different parts to* “ gether in the unity of one complex idea, is the word we annex to it.” Fcjy as Mr. Lockc continues, u Men, in framing ideas, seek more the convenience
