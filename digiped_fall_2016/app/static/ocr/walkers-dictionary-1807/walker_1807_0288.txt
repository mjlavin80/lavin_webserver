aiund. The word Stabling and Stabler, for •stable-keeper in Scotland, with the word Fabled in Milton, all present their true sound to the eye without knowing their primitives; and this essential rule has generated the double consonant in the participles and verbal nouns, beginning, regretted, complotter, &c. But this rule, rational and useful as it is, is athousand times violated by an affectation of a knowledge of the learned languages, and an ignorant prejudice against clusters of consonants, as they are called. Thus couple, trouble, double, treble, and triple, have single consonants, because their originals in Latin and French have no more, though double consonants would fix the sound of the preceding vowels, and be merely double to the eye.
