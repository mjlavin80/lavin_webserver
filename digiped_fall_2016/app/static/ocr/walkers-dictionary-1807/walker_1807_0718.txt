Ophthalmick, 6p-fA41'mlk. a. Relating to the eye.	#
Two aspirations in succession, says Mr. Elphinston, seem disagreeable to an English ear, and therefore one of them is generally sunk. Thus diphthong and triphthong are pronounced dipthong and trip-thong. P is lost as well as n in apophthegm / and therefore it is no wonder we hear the first h dropped in ophthalmy and ophthal-mick, which is the pronunciation I have adopted as agreeable to analogy. Nay, such an aversion do we seem to have to a succession of aspirates, that the h is sunk in Isthmus, Esther, and Demosthenes, because the s, which is akin to the aspiration, immediately precedes. Mr. Sheridan pronounces the first syllable of this word like off, but the first of diphthong and triphthong, like dip and trip. Mr. Scott, W. Johnston, ana Mr. Perry, have “ not got this word, but pronounce diphthong and triphthong in the same manner as Mr. Sheridan. Dr. Kenrick also wants the word; he gives no pronunciation to diphthong, but makes the h silent in triph-thongi while Barclay pronounces the h in ophthalmick, but makes it either way in diphthong, and silent in triphthong. It may be remarked, that Dr. Jones, who ' wrote a Spelling Dictionary in Queen Anne’s time, makes the h in these two words silent.	#
