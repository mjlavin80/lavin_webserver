Jonson, who says, ihityeotnan, people, and jeopardy, were truer written ytnvan, ptple,
. jtpardy. But \V. Johnsto:i, Mr. Perry, " Entick and Fry, pronounce the co like long open o, as it* written yort^an .* aud this last appears to me to be tue most received pronunciation. It is that which we constantly hear applied to the King's body guard, and it is that which lias always been the pronunciation on the Sta^e ; an authority which in this case, may not, perhaps, improperly be called the best echo of the pub-lick voice.' I well remember hearing Mr. Garrick pronounce the word in this manner, in a speech in King Lear i “ Tell me, “ fellow, is a madman a gentleman, or a “ydtnan?”

(jrJ’ This word is worn into a somewhat slenderer sound than what i9 authorized by the orthography ; but e and i are frequently interchangeable, and few changes can be better established than this. W. Johnston and Mr. Perry, are the onl^ orthoe-pists who give the sound of the vowels, that do not taark this change j but Mr.
-	Sheridan, Mr. Scott, Dr. Kenrick, Mr. Nares, Mr. Smith, and Dr. Jones in his New Art of Spelling, confirm this change, and rhyme k with his, miss, blits, &c.— See Been and Despatch.
Yest, y6st. s. The foam, spume, or flowerof beer in fermentation, barm ; the spume on a troubled sea. qfj* Dr. Johnson has very properly spelled this word yest, from the Saxon gest, and not yeast as we sometimes see it; and this spelling decides its pronunciation. Dr. Jones spells it yeast, and gives the diphthong its long sound; Mr. Nares pronounces the word in the same manner, but spells it yest ; Dr. Kenrick spells it yett, but rhymes it with mist; Mr. Barclay pronounces it yeest ,• Mr. Perry writes it yiast, and yUt; but Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Scott, and Mr. Smith, write it as Dr. Johnson has done, and pronounce it as I have done ; and I think not only more agreeable to analogy, which forbids us to pronounce e long, when followed by tt in the same syllable, (see Lest,) but, if 1 mistake notK more consonant to polite
usage. The vulgar do not only pronounce the diphthong long, but siok the y, and reduce the word to east.

Yester DAT, y£s'tfir-dii. s. The day last past, the next day before to-day.
I (£j* Though yes, from its coutinoal use, ii
1 allowably worn into the somewhat easier sound ot yis, there is no reason why yesterday should adopt the same change; and though I cannot pronounce tliis chaise vulgar,' since Mr. Sheridan, Dr. Kenrick, Mr. Nares, and Mr. Scott, have adopted it, 1 do not hesitate to pronounce the regular sound given by W. Johnston as the more correct, and agreeable to the best usage Yesternight, y£s'tiir-nite. s. Tie night before this night.
Yet, y£t. conjunct Nevertheless, notwithstanding, however.
OCj* The e in this word 19 frequently changed by incorrect speakers into i ,* but though this change is agreeable to the best and most established usage in the word yes i myet it is the mark of incorrectness and vulgarity.
Dr. Kenrick is the only orthoepist who gives any countenance to this incorrectness, by admitting it as a second pronunciation; bat Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Scott, W. Johnston, Mr. Perry, and Mr. Smith, give the regular sound only.
Yet, ygt. ad. Beside, oyer and above; still, the state still remaining the same ; once again; at this time, so soon, hitherto, with a negative before it; at least: it notes increase or extension of tbe sense of the words to which it is joined; still, in -anew degree ; even, after all; hitherto.
