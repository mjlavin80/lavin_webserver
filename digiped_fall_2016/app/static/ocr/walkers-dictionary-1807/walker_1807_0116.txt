TERMINATIONAL ACCENT.
rigidly preserve, and so strongly convey the sense of words, as that wh»di always left the accent on the root, where the principal meaning of the word undoubtedly lies ? but the necessities of human nature require that our thoughts should not only be conveyed with force, but with ease; to give language its due effect, it must be agreeable as well as forceful; and the ear must be addressed while we are informing the mind. Here, then, termination^ accent, the mu* sic of language, interposes; corrects the discordant, and strengthens the feeble sounds; removes the difficulty of pronunciation which arises from placing the accent on initial syllables, and brings the force gently down to the latter part of the word, where a cadence is formed, on the principles of harmony and proportion.	.
505.	To form an idea of the "influence of termination upon accent, it will be sufficient observe, that words which have ei, ia, ie, ey, eou, in their termination, always have the accent on the preceding syllable: thusatheist,alien, regaMa,am* brotda, See. the numerous terminations in ionium, Sec. as gradation, promotion, confusion, logician, physician, Sec. those in ious, as harmonious, abstentious, ficc. those in eous, as outrageous, advantageous, &c. These .may not improperly be styled semiconsonant diphthongs. (196).
506.	The only exceptions to this rule are one word in vac, as elegiac, which has the accent on the i, and the following words in iacal, as prosodiacal, cardia-cal, heliacal, genethliacaL, maniacal, demoniacal, ammoniacal, theriacal, paradisiacal, aphrodisiacal, and hypochondriacal; all which have the accent on the antepenul* dmate i, and that long and open, as in idle, title, See*
507.	Nothing can be more uniform than the position of the accent in words
of these terminations, and, with very few exceptions, the quantity of th© accented vowel is as regular as the accent; for when these terminations are preceded by a single consonant, every accented vowel is long, except i; which, in this situation, is as uniformly short: thus occasion, adhesion, erosion, and confusion, have the a, e, o, and u, long; while vision and decision have the i short. The same may be observed of probation, concretion, devotion, ablution, and exhibition. The exceptions are, impetuous, especial, perpetual, discretion and battalion, which last ought to be spelt with double /, as in the French, from which it is derived, and then it would follow the general rule. National and rational, form two more exceptions; and these are almost the only irregularities to which these numerous classes of words are subject.	’
503.	Nearly the same uniformity, both of accent and quantity, we find in jrords ending in ic. The accent immediately precedes this termination, and every vowel under this accent but u is short; thus Satanic, pathetic, eliptic, harmonic, See. have the accent on the penultimate, and the vowel short; while tunic, runic, and cubic, have the accented vowel long.
509. The same maybe observed of words ending in ical, fanatical, poetical, levitical, canonical, Sic. which have the accent on the antepenultimate syllable, and the vowels e, /, and o, short; but cubical and mudcal, with the accent on the same syllable, have the u long.
510.	The only exceptions to this rule are arxeme, choleric, ephemcric, turmeric, empiric, rhetoric, bishopric (better written bishoprick, see No. 400), lunatic, arithmo tic, splenetic, heretic,politic, and perhaps phlegmatic; which, though more frequently heard with the acccnt on the antepenultimate syllable, ought, if possible, to be reduced to regularity. Words ending in scence have uniformly the accent on the penultimate syllable, as quiescence, reminiscence, See.; concupiscence, which has the accent on the antepenultimate, is the only exception.
511.	In the same manner, if we take a view of the words ending in tty, **
