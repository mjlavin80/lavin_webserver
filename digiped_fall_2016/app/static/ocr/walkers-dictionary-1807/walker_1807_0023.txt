difference lying in the quantity. The short o in not, ledge, got, See. is apt to slide into the short u% as if the words were written nut, ludgt. gui. &c. To rectify this, it should be remembered, that this ^ is the short sound of aw. and ought to have the radical sound of the deep a in bad. Thus the radical sound corresponding to the o in noty cot, sot, is found in aught. caught, sough/.. See.; and these long sounds, like the former, should be abbreviated in o the short ones. But what will tend greatly to clear the difficulty will be, to remember that only those words which are collected in the Principles, No. 165, have the
o	sounded like short u when the accent is upon it: and with respect to the u in bu . ttM, Jtull. See. it may be observed, that the pronunciation peculiar to the English is only found in the words enumerated, Principles, No. 174.
In addition to what has been said, it may be observed, that oo in food. moorf, moon, MW* See. which ought always to have a long sound, is generally shortened in Scotland to that middle sound of the u in bull: and it must be remembered, that ivo'jly wood, goody hood, stood, foot, arc the only words where this sound of oo ought to take place.
The accentuation, both in Scotland and Ireland, (if by accentuation we mean the stress, and not the kind of stress,) is so much the same as that of England, that I cannot recollect many words in which they differ. Indeed, if it were not so, the versification of each country would be different: for as English verse is formed by accent or stress, if this accent or stress were upon different syllables in different countries, what is verse in England would not be verse in Scotland or Ireland ; and this sufficiently shows how very indefinitely the word accent is generally used.
Mr. Elphinston, who must be allowed to be a competent judge in this case, tells us, that in Scodand they pronounce silence. bias, canvas, sentence, t* iinnj //, comfort. s lace construe, rescue, resj.ite, govern. ha ass, ransack, ' ancel with the accent on the last syllable instead of the first. To this list may be added the word menace, which they pronounce as if written m> nas*; and though they place the accent on the last syllable of canal. like the English, they broaden the a in the last syllable, as if the word were spelt canavA. It may be farther observed, that they place an accent on the comparative adverb in the phrases
03	much, as tittlr. as many, as great. See. while the English, except in seme very particular emphatical cases, lay no stress on this word, but pronounce these phrases like words of two or three syllables without any accent on the first.
But besides the mispronunciation of single words, there is a tone of voice with which these words are accompanied, that distinguishes a native of Ireland or Scotland, as much as an improper sound of the letters. This is vulgarly, and, if it does not mean stress only, but the kind of stress, I think, not improperly called the accent*. For though there is an asperity in the Irish ck *ect, and a drawl in the Scotch, independent of the slides or inflections they rm!<e use of, yet it may with confidence be affirmed, that much of the peculiarity which distinguishes these dialects may be reduced to a predominant use of one of these slides. Let any one who has sufficiently studied the speaking voice to distinguish the slides, observe the pronunciation of an Irishman and a Scotchman, who have much of the dialect of their country, and he will find that the former abounds with the falling, and the latter with the rising inflection t; and
