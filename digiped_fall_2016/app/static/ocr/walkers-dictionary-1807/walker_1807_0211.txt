(Xjr“ This word, as Dr. Kenrick observes, is frequently pronounced so as to rhyme with herd: but I am of his opinion that this pronunciation is improper. Mr. Scott and Mr. Perry give it both ways. Buchanan sounds it short, like Mr. Sheridan. W. Johnston makes it rhyme with laird, a Scotch lord: but Mr. Elphinstone, who is the most accurate observer of pronunciation I ever met with, gives it as I have done. Tbe stage ha*, in my opinion, adopted tbe short sound of the dipthong without good reason, and in this instance ought not to be followed; as the long souud is not only more agreeable to analogy, but to general usage. I am glad to find my opinion confirmed by so good a judge as Mr. Smith; and though the poets so often sacrifice pronunciation to rhyme, that their authority, in these cases, is not always decisive, yet, as Shakspeare says on another occasion,
“ They still may help to thicken other proofs
“ That do demonstrate thinly.”—Othello.
“ Rail’d at their covenant and jeer’d
“ Their reveretjd persons to my beard.”
Hndibras.
** Some thin remains of chastity appear’d
“ Ev’n under Jove, but Jove without a beard.”
Drydeii.
The impropriety of pronouncing this word as it is heard on the sta^e, will, perhaps, appear more perceptible by carrying this pronunciation into the compounds, as the false sound of great may be detected by the phrase Alexander the Great (241).
“ Old prophesies fortel our fall at hand,
<< When bearded men in floating castles land.
“ And as young stripliugs whip tbe top for sport,
“ On the smooth pavement of an empty
court,
“ The wooden engine flies and whirls about,
“ Admir’d with clamoursof the beardless rout.”
Dry den.
To Beard, b££rd. v. a. To take or pluck by the beard ; to oppose to the face.
