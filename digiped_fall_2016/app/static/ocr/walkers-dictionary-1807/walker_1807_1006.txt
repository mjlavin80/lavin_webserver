nfr* 1 prefer the first mode of pronounczog this word to the second, though, at first sight, it appears not so regular. My reason is, the aversion our language has to a repetition of exactly similar words. The s in the prefix trans is always sharp and hissing, and that inclines us to vary tbe succeeding aspiration, by giving it the flu instead of the sharp sound. This is the best reason I can give for the very prevailing custom of pronouncing* this termination in this word contrary to analog}.— When 1 asked Mr. Gairick to pronounce this word, he, without premeditation,me it in the first manner; but when 1 desired him to repeat bis pronunciation, he gave it in the second:

“ Then with transition sweet new speech u resumes.’*	Milton
