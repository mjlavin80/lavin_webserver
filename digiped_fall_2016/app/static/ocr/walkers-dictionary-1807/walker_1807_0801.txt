ceive why the o is thrown out of the second syllable j and, therefore, to correct the mistake, sounds the word as if written Pronounci a tion. Those who are sufficiently learned to escape this errour, by understanding that the word comes to us either froui the Latin pronunciation or the French pronunciation, are very apt to fall into another, by sinking the first aspiration, and pronouncing the third syllable like the noun sea. But these speakers ought to take notice, that, throughout tiie whole lau-guage, c, s, and /, preceded by the accent, either primary or secondary, and followed by ea, ia, io, or any similar diphthong, always become aspirated, and are pronounced as, if written she. Thus the very same reasons that oblige us to pronounce partiality, propitiation, especially, &c. as if writteu parsheulity, projiskeation, espesheally, &c. oblige us to pronounce pronunciation as if writteu pronunsheashun. See Principles, No. 357,450, 461, and the word Ecclesias-tick.
But though Mr. Sheridan avoids the vulgar errour of sinking tbe aspiration, in^iiiy opinion he falls into one fully as exceptionable; which is, that of pronouncing the word in four syllables, as if written Pro-nun-sha-shun. I am grossly mistaken if correct speakers do not always pronounce this and similar words in the manner 1 have marked them : and, indeed, Mr. Sheridan himself seems dubious with respect to some of them; for though hf pronounces glaciate, glaciation, association, &c. gla shale, gla-shc-shun, as-so-sha-shnn, &c. yet be' spells con-glaciate, con glaciation, and consociation,—con-gla-syate, ccn-gla-sya-shun, con-so-sya-shun. See Principles, No. 542, 543.
