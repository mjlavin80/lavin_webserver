QUANTITY AND SYLLABICATION.	cxlx
the second, cre^hort The’first a in the second word is short also by the power of the secondary accent; though Mr. Sheridan has, in my opinion, very er» TOaeoosty divided TxaiodruUion into ra-#ho-sy-na-*fiun ; that is, into a syllable lees than it ought to have, with the o long instead of short.
537.	The accent on the Latin antepenultimate seemed to have something of a similar tendency : for though the great difference in the nature of the Latin and English accent will allow us to argue from one to the other, but in very few circumstances, (503), yet we may perceive in that accent, so different from ours in general, a great coincidence in this particular ; namely, its tendency to ^shorten an antepenultimate syllable. Bishop Hare tells us, that u Quae acuuntut « m tenia ab extrema, mterdum acuta conipiunt, si positione sola fonga sunt, “ ut Afttimti sfirvitus, fitrvrtim, PkmpkUu*, et pauca alia, quo Cretici mutantur, 44 in Anapetftoa. Idem factum est in neutiquam, licet incipiat diphthongo.* Metr. Comic, pag. 62. Those words which have the acute accent on the antepenultimate syllable, have sometimes that syllable shortened, if it was only long by portion, as ofitime,9&n*itM, fih'vchm, Ptmphilus, and a few others, which hy this means are changed from Cretic to Anapestic feet; nay, neutiquam undergoes the some fate, though it begins with a diphthong.
SYLLABICATION,
538.	Dividing words into syllables is a very different operation, according tb the different ends proposed by it. The object of syllabication may be, either to enable children to discover the sound of words they are unacquainted with, or to show the etymology of a word, or to exhibit the exact pronunciation of it
539.	When a child has made certain advances in reading, but is ignorant of the sound of many of the longer words, it may not be improper to lay down the common general rule to him, that a consonant between two vowels must go to the latter, and -that two consonants coming together must be divided. Farther than this, it would be absurd to go with a child; for telling him that compounds jnust be divided into their simples, and that such consonants as may begin a word may begin a syllable, requires a previous knowledge of words, which children cannot be supposed to have; and which, if they have, makes the division of words into syllables unnecessary. Children, therefore, may be very usefully taught the general rule abovementioned, as, in many cases, it will lead them to the exact sound of the word, as in firo-vi-ded: and in others, it will enable them to give a good guess at it, as in dc-li<atc; and this is all that can be expected: for when we are to form an unknown compound sound, out of several known simple sounds; (which is the case wifh children, when We wish them to find out the sound of a word by spelling it); this, I say, is the only method that c%n be taken.
540.	But an etymological division of words is a different operation : it is the division of a person acquainted with the whole word, and who wishes to convey by this division, a knowledge of its constituent parts, as ortho-grafihy, thco4ogyi fcc.
541.	In the same manner, a person, who is pre-acquainted with the whole compound sound of a word, and wants to convey the sound of each part to one unacquainted with it, must divide it into such partial sgunds as, when put toge-Ifacr again, will exactly form the whole, as or-th^g-ra-phy, the-ol-o-gy, 8cc.
