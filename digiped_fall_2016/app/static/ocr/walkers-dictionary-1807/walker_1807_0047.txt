DIFFERENT SOUNDS OF THE LETTER £.
xli
^cent on the second syllable : in this case we find the vowel lengthen as if the consonant were single. See Efface, Despatch, Embalm.
99.	This vowel, in a final unaccented syllable, is apt to slide into the short
i: thus fcces, ranges, praises, are pronounced as if writtcn./frcf>, rangiz, praiziz ; poet, cuvet, fcrtm, duel, &c. as if written /wit, covif, linin%	Where	we
mar observe, that though the e goes into the short sound of i, it is exactly that sound which corresponds to the long sound of e. See Port Royal Gravinmire, Ztf.?K*page 142.
100.	There is a remarkable exception to the common sound of this letter in the words clerk, aerjrant, and a few others, where we fintf the e pronounced like the a in dark raid margin. But this exception, I imagine, was, till within these few years, the general rule of/sounding this letter before r, followed by anotiier consonant. See Merchant. Tliirty years ago every one pronounced the first syllable of merchant likcjthe monosyllabic march, and as it was anciently uritten marchant. Service and scrx*anl are still heard among the lower order of speakers, as if written*sarvlce and sarvunt; and even among the better sort, we sometimes hear the salutation, Sir, vour sarvunt ! though this pronunciation of the word singly would be looked upon as a mark of the lowest vulgarity. The proper names, Derby and Berkeley, still retain the old sound as if written Darby and Barkeley: but even these, in polite usage, are getting into the common sound, nearly as if written Durbij and Burk dry. As this modern pronunciation of the e lias a tendency to simplify the language by lessening the number of exceptions, it ought certainly to be indulged.
101.	This letter falls into an irregular sound, but still a sound which is its nearest relation, in the words, England, yen, and firetty, where the c is heard like short j. Vulgar speakers are guilty of the same irregularity in engine, as if written ingine ; but this cannot be too carefully avoided.
102.	The vowel e before I and n in the final unaccented syllable, by its being sometimes suppressed and sometimes not, forms one of the most puzzling difficulties in pronunciation. When any of the liquids precede these letters, the e is heal’d distincdy, as woollen, fiannd, women, syren ; but when any of the other consonants come before these letters, the e is sometimes heard, as in novel, *udden; and sometimes not, as in swivel, raven, Sec. As no other rule can be pven for this variety of pronunciation, perhaps the best way will be to draw the line between those words where c is pronounced, and those w here it is not; and this, by the help of the Rhyming Dictionary, I am luckily enabled to do. In the first place, then, it may be observed, die e before /, in a final unaccented syllable, must always be pronounced distinctly, except in the following words : Shekel, weasel, ousel, nousel^ (better written nuzzles) navel, ravel, snivel, rive I, drivel, shrivel, shovel, grovel, hazel, dmzel, nozel. These words are pronounced as if the e were omitted by an apostrophe* as shk*l, rheas’I, ous'l, &c. or rather as if written sheckle, weazle, ouzle, &c.; but as these are the only words of tins termination that are so pronounced, great care must be taken that we do not pronounce travel^ gravel, rebel (the substantive), pnrd, dapd, and vessel, in the same manner; a fault to which many are very prone.
103.	E before n in a final unaccented syllable, and not preceded by a liquid, must always be suppressed in the verbal terminations in to i.oncn, x.oh-'ark-"b and in other words, except the following : Sudden, imjnrhm, ki*chm, hyphen,
' fricken, ticken (better written ticking),jerktn,u^p^n, platen, paten, wartni, laiten, flatten, leaven or leven, sloven, mittens. In these words the e is heard distinctly, fontrary to the general rule which suppresses the r in these syllables, when preceded fcv a mule, as fwrd’m, heathen, heaven, as if written hard'n* heath* n% heavynh
