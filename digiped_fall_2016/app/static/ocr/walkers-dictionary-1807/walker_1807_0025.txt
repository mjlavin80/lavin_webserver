Second Fault Pronouncing w for v, and inversely.
The pronunciation of v for w, and more frequently of w for u, among the in* habitants of London, and those not always ui the lower order, is a blemish of the first magnitude. The difficulty of remedying this defect is the greater, as the cure of one of these mistakes has a tendency to promote the other.
Thus, if you are very careful to make a pupil pronounce ^>eal and vinegar, not as if written weal and wintgar, you will find him very apt to pronounce wine and wmdy as if written vine and vind. The only method of rectifying this habit seems to be this : Let the pupil select from a Dictionary, not only all the words that begin with v, but as many as he can of those that have this letter in any other part. Let him be told to bite his under lip while he is sounding the v in those words, and to practise this every day till he pronounces the v properly at first sight: then, and not till then, let him pursue the same method with the w; which he must be directed to pronounce by a pouting out of the lips without suffering them to touch the teeth. Thus by giving all the attention to only one of these letters at a time, and fixing by habit the true soured of that, we shall at last find both of them reduced to their proper pronunciation? in a shorter time than by endeavouring to rectify them both at once.
Third Faults—Not sounding h after w.
The aspirate h is often sunk, particularly in the capital, where we do not find the least distinction of sound between while and wile* whet and wet* where and were, &c. The best method to rectify this, is to collect all the words of the ^description from a Dictionary, and write them down; and, instead of the wh> to begin them with two in a distinct syllable, and so to pronounce them. Thus, let while be written and sounded hoo-ile ; whet, hoo-et; where* hoo-are; whifi, horj-ifi. &c. This is no more, as Dr. Lowth observes, than placing the aspirate in its true position before the w, as it is in the Saxon, which the words come from ; where we may observe, that though we have altered the orthography of our ancestors, we have still preserved their pronunciation.
Fourth Fault.—Mt sounding h where it ought to be sounded, and inversely*
A still worse habit than the last prevails, chiefly among the people of Loudon, that of sinking the h at the beginning of words where it ought to be sounded, and of sounding it, either where it is not seen, or where it ought to be sunk, This we not unfrequently hear, especially among children, heart pronounced art* and arm, harm. This is a vice perfectly similar to that of pronouncing the v for the w, and the w for the r, and requires a similar method to correct it.
As there are so very few words in the language where the initial h is sunk, ‘ we may select these from the rest, and, without setting the pupil right when he mispronounces these, or when he prefixes h improperly to other words, we may make him pronounce all the words where h is sounded, till he has almost forgot there are any words pronounced otherwise: then he may go over those words to which he improperly prefixes the h, and those where the h is seen, but not sounded, without any danger of an interchange. As these latter words # are but few, I shall subjoin a catalogue of them for the use of the learner: heir, heiress, herb, herbage, honest, honesty, honestly, tumour, honourable, honourably, hcsfiital, hostler^ hour, hourly, humble, humbly, humbles, humour, humorist> humor-
