DIFFERENT SOUNDS OF THE LETTER A
ipwer into the province of a for its long sounc) in tame. The a in carry is not the shott souna of the a in care, but ot that in car, father, See. as the shoft broad sound of the a in want is the'true abbreviation of that in wall. The sound of ‘J in don, gone, See. is exactly correspondent to the a in swan, and finds its long sound in the a in wall, or the diphthong aw in downy lawn, fee.; while the short sound ot the o in tone is nearly that of the same letter in ion* (a weight), <md corresponding with what is generally called the short sound of U in tun, guru, fcc. as the long sound of u in pule must find its short sound in the u in puli, bull, Sec.; for this vowel, like the i and y, being a diphthong, its short sound is formed irom the latter part of the letter equivalent to double o; as the word pule, if spelled according to the sound, might be written peoole. -
68.	Another observation preparatory to a consideration of the various sounds of the vowels and consonants seems to be the influence of the accent; as the accent or stress which is laid upon certain syllables has so obvious an effect upon the sounds of the letters, that unless we take accent into the account, it will be impossible to reason rightly upon the proper pronunciation of the Elements of Speech.
Of the Influence of Accent on the Sounds of the Letters.	.
69.	It may be first observed, that the exertion of the organs of speech necessary to produce the accent or stress, has an obvious tendency to preserve the letters in their pure and uniform sound, while the relaxation or feebleness which succeeds the accent as naturally suffers the letters to slide into a somewhat different sound a little easier to the organs of pronunciation. Thus the first a in cabbage is pronounced distinctly with the true sound of that letter, while the second a goes into an obscure sound bordering on the t short, the slenderest of all sounds; so that cabbage and village have the a in the last syllable scarcely distinguishable from the e and i in the last syllables of college and vestige.
70.	In the same manner the a, e, i, o, and y, coming before r in a final unaccented syllable*, go into an obscure sound so nearly approaching to the short tr, that if the accent were carefully kept upon the first syllables of Har, Her, elixir, i mayor, martyr, &c. these words, without any perceptible change in the sound -of their last syllables, might all be written and pronounced, Bur, bur, etixur9 inayur, martUTy &c.
71.	The consonants also are no less altered in their sound by the position of the accent than the vowels. The k and s in the composition of x, when the accent is on them, in exercise, execute? &c. preserve their strong pure sound; but when the accent is on the second syllable, in exact, exonerate, &c these let- -ters slide into the duller and weaker sounds of g and z, which are easier to the organs of pronunciation. Hence not only the soft c and the * go into sh, but even the t before a diphthong slides into the same letters when die stress is on the preceding syllable. Thus in society and satiety the c and t preserve their pure sound, because the syllables ci and ti have the accent on them; but in social and satiate, these syllables come after the stress, and from the feebleness of their situation naturally fall into the shorter and easier sound, as if written aoshial and ***hiate. See the word Satiety.

72.	A has three long sounds and two short ones.
73.	The first sound of the first letter in our alphabet is that which among the English is its name. (See the letter^ at the beginning of the Dictionary!)
