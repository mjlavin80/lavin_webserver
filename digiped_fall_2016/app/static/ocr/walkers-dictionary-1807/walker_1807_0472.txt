OTj* Why we should pronounceflorist and floret with the long o, and florid and fibrin with the short sound of that letter, cannot easily be guessed. They are all from the same original, are all anglicised, and consist but of two syllables; and the only thing that can be gathered from them is, the uncertainty of arguing from the Latin quantity to ours. See Drama, and Principles, No. 544. Florulent, fl5r'ii-l£nt. a. Flowery, blossoming.

(£j* This word spelled in this manner is notin Johnson, though nothing seems better settled by custom than this distinction in the spelling between this word and the flower of a plant. That words written alike oujjht not to be sounded differently in order to signify different tilings, has been proved, it is presumed, under the word Bowl : but that words signifying different tilings, though sounded alike, ought to be written differently,seems evident from the necessity there is of making words which are the signs of ideas as different as the ideas themselves. In the former case we do not know how to pronounce the word Bow, till we have its meaning fixed by what follows; in the latter, though the ear is not sure of the idea till it has heard the context, the eye in reading is at no loss for the meaning ofthe word, nor are the organs in suspense how to pronounce it. The want of a different sound to express a different idea, is an imperfec-
tion of the language in both cases; but the want of a different mark to express difference of idea to the eye, would be a double imperfection.
