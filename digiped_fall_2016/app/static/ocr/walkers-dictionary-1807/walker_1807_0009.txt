PREFACE.

FEW subjects have of late years more employed the pens of every class of critics, than the improvement of the English language. The greatest abilities in the nation have been exerted in cultivating and reforming it; nor have a thousand minor critics been wanting to add their mite of amendment to their native tongue. Johnson, whose large mind and just taste made him capablc of enriching and adorning the language with original composition, has condescended to the drudgery of disentangling, explaining, and arranging it, and left a lasting monument of his ability, labour, and patience: and Dr. Lowth, tl> -volitest scholar of the age, has veiled his superiority in his short Introduction to English Grammar. The ponderous folio has gravely vindicated the rights of analogy; and the li^ht ephemeral sheet of news has corrected errors in Grammar as well as in Politics, by slyly marking them in Italics.
Nor has the improvement stropped here. While Johnson and Lowth have been insensibly operating on the orthography and construction of our Language, its pronunciation has not been neglected. The importance of a consistent and regular pronunciation was too obvious to be overlooked -y and the want of this consistency and regularity has induced several ingenious men to endeavour at a reformation; who, by exhibiting the irregularities of pronunciation, and pointing out its analogies, have reclaimed some words that were not irrecoverably fixed in a wrong sound, and prevented others from being perverted by ignorance or caprice.
Among those writers who deserve the first praise on this subject, is Mr* El-phinston; who, in his Principles of the English Language, has reduced the ohaos to a system ; and, by a deep investigation of the analogies of our tongue, has laid the foundation of a just and regular pronunciation.
After him, Dr. Kenrick contributed a portion of improvement by his Rhetorical Dictionary ; in which the words arc divided into syllables as they are pronounced, and figures placed over the vowels, to indicate their different sounds. But this gentle naan has rendered his Dictionary extremely imperfect, by entirely omitting a great number of words of doubtful and difficult pronunciation— thase very words for which a Dictionary of this kind would be most consulted.
To him succeeded Mr. Sheridan, who not only divided the words into sylla* bles, and placed figures over the vowels as Dr. Kenrick had done, but, by spelling these syllables as they are pronounced, seemed to complete the idea ot a Pronouncing Dictionary, and to leave but little expectation of future improvement. It must* indeed, be confessed,that Mr. Sheridan’s Dictionary is greatly supe-
