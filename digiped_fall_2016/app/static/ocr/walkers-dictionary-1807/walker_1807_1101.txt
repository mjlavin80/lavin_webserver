In presenting to the Publick this Edition of Walker’s DICTIONARY, a Work which, more than any other, has contributed to fix the vatying Pronunciation of the English Language i the Publishers presume to hope, that in its typographical execution, it will be found more correct than any oth^fgr copy extant. Besides the claim to greater Accuracy, they beg leave to state, that this Edition possesses another advantage, of no trifling importance; that of having the Ap- , PENDix incorporated in the general Vocabulary: an advantage of which the Author regretted he could not avail himself, in the last London Copy; and which has been unaccountably overlooked in the former American Editions.
