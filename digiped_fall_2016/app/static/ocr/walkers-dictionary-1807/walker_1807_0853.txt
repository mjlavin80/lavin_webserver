This word seems to have been some years floating between the accent on the first and last syllable, but to have settled at last on the former. It may still, however, he reckon* ed among those words, which, if occasion require, admit of either. See Principles, No. 5‘28. It may, perhaps, be necessary to observe, that some Lexicographers have written this word Reverie instead of Revery, and that while it is thus written we may place the accent either ou the first or last syllable; but if we place the acceot on the last of Revery, and pronouuce the y like e, there arises an irregularity which forbids it; for t/, with the accent on it, is never so pronounced. Dr. Johnson’s orthography, therefore, With y in the last syllable, aud Mr. Sheridan’s accent on the first, seem to be the most cor/ect mode of writing aud pronouncin* this word.
A view of the different orthography and accentuation of this word may contribute to confirm that which I have chosen :
