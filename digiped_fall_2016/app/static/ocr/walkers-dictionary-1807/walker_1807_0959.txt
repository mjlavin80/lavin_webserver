Johnston, Mr. Perry, Buchanan, and Bailey, on the second; Barclay and Kenning give both, but prefer the first: Mr. Scott gives both, and prefers the second: but, from the opinion that is foolishly gone forth, that we ought to accent words as near the beginning as possible, there is little doubt that the antepenultimate accent will prevail.
