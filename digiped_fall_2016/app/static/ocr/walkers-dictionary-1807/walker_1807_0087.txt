PRONUNCIATION OF THE CONSONANT G.

G.
379.	G, like C, has two sounds, a hard and a soft one: it is hard before
c, o, t/, /, and r, as game,	glory, grandeur. Gao/ is the only exception;
now more commonly written jail. (212).
380.	G before e and i is sometimes hard and sometimes soft: it is generally soft before words of Greek, Latin, or French original, and hard before words from the Saxon. These latter, forming by far the smaller number, may be considered as exceptions.
381.	G is hard before r, in gear, gecky geese, geld, gelt, gelding, get, gew-gaw, shagged, magged, raggedy cragged, scragged, dogged, rugged, dagger,swagger, stag-gery trigger, dogger, pettyfogger, tiger, auger, eager, meager, anger, finger, linger, conger, longer, stronger, younger, longest, strongest, youngest. The last six of these words are generally pronounced in Ireland, so as to let the ^ remain in its nasal sound, without articulating the succeeding vowel : thus longer (more long) is so pronounced as to sound exactly like the noun a long-er (one who longs or wishes for a thing) ; the same may be observed of the rest. That the pronunciation of Ireland is analogical, appears from the same pronunciation of g in strfrig-y, spring-y, full of strings and springs; and wronger and wrongest, for more and most wrong. But though resting the g in die nasal sound, without articulating the succeeding vowel, is absolutely necessary in verbal nouns derived from verbs ending in ing, as singer, bringer, slittg -r, See. pronounced sing-er, bring-er9 sling-er, See. and not xing-ger, bring-ger, sling-ger, See. yet in longer, stronger, and younger ; longest, strongest, and young, st, the g ought always to articulate the e: thus younger ought always to, rhyme with the termination monger, which has always the g hard, and articulating the vowel; and this pronunciation is approved by Mr. Nares. Forget, target, and together, fall into this class. See No. 409.
382.	G is hard before i in gibbe,gibcat, gibber,gibberish,gibbous,giddy,gift, gig,
P8gk>g*gl*t (properly giggletj,gild, gill (of a fish), gimlet, gimp, gird, girdle^rl, girth, gizzard, begin, give, forgive, biggin, piggin, n ggin: also derivations from nouns or verbs ending in hard g, as druggist, waggish, riggish, hoggish, doggish^ *l*ggi*h, rigging, digging, &c.	~
383.	G before y is generally soft, as in elegy, apology, &c. and almost in all
words from the learned languages; but hard in words from the Saxon, which are formed from nouns or verbs ending in g hard, as shaggy, jaggy, knaggy, ^	scraggy,	quaggy, swaggy, dreggy, spriggy, twiggy, boggy, foggy,
doggy, buggy, muggy. Gyve, from its Celtic original, ought to have theg hard, but has decidedly adopted the soft g.
GJV in the same Syllable at the Beginning of a Word.
284.	The g in this situation is always silent, as gnaw, gnash, gnatj gnarl, gnomony gnomonics : pronounced naw, nash, nat, narl, nomon, nomomcs.
GJV in the same Syllable at the End of a Word.
385.	No combination of letters has more puzzled the critics than this. Two actresses of distinguished merit in Portia in the Merchant of Venice, pronounced the word impugn differently, and each found her advocate in the newspapers. One critic affirmed, that Miss Young, by preserving the sound of g, pronounced w* word properly; and the other contended that Mrs. Yates was more judi-
