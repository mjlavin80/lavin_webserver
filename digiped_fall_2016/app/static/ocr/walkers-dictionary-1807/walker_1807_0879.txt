0Cj* From the general tendency of the antepenultimate accent to shorten the vowel, and the particular propensity, to contract every vowel but u before the termination in ical, we find those in ic, which may be looked upon as abbreviations ofthe other, preserve the same shortening power with respect to the vowels which precede: and though the word in question might plead the long sound of the e in the Latin scenicu*; yet, if this plea were admitted, we ought lor the same reasons to alter the sound of
*	in comic; nor should we know where to stop. As a plain analogy', therefore, is formed by epic, topic, tropic, tonic, &c. it would be absurd to break in upon it, under pretence of conforming to Latin quantity; as this would disturb our most settled usages, and quite unhinge the language. —See Principles, No. 544.
