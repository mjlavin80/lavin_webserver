Dr. Johnson tells us, that this word might more properly have been written Appale ; and we find Bacon, in his History of Henry VIJ. actually writes the compound Appale-nrul. Whether Johnson founds his opinion npon the pete colour which fear generally produces, or upon tbe derivation of the word from the French Appalir, it cannot be certainly known; but this is certain, that this word has been so often rhymed with ull+ ball, fall, 6cc. that such $ change as Or. Johnson recommends would be attended with no/small inconvenience. It may be observed too, that spelling this word with single / as he has done, is at variance with its general pronunciation : for one I, when final, does not broaden the a like that in allt but leaves it in the sound of that vowel \x\fnl-lovot lal-low, &c. Considering therefore that the pronunciation of this word is so irrevocably fixed, it is but borrowing an / from the Latin PaUeo to make the sound and the spelling exactly correspond. We are often fond of neglect-iag tbe French for the Latin etymology wben there is no necessity,—in the present case such a preference would be commendable.
