To all these different pronunciations is this word subject. The accentuation, either on the first or last syllable, depends much on the rhythtn of the sentence.—See Commodore, and Commonwealth1. When it is used as a substantive, without an adjective before it, the accent is generally on the first syllable ; as,
“ See how the momingopes hergolden gates,
“ And takes her fJmve//,ofthc glorious sun.”
ShaJtspcarc.
Or if the adjective follow' the substantive, as,
“ If chance the radiant sun with f&rcutell ** sweet
u Extend his ev*ning beam, the fields revive, “The biixis their notes renew, and bleating “herds
“ Attest their joy, that hill and valley ring.”
Milton.
But if the adjective precede the substantive, the accent is generally placed on the last syllable; as,
“ Treading* the path to nobler ends,
“ A long fcrcwtll to love I gave.”
Waller.
“ As in this grove I took my last farnotll.”
Drydcn.
Or when it is governed by a verb, as, “ I “ bade him farexotll” or, “ I badefar cut 11 u to him.” .
When it is used as an adjective, the accent is always on the first syllable; as, “A t “ftirevtell Sermon.”
