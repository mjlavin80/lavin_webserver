QkJ* 1 have given the first syllable of this and the succeeding words, compounded ot male, the long sound of a, because I look upon inale as a prefix not alterable in its sound in words of our own composition, any more than arch, fore, mis, pre, or vice ; arch and fore are used separately as adjectives, which is hot the case with male;
btkll£tt;—p&md;—fAin, Tflis.
but mi*, pre, and vice, are never used out of composition, and are therefore exactly under the same predicament, bis not being a prefix of our own which we can apply to words at pleasure, alters the sound of s according to the presence or absence of the accent, or the nature ofthe succeeding consonants (see Dis) ; but mi* being applicable to any words, never alters the sound of#. (426). Pre, when prefixed to words of our own, as pre-conceived, pre-nip-poxed, &c. never shortens the vowel (530)
(531)	(532); and vice in vice-president) viceadmiral y &c. might as well be changed into vis-president, and vit-admiral, as malecon-tent and malepractice into malcontent and malpractice. But though all our Pronouncing Dictionaries adopt the short sound of a, and some even leave out the e, yet as analogy is so decidedly in favour of the long sound, and custom is not quite unanimous, the long sound ought certainly to have the preference with all who aim at correctness and consistency. W. Johnston is the only one who adopts this pronunciation ; and Barclay, by putting a hyphen after male, seems to favour it. If custom has decided in favour of the short sound of a, the e ought to be omitted in writing, and then the spelling and sound would not be at variance; but as this would lead to incurable evils in language, the pronunciation ought rather to conform to the orthography.
