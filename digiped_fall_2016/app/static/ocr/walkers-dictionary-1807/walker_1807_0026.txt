ou8, humorou*lt/% humorsome; where we may observe, that humour and its com--pounds not only sink the 4, but sound the u like the pronoun you, or the noun yt'io as if written frwmyur, aviv'n^ruiix &c.
Thus I have endeavoured to correct some of the more glaring errors of my county men, who, with all their faults, are still upon the whole the best pro-nouncers of the English language : for though the pronunciation of London is cert iniy erroneous in many words, yet, upon being compared with that of any other place. it is undoubtedly the best; that is, not only the best by courtesy, and because it happens to be the pronunciation of the capital, but the best by a better title, that of being more generally received : on in other words, though the people of London are erroneous in the pronunciation of many words, the inhabitants of every other place are erroneous in many more. Nay, harsh as the sentence may seem, those at a considerable distance from the capital do not only mispronounce many words taken separately, but they scarcely pronounce with purity a single word, syllable, or letter. Thus, if the short sound of the letter u in mnk «unk. &c. differ from the sound of that letter in the northern parts of England, where they sound it like the u in buU, and nearly as if the words were written ft , mk, munk &c. it necessarily follows, that every word where the second sound of that letter occurs, must by those provincials be mispronounced.	*
But though the inhabitants of London have this manifest advantage over all the other inhabitants of the island, they have the disadvantage of being more disgraced by their peculiarities than any other people. The grand difference between the metropolis and the provinces is, that people of education in London are generally free from the vices of the vulgar; but the best educated people in the provinces, if constantly resident there, are sure to be strongly tinctured with the dhlect of the country in which they live. Hence it is, that the vulgar pronunciation of London, though not half so erroneous as that of Scotland, Ireland, or any of the provinces, is, to a person of correct taste, a thousand times more offensive and disgusting.
