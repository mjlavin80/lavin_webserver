(Jj* All our orthoepists but Bailey pronounce this word with the accent on the first syllable ; but my judgment much fails me if the true pronunciation ought not to be with the accent on the second, as in Predicament. My reason is, that this is the syllable on which we place the secondary accent in pronouncing the Latin words medic amentum and predicamentum; and it has often been observed, that this is our guide for accenting English words formed from the Latin by dropping a syllable. See Academy.

Xj* Or. Johnson tells us, that this word is now commonly pronounced medicinal, with the accent on the second syllable, but more properly and more agreeably to the best authorities medicinal. If by the best authorities Dr. Johnson means the Poets, the question is decided ; but I look upon Poets to be the worst authorities in this case, as, by the very rules of their art, a license is given then? to depart from the general pronunciation; and that they often avail themselves of this license, cannot be disputed. But if by more properly, Dr. Johnson alludes to the long i in the Latin mediclnus or mediclnalis, nothing can be more inconclusive. If the word be perfectly Latin, as well as English, we generallypkce the accent oft the same syllable as in the original, as, acumen, decorum, &c. but frequently otherwise, as orator, senator, character, &c. But if this Latin accentuation were to be servilely followed in Latin words anglicised, we should overturn the whole fabrick of our pronunciation. Thus doctrinal, pastoral, &c. &c. must have the accent on the second syllable instead of the first, and nothing but confusion would ensue. The truth is, the strong tendency of our language is to an antepenultimate accent (503) ; and it is with reluctance we ever place it lower, except in words of our own composition, or where the lattef syllables have either an assemblage of consonants or a diphthong; yet even iu this case we find the antepenultimate accent sometimes prevail, as, ancestor, amnesty, magistrate, &c. and counterpoise, porcelain, chamberlain, interreign, &c. So that by attempting to bring our pronunciation under the laws of the Latin language, w'e disturb ami pervert it. Let Poets, therefore, who have, and perhaps, in some cases, ought to have, a language different from prose, enjoy the privilege of their art, and while we are reading them let us conform to their rules : but let us not strive against the general current of prosaick pronunciation, which is always right, and which is equally negligent of the peculiarities of poets, and the pedantry of ancient derivation. The antepenultimate accentuation of this word is supported by Dr. Ash, Dr. Kenrick, Mr. Perry, Mr. Smith, W. Johnston, Barclay, Bailey, Fenning, and Entick. Mr. Sheridan gives both, and, by placing this accentuation first, seems to prefer it to the other.—See Indecorous and Inimical.
