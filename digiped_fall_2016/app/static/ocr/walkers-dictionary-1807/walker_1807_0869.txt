As this word is derived from the Latin salinus by dropping a syllable, the accent ought, according to the general rule of formation (503), to remove to the first. This accentuation, however, is adopted only by Dr. Johnson, Buchanan, and Bailey ; as Sheridan, Kenrick, Ash, Nares, W. Johnston, Scott, Perry, Barclay, Fen-
_ ning, Entick, and Smith, accent the second syllable.
Salinous, sa-lPnils. a. Consisting of salt, constituting salt.
Q£)* Dr. Johnson, in his folio Dictionary, accents this word <jn the first syllable, in which he is followed by his publishers in
the quarto; but as this word may be easily derived from the Latin word tali nut,and with the same number of syllables,it ought to be acccnted on the second. (503, e.) Saliva, si-li'vL s. (503, 6.) Every thing that is spit up, but it more strictly signifies that juice which is separated by the glands called salival.
(Xj* As this word is a perfect Latin word, all our Dictionaries very properly accent it on the second syllable. (503). But tali• val, which is a formative of our own, has no such title to the penultimate accent: this pronunciation, however, is adopted by Mr. Sheridan, Dr. Ash, Dr. Kenrick, Scott, Barclay, Fenning,Entick, and Johnson’s quarto ; but Mr. Perry and Dr. Johnson’s folio place the accent on the first syllable, and, in my opinion, more correctly. Salival, sdl'£-val, or ssl-li'v&l.	>

To Salivate, s&l'l£-v&te. v. a. To purge by the salival glands.
Salivation, s&l-l£-v&;sh<in. s. A method of cure much practised in venereal cases.
Salivous, sd-ll'vds, or sil'£-vfts. a. Consisting of spittle, having the nature of spittle.—See Principle*, No. 103,p.
(Xj9 As this word has somewhat more of a Latin aspect than salival, and is probably derived from salivosus% the learnedly polite, or the politely learned, snatch at the shadow of Latin quantity to distinguish themselves from mere English speakers. Hfnee in all the words of this termination they preserve the penultimate i long, and place the accent on it; and thus we are obliged to do the same in this word under pain of ap-> pea ring illiterate. This penalty, however, Dr. Ash and Mr. Perry have incurred, by placing the accent on the first syllable;, but Dr. Johnson, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Scott, Barclay, Fenning, and Entick,, follow the learned majority, though evidently wrong.
