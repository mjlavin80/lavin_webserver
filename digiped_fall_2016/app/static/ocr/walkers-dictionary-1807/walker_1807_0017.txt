determine the character, and fix the boundaries of every language; as in every system of speaking, however irregular, the organs must necessarily fall into some common mode of enunciation, or the purpose oi Providence in the gift of speech would be absolutely defeated. These laws, like every other object of philosophical inquiry, are only to be traced by an attentive observation and enumeration of particulars; and when these particulars are sufficiently numerous to form a genera] rule, an axiom in pronunciation is acquired. By an accumulation of these axioms, and an analogical comparison of them with each ether, we discover the deviations of language where custom has varied, and the only ciew to guide us where custom is either indeterminate or obscure.
Thus, by a view of the words ending in ity or tty, I find the accent invariably placed on the preceding syllable, as in diversity, congru'ity, Sec. On a closer inspection, I find every vowel in this antepenultimate syllable, when no consonant intervenes, pronounced long* as de'ity, fri'ety, Sec.; a nearer observation shows me, that if a consonant intervene, every vowel in this syllable but u contracts itself and is pronounced short, as sever'ity, curios*ity, imfiu'nity, See. and therefore that ^hastily and obscenity ought to be pronounced with the penultimate vowel short, and not as in chaste and obscene, as we frequently hear them. I find too, that even u contracts itself before two consonants, as cu/vity, taciturnity, Sec. and that scarcity and rarity, (for whose irregularity good reasons may be given) are the only exceptions to this rule throughout the language. And thus we have a series of p ~ar seven hundred words, the accentuation of which, as well as the quantity of the accented vowel, are reduced to two or three simple rules.
The same uniformity of accentuation and quantity may be observed in the first syllable of those words which have the accent on the third, as dem-on-slra'-tioiu dim-i-mt!tiotu lu-cu-bra*tion *, Sec. where we evidently perceive a stress on the first syllable shortening every vowel but w, and this in every word throughout the language, except where two consonants folltfw the w, as in cur-vi-lin'e-ar ; or where two vowels follow the consonant that succeeds any other vowel in the first syllable, as dt-vi-a'iion; or, lastly, where the word is not evidently of our own composition, as re-con-veyf: but as u in the first syllable of a word, having the accent on the third, has the same tendency to length and openness as was observable when it preceded the termination ity, I find it necessary to separate u from the consonant in bu-ty-ra'ceous, which I have never heard pronounced, as well as in lu-cu-hra' tion, which I have, and this from no pretended agreement *ith the quantity of the Latin words these are derived from; for, in the former w°id, the u is doubtful: but, from the general system of quantity I see adopted in English pronunciation, this only will direct an English ear with certainty; for, though we may sometimes place the accent on words we borrow from the (»rcek or Latin on the same syllable as in those languages, as acu'mrn, c/egi'ac, &c.; nay, thotlgh we sometimes adopt the accent of the original with every word of the same termination we derive from it, as asddu'ity, vidu'ity, See. yet the quantity of the accented vowel is so often contrary to that of the Latin and (•reek* that not a shadow of a rule can be drawn, in this point, from these Ian---guages to oursf. Thus, in the letter in •question, in the Latin’ accumulo, dubius, tumr't, See. the first u is every where short; but in the English words accumu-toe, dubious, tumour, every where long. Au/uia/is, murmur, turbulenttis, Sec. where the u in the first syllable in Latin is long, we as constantly pronounce it skovt in nujtiial, murmur, turbulent, See. Nor indeed can we wonder that a different (Economy of quantity is observable in the ancient and modem languages, a* in the former, two consonants almost always lengthen the preceding vowel,
