cri ACCENT ON DISSYLLABLES AND TRISYLLABLES.
to preserve the stress inviolably on the second syllable: nor has even the interposition of two consonants been always able to keep the accent from mounting up to the antepenultimate syllable, as we may see in wdrmter, shatter, character, See.; and this map be said to be the favourite accent of our language. See Miscellany.
(c)	But notwithstanding this prevalence of the antepenultimate accent, the
Kneral rule still holds good; and more particularly in words & little removed tm common usage, such as terms in the arts and sciences: these are generally of Greek original; but coming to us through the Latin, most commonly contract the Latin accent when adopted into our language. This will appear plainly by the following lists: and first, let us select some where the Greek and Latin accents coincide:
plethora,	antiphriisis,
metab&sis,	protasis,	*	t porous,
emphasis,	metathesis,
antispasis,	arrlcnrouri^	cpen thesis,	ir/»Gs<rn,
antithesis,	arr#ra»;,	aphaeresis,
(d)	'Another list will show us where the accents of these languages differ:
antanacftsis,	arr*ya«Xflwi;,	hydrophobia,	Jopo^o&o,
catachr^sis,	xaTa^pti-r*;,	cyclopxdia,	xuxXcrrrouiuot^
paracentesis,	mapxxtrt*xn?,	aporia,	a Kopta,
aposiopesis,	anro<r»wT»j<nf,	prosopopoeia,	VTp<xr*nr<yToiet1
antipt6sis,	arnViw*,',	epiphonema,
anadiplOsis,	ayoAVXiwi?,	diaphoresis,
auxesis,	av^vo-tc,	diploma,
mathesis,	/biaGwn*,	parogoge,	-Grapaywytj',
exegesis,	ifnyw*,',	apostrophe,	air<xrrpof u\
In this list we perceive the peculiar tendency of the Latin language to accent the long penultimate vowel, and that of the Greek, to pay no regard to h if the last vowel is short, but to place the accent on the antepenultimate. It will, however, be easily perceived, that in this case we follow the Latin analogy : this analogy will appear more evident by a list of words ending in osis, where, though the o in the penultimate syllable is the omega, the Greek accent is on the antepenultimate:
wrtpo’apxvo’K,	ar&fAopQvcriC)	OHxcrrofAWiC)	afjtxvpvriy,
arcOf&W,	iAira(A6p$xw$y	<rvrxpQp*xric,	crvtoixuvcrtfy
youtyvnfp	*tra,pa’$tpt*rtfr	hopQpwa-i;,	tnrorwpv<n<;.
This analogy has led us to accent certain words formed from the Greek where the omega was not in the penultimate of the original, in the same manner as those words where this long vowel was found: such as Exostosis, formed from ’»x and o<7Ttor, Synneuroids from <n)r and nZpof> Sec. This tendency therefore has sufficiently formed an analogy; and since rules, however absurdly formed at first, arc better than no rules at all, it would, in my opinion, be advisable to consider every word of this form as subject to the penultimate accent, and to look upon afi theosis and mttamorfilv sis as exceptions.
(e)	The next rule we may venture to lay down as a pretty general one, i»i that if the words derived from the learned languages, though anglicised by altering the termination, contain the same number of syllables as in the ori*?
