Mr. Sneridan, Dr. Kenrick, Dr. Ash, Mr. Perry, Buchanan, Barclay, and Bailey, unite in placing the accent on the first syllable of this word ; Entick alone places it on the third. Mr. Sheridan and Buchanan place an accent also on the last syllable, and make the i long; while Dr. Ken-
41m£, m£t ;~-pbe, pin;—	-
rick and Mr. Perry make it sboH. That the accent ought to be on the first syllable cannot be doubted, wben we consider how uniformly we remove the accent higher when we anglicise Latin words by shortening them : and though the i in these terminations is rather ambiguous (156), it certainly inclines to the long sound which Mr. Sheridan and Buchanan have given it. —See Academy and Incomparable.

C/* There is an affected pronunciation of this and the two preceding words, which contrary to our own analogy, preserves the hard. The piea is, that tnese words are erived from the Greek, which always preserved the gamma hard. To produce this reason is to expose it. What would become of our language if every word from the Greek and Latin, that ha^’ g in H* were so pronounced ? What is most to be regretted is, that men of learning sometimes join in these pedantic deviations* which are only worthy of the lowest order of critical coxcombs.—See Gymnastic k.
