QCj* All our prosodists tell us, that the Circumflex accent is a composition of the pravc and the acute; or that it is a raising and falling of the voice upon the same syllable. If they are desired to exemplify this by actual pronunciation, we find they cannot do it, and only pay us with words. This accent, therefore, in the ancient as well as modem languages, with respect to sound, has no specific utility. The Fiench, who make use of this Circumflex in writing, appear, in the usual pronunciation of it, to mean nothing more than long quantity.—Sec B aryto n.—Iftlie inspector would wish to see a rational account of this accert, as well as ofthe ^raw and acute, let him consult a work lately published by the Author of this Dictionary, called A Rhetorical Grammar, the third edition ; or, A Key to the Classical Pro-nunciatid'n of Greet and Latin Proper Ntnne-i	,
