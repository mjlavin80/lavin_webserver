Cj* I see no good reason why we should not write and pronounce swordsman and govmsman rather than swordman and g/nvn-man, though Johnson produces his authorities for the latter orthography irom good authors. The s seems to hare intervened naturally between the mute and the liquid to facilitate the pronunciation^ in statesman, sportsman, huntsman,and sometimes between the t\\o liquids, as, townsman, talesman, &c. But Dr. Johnson’s sense of the word swordman, meaning a man of the profession of the sword, ora soldier, is now obsolete: we now never hear the •word but as signifying a man expert in the use of the sword; and in this sense it is always called a swordsman.
