The first pronunciation of this word is adopted by Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Scott, Dr. Kenrick, Mr. Smith, Mr. Perry, Buchanan, Barclay, Bailey, and Fenning; and the second by Mr. Nares, Dr. Asn, Dr. Johnson, and Entick. As this substantive was derived from the verb, it had formerly the accent ofthe verb: and that this accent was the most prevailing, appears from the majority of authorities in its favour. But the respectable authorities for the second pronunciation, and the pretence of distinguishing it from the verb, may very probably establish it, to the detriment of the sound of the language, without any advantage to its signification.— See Bqwl.
