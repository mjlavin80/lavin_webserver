This affected pronunciation is traced to a gentleman who was one of the greatest ornaments of the Jaw as well as one of the politest scholars of the age, and whose authority has been sufficient to sway the bench and the bar, though author, authentic, theatre, theory, &.C. and a thousand similar words where the tk is heard, are constantly starin.zthem in the face.
The public ear, however, is not so far vitiated as to acknowledge this innovation; for though it may with security, and even approbation, be pronounced in Westminster Hall, it would not be quite so safe for an actor to adopt it on the stage.
I know it will be said, that autoritas is better Latin, that the purer Latin never had the h; and that our word, which is derived from it, ought, on that account, to omit it. But it may be observed, that,according to the best Latin critics, the word ought to be written aucloritas,and t hat,accord ingto this reasoning, we ought to write and prououuce aucto-rity and auctor: but this, I presume, is farther than these innovators would choose to go. The truth is, such singularities of pronunciation should be left to the lower order of critics; who, like coxcombs in dress, would be utterly unnoticed if they were not distinguished by petty deviations from the rest of the world.
