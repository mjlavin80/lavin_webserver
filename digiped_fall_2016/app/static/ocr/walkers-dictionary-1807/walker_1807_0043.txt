DIFFERENT SOUNDS OF THE LETTER A. xxxVii.
with ii afisr k, and so probably pronounced as broad as the German a ; for Div Johnson oKaerves,u many words pronounced with a broad were anciently writ-“ ten with au, as fault, moult ; and we still write fault, vault. This was pro-“tMy the Saxon sound, for it is yet retained in the northern dialects, and in a the rustic pronunciation, as maun for man, haund for hand'* But since the s has vanished, the a has been gradually pronounced slenderer and shorter, till now almost every vestige of the ancient orthography seems lost; though the termination mand in command, demand} &c. formerly written commaund3 demaundx still retains the long sound inviolably*.
80.	As the mute I in calm, psahn, caff, half, &c. seems to lengthen the sound of this letter, so the abbreviation of some words by apostrophe seems to have the same effect. Thus when, by impatience, that grand corrupter of manners5 j m well as language, the no is cut out of the word cannot, and the two syllables T reduced to one, we find the a lengthened to the Italian or middle a, as cannot, ‘ can't; have not, han't; shall not, sha'n't, &c. This is no more than what the Latin language is subject to; it being a known rule in that tongue, that when, by composition or otherwise, two short syllables become one, that syllable is almost always long, as alius has the penultimate long because it comes from a&us, and the two short vowels in coago become one long vowel in cogo, 8cc.
81.	The short sound of the middle or Italian a, which is generally confounded with the short sound of the slender a, is the sound of this vowel in man, pan, ton, mat, hat, &c.: we generally find this sound before any two successive consonants (those excepted in the foregoing remarks), and even when it comes before an r, if a vowel follow, or the r be doubled; for if this consonant be doubled, in order to produce another syllable, the long sound becomes short, as mar, marry, car, carry, 5cc. where we find the monosyllable has the long, and the dissyllable the short sound; but if a come before r, followed by another consonant, it has its long sound, as in part, partial, Sec.
82.	The only exception to this rule is in adjectivcs derived from substantives ending in r ,• for in this case the a continues long, as in the primitive. Thus the a in starry, or full of stars, is as long as in star ; and the a in the adjective tarry, or besmeared with tar, is as long as in the substantive tar, though short in the word tarry, (tq stay).
. 83. The third long sound of a is that which we more immediately derive from our maternal language the Saxon, but which at present we use less than any other: this is the a in fall, ball, gall, (33): we find a correspondent sound to this a in the diphthongs au and aw, as laud, law, saw, Sec.; though it must here be noted, that we have improved upon our German parent, by giving a broader sound to this letter in these words than the Germans themselves would do, were they to pronounce them.
*	Since the first publication of this Dictionary the public have been favoured with some ▼t*ry elaborate aodjudieiou? observations ou English pronunciation,by Mr. Smith,in a Scheme of a French and English Dictionary. Ir. this work he departs frequently from my judgment* tad particularly ia the pronunciation of the letter n when succeeded by ss, si, or n, and another consonant, as passt-last, chance, &c. to which he annexes the long sound of a in father. That this was the ^oond formerly, is highly probable from its be ing still the sound given it by the yalpar, who are generally the la*t to alter the common pronunciation; but that the short a in these words is now the general pronunciation of the polite and learned world, seems to be candidly acknowledged by Mr. Smith himself; and as evtrv correct ear would be disgusted at giving the a in these words the full long sound of the •: in father, any middle sound on$ht to be discountenanced, as tending to render the pronunciation of a language obscure indefinite.
