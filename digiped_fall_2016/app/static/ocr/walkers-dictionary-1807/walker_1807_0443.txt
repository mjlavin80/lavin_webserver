I have differed from Mr. Sheridan in the accentuation of this word. He has p aced the accent on the second syllable, with the authority of every Dictionary', and of every good Speaker, against him. In the first edition of this Dictionary, when I supposed Mr. Sheridan’s accentuation of this word agreeable to analogy, I did not recollect the verb to explicate, whence it is derived, and which, in my opinion, ought to determine its accentuation.—See Principles, No. 512. Dr. Johnson, Mr. Scott, Mr. Perry, Dr. Kenrick, Dr. Ash, Entick, and Barclay, place the accent on the first syllable, as I have done.
