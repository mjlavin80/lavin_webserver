fljT Mr. Perry, Buchanan, and Entick, pronounce the a in the first syllable long, like that in page ; but Mr. Sheridan, Dr. Kenrick, Mr. Scott, ami Mr. Nares, make it short, as in pad.* that tiie first is more analogical is evident, as the accented a is succeeded by the diphthong ea (505) ; but that the last is more agreeable to general
. usage, I have not the least doubts. The same reason holds good for the first a in pageantry ; but usage is stiU more decidedly for the short sound of this word, than in pageant. Mr. Sheridan, Dr. Kenrick, Mr. Perry, and W. Johnston, adopt the short sound, and Entick alone tiie long one.
