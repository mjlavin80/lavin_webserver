OCJ* Dr. Johnson, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Scott, W. Johnston, Dr. Ash, Dr. Kenrick, Mr. Barclay, and Baily, place the accent on the first syllable ofth^s word; and Mr. Nares, and Entick only, on the second. Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Scott give the a the sound it has in glaze, and Dr. Kenrick gives it the sound of a in glass. The great majority of suffrages for the accent dn the first syllable, which is the most agreeable to the analogy of our own language, are certainly sufficient to keep a plain Englishman in countenance for pronouncing the word in this manner; but as it is a French word, and a military term, a military man would blush not to pronounce it a la Fran^oise; and notwithstanding the numbers for the other manner, I cannot but think this the most fashionable.
