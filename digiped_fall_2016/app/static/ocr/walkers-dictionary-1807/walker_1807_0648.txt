Mall, mil. s. A stroke, a blow. Ob solete. A kind of beater or hammer; a walk where they formerly played, with malls and balls.
This wordis a whimsical instance of the caprice of custom. Nothing can be more uniform than the sound we give to a before double I in the same syllable ; and yet this word, when it signifies a wooden hammer, has not only changed its deep sound of a in all into the a in alley, but has dwindled into the short sound of e in Mall, a walk in S . James’s Park, where thev formerly played with malls and balls, and from whence it had its name ; jyidto crown the absurdity, a street parallel to this walk is spelt Pall Mall, and pronounced Pelhnell, which confounds its origin with the French adverb pHe mSle. For Bailey appears to derive the name of the street justly from pcllere malleo, to strike with a nudlet. That this word was justly pronounced formerly, we can scarcely doubt from the rhymes to it;
•With mighty mall
11	Tne monster merciless him made to faU."
Spenser.
“ And give that reverend head a mall “ Or two or three against a wall.99
Hudibras•
As a corroboration of this, we find a large wooden club used for killing swine, called and spelt a mall { and the verb signifying to beat or bruise is spelt and pronounced in the same manner. The word mallet, where the latter I is separated from the former, is under a different predicament, and is pronounced regularly,_____
