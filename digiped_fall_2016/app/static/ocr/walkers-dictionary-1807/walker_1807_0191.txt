word,as a nonn,was universally pro- I Bounced with the accent oa the last syllable till about the middle of the seventeenth century. It grew antiquated iu Mi Item’s time, and is now entirely obsolete. Dr. Farmer’s observations on this word, in his no less solid than ingenious Essay oa The Learning of Sbakspeare, are so curious, as well as ju*t, that the reader will, I doubt not, be obliged to me for quoting them.
V	Sometimes a very little matter detects a for-“ gery- You may remember a play called “ the Double Falsehood, which Mr. Theo-“ baJd was desirous of palming upon the *' world for a posthumous one of Shak-u gpeare; and I see it is classed as such iu the u last edition of the Bodleian catalogue. Mr. “ Pope himself, after all the strictures of M Scriblerus, in a letter to Aaron Hill, sup-“ poses it of that age ; but a mistaken ac-“ cent determines it to have been writim “ since the middle of the last century:
■	This	late	example
“ Of base Henriquez,bleeding in me now,
“ From each good aspect takes away my trust.”
And in another place,
** Yon have an aspect. Sir,-of wondrous wisdom.”
<* The word aspect, you perceive, is here ac-*• cented on the jirst syllable, which, I am ’* confident, in any sense of it, was never the “ case in the time of Shakspeare ; though “ it may sometimes appear to be so, when ** we do not observe a preceding Elision. •* Some of the professed imitators of our old poets have not attended to this and many ** other minutia : 1 could point out to you “ several performances in the respective “ tlides of Chaucer, Spencer, and Shak-
*# speare, which the imitated bard could not u possibly have either read or construed. n TMs very accent bath troubled the annotators on Miltou. Dr. Bentley observes it “ to be a tone different from the present “ use. Mr, Manwaring, in his Treatise of “ Harmony and Numbers, very solemnly informs us, that this verse is defective
•* both in accent and quantity.
41 JJis words here ended; but his meek aspect,
" Silent, yet spake.”------—
n Here, says he, a syllable is acuted and low*, 41 whereas it should be short and graced!” *• And a still more extraordinary gentleman, u one Green, who published a specimen of
“ a new version of the Paradise Lost, inlo “ blank verse, “ by which that amazing “ work is brought somewhat nearer the lt summit of perfection,” begins with cor-“ recting a blunder in the fourth book,
.	-----** The setting sun
41 Slowly descended, and with right «f-pect—
41 Levell’d his evening ray?.”
(t Not so iu the new version:
“ Meanwhile the setting sun descending slow—
** Levell’d with aspect right his ev’ning rays.”
“ Enough ofsuch commentators.—'The cele-4i brated Dr. Dee had a spirti, who would “ sometimes condescend to correct him, “ when peccant in quantity: and it had been “ kind of him to have a little assisted the “ wights above mentioned.—Milton affect-“ ed the antique ; but it may seem more
*	extraordinary, that the old accent should “ be adopted in tiudibras.”
