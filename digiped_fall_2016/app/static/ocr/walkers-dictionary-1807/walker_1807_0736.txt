Papillary, p&p'pil4-r£. a.

All these, except the last, which was not inserted, 1 had
*	accented on the first syllable in a Rhyming and Pronouncing Dictionary published thirty years ago.
This accentuation I still think the most agreeable to analogy ; and that the inspector may judge of the usage, I have subjoined the several different modes of accentuation of the different orthoepists : Axfillury,	Johnson, Kenrick. ^

Johnson, Sheridan, Ash, Kenrick, W. Johnston, Buchanan, Bailey, Barclay, Fenning, Entick. This extract sufficiently shows how uncertain usage is, and the necessity of recurring to principles : and that these are on the side I have adopted, may be gathered from No. 512.—See Mamillauv and -v Maxillary.
