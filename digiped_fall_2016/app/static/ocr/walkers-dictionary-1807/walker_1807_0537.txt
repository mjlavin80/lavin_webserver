Hiccough, hlk'kiip, or hik'kftf. s. A convulsion of the stomack producing-sobs.
This is one of those words which seems to have been corrupted by a laudable intention of bringing it nearer to its original. The convulsive sob was supposed to be a species of cough ; but neither Junius nor Skinner mention any such derivation, and both suppose it formed from the sound It occasions. Accordingly we find, though hiccough is the most general orthography, hickup is the most usual pronunciation. Thus Butler :
“ Quoth ke, to bid me not to love,
<f I s to forbid my pulse to move ;
** My beard to grow, my ears to prick up, <c Or, when I’m in a fit, to hickup
