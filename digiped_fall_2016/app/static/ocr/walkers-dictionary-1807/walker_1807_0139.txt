CRITICAL PRONOUNCING
DICTIONARY
AND EXPOSITOR OF THE
ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
The figure* between the parentheses refer to the numbers in the Principles of Pronunciation prefixed to this Dictionary, where the different sounds of the letters are explained at large. Thus (73) refers to the first sound of the letter A; (93) to the first sound of the letter E; and so of the rest.	,
The figures over the letters refer to the vowels m the words at the top of the page ; and the index before these words, refers to the table of simple and dipthongal sounds, where the different sounds of the vowels are exhibited at one view. Thus *3* (559) refers to the table in the opposite page.
(559). Fite (73), fir (77), fill (83\ fit (81); mi (93), m«t<95); plfte (105), pin (107); nd(l62), mfive (164), nAr (167),not (163); tilBe(l7l), l4b (l72), bill (173); 611 (29*<); p6und (313) } Mn (466), THIS (469).
A The first letter of the alphabet
f (73). A, an article set before nouns of the singular number; a mao, a tree. Before a word beginning with a vowel, it is written an, as an ox. A is sometimes a souu, as great A. A is placed before a participle, or participial noun: gone a bunting, come a begging. A has a signification de-aoting proportion: the landlord bath a hundred a year.

Of the Alphabetical Pronunciation qf the Letter A.
So many profound and ingenious observations fcavebeen made upon this firpt step to literature, that volumes might be filled with the audition that has been lavished on this letter alone. Tbe priority of place it claims, in all alphabets, has made it so much the object of atteution, that philologists suppose the foundation of learning but weakly l**d till the natural and civil history of the first letter be fully settled.
Bot, however deep have been tbeir researches into the origin of this letter, we find no author in our language has hitherto attempted to settle the disputes that have arisen be-
tween the natives of England, Ireland, and Scotland, about the true sound of it, when called by its name. Instead, therefore, of tracing this character through the circles of Gomer, the Egyptian Hieroglyphics, the mysterious Abraxas, or the Irish Ogum, I shall endeavour to obviate a difficulty that frequently arises when it is pronounced in the Hornbook : or, in other words, to enquire what is the true name of the first letter of the English alphabet—whether we are to say Aye> B, C; Ah, B, C; or Arc, B, C.
And first, it will be necessary to consider the nature of a vowel; which grammarians are generally agreed iu defining to be “ a sim* “ pie articulate sound, formed by the im« “ pulse of the voice by the opening only of “ the mouth in a particular manner.” Now, as every vowel by itself is sounded long, s* nothing but its junction with a consonant can make it otherwise, it is natural, when pronouncing this vowel alone, to give it the long open sound; but as this long open sound is threefold,as heard inface father t*ndwater, a question arises, which of these loug sounds shall we adopt as a common name to the whole species of this letter ? The English make choice of the a i uface, tbe I rish of that in father, and the Scotch of that in water. Each partyproduces words where the letter a is sounded in the manner they contend forj but when we demand why one should have the preference, the controversy is common* ly at an end; any farther reasons are either
