DIFFERENT SOUNDS OF THE LETTER L
li
khe, except in the two verbs, give, live, and their compounds, giving, living, &c.; for the adjective live, as a live animal, has the i long, and rhymes with strive ; so have the adjective and adverb, lively and livelily: the noun livelihood follows the same analogy ; but the adjective live-long, as the the live-long day, has the i short, as in the verb. When the accent is not on the i in this termination it is always short, tfcs sportive, plaintive, kc. rhyming with give (150), except the word be a gentile, as Argtve.
158.	All the other adjectives and substantives of this termination, when the
accent is not on it, have the i invariably short, as offensive, defensive, See. The i in ue is short, as if written sallick, but long in oblique, rhyming with pike, strike, Sec.; while antique has the i long and slender, and rhymes with speak. Dr. Kenrick Mr. Elphinston, Mr. Perry, Buchanan, and Barclay, have obleek for oblique ; Mr. Scott has it both ways, but gives the slender sound first; and Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Nares, and W. Johnston, obfike. The latter is, in my opinion, more agreeable to polite usage, but the former more analogical; for as it comes from the French oblique, we cannot write it obUke, as Mr. Nares wishes, any more than antiijue, antike, for fear of departing too far from the Latin anti-quus and obliquus. Opaque, Mr. Nares observes, has become opake ; but then it must be remembered, that the Latin is o/iacus, and not opaquus.	"
159.	All the terminations in ize have the i long, except to endenize ; which, having the accent on the second syllable, follows the general rule, and has the
*	short, pronounced as in the verb is. (140.) To these observations we may add, that though evil and devil suppress the /, as if written ev’l and dev'I, yet that cavil and pencil preserve its sound distinctly ; and that iMtin ought never to be pronounced as it is generally at schools, as if written Latt*n. Cousin and cozen both drop the last vowels, as if spelled cozn, and are only distinguishable to the eye.
Thus we see how little regularity there is in the sound of this letter when it is not under the accent; and, when custom will permit, how careful we ought to be to preserve the least trace of analogy, that a confusion may not be worse confounded.” The sketch that has been just given may, perhaps, afford something like a clew to direct us in this labyrinth, and it is hoped it wiil enable the judicious speaker to pronounce with more certainty and decision.
160.	It was remarked under the vowel A, that when a hard g or c preceded that vowel, a sound like e interposed, the better to unite tjie letters, and soften the sound of the consonant The same may he observ ed of the letter I. When this vowel is preceded by hard g or k, which is but another form for hard c, it is pronounced as if an e were inserted between the consonant and the vowel: thus *kv, kind, guide, guise, disguise, catechise, guile, beguile, mankind, are pronounced as if written ske-y, ke-ind, gue-ise, di&-guc-ise, cate-che-isc, gue-ile, begue-ile,manke-ind* At first sight we are surprised that two such different letters as a and i should be affected in the same manner by the hard gutturals, g, c, and k; but when we reflect that * is really composed of a and e, (37,) our surprise ceases; and we are pleased to find the ear perfectly uniform in its procedure, and entirely unbiassed by the eye. From this view of the analogy we may see how greatly mistaken is a very solid and ingenious writer on this subject, who says, that w ky-ind for kind is a monster of pronunciation, heard only on our stage.” Nares’ English Orthoepy, page 28.

It may not, parhaps, seem unworthy of notice, that whenrthis letter is unaccented in the numerous terminations ify, ibk, 8ec. it is frequently pronounced fike short u, as if the words semi hie, visible, &c. were written ser.svbble, visubble, *c.; and charity, chastity, See. like charrutty* chastutty, See.: but it may be ob*
