the clearest analogies of the language; which is, that the antepenultimate, and secondary accent, shorten every vowel they fall upon except u, unless they are followed by a diphthong. (534) (535). This analogy is evident in a numerous catalogue of words ending in ity, where the antepenultimate vowel is short in English, though long in the Latin words whence they are (lerived, as, serenity y divinity, globcsity, See. The same may be observed of the words declamatory, deliberative, &c. where the two second syllables are short in English, though long in the Latin dcclamatorius, deliberativus, &c. Even the words liberal and liberty, if pronounced with their first syllables long, as in the Latin words //-
•	beralis and libertas, ought to be sounded lye'beral and lye'berty. If, therefore, we consider the accent on the first syllable of legislator, legislature, or legislative, either as primary or secondary, we find a clear i analogy for shortening the vowel; nor can we have the least reason for lengthening it, which will not oblige us in tiie same manner to lengthen the first vowel of lenitivey pedagogue, pacification, and a thousand others. See principles, No 530, 535. Mr. Sheridan, Dr. Kenrick, Mr. Scott, and Mr. Perry, mark the e in the ‘ first syllab'e of this word and its relatives short. W. Johnston only marks them long. From Entick we can gather the quantity of this vow el in no word but legislate, where he makes it long; and Ash, Bailey, and Buchanan, do not mark it either way. These authorities sufficiently show us the general current of custom ; and the analogies of the language sufficiently show the propriety of it.
