Till a better reason appear, let us suppose the following : Fetus, except the diphthong, retains its Latin form,and therefore is naturally pronounced w-th its first syllable long. Fetid is anglicised ; and as most of these anglicised words of two syllables arc derived from Latin words ofthrec where tiie first, be it short or long, is in our English-Latin pronounced short, the same syllable in the English word* is generally short likewise. Tins has established something like a rule; and this rule has shortened the first syllable of Fetid,, though long in the Latin FatiJus.—See Drama.
