Merchant, mSr'tshdnt. s. (352). One ■who trafficks to remote countries.
(Ej* Mr. Sheridan pronounces the e in the first syllable of this word, like the a in march ; and it is certain that, about thirty years ago, this was the general pronunciation ; but since that time the sound of a has been gradually wearing away; and the sound of e is so fully established, that the former is now become gross and vulgar, and is only to be heard among the lower orders of people. It is highly p. obable that, however coarse this sound of e may now seem, it was once not only the common pronunciation, but the most agreeable to analogy. We still find, that the vowel i before r, followed by another consonant,sinks into a broader sound by taking the short •ound of e, which is really the short sound of a slender a, as virgin, virtue, &c.; and it is a similar alteration which takes place in the e before r, followed by another conso-nunt, in clerk, serjeant, Derby, &c. where this vowel falls into the broader sound of the Italian a. Sermon, service, vermin, &c. are still pronounced by the vulgar, as if written sarnion, sarvice, varment, &c.; and this was probably the ancient manner of pronouncing every e in the same situation. This analogy is now totally exploded; and, except clerk, serjeant, and a few proper names, we have scarcely another word in the language where the e has not its true sound. But instead of saying, with Mr. Nares, that merchant has returned to the proper sound of c, we may with great probability assert, that this and every other word of the same form have acquired a sound of e9 which they never had before ; and which, though a feebler and a shorted sound, conduces to the simplicity and regularity of our pronunciation. Dr. Kenrick concurs, in my opinion, that pronouncing the e in this word like a is vulgar; and every other orthoepist, who gives the sound of the vowels, marl^s it as I have done.
