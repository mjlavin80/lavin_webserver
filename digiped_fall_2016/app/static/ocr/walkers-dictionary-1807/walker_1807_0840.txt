Spenser and Milton p’ace the accent upon the second syllable of this word; and as Mr. Nares observes, Dr. Johnson has,oo the authority of these authors, adopted thv accentuation: “ But this,” says Mr. Nares,
“ is irregular; for every monosyllabic ter-“ inination added to a word accented on “ the antepenult, throws tbe accent to the “ fourth syllable from the end.** With great respect for Mr. Nares* opinion on this subject, I should think a much easier and more general rule might be laid dowu for all words of this kind, which is, that those words which take the Saxon terminations after them, as rr, less, ness, less ness t ly% ic. preserve the accent of the radical word; therefore this and the following word ought to have the same accent as remedy, from which they are formed.—See Principles,
No. 489,501.
