ing privation of any thing; consisting in the absence of something; not positive. OCJ* Mr. Sheridan, Dr. Kenrick, Dr. Ash, Mr. Scott, W. Johnston, and Entick,make the first syllable of this word short, as I have done; and Mr. Perry and Buchanan make it long. In defence of the first pronunciation it may be observed, that this word is not like primacy and primary; the •first of which is a formative of our own ; and the second derived from the Latin primariut, which in our pronunciation of the Latin, does net shorten the i in the first syllable asprivativu* does, (see Academy and Incomparable ;) and therefore these words are no rule for the pro nunciation of this; which, besides the general vtendency of the penultimate accent to shorten every vowel it falls on but u (535), seems to have another claim to the short vowel from its termination: thus sanative, donative, prhnative, derivative, kc. all plead for the short sound.
