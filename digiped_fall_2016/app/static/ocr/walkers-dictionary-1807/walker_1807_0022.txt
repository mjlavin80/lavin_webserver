Rule* to be observed by (he Natives of Scotland for attaining a just PrommcTa*
tion of English,
TTHAT pronunciation which distinguishes the inhabitants of Scotland is of a very different kind from that of Ireland, and may be divided into the quantity, quality, and accentuation of the vowels. With respect to quantity, it may be observed, that the Scotch pronounce almost all their accented vowels long. Thus, if I am not mistaken, they would pronounce habit, hay-bit; tepid, tee-ftid ; sinner, see-ner ; conscious, cone-shus ; and subject, soob-ject *: it is not pretended, however, that every accented vowel is so pronounced, but that such a pronunciation is vei*y general, and particularly of the i. This vowel is short in English pronunciation, where the other vowels are long; thus, evasion, adhesion, emotion, confusion, have the a, r, o, and u, long; and in these instances the Scotch would pronounce them like the English; but in vision decision, &c. where the English pronounce the i short, the Scotch lengthen this letter by pronouncing it like ee, as if the words were written vee-sion, decee-sion, &c. and this peculiarity is universal. The best way, therefore, to correct this, will be to make a collection of the most usual words which have the vowels short, and to pronounce them daily till a habit is formed. See Principles, No. 507.
With respect to the quality of the vowels, it may be observed, that the inhabitants of Scotland are apt to pronounce the a like aw, where the English give it the slender sound : thus Satan, is pronounced Sawtan, and fatal, fata-tal. It may be remarked too, that the Scotch give this sound to the a preceded by w, according to the general rule, without attending to the exceptions, Principles, No. 88; and thus, instead of making wax, waft, and twang, rhyme with tax, shaft, and hang, they pronounce them so as to rhyme with box, soft, and song. The short e in bed, fed, red, &c. borders too much upon the English sound of a, in bad, lad, mad, &c. and the short i in bid, lid, rid, too much on the English sounds of e in bed, led, red. To corrcct this error, it would be useful to collect the long and short sound of these vowels, and to pronounce the long ones first, and to shorten them by degrees till they arc perfectly short; at the same time preserving the radical sound of the vowel in both. Thus the correspondent long sounds to the e in bed, fed, red, arc bade, fade, rade ; and that of the short i in bid, lid, rid, are bead, lead, retd; and the former of these classes will naturally lead the car to the true sound of the latter, the only
*	That this is the general mode of pronouncing these words in Scotland is indisputable : and it is highly probable that the Scotch hare preserved the'old English pronunciation, from which the English themselves have insensibly departed. Dr. Hick9 observed long ago, that the Scotch saxonised in their language much more than the English ; and it is scarce* ly to be doubted that a situation nearer to the Continent, and a greater commercial intercourse with other nations, made the English admit of numberless changes which never extended to Scotland. About the reign of Queen Elizabeth, when the Greek and Latin languages were cultivated, and the pedantry of showing an acquaintance with them became fashionable, it is not improbable that*an alteration in the quantity of many words took place ; for as in Latin almost every vowel before a single consouant is short, so in English almost every vowel in the same situation was supposed to be long, or our ancestors would not have doubled th£ consonant in the participles of verbs, to prevent the preceding vowel from lengthening. But when once this affectation of Latinitv was adopted, it is no wonder it should extend beyond its principles, and shorten several vowels in English, because they were short in the original Latin £ and iu this nuinner, perhaps, might the diversity betwc en the quantity of the English and the Scotch pronunciation arise, (542) (543).
