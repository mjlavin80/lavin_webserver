(£j> Dr. Johnson seems to have accented this word on the last syllable, in compliance with tlie verb advertise, which is exactly of the same form, and therefore he thought ought to be accented in the same manner. But by making divertise conform in accentuation to advertise, we make the general rule stoop to tlie exception, rather than the exception to the general rule. For in all verbs of three or more syllables where the termination ise is only the verbal formation, and does not belong to the root, wc never find the accent on it; as criticise, exercise, epitomise, &c.—See Advertisement.
