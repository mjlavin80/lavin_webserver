Cjr* This and the following word are by Dr. Johnson accented on the secorvl syllable ; ho doubt from the harshness that must necessarily arise from placing* the accent on the first, when so many unaccented syllables are to succccd. But if harmony were to take placc, we should never suffer the stress on' the first syllable of Contrary, from which these words are formed ; but that oncc admitted, ;is it invariably is by the best speakers, we should cross the most uniform analogy of our language, if we accented the adverb differently from the substantive and the adjective ; and therefore, however harsli they may sound, these words must necessarily ha%c the accent on the first syllable.

|The qccent is invariably placed on the first syllable of this word by all correct speakers, and as constantly removed to the second by the illiterate and vulgar. Whfcn common ears refuse a sound, it is a strong presumption that sound is not agreeable to the general harmony of the language. The learned often vitiate the natural taste for their own language by an affected veneration for others : while the illiterate, by a kind of vernacular instinct, fall into the most analogical pronunciation, and such as is most suitable to th<? general turn of the language. An, ciently this word was most commonly pronounced by the learned, as it is now by the nilgai*, with the accent ou the sccond syllabic j but nothing can be now more J irmly established than the acccnt on the first syllable, and the other pronunciation must be scrupulously avoided.—See Cox-TBARILY.

(140). Accordingly Dr. Johnson, Mr. Scott, and Bailey, place the accent on the last syllable ; but Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Nares, Mr. Elphinstone, Dr. Ash, \V. Johnston, Perry, Buchanan, and Entiek, place it on the first, with unquestionably the best usage on their side.
