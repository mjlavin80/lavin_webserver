SpooCer, says Mr. Nares, was probably misled, as well as tbe Lexicographer, by a false notion of the etymology. The word, as well as the game, is French, bittdrd; and made by the addition of a common termination, from bilk, the term for the ball used in playing.

This word and Bipedal have the i Ion;: in Dr. Ash and Mr. Sheridan ; Iwt Mr. Perry makes the / in the first long, and in the last short: *;alo?y, however, seems to decide in favour of the sound 1 have given it. For ^	though the penultimate accent, has a ten-
*	dcncy to lengthen the vowel when follow-
ed by a single consonant, as ip biped, tri-
pod, fee. the antepenultimate accent has* greater tendency to shorten the vowel it falls upon.—See Bigamy and Tripod. (503).
Bipartite, blp'pir-tite. a. (155). Having two correspondent parts.
(£/* Every orthoepist has the accent on the first syllable of this word but Entick, w!io places it on the second; but a considerable difference is found in the quantity of the f»v«tand last ?. Sheridan and Scott hare them both long, Nares the last long, Perry both short, and Buchanan and Wr. Johnston as I have done it. The varieties of quantity on this word are the more surprising, as all these writers that give tho sound ol the vowels make the first i in tripartite short, and the last long; and this uniformity iu the pronunciation of one word ought to have led them to the same pronunciation of the other, so perfectly similar. The shortening power of the antepenultimate accent is evident iu both. (503).
