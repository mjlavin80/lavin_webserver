44 Ei is also sounded ee by the English, and as & by the Irish; thtis the word dec«7, receive, are pronounced by them as if written de*a/r, re*<n/<\ Ei is 44 always sounded eey except when a g follows it, as in the words reign, feign,
44 deign, 8cc.; as also in the words rein (of a bridle), m^-deer, vein, dran, veil,
44 heir, wliich are pronounced like rain, vain, drain, vail, air.
^ 44 The final mute ^, makes the preceding r in the same syllable^ when accented,
“ have the sound of ee1 as in the words supreme, sincere, replete. This rule 44 is almost universally broken through by tie Irish, who pronounce all such 44 words as if written supreme, sins&re, rcpl&te, See. There are but two excep-44 tions to this rule in the English pronunciation, which are the words ihere>
44 where.	*
44 In the way of marking this sound, by a double ?, as thus ee, as the Irish 44 never make any mistakes, the best method for all who want to acquire the 44 right pronunciation of these several combinations is, to'suppose that ta, «,
44 and f, attended by a final mute e, are all spelt with a double e, or ee.
u Ry is always sounded like & by the' English when the accent is upon it;
44 as in the words fircy, convey, pronounced firay, convau. To this there are 44 but two exceptions, in the words k£y and l£y, sounded kee% Ice. The Irish,
44 in attempting to pronounce like the English, often give the saiqe sound to ey u as usually belongs to ei; thus for /jm/, convey, they say flrce, convee.
44 A strict observation of these few rules, with a due attention to the very few u exceptions enumerated above, will enable the well-educated natives of Ire-44 land to pronounce their w ords exactly in the same way as the more polished 44 part of the inhabitants of England do, so far as the vowels are concerned.
44 The dipthongs they commit no fault in, except in the sound of i, which 44 has been already taken notice of in the Grammar*: where, likewise, the 44 only difference in pronouncing any of the consonants has been pointed out; u which is the thickening the sounds of d and r, in certain situations; and an 44 easy method proposed of correcting this habit f.
44 In order to complete the whole, I shall now give a list of such detached 44 words that do not come under any of the above rules, as are pronounced u differently in Ireland from what they are in England:
*	“ Vide p. 11. where the true manner of pronouncing the dipthong i is pointed out; “ the Irish pronuncing it much in the same manner as the French.
+ “ The letter (/has always the same sound by those who pronounce English well ; but the tc Provincials, particularly the Irish, Scotch,and Welsh, in many words thicken the sound “ by a mixture of breath. Thus, though they sound the d right in the positive loud and “ broad, in the comparative decree they thicken it by an aspiration, and sound it as if it were “ written lottdher, brondher. This vicious pronunciation is produced by pushing the tongue for-“ ward so as to touch the teeth in forming that sound : and the way to cure it is easy ; for as “ they can pronounce the r/propcrly in the word loud, l«tthein rest a little upon that syl-** labie, keeping the tongue in the position of forming d> and then let them separate it from u the upper gum without pushing it forward, and the sound der will be produced of course : for. the organ being left in the position of sounding d at the end of the syllable loud “ is necessarily in the position of forming the same d in uttering the last syllable, unless il ** make? a new movement, as in the case of protruding it so as to touch the teeth. This let-“ ter is sometimes, though not often, quiescent, as in the words handkerchief, handtome, handset u In pronouncingthe letter / the Irish and oth^r Provincials thicken the sound, as was be u fore mentioned with regard to the d; for they say betUter ; for utter, uttker • and s< “ on in all words of that structure. This faulty manner arises from the same cause tba “ was mentioned as aflectiugthe sound of the d; I mean the nrotruding of the tongue s< " as to touch the teeth, and is curable only in the same way.*'
