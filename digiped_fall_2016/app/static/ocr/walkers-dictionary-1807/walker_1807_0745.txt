Q3* That the first syllable of this word is short, and that of patron lonfj, is owing to the shortening power of the antepenultimate accent. (503).
Patronal, p&t'r6-n&l. a. Protecting, supporting, guarding, defending.
This word, like Matronal, has a diversity of pronunciation in our Dictionaries, which shows the necessity of rccurring to principles in order to fix its true sound. Buchanan places the accent on the first syllable; but whether he makes the a long or short cannot be known. Dr. Asn places the accent on the same syllable; and though he makes the a in Matronal short, yet he makes the same letter in this word long, as in Patron. Barclay and Fenning lay the stress upon the first of Matronal, and on the second of Patronal .* Perry and Entick place the accent on the first of both these ifcords, but make.the a in Ma-tronal long, and the same letter in Patronal short. Bailey accents the second syllable of this word.
Patroness, p&'triin-£s. s. A female that defends, countenances, or supports j a female guardian saint.	(
1	am well aware of the shortening power of the antepenultimate accent in Patronage, Patronise, &c. but cannot, as Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Scott, W. Johnston, Dr. Kenrick, and Mr. Perry, have done, allow it that power in Patroness, because the feminine termination ess is as much a
, subjunctive of our own as the participial terminations ing or ed, or the plural number, and therefore never ought to alter the accent or quantity of the original word.— See Principles, No. 386, 499.
