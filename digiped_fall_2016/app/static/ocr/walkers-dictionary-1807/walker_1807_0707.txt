(E?* W. Johnston and Entick are the only orthoepists who adopt the first mode of accenting this word; while I)r. Johnson, Dr. Ash, Mr. Sheridan, Dr. Kenrick, Buchanan, Perry, and Barclay, adopt the last Mr. Scott adopts both, but seems to give the latter the preference by placing it first. The accentuation of this word must be determined by that of r.bdurate, from which it is derived. It seems, however, to follow the example of accuracy, procuracy, &c. in throwing the accent on the first syllable. As there are some terminations which seem to attract the accent lo the lat* ter syllables, as, ator^eud, &c. as spectator, observatory &c. comprehend, apprehend, he. so there are others that seem to repel it to the beginning of the word, as ary, acy9 &c. as,e^T acy.optimacy, contumacy t &c. *<*-hit ary % tributary, adversary, Sec.

Johnston. Mr. Scott accents it either on the first or second, but seems to give the preference to the latter. The Poets are decidedly in favour of the penultimate accent; and when the us;*.ge of poetry does not contradict any plain analogy of prosaic pronunciation, it certainly has a respectable authority. But the verb to indurate is a word of exactly the same form, and has the same derivation; and yet Dr. Johnson, Mr. She*
