(£j* All oar orthbepists teU us that ttiis word is ^eneraUy pronounced in two syllables, as if written medcine.• That so gross a vulgarism should gain ground in our language, is an imputation on our national taste. Our poets, who, when tortured for a word, often torture a word to ease themselves, are generally guUty of one part only of the cruelty of Procrustes, and that is of shortening such words as are too long for their verse ; and these mutilations too often slide into our prosaick pronunciation: but against this abuse every accurate speaker ought to be on his guard. Nay, Cowley, as Mr. Nares informs us, crushes medicinal into two syllables ; and instances from Milton of this kind are innumerable.
Mr. Elphinston adopts the dissyUable pronunciation as more agreeable to its immediate origin, the French medecene: but as we preserve the i in this word, the Latin medicina seems its most authentick original, and demands the sound of the i in medicine as much as in ominous, mutinous, and original, which Shakspeare and Milton sink in tha same manner as the word in question.
