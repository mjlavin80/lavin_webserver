Qjr* From what oddity I know not, this word i* frequenUy pronounced as ifacccntod on tbe last syllable but one, and is generally found written as if it ought to be so pronounced, the t being doubled, as is usual vhen a participlc is formed from a verb that its accent on the last syllable. Dr. Johnson, indeed, has very judiciously set both orthography and pronunciation to rights, and spell5 t he word with one /, though he finds it with two in the quotations he gives ^from Garth and Swift. That the former thought it might be pronounced with the accent on the second syllable, is highly presumable from the use lie makes of it, where he mvs :
“ Bigottcd to this idol, we disclaim u Rest, health, and ease, for nothing but a name.”
For if we do not lay the acccnt on the second syllable, here the verse will be unpar-donably rugged. This mistake must certainly take its rise from supposing a verb which does not exist, namely, as bigot; but as this word is derived from a substantive, it ought to have the same accent; thus though the words balL>t and billet are verbs as well as nouns, yet as they have the accent on tbe first syllable, the participial adjectivesde-Tived from them have only one /, and both are pronounced with the accent on the first syllable, as balloted, billeted. Bigoted therefore ought to have but one /, and to preserve the a^ent oo the f*r«i; ?ytyable.

'j* Mr. Nares has very judiciously corrected a false etymology of Dr. Johnson in this word, which might eventually lead to a false pronunciation. Dr. Johnson derives it from bal and jyarr/, or sticky to push it with. So Spencer—
