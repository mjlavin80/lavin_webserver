^tainly pronounced so two centuries ago, as appears by Dr. Johnson’s quotation of him:
** Our court shall be a little academy, Still and contemplative in living arts.*’
*	Love's Labour's Lost.
. And in Ben Johnson’s New Jnnwe find the tame accentuation:
----“ Every house became

But the accentuation of this word formerly, on the first syllable, is so generally acknowledged, as not to stand in need of poetic authority. The question is, whether this accentuation, or that which places the stress on the second syllable, is the most proper? To wave, therefore, the authority of custom, which precludes all reasoning on language, and reduce* the dispute to s» mere matter of feet, it may be presumed that whatever is agreeable to the most general usage of the language in simi !ar words, is the most proper in this; and if it appears that general usage, in similar words, is in favour of the old pronunciation, it must certainly, for that reason, be allowed to be the best And first it may be observed, that as our language is almost as averse to the accent on the last syllable, as the Latin, it is a general Custom with us, when we adopt a word from the Latin, and abridge it of one or two of its syllables, to remove the accent at least a syllable higher than
*	it wa6 in the original language, that the accent, when the word is naturalized, may uot rest on the last. Thus of Homerus, we
^ make HSmer ; of VirgUius, Virgil; and of HoratiuSy Horace: Hyacinthus, altered to Hy'acinth, removes the accent two syllables higher; and C'rremonia, become ctrcmony, does the same; and no law, that! know of, forbids us to accent academia, or if you will Axodrj^ua, when turned into academy, on the first syllable, as it was constantly accented by our ancestors; who, receiving Greek through the medium of Latin, generally pronounced Greek words according to the I.atin analogy, and therefore necessarily placed the accent of academia on the third syllable, which, when reduced to academy, required the accent to be removed higher.
But how, it will be said, does this account for placing the accent on the first syllable of the English word academy, rather than the second > To this it may be answered, that the numberless instances of preference given by the accent to the first syllable in similar words, such as melancholy,parsimony,
;—m£, m&t;—pine, pin
dilatory, &c. might be a sufficient authority without any other reason. But, perhaps, it will be pardoned me if I go farther, and hazard a supposition that seems to account for the very common practice of placing the accent of so many of the longer polysyllables from the Latin on the first or second syllable. Though in the Latin there never was more than one accentupon a word, yot, in our pronunciation of Latin, we commonly place an accent on alternate syllables, as in our own words ; and when the Latin word, by being anglicised, becomes shorter, the alternate accent becomes the principal. Thus, in pronouncing the Latin word academia, the English naturally place an accent 011 the first and third syllable, as if divided into ac-a-di-mi-a ; so that when the word becomes anglicised into dc-a-de-myf the first syllable retains the accent it had when the word was Latin. On the other hand, it may be conjectured with some probability, that a fondness for pronouncinglike the French has been the'occasion of the alteration. As the English ever suppose the French place the decent on the last syllable, in endeavouring to pronounce this word after their manner, the stress must uaturally fall on the second and last syllables, as if divided into a-cad-a-*ie; and from an imitation of this, it is probable, the present pronunciation of the word was produced. Thus we have a very probable reason why so many of »ur longer words from the Latin are accentcd so near the beginning ; as, in this mode of pronouncing them, they seem to retain one of the accents of the original. Hence the long train of words, voluntary, comparable, disputable, admirable, See. have the accent on the first syllable, because in pronouncing the words voluntarius, comparahilis, dispidabilis, admirabilis, &c. we commonly lay a stress upon the first, as well as the third syllable. As to the analogy, as Mr. Sheridan pretends, of pronouncing this word with the accent on the second syllable,because words ending in my have the accent on the antepenultimate, nothing can be more ill-founded. True it ;s, that words of this termination never have the accent on the penultimate ; but that, for this reason, they must necessarily have the accent on the antepenultimate, I cannot well comprehend. Ji polygamy, oeconomy, astronomy, &c. (515) have their accent on the antepenultimate* it arises from the nature of the terminations ; which being, as it were, a sPerjj:s» and applicable to a thousand other words, have, like logy and graphy, the accent always on the preceding syllable; which
