Thy, thI, or th£. pron. (466), Of thee, belonging to thee.
From what has been already observed under the pronoun my, we are naturally led to suppose that the word thy, when notemphatical, ought to follow the same analogy, and be pronounced like the, as we frequently hear it on the stage ; but if we reflect that reading or reciting is a pcrfect picture of speaking, we shall be induced to think that, in this particular, the stage is wrong The second personal pronoun thy is not, like my, the common language of every subject: it is used only where the subject is either raised above common life,
or sunk below it into the mean and firai* liar. When the subject is elevated above common life, it adopts a language suitable to such an elevation, and the pronunciation of this language ought to be so far removed from the familiar as the language itself. Thus, in prayer, pronouncing th like the, even when unemphatical, would be intolerable; while suffering thy, when unemphatical, to slide into the in the pronunciation of slight and familiar composition, seems to lower the sound lo the language, and form a proper distinction between different subjects. If, therefore, k should be asked why, in reciting epic or tragic composition, we ought always t» pronounce thy rhyming with high, while my, when unemphatical, sinks into the sound of me, it may be answered, because my is the common language of every subject, while thy is confined to subjects either elevated above common life, or sunk below it into the negligent and familiar. —When, therefore, the language is elevated, the uncommonness of the word thy, and its full sound rhyming with high, is suitable to the dignity of the subject: but the slender sound, like the, gives it a familiarity only suitable to the language of endearment or negligence, and for this very reason is unfit for the dignity of epic or tragic composition. Thus in the following passages from Milton c “ Say first, for heav’n hides nothing from thy “ view,
‘*»Nor the deep tract of hell.”
Parad. Lost. b. 1.
“ P thou, that with ‘surpassing glory “ crown'd,
“ Look’st from thy sole dominion like tbe " God
“ Of this new world; at whose sight all the " stars
“ Hide their diminish’d heads ; to thee I call, “ But with no friendly voice, and add thy " name,
“ O sun, to tell thee howr I hate thy beams.” Parad. Lott. b.4» Here "pronouncing the pronoun thy like the word the, would familiarise and debase tbe language to prose. The same may be observed of the following passages from Addison’s tragedy of Cato :
“ Now, Cxsar,let thy troops beset our gates, “ And bar each avenue ; thy gathering deets “ O’erspread the sea, and stop up every port; “ Cato may open to himself a passage,
“ And mock thy hopes.5*
Here the impropriety of pronouncing thy \tkf-the is palpable: nor would it be much more
