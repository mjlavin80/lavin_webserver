fctvni CLASSIFICATION OF VOWELS AND CONSONANTS*
the pronotnt you *. If, therefore, the common definition of k vowel be just these two letters are so far from being simple vowels, thafc they may more pro peMy be called semi-consonant diphthongs.
9.	Th&t y and w are consonants when they begin a word, and bowels Whei they end one, is generally acknowledged by the best grammarians; and ye Dr. Lowth has told us, that w is equivalent to oo; but if this were the case, i would always admk of the particle an before it: for though we have no word ii tjie -language which commences with these letters, we plainly perceive, that i we had sudi a word, it would readily admit of an before it, and consequently that these letters are not equivalent to Thus we find, that the commor opinion, with respect to the double capacity of these letters, is perfectly just.
10.	Besides the vowels already mentioned, there is another simple vowe sound found under the in the words w.>o and coo; these letters have, in thcs< two words, every property Of a pure vowel, but when found in food, mood. Sec and in the word 'oo. pronounced like the adjective ttvo; here the oo has asqueez ed sound, occasioned by contracting the mouth, so as to riiake the lips nearlj touch each other; and this makes it, like the i and u, riot so much a doubh Voiwei, as a soiind between a vowel iand a consonant.
.. Classification of Vowels and Consonants.
tl. Vowels and coijsbnahts being thus defined, it will be necessary, in th< tiext place,to arrange thefa in(io such classes as their similitudes and specific dif ferences seem to require.
15.	Letters, therefore, are naturally divisible into vowels and consonants.
13.	The Totfels are, a, c.i.o* «, and y> and w when ending a syllable.
14.	The consonants are, b. c, d,f g, k, L m, n, //, 7, r, «, ts v, xy 2, anc j^and tv when beginning a syllable.
1 13. The vowels may be subdivided into such as are simple and pure, and in to ^uch tls ire compound and impure. The simple or pure vowels are such ai require only one conformation of the organs to form them, and no motion in the brgans while forming.
16.	The compound or impure vowels are such as require more than one conformation of the organs to form them, and a motion in the organs while forming. These observations prehiised,1 we may call the following scheme
*	An ignorance of the real composition of v, and a want of knowine that it partook of the nature Of a consonant, has occasioned a jrreat diversity and uncertainty in prefixing the in. flefinite article an befbreit. Our ancestors, judging of its nature from its name, nev^rsus-pectetf that it was not a pure vowel, anti constantly prefixed the article an before nouns beginning with this letter: as an vnion, an vtefui book. They were confirmed ip this oj inioi; by finding the an always adapted to the short >ry as an nmr>fr-'% an umbrella, without < rci dreaming that the short n is a pure vowel, and essentially different from the long one. Bu1 the moderns, not resting in the name of a letter, and consulting their ears rather than theii eyes, hare frequently placed the a instead of an before the long ut and we have seen a unioni a university, a twfnl book, from some of the most resectable pens of the present age. Noi Can we doubt a moment of the propriety of this orthography, when we reflect that these words actually begin to the ear with y, and might be spelled younion, younivrrsity, youseful, and can therefore nfi more admit of an before them than year and youth.
