(£j* This word sprung up in the House of

a.
Commons about ten yean ago, and has since been so much in use as to make us wonder how we did so long without it. It had, indeed, one great recommendation, which was, that it was pronounced in direct opposition to tiie rules of our own language. An Englishman, who had never heard it pronounced, would, at first sight, have placed the accent on the antepenultimate, and have pronounced the penultimate i short; but the vanity of showing its derivation from the Latin inimicus, where the penultimate i is lonp; and the very oddity of pronouncing this i lon^ in inimical, made this pronunciation fashionable. I know it may be urged, that this word, with respect to sound, was as great an oddity in the Latin language as it is in ours; and that the reason for making the
*	long was its derivation from amicus. It will be said too, that, in other words, such as aromaticus, tyrannicus, rhetoricus, &c. the * was only terminational; but in inimicus it was radical, and therefore entitled to the quantity of its original qmicus. In answer to this, it may be observed, that this was no reason for placing the accent on* that syllable in Latin. In that language* whenever the penultimate syllable was long, whether radical or terminational, it had always the accent on it. Thus the numerous terminations in alis and at or, by having the penultimate a long, had always the accent on that letter, while the i in the terminations ilis and it as selcjpm had the accent, because that vowel was generally' short. But allowing for a moment that we ought servilely to follow the Latin accent and quantity in words which we derive from that language; this rule, at least, ought to be restricted to such words as have preserved their Latin form, as orator, senator, character, &c. yet in. these words we find the Latin penultimate accent entirely neglected, and the English antepenultimate adopted. But if this La. tin accent and quantity should extend to words from the Latin that are anglicised* then we ought to pronounce divinity, de~ v'me-e-ty ; severity, se-wre-e-ty ; and urban nity, ur-bane-e-ty. In short, the whole language would be metamorphosed, and we should neither pronounce English nor Latin, but a Babylonish dialect between both, Injmitability, ln-lm-£-t£-bll'£-t£. s.
