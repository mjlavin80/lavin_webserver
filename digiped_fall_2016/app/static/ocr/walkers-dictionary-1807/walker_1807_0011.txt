« minciation is always vague and uncertain, being made different in different w mouths, by negligence, unskilfulness, or affectation. The solemn pronun-“ ciation, though by no means immutable and permanent, is yet always less u remote from the orthography, and less liable to capricious innovation. 1 hey
*	have, however, generally formed their tables according'to the cursory speech
*	of those with whom they happened to converse, and, colluding that the whole
a nation combines to vitiate language in one manner, have often established the w jargon ot the lowest of the people as the model of speech. For pronunciation, u the best general rule is, to consider those as the most elegant speakers, who de-« Yiate least irom the written words.”	*
\\ ithout any derogation from the character of Dr. Johnson, it may be assert- . ed, that in these observations we do not perceive that justness and accuracy of thinking for which he is so remarkable. It would be doing great injustice to him, to suppose that he meant to exclude all possibility of conveying the actual pronunciation of many words that depart manifestly from their orthography, or^ of those that are written alike, and pronounced differently, and inversely. He has marked these differences with great propriety himself, in many places of his Dicdonary ; and it is to be regretted that he did not extend these remarks farther. It is impossible, therefore, he could suppose, that because the almost imperceptible glances of colloquial pronunciation were not to be caught and described by the pen, that the very perceptible difference between the initial accented syllables of money and monitor, ov the final unaccented syllables offinite and infinite, could not be sufficiently marked upon puper. Cannot we show that cellar, a vault, and teller one who sells, have exactly the same sound ? or that the monosyllabic full, and the first syllable of fulminate, are sounded differently* because there are some words in which solemnity will authorize a different shade of pronunciation from familiarity ? Besides, that Colloquial pronunciation which is perfect, is so much the language of solemn speaking, that, perhaps, there is no more difference than between the same.picture painted to be. viewed near and at a distance. The symmetry in both is exactly the same; and the distinction lies only in the colouring. The English Language, in this respect, seems to have a great superiority over the French, which pronounces many let-tm in the poetic and solemn style, that are wholly silent in the piosuc and familiar. But if a solemn and familiar pronunciation really exists in our language, is it not the business of a grammarian to mark both ? And if he cannot point out the precise sound of unaccented syllables, (for these only are liable to obscurity,) he may, at least, give those sounds which approach the nearest, and by this means become a little more useful than those who so liberally leave every thing"' to the ear and taste of the speaker.
The truth is, Dr. Johnson seems to have had a confused idea of the distinctness a^d indistinctness with which, on solemn or familiar occasions, wc sometimes pronounce the unaccertcd vowels; and with respect to these, it must Lye owned, that.- his remarks are not entirely without foundation. The English . Language, wilh respect to its pronunciation, is evidently divisible into accented and unaccented sounds. The accented syllables, by being pronounced with ^ greater force than the unaccented, have their vowels as clearly and distinctly sounded as any given note in music ; while the unaccented vowels, for want of the stress, are apt to slide into an obscurity of sound, which, though sufficiently distinguishable to the ear, cannot be so definitely marked out to the eye by other sobnds as those vowels that are under the accent. Thus some of the vowels, when neither under the accent, nor closed by ^consonant, have a lonpjrr or a shorter, an opener or a closer sound, according tb the solemnity or fanitw-rity, the deliberation or rapidity of our deliver}'.
