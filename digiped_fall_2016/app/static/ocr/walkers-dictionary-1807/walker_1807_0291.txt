Towels appear more perceptibly than in the prepositional syllables Col, Com, Con, and Cor. When the accent is on these syllables, in College,Cvmmusary, Conclave ^Corrigible, kc. c. the o has distinctly its short sound. The same may be observed ofthis o, when tbe principal accent is on the third syllable, and th? secondary accent on the first (523): a* in Colonnade, Commendation, Condescen-sieuj Correspondent, &c. Sec.: for in this case there is a secondary accent on the first syllable, which preserves the o in its true sound
(522)	; but when the accent is on the second syllable, this vowel slides into a sound short ii, and the words To Collect, To Commit, To Convince, To Corrupt, 8cc. &c. are heard as if written Collect, Cummit, Convince, Currupt, kc. &c. It is true, that when these words are pronounced alone wi di deliberation, energy and precision,the y vi the first syllable preserves nearly its true sound; but this seems to slide insensibly into short u the moment we unite these words with others, and pronounce them without premeditation. The deliberate arid solemn sound is that which 1 have given in this Dictionary: nor have I made any difference between words where the accent J3 on the second syllable; and why Mr. Sheridan, and those who have followed hi'Ti, snould in Combust, Commute, Complete, Sec. give the sound of short o infrom f and in Command, Commit, Commence, &c. give the same letter the sound of short «in drum, 1 cannot conceive ; they are all susceptible of thissoundor none,and therefore should all be marked alike. If custom be pleaded for this distinction, it n^ay be observed diat this plea is the best in the world when it is evident, and the worst whenob-scare. No such custom ever fell under my observation ; I have always heard the first syllable of compare and compel, of commence and compote, pronounced alike, and have therefore made no distinction between them in this Dictionary. I have given them all the sound of the o m Comma; though I am sensible that, in colloquial pronunciation, they all approach nearer to the short «, and are similar to the same syllables in Comfort, Combat, &c. And it may be laid down as a general rule, without an exception, that o in an initial syllable, iinmedi-** ately before the accent,and succeeded by “ two uncombinable consonants, may, in u familiar conversation, be pronounced “ like the same letter m come, donej” &c.
