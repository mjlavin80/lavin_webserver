Jj* I have here differed from Mr. Sheridan, and adopted that sound of the vowel in this word which is given to it by Dr. Kenrick, Mr. Scott, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Perry. This I do not only suppose to be tlie general pronunciation, but find it written rhumb by Dr. Ash, Buchanan, and Barclay. But when this word is given us in its Latin form Rhombut, the o ought to have the same sound as in comedy. See Principles, No. 347.
