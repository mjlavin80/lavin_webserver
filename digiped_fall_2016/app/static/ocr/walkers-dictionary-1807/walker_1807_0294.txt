XT The propensit y of the unaccented o to fall into the sound of short u is no where more perceptible than in the first syllables ofwards beginning with coi9 com, con, or cor, when the accent is on the second syllable. Thus the o in to collect and college; in commendandcom-merits in connect and consul; in correct and corner, cannot be considered as exactly the same in all: the o in the first word of each of these pairs has certainly a different sound from the same letter in the second; and if we appreciate this sound, we shall firtd Hcoincide with that which is the most nearly related to it, namelv, the short*. I have not how'ever ventured to substitute this u; not that I think it incompatible with the most correct and solemn pronunciation, but because where there is apossibility of reducing Tetters to their radical sound without hurting the ear, this radical sound ought to be the model; and the greater or lesser departure from it, left to the solemnity or familiarity of the occasion. To foreigners, however, it may sot be improper to remark, that it would be always better for them to adopt the n instead of o; this will secure them from the smallest impropriety, for natives only can seize such nice distinctions as sometimes divide even judges themselves. Mr. Sheridan was certainly of opinion that this unaccented o might be pronounced like m, as he has so marked it in commantL, com• mence, commission, and commend; though not in commender; and in compare, though not in comparative/ but in almost every other word where this o occurs, he has given it the sound it has in constant. Mr. Scott has exactly foliow’ed Mr.Sheridan in these words ; and Dr. Kenrick has uniformly marked them all with the short sound ofo. Why Mr. She-ridao and Mr. Scott should make any difler-ence in the t*i*st syllables of these words, where the letters and accents are exactly the same, I cannot conceive: these syllables may be c ailed a spccics; and, if the occasion were not too trifling for such a comparison, it might be observed, that as nature varies in individuals, but is uniform in the species, so custom is sometimes various in accented syllables, which are definitely and strongly marked, but commonly more regular in unaccented syllables, by being left, as it were, to the common operation of the organs of pronunciation.—See the words Collect and Domestic.
