OC/* Dr* Johnson has placed the accent on the last syllable both of this word and Jocund; in which he is consistent, but contrary both to custom and to English analogy. Mr. Sheridan places the accent on the first syllable of Jocund, and on the last ofthis word. The reasons are the same for accenting both; they both come from theLatinj^/aewn-dut and jocundut ,* and there is scarcely a more invariable rule in our language than that of removing the accent higher when we adopt a wordfrom the Latin,and abridge it of its latter syllables.—See Academy.
