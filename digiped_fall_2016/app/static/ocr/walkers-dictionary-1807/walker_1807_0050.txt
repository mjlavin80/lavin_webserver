which I think the most agreeable to polite usage. See Mr. Garrick’s Epigram upon the sound of this letter, under the word Virtue.
Irregular and unaccented Sounds.
111.	There is an irregular pronunciation of this letter which has greatly multiplied within these few years, and that is, the slender sound heard in ee. 1 his sound is chiefly found in words derived from the French and Italian languages; and we think we show our breeding by a knowledge of those tongues, and an ignorance of our own:
M Report of fashions in proud Italy,
Whose manners still our tardy apish nation “ Limps alter, in base awkward imitation.”
Skctkspeare, Richard //.
When Lord Chesterfield wrote his letters to Ids son, the word oblige was, by many polite speakers, pronounced as if written obleege, to give a hint of their knowledge of the French language; nay, Pope has rhymed it to diis sound :
*( Dreading: ev’n fools, by flatterers besieg'd,
•' And so obliging, that he ne’er oblig'd.”
But it was so far from having generally obtained, that Lord Chesterfield strictly enjoins his son to avoid this pronunciation as affected. In a few years, however, it became so general, that none but the lowest vulgar ever pronounced it in the English manner; but, upon the publication of this nobleman’s letters, which was about twenty years after he wrote them, his authority has had so much influence with the polite world as to bid fair for restoring the /, in this word, to its original rights; and we not unfrequently hear it now pronounced with the broad English i, in those circles where, a few years ago, it would have been an infallible mark of vulgarity. Mr Sheridan, W. Johnston, and Mr. Barclay, give both sounds, but place the sound of oblige first. Mr. Scott gives both, but places obleege first. Dr. Kenrick and Buchanan give only oblige; and Mr. Elphinston, Mr. Perry, and Fenning, give oniy obleege ; but though this sound has lost ground so much, yet Mr. Nares, who wrote about eighteen years ago, says, u oblige still, I think, retains the u sound of long r, notwithstanding the proscription of that pronunciation by u the late Lord Chesterfield ”
112.	The words that have preserved the foreign sound of /, like ee, are the Following : Ambergris, verdrgris, antique, becafico, bombasin, brazil, cafiivi, capuchin, c lb rtincs chioppincs or chopin, ca/irice, chagrin, chevaur-de-frisc, critiquc, (for cri-tichm),frstucine.frize, gabardine, haberdine, sordine, rugine, trephine, quarantine, r^utinesfaaciiir, fatigue, intrigue, glacis, invalid, machine, magazine, marine, pa/an-cjuvu fa ur, fiolict\ profile, recitative, man-da-rine, tabourine, tambourine, tontine, t an,smari)u\ ultramarine. In all these words, if for the last / we substitute ee, we shall have the true pronunciation. In signior the first t is thus pronounced. Mr. Sheridan pronunces vertigo and serpigo with the accent on the second syllable. and the i long as in tie and pie. Dr. Kenrick gives these words the same accent, but sounds the i as e in tea and pea. The latter is, in my opinion, the general pronunciation ; though Mr. Sheridan's is supported by a verv general rule which is, that all words adopted whole from the Latin preserve the Latin accent. (503. b.) But if the English ear wxre unbiassed by the long i in Latin, which fixes the acccnt on the second syllable, and could free itself from the
