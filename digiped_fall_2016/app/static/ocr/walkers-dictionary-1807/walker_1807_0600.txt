Barclay, on the second* Dr. Kenrick, is* deed, tells us, that the accent is sometimes placed on the first; which is indeed very apparent from tlie number of writers I have produced for that accentuation. But the propriety of jthis pronunciation is not better supported by authority than by analogy. For if we have an English word from which a word of this kind might be formed, as declaratory, defamatory, &c. the accent will generally be found to be on the same syllable as in declare, defame, &c.; but if we have no such corresponding English word, and the word of this termination comes from the Latin, as promontory, desultory, &c. the word then takes the secondary accent we give the Latin words
pr6mont6rium,d£sult6riusj&.c.'Now though our English verb to invent comes from the same parent invenio as inventory, it is in so different a sense as to have no claim to the parentage. As therefore inventarium is the fatter Latin word from which this word is derived, and as this has the secondary accent on the first syllable in our pronunciation of Latin, so inventory must have the principal accent in the same syllable in English^—See Academy, Incompatible, &c.—Dr. Johnson indeed furnishes us with an authority from Shakspeare against himself: u I found
n Forsooth an inventory thus importing “ The several parcels of his plate.”
