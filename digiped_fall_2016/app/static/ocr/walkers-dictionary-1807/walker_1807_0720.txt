ive inserted this word, though omitted by almost allottr lexicographers, because I have met with it in authors of rc-putation. Dr. Foster, in his Treatise on Accent and Quantity, v-.vs: “ The con-“ nexion of this, which may be callcdtiie " oratorial accent, with the syllable, and u the subordination of them to each otlier, *€ however difficult it may appear, is yet ** easy in practice.” Page 23. Other good authorities for this word might have been adduced, but the other adjective oratorical though not so justly formed, seems generally to be preferred 1 have sometimes made the experiment on people, whose ears were nicely set to pure English pronunciation, by proposing to them for their choice the adjectives oratorial or oratorical, and have always found them prefer the latter. This may, in some measure, arise from supposing the former might be considered as the adjective of oratorio9 but seems rather to be occasioned by too great a plenitude and rotundity of sound, which is not agreeable to the genius of our language : for if we regard derivation only, the adjective ought to be oratorial, as derived immediately from the Latin oratori-iaj, in the same manner as from rhetoricus, is formed rhetorical.
