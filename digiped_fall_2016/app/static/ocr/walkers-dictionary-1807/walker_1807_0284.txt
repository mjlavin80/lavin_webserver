This word is not in Johnson’s Vocabulary, though he lias taken notice of it under the word Cloth, and says it is the plural of th at word. With great deference to his authority, I think it is rather derived from the verb to clothe, than from the noun cloth, as this word has its regular plural which plural regularly sounds the th as in this, (469), and not as z; which is a corruption, that, in my opinion, is not incurable. I see no reason why we may not as easily pronounce the th in this word as in the third person of the verb To clothe.

QCj* When this word signifies a deep descent between hills, it seems best to pronounce it so as to rhyme with ploughaiul when it means an allowance in weight, to rhyme it with enoughbut this distinction of sound to distinguish the different meaning of a word, However pjausibie, is a great inconvenience in language.
