f£j* Almost all the dictionaries I have consulted, except Mr. Sheridan’s, place the accent on the second syllable of this word; and yet, so prevalent has the latter accentuation been of late years, that Mr. Nate? i$ reduced to hope it is not 6xed beyond recovery. There is, indeed, one reason why this word ont*lit not to have the accent on the first syllable, and that is, the two mutes iir the second and third, which are not so easily pronounced when the accent is remov ed from them, as the mntesaml liquids in nrressornt cons story% desultory, &e,; and therefore I am decidedly in favour of the accentuation on the second syllable, which is ajlopred by Dr Johnson, Dr Asb, Dr. Kenrick, W. Johnston, Mr. Nares, Fn-chanan, Perry, Scott, Bailey, Barclay, anti Entick, as all words of this termination have the accent on the «ame syllable.—Se* Rf.fr Ad ORV, PEREMP ORY, CORRIIPTlBLE^aod Irrefragable.	-
