Mr. Sheridan, Dr. Johnson* Dr. Ash, and Bailey, accent the second syllable of this word, but Dr. Kenrick, W. Johnston, Mr. Scott* Buchanan, Barclay, Fenning,
. and Entick, the first. 1 do not hesitate to pronounce the latter mode the more correct ; first, as it is a simple in our language, and, having three syllables, requires the accent on the antepenultimate, notwithstanding the double I (see Medicinal). In the next place, though there is no mctalli-mu in Latin* it otight to follow the analogy of words of that termination derived from Latin, as, Cryttallinus, Serpentinus, &c. which, when anglicised, lose the last syllable, and remove the accent to the first.— See Academt. For the i in the last syllable, see Principles, No 148,149. Metallist, m£t't£l-list. s. A worker of metals, one skilled in metals. Metallography, m£t-t&l-l6g,gra-f£. s.

03* This word ii accented three different ways by different orthbepists. Dr. Johnson, Barclay, Fenning, and Perrv, accent it on the second syllable ; Sheridan, Buchanan, and Bailey, on the third ; and Ash, Scott, Nares, and Entick, on the first; and Kenrick on the first and third. The accent on the first seems to me the most correct. Bailey derives this word from the Greek ptreiMovpyla; and words of this form upon dropping a syllable when anglicised, remove the accent higher,as, philosophy, philology, 8cc. from <p*Ao<ro^*a, The accent thus removed, in enclitical terminations, (513), generally falls upon the antepenultimate syllable,unless in the two succeeding syllables there are uncombinable consonants, as, chiromancy, oligarchy; and in this case, for the ease ofpronunciatio >, the accent generally rises to the next syllable, which throws a secondary or alternate accent on the penultimate, and by this means gives the or-
gans a greater force to pronotmce theim-combinable consonants than if they immediately followed the principal stress. See Principles, No. 517, 519.
