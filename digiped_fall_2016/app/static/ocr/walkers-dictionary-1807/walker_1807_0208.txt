A word with the grave accent on the last syllable. If the inspector does not know what is meant by the grave accent, it may be necessary to inform him, that writers on the Greek accent tell us that every syllable which has not the acute accent has the grave; and an there could but be one syllable acuted in that language, the rest must necessarily be grave. What these.accents are has puzzled the learned so much that they seem neither to understand each other nor themselves; but it were to be wished they had kept this distinction into acute and grave out of our own language, as it is impossible to annex any dear ideas to it, except we consider the grave accent merely as tbe absence of the acute, which reduces it to no accent at all. If we divide the voice into its two leading inflections, the rising and falling, and call the former the acute and the latter the grave, we can annex distinct ideas to the*e Words: and perhaps it is an ignorance of this distinction of speaking sounds, and confounding them with high and low, or »oud and •oft, that occasions the confusion we meet with ia wfiters on this subject.—See Ek‘.
