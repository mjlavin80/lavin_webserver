SYLLABICATION,
the method adopted by those who would convey die whole sound, by gfvShg distinctly every part; and, when this is the object of syllabication, Dr. Lowth’s rule is certainly to be followed. 44 The best and easiest rule,” says the learned bishop, “ for dividing the syllables in spelling, is, to divide them as they are “ naturally divided in a right pronunciation, without regard to the derivation of 14 words, or the possible combination of consonants, at the beginning of a sylla-“ ble.” Introduction to Eng. Gram. pag. 7.
i	542. In this view of syllabication we consider it only as the picture of actual
*	pronunciation; but may we not consider it as directed likewise by some laws of its own ? Laws, which arise out of the very nature of enunciation, and the specific qualities of the letters ? These laws certainly direct us to separate double consonants, and such as are uncombinable from the incoalescence of their sounds : and if such a separation will not paint the true sound of the word, we may be certain that such sound is unnatural, and has arisen from caprice: thus the words Chamber, Cambridge, and Cambrick, must be divided at the letter m, and as this letter, by terminating the syllable according to the settled rules of pronunciation, shortens the vowel—the general pronunciadon given to these words must be absurd, and contrary to the first principles of the language. Angel?, ancient, danger, manger, and ranger, are under the same predicament; but the paucity of words of this kind, so far from weakening the general rule, strengthen it. See Change.

By an induction which demonstrates the shortening power of the ante* penultimate accent, has been shown the propriety of uniting the consonant to the vowel in the first syllable of demonstration, lamentation, propagation, &c. we thus decide upon the quantity of these vowels, which are so uncertain in our best dictionaries; and may we not hope, by a similar induction, and with the first principles of language in view, to decide the true, genuine, and analogical sound of some words of another kind which waver between different pronunciations ? The antepenultimate accent has unquestionably a shortening power; and I have not the smallest doubt that the penultimate accent has a lengthening power: that is, if our own words, and words borrowed from, other languages of two syllables, with but one consonant in the middle, had been left to the general ear, the accent on the first syllable would have infallibly lengthened the first vowel. A strong presumption of this arises frpm our pronunciation of all Latin dissylla* bles in this manner, without any regard to the quantity of the original, (see Drama), and the ancient practice of doubling the consonant when preceded by a single vowel in the participial terminations, as to b-giru beginning, to regret, regretted: and I believe it may be confidently affirmed, that words of two syllables from the Latin, with but one consonant in the middle, would always have had the first vowel long, if a pedantic imitation of Latin quantity had not prevented it (See Drama). Let an Englishman, with only an English education, be put to pronounce z^pbrr, and he will, without hesitation* pronounce the e long, as in zenith: if you tell him the e is pronounced short in the Latin zephyru*, which makes it short in English, and he should happen to ask you the Latin quantity of the first syllable of comic* mimic, solace, kc. your answer would be a contradiction to your rule.—What irrefragably proves this to be the genuine analogy of English quantity, is the different quantity we .give a Latin word of two syllables when in the nominative, and when in an oblique case: thus in the first syllable of nidus and nomen, which ought to be long ; and of miter
