Chird syllable, because Europ<tus has the penultimate long, and is therefore accented in Latin. Epicurean, has the accent on the same syllable by the same rule; wiile Herculean and Cerulean submit to English analogy, and have the accent on the second syllable, because theirpenultimate in Latin is short.	,	.

Of the accent of the first of these words, there can be no dispute; hut the last is the first anglicised, and therefore admits of some diversity. Mr. Sheridan, Dr.Keririck, Dr.Ash, Entick, Barclay, Bailey, and the first editions of Dr. Johnson, accent the last of these words on the antepenultimate, but the quartoedition of Johnson on the penultimate; I suspect,however,if we were strictly to follow ourown analogy, that we ought to place the accent on the first syllable ;jfor as this termination is not enclitical (513), it seems to be under the same predicament as Academy, Irreparable, &c. which see.

This word is sometimes heard with the double g hard, as in dagger; but every one who has a scrap of Latin knows, that exaggerate comes from exaggeroy and that all words from that language have the g soft: before c and i; the third syllable,therefore, must have the e soft. But it will be said, that,accordingto the laws ofpronuncialiop, the first^ ought to be hard as the first c is in jlaccid, siccity, See. To which it may be answered, that, strictly speaking*, it ought to be so ; but polite usige has so fixed the first as well as the lastg in the soft sound, that none but a confirmed pedant would have the boldness to pronounce them differently.	#
This usage too we find is not without all foundation in analogy. Wherever there is a considerable difficulty in keeping sounds separate, they will infallibly run into each other. This is observable in the sound of#, which, when final, always adopts tlie sound of z wrhen a flat consonant precedes (434); the first t likewise in the termination session, mission, &c. necessarily runs into the sound of sh like last s .* but it may be said, that tlie first g in exaggerate has no such relation to the second as s has to sh, and that this very difference betwreen the two consonants makes us preserve the first c in jlaccid and siccity in its hard sound of k, which is perfectly distinct from the other sound of c, which is nothingmore than s. To this it can only be replied by w ay of mitigation, that hard g and soft g or j are formed nearer together in the mouth than	hard	cor	i	and
soft c or s ; and therefore	as*they are	more
liable to coalesce, their coalescence is more excusable.	#
