Q'j* AU our orthoepists aoree in accenting this word on the first syllable. Mr. Nares ■says, Dr. Johnson has improperly accented this word on the last; but, both in the folio edition of his Dictionary, and the, quarto, printed since his death, the accent is on the first. There is not the same uniformity in the accentuation of the companion to this word artisan g for though Mr. Nares, Mr. Perry, Dr. Ash, W. Johnston, Buchanan, Bailey, Fenning, and Entick, accent the first sellable, Dr. Johnson, in both editions of his Dictionary, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Scott, and Mr. Barclay, accent the last: and Dr. Kenrick places an accent on both first and last. The same diversity appears in the accentuation of courtesan, a word of exactly the same form; which is accented by Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Scott, W. Johnston, Mr. Nares, Fen-ning, and Entick, on the last syllable; and by Dr. Ash, Dr. Kenrick, Buchanan, Barclay, Bailey, and Fenning,on the first; and by Mr. Perry both on the first and last. The truth is, these three words are among those which admit ofthe accent either on the first or last syllable, and this has produced the diversity we find in our Dictionaries. (524). The accent on the first syllable seems the most agreeable to our own analogy, and ought to be preferred. (503). Partition, p&r-tlsh'&n. s.
