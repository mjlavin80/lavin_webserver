Mr. Nares observes, that this word ought to be written Grosser, as originally being one who dealt by the gross or wholesale. There is not, however, he observes, much chance that Grocer will give place to Grosser; especially as they no longer engross merchant^ze of all kinds, nor insist upon dealing in the gross alone. The other derivation ofthis word, from grossusf a fig, is not worth notice.

{j* This Vrord is irregular from a vanity of imitating the French. In Scotland they pronounce this word regularly so as to rhyme with moss. Pope also rhymes it with this word.
" Shall only man be taken in the gross ?
“ Grant but as many sorts of mind as moss.” This, however, must be looked upon as a poetical license ; forthe sound seems now irrevocably fixed as it is marked, rhyming with jocose, verbose, &c.	.	#
