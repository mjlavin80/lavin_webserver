(Ej* This word was, till of late years, universally pronounced, in prose, with the accent on the first syllable; and Shaks-peare, says Dr. Johnson, has improperly placed it so in verse :
........“ When the morning sun shall raise
** his car
" Above the borders of this horizon,
“ We*U forwards towards Warwick and his “ mates.”
With respect to the propriety of this pronunciation, it may be observed, that there is scarcely any thing more agreeable to the genuine analogy of English orthoepy, than placing the accent on the first syllable of a trissyliable, when the middle syllable does not end with a consonant (503). But another rule almost as constantly counteract* this analogy : when the word is perfectly Latin or Greek, and the accent is on tbe penultimate, then we generally follow the accentuation of those languages. Poets have so universally placed the accent on the second syllable of tbis word, and this pronunciation has so classical an air as to render the other accentuation vulgar.
