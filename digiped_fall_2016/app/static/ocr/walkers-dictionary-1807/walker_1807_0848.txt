This vword, like several others of tbe same form, is frequently distorted by an accent on the first syllable. When there
are no uncombinable consonant* in the latter syllable, this accentuation is not improper, as, despicable, disputable, prefcrabtt, &c. j but when consonauts of so different an organ as cl and pt occur in the penultimate and antepenultimate syllable* of words without the acceut, the difficulty of pronouncing them is a sufficient rea*oa for placing the accent on thetn in order to assist the pronunciation ; tfud accordingly we find almost every word of this form has the accent upon these letters, as, tUiecidic, destructible, perceptible, snseei>ttUr, ducerp-iibie, &c. besides, as it contributes greatly to place the accent ou tbe most significant part of tlie word, when other reasous do not forbid, this ought to determine us to lay the stress upon the second syllableof the word in question. This is the accentuation of Mr. Scott, Mr. Buchanan, W. Johnston, Bailey, and Entick; and if Dr. Johnson, Mr. Sheridan, Dr. Ash, Dr. Ktn-rick, Barclay, Fenning, and Perry, had inserted the word in their Dictionaries, they would, in all probability, have accented the word iu the same manner Since tbfc first edition of this Dictionary, I see this is the case with tbe quarto edi-tiou of Dr. Johnson.—See Acceptasli, Corruptible, aid Irrefragable.
