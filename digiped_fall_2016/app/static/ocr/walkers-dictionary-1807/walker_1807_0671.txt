Qj* In reading the Scripture, as, ** Mine u eyes have seen tliy salvation,” we are at no loss for the pronunciation of this word, as the dignity and solemnity of the composition invariably directs us to give the i its long sound, as in fine, line, «c.; but in Milton and other authors, where there is no such dignity or solemnity, this sound of the word nas an intolerable stiffness, and ought not to have been used.— Thus in the Spectator, No. 195, Mr. Addison, says : ‘ Were 1 to prescribe a rule 1 for drinking, it should be formed upon a * saying quoted bv Sir William Temple.— “ The first glass for myself, the second for “ my friends, the third for good humour, “ and the fourth for mine enemies.”
’ In Milton too:
-__________“ Methought

In Shakspeare also:
.... ■ “ Sleeping within mine orchard,
“ My custom always in the afternoon,
“ Upon my secure nour thy uncle stole,
“ With juice of cursed hebona in a phial,
“ And in the porches of mine ears did pour The leprous distilment.”— Hamlet .

ed when our language may he saidtohav* been in its infancy for the sake of euphony (for it is clearly ungrammatical); so now, when it may be said that it has ar* rived at its maturity, the very same reason seems to entitle the present age to alter it; that is, I mean the pronunciation of it, by substituting my, pronounced like me, in its stead.	(	<
The disagreeable sound which mine has in these cases, has induced several readers to pronounce it min ,* but by thus mincing the matter, (if the pun will be pardoned me), they mutilate the word, and leave it more disagreeable,to the ear than it was before. Readers therefore have no choice, but either to pronounce it as it ia written, and to let the author be answerable for the ill sound; or, in all language but that of Scripture, to change itinto nyr, pronounced like me.
Shakspeare seems to have used this word ludicrously in the Merry Wives of Windsor, where Falstatt says, “ Mine host of “ the Garter—truly, mine host, I must w turn away some of my followersand the host, by requesting Falstaff to speak scholarly and wisely, seems to intimate, that this use of the word mine before a vowel or an A was the most correct way of speaking. But though thy will, in familiar or ludicrous language, admit of being changed into the sound of the—mine will, on no occasion, suffer an alteration into min. When tbe vowel is used familiarly, it ia always a burlesque upon the grave use of it, and therefore requires the grave sound, that the humour may not be lost.
