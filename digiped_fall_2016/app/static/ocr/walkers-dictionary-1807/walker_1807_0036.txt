30.	Vowels and consonants being thus defined and arranged, we are the better enabled to enter upon an inquiry into their different powers, as they, are ■differently combined with each other. But previous to this, that pothing may be wanting to form a just idea of the first principles of pronunciation, it may not be improper to show the organic formation of each letter.
Organic Formation of the Letters.
•	31. Though I think every mechanical account of the organic formation of the letters rather curious than useful, yet, that nothing which can be presented to the eye may be wanting to inform the ear, I sihall in this follow those who have been at the pains to trace every letter to its seat, and make us, as it were, touch the sounds we articulate.
Organic Formation of the Vowels.
32.	It will be necessary to observe, that there are three long sounds of the letter a, which are formed by a greater or less expansion of the internal parts of the mouth.
33.	The German <z, heard in ball, 'wall, See. is formed by a strong and grave expression of the breath through the mouth, which is open nearly in a circular form, while the tongue, contracting itself to the root, as to make way for the sound, almost rests upon the under jaw.
34.	The Italian c, heard in father, closes the mouth a little more than the German a ; and by raising the lower jaw, widening the tongue, and advancing it a little nearer to the lips, renders its sound less hollow and deep.
35.	The slender a, or that heard in lane, is formed in the mouth still higher than the last; and in pronouncing it, the lips, as if to give it a slender sound, dilate their aperture horizontally ; while the tongue, to assist this narrow cmw-
