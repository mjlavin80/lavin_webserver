This word, though not noticed by Johnson, is used to signify thfegoods of a stationer; such as books, pa^JPi, and other commodities for writing. The reason why u seller of paper is called a stationer, is, that formerly the sellers of paper were itinerants or peddlers; and that as the trade became more important, they tbok a stand or station, which gave a name to the profession.

This word is not found in any of our Dictionaries, and seems to have been first used by Sir John Sinclair in his plan fora statement of the trade, population, and productions of every county in Scotland ; with the food, diseases, and longevity of its inhabitants. A plan which reflects the greatest credit on the understanding- aiul bcnevolence of that gentleman, as it is big with advantages both to the philosopher and the politician. These words must not be confounded with Statical and Statici ; for though such a plan leads to a philosophical weighing of these provincial circumstances, yet certainly the first idea is that of stating these circumstances ; and therefore these words are formed from the English verb to state, and not from staticks, derived from the Greek word errata.
