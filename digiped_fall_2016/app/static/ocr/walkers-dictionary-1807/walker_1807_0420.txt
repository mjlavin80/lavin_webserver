Cj'This word is perfectly French, and, as
usual, we have adopted it with th? on* ginal pronunciation. In other words which we have received from the French, where the nasal vowel has occurred, we have substituted an awkward pronunciation in imitation of it, which has at once shown our fondness for foreign modes of speaking, and our incapacity of acquiring them: thus Caisson has been turned into Cassoon, Ballon into Balloon, Dragon into Dragoon, and Chamont (a charactcr in the Orphan) into Shamoon; but in the word before us, this nasal sound is followed by c hardy which after n always involves hard g (408) ; and this is precisely an English sound. An Englishman, therefore, does not find the difficulty in pronouncing the nasal sound in this word, which he would in another that does not admit of the succeeding hard c or g ; as entendement, at-tentif, &c.; for if in pronouncing the en in these words the tongue should once touch the roof of the mouth, the French nasal sound would be ruined. No wonder then that a mere English speaker should pronounce this French word so well, and the rest of the nasal vowels so ill. It does not arise from the habit they contract at Theatres, (where it would be the most barbarous and ill-bred pronunciation in the world to caUfor the repetition of an English song in plain English). It does not, 1 say, arise from custom, but from coincidence. The sound, in the word before us, is common to both nations; and though the French may give it a somewhat lighter sound than the English, they arc both radically the same. Adopting this word, however, in the Theatre, does the English n<^ manner of credit. Every language ought to be sufficient for all its purposes. A foreigner who understoodourlanguage, but who had never been present at our dramatic performances, would suppose we had no equivalents in English, snoukl he hear us cry out Encore, Bravo, and Bravis-simo, when we only wish to have a song repeated, or toappluudthe agility of a dancer.
