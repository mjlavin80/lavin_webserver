nore than the length or shortness of the vowels, either as they stand alone, or as they are differently combined with the vowels or consonants. (63).
530.	Quantity, in this point of view, has already been fully considered under I every vowel and diphthong in the language. What remains to be said on this | subject is, the quantity of vowels under the secondary accent. We have seen that vowels, under the principal accent, before the diphthongs ia, ie, eou, ion, are ill Jong, except *. (507). That all vowels are long before the terminations ity andrty, &s deity, piety, See. (511); that if one or more consonants precede these terminations, every preceding accented vowel, except the a in scarcity and rarity signifying uncommonness, is short but u: and that the same analogy of quantity is found before the terminations ic and iced, and the numerous enclitical % terminations we have just been pointing out. Here we find custom conformable to analogy; and that the rules for the accent and quantity of these words admit of scarcely any exceptions. In other parts of the language, where custom is more capricious, we can still discover general rules ; and there are but ▼cry few words in which the quantity of the vowel under the principal accent is not ascertained. Those who have but a common share of education, and are conversant with the pronunciation of the capital, are seldom at a loss for the quuirity of the vowel under that accent which may be called principal; but the secondary accent in the longer polysyllables does not seem to decide the quantity of the vowels so invariably. Mr. Sheridan divides the words deglutition, de-ftmvation, degradation, dereliction, and democratical, into de-gtu-ti-tion, de-pra-va tm, de-gra-da-ticn, de*re-lic-tion, and de-mo-crat-i-cal; while Dr. Kenrick more accurately divides them into deg-lu-ti-tion, dep-ra^va-tiou, drg-ra-da-tion, and dem-o-crot+eal; but makes not any distinction between the first o in profanation and profane, prodigality and prodigious, prorogation and prorogue, though he distinguishes this letter in the first syllable of progress, and that in progression: and though Mr. Sheridan divides retrograde into ret-ro-grade, he divides retrograda-retrogression, retrospect, retrospection, and retrospective, into re-tro-gra-da-tew, re-tro-gres-sion, re-tro-spect, ri -trospec-tion, and rc-trosjiec-tive. At the fir* sight of these words we are tempted to prefer the preposition in a distinct syllable, as supposing that mode to convey more distinctly each part of the word; but custom at large, the best interpreter of nature, soon lets us see that these prepositions coalesce with the word they are prefixed to, for reasons greatly superior to those which present themselves at first. (514). If we observe the tendency of pronunciation, with respect to inseparable prepositions, we shall find, that those compound words which we adopt whole from other languages, we consider as simples, and pronounce them without any respect to their component parts ; but those compounds which we form ourselves retain the traccs of then* formation, in the distinction which is observable between the prepositive and radical part of the word: thus retrograde, retrogression, retrospect, and re* trotfiecthe, coming compounded to us from the Latin, ought, when the accent is on the preposition, to shorten the vowel, and unite it to the root, as in res-ur-nt-tion, rec-ot-lec-tion, preposition, fcrc.; while recommit, rc-convey, See. being compounds of our own, must preserve it separate.
531.	From what has been observed, arises this general rule: where the compound retains the primary sense of the simples, and the parts of the word are the same in every respect, both in and out of composition, then the preposition k pronounced in a distinct syllable; but when the compound departs ever so little from the literal sense of the simples, the same departure is observable in the pronunciation ; hence the different syllabication and pronunciation of re-couHoence and rtc-om*mcnd ; the former signifies a repetition of a cotnmence-
