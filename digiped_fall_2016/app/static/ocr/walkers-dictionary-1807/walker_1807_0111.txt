ACCENT ON DISSYLLABLES AND TRISYLLABLES. Cf
Accent on Trisyllables.
501.	As words increase in syllables, the more easily is their accent known, Nouns sometimes acquire a syllable by becoming plural; adjectives inert utte a syllable by being compared; and verbs, by altering their tense, or becoming parridpJes: adjectives become adverbs, by adding ly to them; and prepositions precede nouns or verbs without altering the accent of the word to which the y are prefixed s so that when once the accent of dissyllables is known, those poiy-sylkdbles, whose terminations are perfectly English, have likewise their accent invariably settled. Thus Hon becomes lioness ; poet, poetess; polite becomes fi'jftter, or politely, or even pfj&tekcr: mischief, mischievous ; happy, happiness ; nay, Hones* becomes lionesses ; mischief, mischievousness ; and service, serviceable, serviceableness, serviceably, and unserviceably, without disturbing the accent* either oo account of the prepositive un, or the subjunctives able, ably, and uble-nets.
502.	Hence we may perceive the glaring absurdity which prevails even in the first circles ; that of pronouncing the plural of princess, and even the singular, with the accent on the second syllable, like success and successes ; for we might just as well say, dutches* and dutchesses, as princess and princh$es ; nor wwad a correct ear be less hurt with the latter than with the former.
503.	So few verbs of three syllables follow the analogy observable in those of two, that of protracting the accent to the last syllable, that this oeconomy seems peculiar to dissyllables; many verbs, indeed, of three syllables are compounded of a preposition of two syllables : and then, according to the primary law of formation, and not the secondary of distinction, we may esteem them radical, and not distinctive : such are contradict, intercede, supersede, contraband, drains scribe, superscribe, &c. while the generality of words ending in the verbal terminations ise and ize, retain the accent of the simple, as criticise, tyrannise, modernise, kc.: and the whole tribe of trisyllable verbs in ate, very few excepted, refase the accent on the last syllable : but words of three syllables often take their accent from the learned languages from which they are derived; and this makes it necessary to inquire how far English accent is regulated by that of the Greek and Latin.
On the Influence of the Greek and Latin Accent, on the Accent of English Polysyllables.
fa) As our language borrows so largely from the learned languages, it is not wonderful that its pronunciation should be in some measure influenced by them. The rule for placing the Greek accent was, indeed, essentially different from that of the Latin; but words from the Greek, coming to us through the ktin, are often so much latinized as to lose their original accent, and to fall into that of the Latin; and it is the Latin accent which we must chiefly regard, as that which influences our own.
(b)	The first general rule that may be laid down is, that when words come to us whole from the Greek or Latin, the same accent ought to be preserved as to the original: thus horizon, sonorous, decorum, dictator, gladiator, mediator, de-btor, spfctator, adulator, &c. preserve the penultimate accent of the original;
yet the antepenultimate tendency of our language has placed the accent on the first syllable of orator, senator, auditor, dcatrLr, plethora, See. in opposition the Latin pronunciation of these words, and would have infallibly dene the same by abdomen, bitumen, and acumen, if the learned had not stepped in $ rescue these classical words from the invasion of the Gothic accent, and
