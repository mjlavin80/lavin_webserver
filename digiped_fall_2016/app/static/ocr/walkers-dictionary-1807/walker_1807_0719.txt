Optative, 6p/td-tlv, or dp-t&'tlv. a. (505). Expressive of desire ; the name of that mood of a verb which expresses de-. sire. ’ dj* Dr. Johnson, Mr. Sheridan, Dr. Ash, Mr. Scott, Entick, Barclay, and Buchanan, accent this word on the first syllable ; and Dr. Kenrick, Bailey, W. Johnston, and Mr. Perry on the second. That the last is more general, particularly in grammar schools, will b^ readily acknowledg-, ed; but that the first is more correct and agreeable to analogy, cannot be denied: for this word is not so naturally derived from the classical optatus, as the lower Latin optativus; and why -this word should transfer its penultimate accent to the first syllabic of the English word, maybe seen under the words Academy, Incomparable, &c.
I am convinced of the justness of the decision on the accentuation of this word. A critick, with whom I lately conversed upon it, contended that the accent ought to be upon the a, because it was dh that letter in the preterj.erfect tense of the verb opto, optavi. I desired him to put his
bill^11;—ptfmd;—/Ain, this.
argument into form, and tell me, whether all words of this termination were to have the same accent as in the preterperfect tense of the verb ?—here he could go no farther: 1 could have immediately confronted him with tentalivefrym tetito ,tenta-/with negative'fieom nego,negavi; with vo* cative, from voco, vocavi; and twenty other examples, wliich would have shown the weakness of his reason; and yet this gentleman is a real scholar, and a man of good sense and great acuteness. See Principles, No. 503, on the influence of the Greek and Latin accent on that of the English; No. 544, on the influence of the Greek and Latin quantity on that of the English; and No. 512, on the termination* ativc and atory.
