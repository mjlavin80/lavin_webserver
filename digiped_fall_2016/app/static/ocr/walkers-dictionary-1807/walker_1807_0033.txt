DEFINITION OF VOWELS AND CONSONANTS. raw
trarf, we find that there are others* whose pronunciation depends on the par* dcular application and use of every part of the mouth, as the teeth, the lips, the tongue, the palate, &c. which yet cannot make any one perfect sound but by their union with those vocal sounds; and these are called consonant«, or letters sounding with other letters.	r
Definition of Vowels and Consonants.	•
5.	Vowels are generally reckoned to be five in number; namely, d, e, r, o, u; y and w are called vowels when they end a syllable or word, and consonant^ when they begin one.
6.	The definition of a vowel, as little liable to exception as any, seems to b£
the following: A vowel is a simple sound formed by a continued effusion of the breath, and a certain conformation of the mouth, without any alteration in the position, or any motion of the organs of speech, from the moment the vocal sound commences till it eijds.	.
7.	A consonant may be defined to be an interruption of the effusion of vocal
sound, arising from the application of the organs ofspeech to each other. _	’
8.	Agreeably to this definition, vowels may be divided into two kinds, the ample and compound. The simple a, e, o, are those which are formed by one conformation of the organs only; that is, the organs remain exactly in the same position at the end as at the beginning of the letter; whereas in the compound vowels £ and i/, the organs alter their position before the letter is completely sounded; nay, these letters, when commencing a syllable, do not only require a different position of the organs in order to form them perfectly* but demand such an application of the tongue to the roof of the mouth, as is means sistent with the nature of a pure vowel; for the first of these letters, i, when sounded alone, or ending a syllable with the accent upon it, is a- real diphthong, composed of the sounds of a in father, and of e in (he, exactly correspondent to the sound of the noun eyt; and when this letter commence? a syllable, as in min-ion, fiin-ion, &c. the sound of e with which it terminates is squeezed into a consonant sound, like the double e heard in queen, different frpm the simple sound of that letter in queen, and this squeezed sound in the com* mencing i makes it exactly similar to y in the same situation; which, by all grammarians, is acknowledged to be a consonant*. The.latter of thesexom.-pound vowels, m, when initial, and not shortened by a consonant, commences with this squeezed sound of e equivalent to the t/, and ends with a sound giv^n to oo in woo and coo, which makes its name in the alphabet exactly similar to
* How so accurate a grammarian as Dr. Lowth could pronounce so definitively on the nature of y and insist oo its being always a vowel, can only be accounted for by considering the small attention which is generally paid to this part of grammar. His words are these;
“ The same sound which we express by the initial y, our Saxon ancestors in many instances expressed by the vowel e; as cover, your ; and by the vowel *,* as iw, yew ; iong, young.
* the initial y has precisely the same sound with i iu the words vieyu lieu, adieu .* the i is acknowledged to be a Towel in these latter ; how then can the y, which nas the very SMDe sound, possibly be a consonant in the former? Its initial sound is generally like that of
*	m tkire, or ee nearly ; it is formed by the opening of the mouth without any motion or contact of the parts: in a word, it has every property of a vowel, and not one of a consonant.” Introd. to Enjr. Gram, page 3.
Thus far the learned bishop • who has too fixed a fame to suffer any diminution by a mis-in to trifling a part of literature as this: but it may be asked, if y has every property •fa vowel and not one of a consonant, why, when it begins a word, does it not admit of the aphonic article an before it.?
