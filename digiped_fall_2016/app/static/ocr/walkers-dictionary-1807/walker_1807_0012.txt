sound of the e in emotion*, of the o in obedience^ and of the u in monument. In the hasty pronunciation of coipmon speaking, the c in emotion is often shortened, as if spelt im-nio-tion; the a in obedience shortened and obscured, as if written ub-be~de*cnce; and the u in monument^ changed into r, as if written mon~ne-ment; 'while the deliberate and elegant sound of these vowels is the long open sound they have, when the accent is on them i;v equals over, and unit; but a when unaccented, seems to have no such diversity; it has generally a short obscure sound, whether ending a syllable, or closed by a consonant. Thus the a in able has iu definite and distinct sound; but the same letter in tolerable f goes into an obscurarpdefinite sound approaching the short u; nor can any solemnity or deliberation give it the long open sound it has in the iirst word. Thus, by distinguishing vowels into their accented and unaccented sounds, we are enabled to see clearly what Dr. Johnson saw but obscurely; and by this distinction entirely,to obviate the objection.	1
Equally indefinite and uncertain is his general rule, that those are to be considered as the most elegant speakers who deviate least from the written words. It is certain, where custom is equal, this ought to take place ; and if the whole body of respectable English speakers were equally dividpd in their pronunciation of the word busy, one half pronouncing it bew-ze], aim the other half biz-ze, that the former ought to be accounted the most elegant speakers; but till this is die case, the latter pronunciation, * though a gross deviation from orthography, will still be esteemed the most elegant. Dr. Johnson’s general rule, therefore, can only take place, where custom has not plainly decided; but, unfortunately for the 'English Language, its orthography and pronunciation are so widely different, that Dr. Watts and Dr. Jones lay it down as a maxim in their Treatises on Spelling, that all words which can be sounded different ways, must be written according to that sound which is most distant from the true pronunciation; and consequently, in such a Language, a Pronouncing Dictionary must be of essential use.
But still it may be objected to such an undertaking that the £uctuation of pronunciation is so great as to render all attempts to settle it useless. What will it avail us, it may be said,, to know the pronunciation of the present day, if, in a few years, it will be-altered ? And how are we to know even what the present pronunciation is, when the same words arc often differently pronounced by different speakers, and those perhaps of equal numbers and reputation ? To this it may be answered, that the fluctuation of our language, with respect to its pronunciation, seems to have been greatly exaggerated $. Except a very few single

§ The old and new	with	all	the various dialects, must have occasioned infinite
irregularity in the pronunciation of the Greek tongue ; and if we may judge of the Latin pronunciation by the ancient inscriptions, it was nttle less various and irregular than the Greek. Aulus GclliuR tells us, that Nigidius, a grammarian who lived a little more than a century before him, accented the first syllable of Valeri; but, says he, “ si quis nunc Valerium t( appeilansin casu voeandi secundum id prxccptuiu Nigidii acueritprimam,non aberitnuin
** rideatur.”—Whoever now should place the accent on the first syllable of Valerius, when a vocative case, according* to the precept of Nigidius, would set every body a-laughing. Even that highly polished language tlie French, if we may believe a writer in the Encyclopedic, is little less irregular in this respect than our own.
