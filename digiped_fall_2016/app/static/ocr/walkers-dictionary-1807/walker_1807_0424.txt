I have given the last syllable of this word the long sound, as I am convinced it is the most correct, though I am of opinion that, in the military profession, it is oftencr pronounced short, as if written en*in. Some reasons from analogy might be produced in favour of this latter pronunciation (144); but they do not seem sufficient to outweigh the more general usage which declares fur the former.
