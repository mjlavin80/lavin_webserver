This is the sound this diphthong always has when the accent is not on it, unless in very few instances, where the compound retains the sound of the simple, as in pronoun ; but in sojourn and sojourner, with the accent on the first syllable, and in every unaccented termination in our and ous, this diphthong has exactly the sound of short u: thus favour, honour, odour} and famous, art pronounced as if written./inmr, honur, odur, and famus.
