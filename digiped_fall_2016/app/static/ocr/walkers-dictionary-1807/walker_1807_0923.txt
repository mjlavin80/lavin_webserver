Cj* Dr. Johnson seems to favour writing this word without tbe /, as it is sometimes pronounced: but the many examples he has brought where it is spelled with /, show sufficiently bow much this orthography is established. It is highly probable, that omitting tbe sound of / in this word began with mechanicks ; and as the word has been ately litUe used, except in mechanical operations, this pronunciation has crept into our Dictionaries, but ought not to be extended to the liberal and metaphorical use of the word. It is derived from the Latin solidare, the Italian toldare, or the French souder : and wtien other things are equal, Dr. Johnson's rule of deriving words rather from the French than the Latin, is certainly a good one, but ought not to overturn a settled orthography, which Jias a more original language than the French in its fav ur. Though our orthoepists agree in leaving out the /, they differ in pronouncing the o. Sheridan sounds the o as in toti; W. Johnston as in toher ; and Mr. Nares as the diphthong aw, Mr, Smith says, that Mr. Walker pronounces the I in this word, but every workman pronounces it as rhyming with fodder: to which it may be answered, that workmen ought to take their pronunciation from scholars, and not scholars from workmen.-*-See Cu ?r.
