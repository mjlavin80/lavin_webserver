(£j* Mr. Elphinston has a no leas strange than whimsical derivation of this word from an old French substantive le motut, “ That the verb mint should ever have “ been Scottishly man, (as, ye man doo'd, “ for ye must do it,) seems indeed as sur-“ prising, as that the old le moust (now u moxLt), the noun must should ever have “ Englishly run into lamb’s wool, which “ beats far the change of Asparagus into “ Sparroxo-grass, or the elegant as ellipti-“ cal grass. Such a derivation, perhaps, is not impossible ; but 1 should think the more natural, as well as the more easy one, is the resemblance of the soft pulp of an apple to the wool of a lamb.—See Asparagus and the noun Must.
