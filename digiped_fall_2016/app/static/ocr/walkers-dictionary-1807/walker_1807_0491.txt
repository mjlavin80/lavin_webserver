Ij* Dr. Johnson has proved1>eyond dispute farther and farthest are not the comparative and superlative offar, but corruptions of the comparative and superlative of firth. However true this discovery may it does not seem a sufficient reason for jltering the beaten path which custom had formed in the usage of farther and farthest.
It is probable, indeed, that far, fore, and fifth, arise from the same original root: extending beyond tome other object seems to oc the leading idea in all. Far seems to in-tinatt; extension beyond an indefinite ob-
ject ; fore only such extension as gives priority to the extended object; and forth» from its form, seems to relate to the abstract of such priority of extension, or thfc very act of extending or issuing out. If, there fore	and/arhave difierent ideas
annexed to them,the same comparative and superlative cannot possibly suit with both; and as almost immemorial usage has borrowed the comparative and superlative of forth to form tlie comparative and superlative offar, their sense is now fixed to the latter adverb; and forth, inasmuch as it differs from far, seems entirely to have lost its comparison. Notwithstanding, therefore, that farther and farthest are veiy irregular branches of far, they are grafted on it by use, and cannot be altered without diverting the plain tendency of the language. Such, however, has been the force of Dr. Johnson’s criticism, that, since his time, every writer and printer, unless by mistake, has used further and furthest for fatthtr and farthest; by which means we have revived the comparative and superlative of an adverb which has lost its comparison, and have lost tlie comparative and superlative of an adverb, which has been compared for these two hundred years. But though further passes very well for farther, when far is out of sight, we feel the utmost repugnance at saying, “ Thus “far shalt thou go, and nofurther ”

“ The storm of passion, and say Peace,be still;
