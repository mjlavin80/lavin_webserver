xfiviii PRONUNCIATION OF THE CONSONANTS TH, 8tc.
469.	Th between two vowels is generally soft in words purely English,
father, feather, heathen, hither, thither, wAi/A<rr, whether, either, neither, weather, wether, wither, gather, together, fiother, mother.
470.	7% between two vowels, in words from the learned languages, Is gene*
rally hard, as apathy, sym/iathyr antipathy, Athens, atheist, authentic, author, authority, athirst, cathartic, cathedral, catholic, catheter, <?/Arr,	lethargy, Lethey
leviathan, litharge, lithotomy, mathesis. mathematics, method, pathetic, plethora, poly mathy, prothonotary, anathema, amethyst, theatre, amphitheatre, apothecary9 apotheosis.	*
471.	TA is sometimes pronounced like simple r, as Thomas, thyme, Thame*, asthma, phthisis, phthisic ffihthisicai, and Li silent in twelfthtidc, pronounced twelf-ttde.
■	71	*//£nr.
472.	7* is silent when preceded by *, and followed by the abbreviated terminations and /r, as hasten, chasten, fasten, listen, glisten, christen, moisten, which are pronounced as if written hace'n, chace'n, 8cc.; in burst en the f is heard : so castie^ nestle, trestle, wrestle, thistle, whistle, epistle, bristle, gristle, jostle, apostle, rhtqstle, buxtle, jwtfc, rustle, are pronounced as if written cassle, nessle, &c.; ih /ie\s£/f the t is pronounced ; in often, fasten, and soften, the * is silent, and at the end of several words from the French, as /nwV, ,^ow/ (taste), eclat. In the first of these words the t begins to be pronounced; in the last, it has been sometimes heard; but in the second, never. Tmpet is more frequently written toupee, and is therefore not irregular. In biUet-doux the t is silent, as well as in hautboy. The same silence of / may be observed in the English words, Christmas, chestnut, mortgage, ostler, bankruptcy, and in the second syllable of mistletoe. In currant and currants the t is always mute. See No. !02, 103, 405.
V.
473.	V is flat f, and bears the same relation to it as b does to p, d to t, hard
g to k, and z to s. (41). It is never irregular : and if ever silent, it is in the word twelvemonth, where both that letter and the e, arc, in colloquial pronunciation, generally dropped, as if written tweCmonth.	•
W initial.
474.	That & at the beginning of a word is a consonant, has been proved already. (9) (59). It is always silent before r, as in wrack, wrangle, wrap, wrath, wreak, wreath, wreck, wren, wrench, wrest, wrestle, wretch, wriggle, wright, wring-, wrinkle, wrist, write, writhe, wrong, wrought, wry, awry, bewray ; and before h und the vowel o, when long, as whole, who, 3cc. pronounced hole, hoo, &c.
475.	XV before h is pronounced as if it were after the h, as hoo-y, why, hoo-en> when. &c.; but in whole, whoop, &c. the single and double o coalescing with the same sound in w, this last letter is scarcely perceptible. In swoon, however, this letter is always heard ; and pronouncing it soon, is vulgar. In sword and answer it is always silent. In two it mingles with its kindred sound, and the number two is pronounced like the adverb too. In the prepositions toward and towards the w is dropped, as if written toard and toards, rhyming with hoard and hoards; but in the adjectives and adverbs toward and towardly, froward and fro-•wardJu, the w is heard distinctly. It is sometimes dropped in the last syllable of awkward, as if written awkard ; but this pronunciation is vulgar.
