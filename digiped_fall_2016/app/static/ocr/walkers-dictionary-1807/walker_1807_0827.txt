This word is frequently, .but corruptly, protiou need us if written rare. But though rear, rhyming with fear, is the true pronunciation, wejnust not suppose, it to have the least affinity and signification with rear (behind^. Junius and Skinner derive this word from the Saxon word hrere, signifying fluent or trembling like the white or yolk of an egg when unconcocted; hence Junius explains the phrase a Reer-egg, a trembling egg ; and Skinner imagines that this word may come from the Greek word ‘Pev, to flow, because unconcocted eggs flow or move about; or he supposes that our word rear, and the Saxon hrere, may possibly come from the Latin rarus, as opposed to dense, because eggs when boiled, lose their fluidity, and grow thick. This derivation of Skinner seems a little too farfetched. Whatever may he its origin in the Saxon, it seem* to have been used in that language for crrtde and tmconcocled; from the Saxon it comes to us in that sense, and, in my opinion, ought to be written as well as pronounced Here.
