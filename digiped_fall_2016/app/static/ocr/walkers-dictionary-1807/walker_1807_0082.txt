OF THE CONSONANTS.
B.
347.	When b follows m in the same syllable it is generally silent, as in lamb, kemb, Jmb, comb. dun,b, &c. except accumb and succumb; it is silent also before t in the sume syllable, as in debt, doubt, ndjubt, redoubted, and their compounds: it is silent before t, when not in the same syllable, in the word subtle (cunning), often inaccurately used for subtile (finej, where the b is always pronounced. In the mathematical term rhomb the b is always heard, and the wprd pronounced as ii written rhumb. Ambs-ace, is pronounccd jiinu>*uce.
C.
348.	C is always heard like k before a o, and u; as card, cord, curd; and soft like •' before e, i, and y ; as cement, city, cynic.
349.	When c ends ^ wo I'd, or syllable, it is always hard, as in music, flaccid, giccittj, pronounced muak,f.ak~$id, tiksnij, See Exaggerate.
350.	In the word sceptic, where the first c, according to analogy, ought to be pronounccd like s, Dr. Johnson has not only given his approbation to, the sound of k but has, contrary to general practice, spelt the word skeptic. It may be observ ed, perhaps, in this, as on other occasions, of that truly great man, that he is but seldom wrong; but when he is so, that he is generally wrong to absurdity. What a monster does this word >k<ptic appear to an eye the least classical or correct 1 And if this alteration be light) why should we hesitate to write and pronounce *>ccne, sctpter, and Luced&mon. akc ne. skcpter, and Lakcdamion, as there is the same reason for k in all ? It is not; however my intention to cross the general current ol polite and classical pronunciation, which I know is that of sounding the c like k; my objection is only to writing it with the k; and in this I think I am supported by the best authorities since the publication of Johnson’s Dictionary.
351.	C’is mute in C a , Czarina, victuals, indict, arbusclc* corpuscle, and muscle ; it sound# like tch in the Italian words vcrmic-lh and violinccllo; and like -in suffice, Kicrijicc, sice, (the number six at ciicc.) and dUcem.
352.	This letter, when connected -with h, has two sounds; the one like tch in child, chair, rich which. Sic. pronounced as i( written tchild, tchai y tiich, vvhitch, he. ; the other like sh, after / or w, as in bdeh, brnehKfi’ch, &c. pronounced bekdi, bvn. h fll h, hue. This latter sound is generally given to words from the French? as chyise, chagrin, chan.ade, champagne, champtgjwv, chandelier, chaperon, charlatan, chevalier, chevron, chicane, capuchin, cartouch, machine, machinist, chancre, marchioness,
353.	Ch in words from the learned languages, are generally pronounced like k, as chalcography, chalybeate, chamtlccn* chamomile, chaos, character* chart, chasm*
