cr There is a diversity in the pronunciation of this word, which makes it necessary to recur to principles to decide which is best. Dr. Johnson, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Nares, and Mr. Barclay, accent it on the first syllabic ; and Dr. Ash, Dr. Kenrick, W. Johnston, Bailey, and Entick, on the second: and notwithstanding this majo'ri-ty, I am of opinion that the first manner is right. For though Maxillary and the other similar words of this termination are of the same number of syllables with the Latin words from which they are derived, as Maxillaris, Capillarity See. (503, e); yet as our language has an aversion to the accent on the a in these terminations which have the accent in the Latin words (512), it seems agreeable to our own analog)' to place the stress on that syllable to which we give a secondary stress in the original word, and that is the first.—See Academy and Mammillary.
