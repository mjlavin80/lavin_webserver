SECONDARY ACCENT-
sometimes pronounced with the accent on the first syllable, and sometimes ^>n the third: but as these words may be pronounced with an accent on both these syllables, it is el less consequence on which syllable we place the accent, when, we use qbIj one* (52&). The general rule certainly inclines to the penultimate accent; but as all these words are verbal nouns* and, though generally derived from Latin words of the same terminations, have ^verbs corresponding to them in our own language, k is very natural to preserve the accent of the verb in these words, as it gives an empKasis to the most significant part of them: thus eqtdvo* t cator, prevaricator, dedicator, might be regularly formed from the verbs to equivocate, to prevaricate, and to dedicate ; and, agreeably to analogy, would have been written equivocater, prevaricater, and dedicater ; but an affectation of preferring every analogy to our own, has given these words a Latin termination, which answers no purpose, but to involve our language in absurdities ; but the ear, in this case, is not quite so servile as the eye : and though we are obliged to write these words with or, and not er, we generally hear them pronounced as if they were formed from our own verbs, and not from Latin nouns in at or,
Bat when the word has no verb in our own language to correspond to it, the ac* cent is then placed with great propriety upon the a, as in Latin: thus violator, instigator, navigator, &c. ought to have the accent on the first syllable ; and' emendator, gladiator, adulator, &c. on the last but one.
SECONDARY ACCENT.
523. Hitherto we have considered that accent only, which necessarily distin guishes one syllable in a word from the rest: and which, with very little diversity, is adopted by all who speak the English language.
523.	The secondary accent is that stress we may occasionally place upoiv another syllable, besides that which has the principal accent, in order to pronounce every part of the word more distinctly, forcibly, and harmoniously. Thus this accent may be placed on the first syllable of conversation, commendation, &c.
524.	There arc few authors who have not taken notice of two accents upon some of the longer polysyllables, but none have once hinted that one of these is not essential to the sound of the word : they seem to have supposed both accents equally necessary, and without any other difference than that one was pronoinced more forcibly than the other. This mistake arose from a want of studying the speaking voice. A knowledge of this would have told them, that one accent only was essential to every word of more than one syllable, and that the secondary stress might, or might not, be adopted, as distinctness, force, or harmony, should require? thus complaisant, contraband, caravan ; and -violin, partisan, artisan, courtesan, metaphysick, have frequently an accent on the first, as well as on the third syllable,'though a somewhat less forcible one. The same may be observed of repartee, referee, privateer, domineer, See.; but it must still be observed, that though an accent be allowable on the first syllable of these words, it is by no means necessary ; they may all be pronounced with one accent, and that on the last syllable, without the least deviation from propriety.
525.	In order to give some idea of the nature of the secondary accent, let us suppose, that, in giving our opinion of an astronomical argument, we say;
