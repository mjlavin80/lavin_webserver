To Exicc ate, £k-slk7k&te. va.To dry. ft* The first syllable of this word (strictly speaking) ought to be pronounced according to the rule laid down under the preposition Ex: but in this pronunciation we totally lose the sharp ^ which.commences the Latin word«icco, to dry; of which this word is compounded.; and thus the sound of the word is radically injured, and its etymology lost. But it wifi be said, the Latins made the same excision of the radical s on account ofthe coincidence with the * contained in the x of the preposition, and wrote the word txicco. It is allowed thesecorruptions obtained amongst them, as amongst us ; though it is doubtful whether the same inconvenience arose amongst them in this word as with us: for Vossius makes it highly probable that the Latins never gave the flat sound egz to the letter x / and the best manuscripts inform us, that writing this word with an x, as exsicco, and thus preserving the composition distinct and perfect, is the most accurate orthography.

Cf This word, as an adjective derived from the Latin exi/is, is by Nares, Sheridan, Ash, and Entick, accented on the last syllable. The third edition of Johnson’s folio edition has the accent on the last also ; fcut the quarto edition has it on the first. Authority is certainly on the side of the ultimate accent; but it may be questioned whether it is not contrary to analogy, for the penultimate i being long in Latin has necessary influence on the English
word, any more than it has on hostile, sefy vile, &cc.
