GO* Nothing can show more with what servility we sometimes follow the Latin accentuation than pronouncing* this word with the accent on the penultimate. In the Latin decorut the o is long’, and therefore has the accent j but in dedecorus the
o	is short, and the accentis consequently removed to the antepenultimate ; this alteration of stccent obtains likewise when the word is used in English, and this accentuation is perfectly agreeable to our own analogy : but because the Latin adjective indecorus has the penultimate long, and consequently the accent on it, we must desert our own analogy, and servilely follow the Latin accentuation, though that accentuation has no regard to analogy; for why dedecorout and indecoroust words which have a similar derivation and meaning, should have the penultimate of different quantities, can be resolved into nothing but the caprice of custom; but that . so clear an analogy of our own language should be subservient to the capricious usages of the Latin, is a satire upon the good sense and taste of Englishmen. Dr.
Ash is the only one who places the accent on the antepenultimate of this word: but what is his single authority, though with analogy on his side, to a crowd of coxcombs flirting with scraps of Latin ?—See Principles, No. 512.	*
