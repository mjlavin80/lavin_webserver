qt}* This word is frequently mispronounced by sounding the first syllable like the adjective red; an inaccuracy which cannot be too carefully avoided. '
I	am of the same opinion as Mr. Nares, that this word was anciently accented on the
*	last syllable as derived from the French ridicule, and not the Latin ridicitlus / but this accent being found contrary to the Latin analogy (503) shifted to the first syllable ; a transition which, in words of tnree syllables, is the easiest thing in the world. See Principles, No. 524
