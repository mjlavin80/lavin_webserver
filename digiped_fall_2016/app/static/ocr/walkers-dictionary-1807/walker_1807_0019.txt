Rtdet to be observed by the Native* of Ireland in order to obtain a just Pro-
✓	nundation of English*
-AlS Mr. Sheridan was a native of Ireland, and had the best opportunities of understanding those peculiarities of pronunciation which obtain there, I shall extract his observations on that subject as the best general direction, and add a lew of my own, by way of supplement, which I hope will render this article of instruction still more complete.
The reader will be pleased to take notice, that as I have made a different arrangement of the vowels, and have adopted a notation different from Mr. Sheridan, I am obliged to make use of different figures to mark the vowels, but still such as perfectly correspond to his.
a The chief mistakes made by the Irish in pronouncing English, lie for the
*	most part in the sounds of the two first vowels, a and e; the former being u generally sounded k by the Irish, as in the word b&r, in most words where it u is pronounced as in day, by the English. Thus the Irish say, p&tron, m&-“ tron, the vowel k having the same sound as in the word father; whilst the
* English pronounce them as if written fiaytron, may tron. The following u rule, strictly attended to, will rectify this mistake through the whole language.
u When the vowel a finishes a syllable, and has the accent on it, it is inva-u riably pronounced k [day] by the English. To this rule there are but three a exceptions in the whole language, to be found in the words father, papft, “ mam4. The Irish may think also the word rather an exception, as well as “ father; and so it would appear to be in their manner of pronouncing it r&-a ther, laying the accent on the vowel a ; but in the English pronunciation the u consonant tk is taken into the first syllable, as thus, rattier, which makes the a difference.
w Whenever a consonant follows the vowel a in the same syllable, and the u accent is on the consonant, the vowel a has always its fourth sound, as hdt,
*	m&n; as also the same sound lengthened when it precedes the letter r, as u fir, b&r, though the accent be on the vowel; as likewise when it precedes “ An, as bilm, ps&lm. The Irish, ignorant of this latter exception, pronounce u all words of that structure as if they were written hawm, psawm, guawm, u eawm, &c. In the third sound of a, marked by different combinations of u vowels or consonants, such as au, in Paul; aw, in law; alL> in call; ald> in u bold; alfc. in talk, &c. the Irish make no mistake, except in that of Im, as be-“ fore mentioned.
u The second vowel, e, is for the most part sounded ee by the English, when 44 the accent is upon it; whilst the Irish in most words give it the sound of u slender k, as in hate. This sound of £ [ee] is marked by different combina-K tions of vowels, such as ea, eiy e final mute, ee, and ie. In the two last w combinations of ee and *>, the Irish never mistake ; such as in meet, seem, “field, believe, he.; but in all the others, they almost universally change the
*	sound of 6 into k. Thus in the combination ea, they pronounce the words tea* u sea, please, as if they were spelt lay, say, plays; instead of tee, see, plecse. The a English constantly give this sound to ea whenever the accent is on the vowel “ e, except in the following words, great, a pear, a bear, to bear, to forbear, to u swear, to tear, to wear. In all which the e has the sound of k in hkte. For w want of knowing these exceptions, the gentlemen of Ireland, after some u time of residence in London, are apt to fall into the general rule, and pro-
*	nounee these words as if spelt greet, beer, svjecr> kc.
