xcii PRONUNCIATION OF THE CONSONANT S.
431.	Se, preceded by the liquids /, n, or r, has the * sharp and hissing, as pulse, appulse, denhe, tense, intense, sense, verse, adverse, See. except cleanse.
S	fironounced like z.
432.	5 has always its flat buzzing sound, as it may be called, when it immediate iy follows any of the fiat mutes b, d, g hard, or v, as ribs, heads, rags, sieves. (24).
433.	6 is pronounced like z, when it forms an additional syllable with e before it, in the plurals of nouns, and the third person singular of verbs; even though the singulars and first persons end in sharp hissing sounds, as asses, richer cages, boxes, &c.: thus prices and prizes have both the final * flat, though the preceding mute in the first word is sharp. (422).
434.	As * is hissing, when preceded by a liquid, and followed by e mute, as transe, tense, See.; so when it follows any of the liquids without the e, it is pronounced like z, as morals* means, seems, hers. In the same analogy, when 8 comes before any of the liquids, it has the sound of z, as cosmetic, dismal, pismire, chasm, prism, theism, schism, and all polysyllables ending in asm, ism, own, or ysm, as enthusiasm, Judaism, mici'ocosm, paroxysm, &c.
435.	S, in the preposition die, is either sharp or flat, as it is accented or unaccented, as explained above; but it ought always to be pronounced like z, when it is not under the accent, and is followed by a flat mute, a liquid, or a vowel, as disable, disease, disorder, disuse, disband, disdain, disgrace, disvalue, disjoin, dislike, dislodge, dismay, dismember, dismount, dismiss, disnatured, disrank, disrelish, disrobe. (425). Mr. Sheridan, and those orthoepists who have copied him, seem "to have totally overlooked this tendency in the liquids to convert the s to z when this letter ends the first syllable without the accent, and the liquids begin the second syllable with it.
436.	S is pronounced like z, in the monosyllables	as, is, Us,	was,	these,	those,
and in. all plurals whose singulars end in a vowel, or a vowel followed by e mute, as commas, operas, shoes, aloes, dues, and consequently when it follows the w or y, in the plurals of nouns, or the third person singular of verbs, as ways, betrays, news, virvrs, See.	-
437.	Some verbs ending in se have the * like	z,	to distinguish	them	from
nouns or adjectives of the same form.
Nouns	Verbs	Nouns	Verbs
grease	to grease	excuse	to excuse
close	to close	refuse	to refuse
house	to houst	diffuse	to diffuse
mouse	to mouse	use	to use
louse	to louse	rise	to rise
abuse	'to abuse	premise	to premise.
438.	Sy and sey, at the end of words, have the s pronounced like z, if it has a vowel before it, with the accent on it, as easy,greasy, queasy, cheesy, daisy, misy, rosy, causy, noisy; but if the accent is on the antepenultimate syllabic, the s is sharp, as heresy, poesy, &c. if a sharp mute precede, the s is sharp, as tricksy, tipsy ; if a liquid precede, and the accent is on the penultimate syllable, the * is flat as pahy, fimsy,clumsy, pansy, tansy, phrensy, quinsy, tolsey, whimsey, malmsey, jersey, kersey. Pursey, has the * sharp and hissing from its relation to purse, and minstrelsey and controversy have the antepenultimate and preantcpenultimate
