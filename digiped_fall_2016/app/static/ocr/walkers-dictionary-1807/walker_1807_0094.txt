Ixxxviii PRONUNCIATION OF THE CONSONANTS JV, &c.
adjectives, or verbs, do not alter their original sound upon taking an additional syllable. In these three words, therefore, the Irish pronounce more agreeably to analogy than the English; for, if I mistake not, they do not articulate the/. (381).
410.	Hitherto'we have considered these letters as they are heard under the accent; but when they are unaccented in the participial termination irg, they are fiequently a cause of embarrassment to speakers who desire to pronounce correctly. We are told, even by teachers of English that ing, in the word singing, bringing, and swinging, must be pronounced with the ringing sound, which is heard when the accent is on these letters, in king* sing, and wing, and not as if written without the g as singin, bringing s%vingin. No one can be a greater advocate than I am for the strictest adherence to orthography, as long as the public pronunciation pays the least attention to it; but when I find letters given up by the Public, with respect to sound, I then consider them as cyphers: and, if my observation does not greatly fail me, I can assert, that our best speakers do not invariably pronounce the participial rng, so as to rhyme with sing, king, and ring. Indeed, a very obvious exception seems to offer itself in those v^rbs that end in these letters, as a repetition of the ringing sound in successive syllables would produce a Tautofthontj, (see the word,) and have a very bad effect on the ear; and therefore, instead of singing, bringing, and flinging, our best speakers are heard to pronounce sing-in, bring-in, and fling-in; and for the very same reason that we exclude the ringing sound in these words, we ought to admit it when the verb ends with in; for if instead of sinning, f tinning, and beginning* we should pronounce sin-nin, flm-nin, and be-gin-mn, we should fall into the same disgusting repetition as in the former case. The participial ing, therefore, ought always to have its ringing sound, exeept in those words formed from verbs in this termination; for writing, reading, and speaking, are certainly preferable to writin, readin* and speakm, wherever the pronunciation has the least degree of precision or solemnity.
411.	JVis mute when it ends a syllable, and is preceded by / or m, as kiln,
hymn, tiirm, solemn, column, autumn, condemn, contemn. In hym-ning, and lim-rting, the n is generally pronounced, and sometimes, in very solemn speaking, in condem-ning, and contem-ning ; but in both cases, contrary to analogy, which forbids any sound in the participle that was not in the verb. (381).	'
P.
412* This letter is mute before* and t at the beginning of words, ftralm4 psabrast, psalmody, fisalmografihy, psalter, psaltry ; the prefix pseudo, sifmifving false, as pseudography, fiseudohgy, and the interjection pshaw I To these we may add, ptisan, ptyalism, ptysmagogue. It is mute in the middle of words between 7/2 and ', in empty, sempstress,peremfitory, sumptuous,presumptuous, redemption* ex-cmfnion, and raspberry. In cupboard it coalesces with and falls into its flat sound by as if written cubboard. It is mute in a final syllable between the same letters, as temfit, attempt, contempt, exempt,prompt, accompt. In receipt it is mute between i and t, and in the military corps (a body of troops), both p and s are mute, as custom has acquiesced in the French pronunciation of most military terms.
