Me of a word, though unaccented, it keeps its true sound: thus, though the « is pronounced like « in alter, alteration, &c. yet in perfection, terr\fic, &c. this} tetter i*as pure ae when the accent is on it in perfect, terrible, &c.
557.	Something like the Corruption of the sound of unaccentcd e before r, we may perceive in the colloquial pronunciation of the vowel o in the same situation ; and accordingly we find oar best oirthocpists differ in their notation of this letter : thus memory, memeroblc, immemorable, memorably, memorize, have the o pronounced like short t by Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Scott; and memorandum, with the o, as in open; while Dr. Kendrick gives the u in all these words the sound it has iu the conjunction or. Mr. Sheridan marks the unaccented o ia corporal, corporate, and corporation, like the o in open ; but Mr. Scott pronounces this o iu ror-poral, corporate, and corporation, like short u, and the same letter iu incorporate, and incorpo~ ration, like Mr. Sheridan; and Dr. Kenrick, like the o in the former instances. Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Scott are uniform in their pronunciation of the same vowel like short v in armour, armorer, armory, pillory* s/asory, persunsory^ allegory, compilsory, cursory, and predatory; white Dr. Kenrick prouounces the o in armour and armory, like tyie a in open, aud the same letter in pillory, allegory, and cursory, like the o in or, nor, &e. This diversity, arnotig good judges, can arise from nothing but the same uncertainty of the sound of this letter that we have just observed of the e; but if we narrowly watth our pronunciation, we shall find that the unaccented omay be opened and lengttened, in deliberate speaking, without hurtiug the ear, which is not always the case with e ; and this has induced me generally to separate th#
•	from the succeeding r when immediately following the accent; though X am sensible that the rapidity of colloquial speaking often reduces it to short « without offending the ear: but when the o is removed more than one syllable from the accent, the most deliberate speaking generally lets it slide into the other vowel: for which reason 1 havecommoniy marked it ia this manner. See Command.
558.	Jt may, perhaps, appear to some of my readers, that too much time has been spent upon these nice distinctions of sound, in which judges themselves are found to disagree^ but iHken we consider how many syllables in the language are unaccented, and that these syllables are those in which the peculiar delicacy of the pronunciationof natives consists: when we reflect on the necessity of having as distinct and permanent sounds as possible, to which we may refer these fleeting and evanescent ones, we shall not look upon an attempt to arrest and investigate them as a useless part of philology.
