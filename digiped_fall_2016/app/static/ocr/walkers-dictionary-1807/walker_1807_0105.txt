PRONUNCIATION OF THE CONSONANTS J, Y. xcix
X
476.	X is a letter composed of those which have been already considered, and therefore will need but little discussion. (48) (51). It is flat or sharp like its component letters, and is subject to the same laws.
477.	X has a sharp sound like ks, when it ends a syllable with the accent upon it, as exercUe, excellence, &c. or when the acccnt is on the next syllable, if it begin with a consonant, as excuse, exfiense, &c. (71).
478.	X has its flat sound like gz, when the accent is not on it, and the following syllable having the accent begins with a vowel, as exei t, examfile, exist, Sec. pronounced egzert, egzample, egzist, &c. The same sound may be observed if h follow, as in exhibit, exhale, &c. pronounced egzhibit, egzhale ; but if the secondary accent be on the x in the polysyllable exhibition, exhalation, &c. this letter is then sharp, as in exercise (71) ; but in compound words where the primitive ends in x, this letter retains its primitive sound, as fixation, taxation, vexation, vexatious, relaxation, See.; to which we may add the simples in our language, duxobgy and proximity ; so that this propensity of x to become egz, seems confined to the inseparable preposition.
479.	J, like t, is aspirated, or takes the sound of h after it, only when the acccnt is before it: hence the difference between luxury and luxurious ; anxious and anxiety; in the true pronunciation of which words, nothing will direct us but recurring to first principles. It was observed that s is never aspirated, or pronounced like sh, but when the accent is on the preceding syllable (45€p; and that when the accent is on the succeeding vowel, though the s frequently is pronounced fike z, it is never sounded zh : from which premises we may conclude, that luxury and luxurious, ought to be pronounced luckahury and togzurious, and not lug-zho-ryus, as Mr. Sheridan spells it. The same errour runs through his pronunciation of all the compounds, luxuriance, luxuriant, luxuriate, kc. which unquestionably ought to be pronounced lug-zu-ri-ance, htg-zu* ri'-ant, lug-zu-ri-ate, &c. in four syllables, and not in three only, as they are divided in his Dictionary.
480.	The same principles will lead us to decide in the words anxious and anxiety: as the accent is before the x in the first word, it is naturally divisible into ank-siaus, and as naturally pronounced ank-shus ; but as the accent is after the x in the second word, and the hissing sound cannot be aspirated (456), it must necessarily be pronounced ang-ziety. But Mr. Sheridan, without any regard to the component letters of these words, or the different position of the acccnt, has not only spelled them without aspiration, but without letting the « in the composition of the last word, go into z ; for thus they stand in his Dictionary : ank-syus, anksi-e-ty. (456^.
481.	The letter x, at the beginning of words, goes into z, as Xerxes, Xenophon, See. pronounced Zerkses, Zenophon, fccc.; it is silent at the end of the French hOln doux, and pronounced like s in beaux ; often and better written beaus.
Y initial.
482.	Y, as a consonant, has always the same sound ; and this has been sufficiently described in ascertaining its real character (40); when it is a vowel at the eral of a word or syllable with the accent upon it, it is sounded exactly like the first sound of i, as cy-der, ty-rant, re-ply, &c.; but at the end of a word or syllable, without the acccnt, it is pronounced like the first sound of e, as liberty, fury, tenderly, fee.
