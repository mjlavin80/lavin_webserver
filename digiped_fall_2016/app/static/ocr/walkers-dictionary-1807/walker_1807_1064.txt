Untameable, An-tA'md-bl. a. Not to be tamed, not to be subdued.
(Xj* Dr. Johnson inserts the silent e after m both in this word and its simple tameable / but in blamable and unblamable, omits it. Mr. Sheridan has followed him in the two first words; but though he inserts the e in blamable, he leaves it out in unblamable. In my opinion the silent e ought to be emitted in all these words. For the reasons, see Preliminary Observations to the Rhyming Dictionary, page xiii. See also the wdrd Reconcilradle.
