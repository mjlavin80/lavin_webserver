These two modes of pronunciation have been long contending for superiority, till at last the former seems to have gained a complete victory, except in the territories of rhy me. Here the poets cl^im a privilege, and readers seem willing to grant it them, by pronouncing this word, when it ends a verse, so as to rhyme with the word it is coupled with.
“ For as in bodies, thus in soul we find,
** What wants in blood and spirits, fill’d “ with wind.”
But in prose this regular and analogical pronunciation borders on the antiquated and pedantick.
What could have been the cause of this deviation from the general rule in this word and gold, it is not easy to guess; they were both bound to their true sound in the fetters of rhyme; but these fetters, which are
■	supposed to alter the pronunciation of some words by linking dissimilar sounds, have not been strong enough to restrain these from a capricious irregularity. It is not improbable that tbe first deviation began in the compounds, such as Goldtvuth, Goldfinch, Windmill, Windward, See. (as it .js a prevailing idiom of pronunciation to

shorten simples in their compound?} see Principles, No. SiS, and the word ’krtoxe-ledge>Jand these at last corrupted the samples. But whateter may have been the cause, the effect is now become so general, that reducing them to their true sound seems almost impracticable. Mr. Sheridan * tells us, that Swift Used to jeer those who pronounced wind with the i short, by saying, “ I have a great mmd to find why ** you pronounce it wind.’’ A very illiberal critic retorted this upon Mr. Sheridan, by saying, “ If I may be so boold, 1 should be glad to be toold why you pronounce it gooldThe truth is, every child knows now these words ought to be pronounced according to analogy; but it requires some judgment, and an extensive acqi^aintance with polite and literary circles, to know which is tlie most current pronunciation. Where analogy is not so evident, and yqt as real as in these words, it.is some credit to a speaker to depart a little from custoip in favour of analogy; but where everyone knows as well as ourselves What ought to be the pronunciation, and yet where ever* one pronounces in opposition to it, we shall get nothing but contempt by departing from the general voice. With respoct to the words in question, my observation fails me if wind, as a single word, is not mbre fixed in the soifnd of short i, than gold in the sound of oo ; tlie true sound of this last word seems not quite irrecoverable, -except in tlie compoundgoldrmithj but the compounds of wind, such as windy, Viind-mill,windward, &c. must in my opinion be given up : nor, till some superiour spirit, uniting the politeness of a Chesterfield with the genius of a Swift, descends t}0 vindicate the rights of an injured word, do I think that wind will, in prose and fa~ miliar language, ever be*a fashionable pronunciation. The language of Scripture seems to have native dignity and solemnity sufficient to authorize the long sound, but no other. Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Scofi give the same preference to the first sound of this word that I have done. Dr. Kenrick and Mr. Barclay give only the short sound. Mr. Pecry joins them in this sound; but says, in dramatick scenes it has the long one Mr. Nares says, it has certainly tne short sound in common usage, but that all our best poets rhvme it with mind, kind, &c.; and Mr. Smith observes, that it is now the polite pronunciation, tliough against analogy.
To Wind, wind. v. a. To blow, to sound by inflation; to turn round, to twist; to regulate in action ; to nose, to follow by scent.
