world, is certainly a capricious novelty ; a noveltjr either generated by false criticism to distinguish \t from, tbe preterit of the verb to wind, of which there was not tlie least danger of interference (see Bowl) , or more probably from an afTectation of Uic French sound of this diphthong, which, as in pour, and some other words, we find of late to have prevailed. The Stage is in possession of this sound ; and what Swift observes of newspapers with respect to' the introduction of new and fantastical words, may be applied to the Stage, with respect to new and fantastical modes of pronunciation. (See Sigh). That the other pronunciation was the established sound of this word, appears from the poets, who rhyme it with Loundxfound,ground, andaroum/, and is still so among the great bulk of speakers, who learn this sound at school, and are obliged to unlearn it again when they come into tlie convei Sa< ion of the polite world Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Scott, and Mr. Elphinston, adopt the first sound of this word; but Dr. Kenrick and W. Johnston the second ; Mr. Perry gives both, but prefers the first; and though Mr. Smith, :n his Vocabulary, has classed it with sound and found, sa}s woond is the common pronunciation. I am, however, of Mr. Narea’s opinion, who says this pronunciation ought to be entirely banished. But where is the man bold enough to risk the imputation of vulgarity by such an expulsion ?

(Cj*This word is often pronounced rop, rbr»-ing with top, even by spe akers much abore 1he vulgar. They nave a confused idn, that a preceding « makes the a broadband do not attend to the intervening r, w&kh bars the power Of the «<» and necessarily preserves the a in its short Italian sound. Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Scott, W. Jchnstac, Dr. Kenrick, Mr. Perry, and Mr. SmitK pronounce it as 1 have done.

(Xj* The first pronunciation of this word is by far the more usual, but the fcistxsmorv analogical. Th^to has no powerovertbe a, for the same reason as in the precedirg w’ord. A want of attending to this, awi, perhaps, confounding this word with the obsolete adjective wroth, are the reasons of the present currency of this errcneor* pronunciation. Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Scott. W. Johnston, Dr. Kenrick, Mr. Nares. and Mr. Smith adopt the first sound; at*! Mr. Perry, alone the last; but in a where analogy is so clear, his authority ought, in my opinion, to outweigh them all Wr ath ful, r6/A'fi*il, or ra/A'fitl a. Ad* jtry, furious, raging.

(jjr* 1 have placed what I think the l>cst usual mode of pronouncing this word firs*, because 1 think it so much more agreeable to analogy than the second. Nouns and verbs spelled alike, and ending with a hissing consonant, seem throughout the whole language to be distinguished from each j other by the former giving the sharp, and
