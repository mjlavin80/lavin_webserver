This indefinite, and, as it may be colled, tbe euphonic art icle, is said by all our Gram -TTiarians to he used be fore a rowel or h mute j but no potice is taken of using a instead of it before what is called a vowel, as, a useju> book, a useful ceremony' a usurer, &c. nor is any* mention made of its constant usage before h when it is not mute, if the accent of the word be on the second syllable, as, an heroic action, an historical accountt &.C. This want of accuracy arise* from a want of analyzing the vowels, and not attending sufficiently to the influence of accent on pronunciation. A proper investigation of the power of the vowels would have informed ^)ur Grammarians, that the letter v, when long, is not so properly a vowel as a semi-<-onsoi) a nt ,and pe rfec 11 y equivalent to commencing y (8); and that -a feeling of this has insensibly influenced the best, speakers to prefix a to it in their conversation, while a confused idea of the general rule arising from an ignorance of the nature of the letters has i. ene rally induced them to prefix onto it i n wri t i n if. The same observations are appl i-cable to the A. The1 ear alone tells us, that before heroic f historical, Ucc. tbe an ought invariably to be used ; but by not discovering that it is the absence of accent on the h that makes an admissible in these words, we are apt to prefix an to words where the h is sounded, as, an horse, Vn house, &x\ and thus 6et our spoke n and written language at variance. This seems better to account for the want of accuracy in this article than a conjecture I once heard from Dr. Johnson, that our ancestors, particularly in the time of the Spectator, where this misapplication of the article frequently occurs, did not pronounce the h at the beginning of words so often as we do. However this may be, it seems necessary
-	to a correctness of language to make our orthography aud pronunciation as consistent as possible : for which purpose it may not be useless to attend to the following general rules. The article A must be us-<;d before all words beginning with a consonant, and before the vowel u when long: and the article An must be used before all words beginning with a vowel, except long u; before words beginning with h mute, as, an hour, an heir, &c. or before words where the h is not mute, if the ac-
cent be on the second syllable, as, an heroic action, an historical account, &c. For the few words in our language where tbe h is mute, see this letter in the Principles, Ito. 394 : and for a just idea of the letter zi, and the reason why it admits of an before it, when long, see Principles, No. 8, and the Notes upon it.
