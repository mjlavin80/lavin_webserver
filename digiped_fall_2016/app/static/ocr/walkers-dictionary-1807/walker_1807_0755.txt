" My love, as it begins, so shall per sever” AU9* well, &c. Act IV.
“ Per sever not, but hear me, mighty kings.” King John, Act II.
“ But in her pride she doth persever still.”
Spenser.
But that before the time of Milton the spelling and accentuation had been changed.
“ Whence heavy persecution shall arise
M Of all wh6 in the worship persevere
“ Of spirit and truth.”—	_
*	Par. Lost, xii. v. 532.
As this word is written at present, there can be no doubt of its pronunciation ; and that it is very properly written so, appears from other words of the same form. Declare, respire, explore, procure, &c. from declaro9 respiro, exploro, procuro, &c. and consequently from persevero ought to be formed persevere: not one of our orthoepists places the accent on the second syllable; yet such is the force of prescription, that the old pronunciation is not entirely rooted out, especially in Ireland, where this pronunciation is still prevalent.
