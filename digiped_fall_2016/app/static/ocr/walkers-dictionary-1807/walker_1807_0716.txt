(* All the orthoepists I have consulted (as far as can be gathered from their notation and accentuation) make the penultimate e in tills word short, as in the word presence, except Mr. Sheridan. That it is not pronounced enclitically like omnipotence (513)(518), arises, perhaps, from the number of consonants in the latter syllables ; and as this is the case, it sfeems most agreeble to the nature of our composition to pronounce presence in this word, in the same manner as when it is taken singly ; just as we pronounce theatre in the w6rd amphitheatre, with the accent on the antepenultimate, though tlie accent is on the penultimate, and the vowel is iong in the Latin amphitheatrum.

•Xj* This w.ord, and its relatives, once and none, are perhaps the best test of a residence in the capital In some parts of England they are pronounced so as to give the o the sound it has in tone, sometimes the sound it has in gone; but the true sound is that it has in son, done, &c. which is perfectly equivalent to the sound of tt in sun. I never could make a northern inhabitant of England pronounce the following sentence without the greatest difficulty : “ I have won one game, and you “ have won none ; you have not won once, “ and that is wonderful.” Where we may observe that the o in won, is the exact sound it has in one, once, and wonderful.
