Ml	DIFFERENT	SOUNDS	OF	THE LETTER Y.
It may, indeed, be observed, that there is scarcely any thing more distinguishes a person of mean and good education than the pronunciation of the unaccented rowels, (547^ (558.) When vowels are under the accent, the prince, and the lowest of the people in the metropolis, with very few exceptions, pronounce them in the same manner; but the unaccented vowels in the mouth of the former have a distinct, open, and specific, sound, while the latter often totally sink them, or change them into some other sound. Those, therefore, who wish to pronounce elegantly, must be particularly attentive to the unaccented vowels; as a neat pronunciation of these, forms one of the greatest beauties of speaking.
Y	Jmal.
180.	Y final, either in a word or syllable, is a pure vowel, and has exactly the same sound as i would have in the same situation For this reason, printers, who have been the great correctors of our orthography, have substituted the i in its stead, on account of the too great frequency of this letter in the English language. That y final is a vowel, is universally acknowledged ; nor need we any other proof of it than its long sound, when followed by e mute, as in thyme, rhyme, &c. or ending a syllable with the accent upon it, as buying, cyder, &c. this may be called its first vowel sound.
181.	The second sound of the vowel y is its short sound, heard in system, syt:-fax, See.
Irregular and Unaccented Sounds.
182.	The unaccented sound of this letter at the end of a syllable, like that •f i in the same situation, is always like the first sound of e: thus -vumty, pleurisy, See. and if sound alone were consulted, might be written vanitee, fileurisee,
183.	The exception to this rule is, when/precedes the y in a final syllable,
the y is then pronounced as long and open as if the accent were on it: thus justify, qualify, See. have the last syllable sounded like that in defy. This long ' sound continues when the y is changed into i, in justifiable., tjuaHfiablc, See. The same may be observed of multiply and multipliablc, See. occupy and occvpiabley See. (512.)	^
184.	There is an irregular sound of this letter when the accent is on it in panegyric, when it is frequently pronounced like the second sound of t; which would bd*more correct if its true sound were preserved, and it were to rhyme with Pyrrhic ; or as Swift does with Satiric:
“ On me when dunces are satiiick,
'	**	I take it for a paneuijnck.'’*
Thus we see the same irregularity attends this letter before double r, or before single r, followed by a vowel, as we find attends the vowel i in the same situation. So the word Syrinx ouprht to preserve the u like i pure, and the wonj syrtin should sound the y like e short, though the first is often heard improperly like the last.
185.	But the most uncertain sound of this letter is, when it ends a syllable Immediately preceding the accent. In this case it is subject to the same variety >
