DIFFERENT BOUNDS OP THE DIPHTHONG AE. lix
lOwels we find a squeezed sound like the commencing or consonant y interpose, as h were, to articulate the latter vowel, and that the words where ihese diphthongs are found, might agreeably to the sound, be spelt oshe-yun, /•yude9 jfrtveL, pon-yard* sfuvfyel, pash-yon, Sec.j and as these diphthongs (which, from their commencing with the round of y consonant, may not improperly be caiied sex-consonant diphthongs?) begin in that part of the mouth where s, c soft, and t are formed, we find that coalescence ensue which forms the aspirated hiss in the numerous terminations sion, tion, tial, &c. and by direct consequence in those ending in ure, tens, as future* fortune, &c. for the letter u, when long, is exactly one of these semi-consonant diphthongs (8); and when immediately after the accent it coalesces with the preceding *, c, or *, and draws them into the aspi-med hiss of sh or tsh. (459). Those found in the termination ious may be called semi-consonant diphthongs also, as the o and u have but the sound of one vowel. It may be observed too, in passing, that the reason why in mansuetude the # does not go into sh, is, because when u is followed by another vowel in the same syllable, it drops its consonant sound at the beginning, and becomes merely double o.
197.	The improper diphthongs are,
ae Caesar	ea	clean	ie	friend
ai aim	ee	reed	oa	coat
ao gaol	ei	ceiling	oe	oeconomy.
au taught	eo	people	oo	moon
av law	ey	they	ow	crow.
198.	The triphthongs having but two sounds are merely ocular, and ifwxt therefore be classed with the proper diphthongs:
aye (forever)	eou plenteous	iev> view
eau beauty	ieu adieu	oeu manoeuvre.
Of all these combinations of vowels we shall treat in their alphabetical order.
AE.
199.	Ae or * is a diphthong, says Dr. Johnson, of very frequent use in the Utin language, which seems not properly to have any place in the English; since the * of the Saxons has been long out of use, being changed to e ample; to which, in words frequently occurring, the * of the Romans is, in the same manner, altered, as in riuator, equinoctial, and even in Erica*.
200.	But though the diphthong « is perfectly useless in our language, and the substitution of e in its stead, in Cesar and Enrax, is recommended by Dr. Johnson, we do not find his authority has totally annihilated it, especially in proper names and technical terms derived from the learned languages. Caxar, &nro9, JEsop, fitan, ether, etfdop# mineral, ami hsbena, anacefiholtods, aph<rrcxi8} ‘gitofiM, ozena, ice. seem to preserve the diphthong, as well as certain words which are either plurals or genitives, in Latin words not naturalized, as comucom
exwi*, aqua vit*, ndnutie, stria:, See.
201.	This diphthong, when not under the accent- in Mlchadma*, and when
accented in Dedahts, is pronounce ! like short e; it is ike r, subject to the short sound when under the secondary accent, as in J 'noba bus, where enin the first syllable, is pronounced exactly like the letter n. (530).	^
