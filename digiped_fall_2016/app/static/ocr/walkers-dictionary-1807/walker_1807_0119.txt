(328).
515.	This tendency in our language, to simplify compounds, is sufficiently evident in that numerous catalogue of words, where we find the long vowel of the simple changed into a short one in the compound, and by this means losing much of its original import tct the ear: thus breakfast, shepherd, vineyard, meadow, shadow, zealous, hearken, valley, cleanse, cleanly (neat), forehead, wUdemens, bewilder, kindred, hinder, knowledge, darling, fearful, pleasant, pleasure, whit* ter, wkitleather, seamstress, stealth, wealth, health, wisdom, wizard, parentage, lineage, children, pasty, gosling, collier, holiday, Christmas, Michaelmas, windlass, cripple, kinder, stripling, starling, housewife, husband, primer, peascodyfieUyare, birth from bear, dearth from dear, weary from wear, and many others, entirely lose the sound of the simple in their compound or derivative.
516.	The long i in white, when a simple, is almost universally Changed into a short one in proper names, as Whitchurch, Whitefietd, Whitbread, Whitlock, Whitaker, &c. for compendiousness and despatch being next in importance to perspicuity, when there is no danger of mistake, it is no wonder that the organs should (all into the shortest and easiest sounds.
517.	It must, however, be observed, that this tendency to unite simples into » compound, by placing an accent exactly where the two words coalesce, is still subservient to the laws of harmony. The Greek word Sox**, which signifies to opine, and from which the last syllables of orthodoxy are derived, was never a general subjunctive word like tayo? and ypa$* ; and even if it had been so, the assemblage of consonants in the letter x would have prevented the ear from admitting an accent on the syllable immediately preceding, as the x would, by this means, become difficult to pronounce. Placing the accent, therefore, on the first syllable of orthodoxy, gives the organs an opportunity of laying a secondary stress upon the third, which enables them to pronounce the whole with distinctness and fluency : thus Galaxy and Carhexy* having the accent on the first syllable, are very difficult to pronounce; but this difficulty is removed by placing the accent a syllable higher in the words upofilexy, atamxy, and anor xy.
518.	But the numerous classes of words that so readily adopt this enclitital vcent, sufficiently prove it to be agreeable to the genius of our pronunciation, [Hus wi1! more evidently appear by adducing examples. Words in the following terminations have always the accent on that syllable where the two parts unite, that is, on the antepenultimate syllable s
