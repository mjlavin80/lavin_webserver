irregular, as it is the only pure English word id the language where the final e does not produce the long diphthongal sound of i when the accent is on it: but this irregularity is so fixed as to give the regular sound a pedantic stiffness.

Johnston gives both, but places the irregular first: and the Grammar called BickerstafPs, recommended by Steele, adopts the sound, and gives this rule :
