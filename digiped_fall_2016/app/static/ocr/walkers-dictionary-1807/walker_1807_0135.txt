NOT UNITED TO CONSONANTS.
ends
J50l Bat it may be demanded, what reason is there in the nature of the thing for dividing the word in this manner, rather than into op-in-ion, where a consonant ends every syllable? In tkb, as in many other cases of delicacy, we may be avowed to prove what is right, by fiist proving what is wrong. Every ear would be hurt, if the first syllable of opinion and oh/ence vere pronounced exactly al ike; op-m-ton would be as different from o-pin-iontas o-p > ence from op-t-bntf, and consequently a different syllabication ought to be adopted ; but as ofi't'ence is rightly divided into op-u-lenee, opinion must be divided into o-pin-io'i; that is, the o must be necessarily separated from the p, a - in o-pen ; for, as wa> before observed, every vow el pro-Boaoced alone has its open sound, as nothing but its junction with a consonant can shut it, and consequently unaccented vowels not necessarily joined to a consonant are always open: therefore, without violating the fundamental laws of pronunciation, opinion must necessarily be dirided into o-trin-ion and not op-m-ion, and the o pronounced as in the word open, and uot as in optdence; which was the thing to be proved.
551.	If these ieason«* are valid with respect to the vowel in question, they have the same force with respect to every other vowel not shut by a consonant throughout the language. That the rovets in this situation are actually open, we may easily perceive by observing t iUt rowel, which, from its diphthongal and semi-consonant sonnd, is less liable to suffer by obscure pronunciation than any other. The letter n, in this situation, always preserv es itself fuJI and open, as we may observe in utility, lucubration, &c. The o, the most open of al* the simple rowels, has the same tendency in obedience, opake, position, &c. the e iu the first syllable of rveal, io the second of delegate, the first and third of et angelis , in the second of gayety, nicety, kc. the a in the first of abate, and the second of probable, &c. and the i iu nullity. This auacccnted letter being no more than e% and this sound when long, corres|ionding exactly with its short sound, (which is not the case with any of the other vowels (65) (<»G), the difieretice between the long and short, or open and shut sound of this letter, is less perceptible thao in any other: yet we may easily perceive that a delicate pronunciation evidently lea?es it open when unaccented in indivisibility, as this word would not be justly pronounced if the* in every syllable were closed by a consonant, as if divided into rv-tliv- is- ib-ii-it-y; the first,third,aud fifth syllables, would, indeed, be justly pronounced according to thisdivision, ^ these hare all accentual force, which shuts this vowel, and joins it to the succeeding consonant; bat in the second, fourth, and sixth syllable-*, there is no such force, and consequently it must remain opeu and unconnected with the consonant | though, a* wa^ before observed, the long and short sound of this vowel are so near each other, that the difference is less perceived than in the rrst. Every ear would be displeased at such a pronunciation as is indicated by 'ft-tii-iit-y, luc-cub-bra-tion, op-pin-ion,pm-ition,ev-vent, ev-van-pei-ist, ab-fcate, prob-bab-ble, kc.; but for exact’y the same reasons that the vowels out of the stress ought to be kept open to these words, the slender i must be kept open in the same situation in the word in-di-v sand every similar word in the language*.
552.	From all this it will necessarily follow, that the custom adopted by the ancients and Boderns of joining the single consonant to tpe atter vpwel in syllabication, when investigate iog ibe uuknown sound of a word, has its foundation in reason and good sense; that the only reason why vowels are short and shut, is their junction with a consonant; so those that are ** joined to consonants, when we are not speaking metrically, cannot be said to be either >bortor shut: and that as aJ accented vowels, when final or pronounced alone, have their open sound, so those vowels that are alone or final in a syllable must uecessarily retain their °peo sound likewise, as nothing but uniting instantaneously with the succeeding consonant ^ shut them : and though nothing but a delicate ear will diiect us to the degree of open-&€« with which we must pronounce the first unaccented o in docility, domestic, potential, pro-
monastic, monotony, &c. we may be assured that it is exactly under the same predicament, *ith respect to sound, in all these words: and as they can never be pronounced short aud as if written dosstlity, dommestic, &c. without hurting the duliest ear; so the e\w%event9 *fcc. and the v in the third syllable of utility, and in the jecond, fourth, and sixth, •f indkisibility, can never be sounded as if joined to the consonant without offending every Plicate ear, and overturning the first principles of pronunciation.
*	It is plain that Mr. Sheridan considered the unaccented vowel i, whether ending a syllable, or joined to the succeeding consonant, as standing for the same sound; for we see him
**raetiaie$ making use of one division, aud sometimes of another: thus he divides the word 4*‘ttr.ti-ty with the i terminating the penultimate syllable, and u-m-vsr-sit-y with the same ' naitcd to the consonant. The same variety takes place in the words dwts-i-bil-i-ty aud '*-dt-us-i-hd-it-y, while Dr. Kenrick divides all words of this termination regularly in the furnjtr manner.	v
