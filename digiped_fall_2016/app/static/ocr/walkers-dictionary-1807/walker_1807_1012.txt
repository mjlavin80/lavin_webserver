The first mode of pronouncing this word is that which is adopted by Mr. Sheridan, Dr. Kenrick, Bailey, Buchanan,
and Perry ; and the second, by Dr. Ash, Mr. Nares, Mr. Scott, Entick, and Fr\. I do not hesitate fo pronounce the former the most agreeable to English analogy : not only because the prefixes, bi and tri, when no other law forbids, ought to be made as distinct as possible, but because all words of two syllables with the accent on the first, and having one consonant between two vowels, ought, if custom does not absolutely forbid, to have tlie vowel in the first syllable long. This is the genuine English analogy ; the mode in which we pronounce all Latin words of this form, let the quantity be what it will (544) ; and the mode m which we should have pronounced all English words of this . form, if an affectation of Latinity had not often prevented us. For the same reason, therefore, that we pronounced biped, trigon, and tridmt, with the i long, we ought to adopt the first pronunciation of the word in question, and not the second. —See Drama.
