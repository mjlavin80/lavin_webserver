tttti DIFFERENT SOUNDS OF THE LETTER A
This is what is called by most grammarians its slender sound (35) (65); we find it in the words lade, spade, trade, See. In the diphthong ai we have exactly the same sound ot this letter, as in /ram, gain, stain, 8cc. and sometimes in the diphthong ea, as btar, s%vrar, pear, Sic.; nay, twice we find it, contrary to every ruie of pronunciation, in the words where and there, and once in the anomalous diphthong ao in gaol. Ii exactly corresponds to the sound of the French r. in the beginning of the words etre and tete.
74.	The long slender a is generally produced by a silent e at the end of the syllable; which e not only keeps one single intervening consonent from shortening the preceding vowel, but sometimes two: thus we find the mute e makes of rag, rag?, and very improperly keeps the a open even in range, change, See. (See Change) ; hat, with the mute e, becomes hate, and the a continues open, and, perhaps, somewhat longer in haste, waste, paste, Sec. though it must be confessed this seems the privilege only of a ; for the other vowels contract before the consonants ng in revenge, cringe, plunge ; and the ste in our language is preceded by no other vowel but this. Every consonant but n shortens every vowel but a, when soft g and e silent succeed; as bilge, badge, hinge, spunge, Sec.
75.	Hence we may establish this general rule: A has the long, open, slender dound, when followed by a single consonant, and e mute, as lade, made, fade, Sec. The only exceptions seem to bef have, are, gape, and bade, the past time of to bid.
'	76. A has the same sound, when ending an accented syllable, as pa-pcr, ta-
per, spec-ta-tor. The only exceptions are fa-ther, master, wa-ter.
77.	As the short sound of the long slender a is not found under the same character, but in the short e (as may be perceived by comparing mate and met) (67), we proceed to delineate the second sound of this vowel, which is that heard in father, and is called by some the open sound (34); but this can never distinguish it from the deeper sound of the a in all, ball, Sec. which is still more open: by some it is styled the middle sound of <z, as between the a in pale, and that in wall: it answers nearly to the Italian a in Toscano, llomana, See. or to
- the final a in the naturalized Greek words, papa and mamma ; and in baa ; the word adopted in almost all languages to express the cry of sheep. We seldom find the long sound of this letter in our language, except in monosyllables ending with v, as far, tar, mar, Sec. and in the word father. There are certain words from the Latin, Italian, and Spanish languages, such as lumbago, bravado, tornado, camisado, farrago, See. which are sometimes heard with this sound of a ; but except m bravo, heard chiefly at the Theatres, the English sound of a is preferable in all these words.
78.	The long sound of the middle or Italian a is always found before r in monosyllables, as car, far, mar, Sec. before the liquids Im; whether the latter only be pronounced, as in psalm, or both, as in psalmist; sometimes before If, and he, as ca(fn half, calve, halve, satve, Sec.; and, lastly, before the sharp aspirated dental th in bath, path, lath, Sec. and in the word father: this sound of the a was formerly more than at present found before the nasal liquid n, especially when succeeded by c, t, or d, as dance, glance, lunce, France, chance, prance, grant, plant, slant, slander, See.
79.	The hissing consonant s was likewise a sign of this sound of the o, whether doubled, as in glass, grass, lass, See. or accompanicd by t, as in last, fast, vast, Sec.; but this pronunciation of a seems to have been for some years advancing to the short sound of this letter, as heard in hand, land, grand, See. and pronouncing the a in of nr, answer, basket, plant, mast, See. as long as in half calf\ Sec. borders very closely on vulgarity. It must be observed, however, that the a before n in monosyllables, and at the end of words, was anciently written
