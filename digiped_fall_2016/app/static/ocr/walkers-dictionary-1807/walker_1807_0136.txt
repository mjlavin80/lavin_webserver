cxx* QUANTITY CM? THE UBTACCENTED VOWELS
553b The only considerable exception to this general rule of syllabication which Menu roes the sound of the uuacoented vowels, is when e succeeds the accent, and is followed by r, as in literal, general, misery, &c. which can never be pronounced Ut-e-mi, gen-t-ral* mis-e-ry, See. without the appearance of affectation, in this sitfuatioa we find the r corrupts the sound of the e, as it does that of every other vowel when in a final unaccented sy liable. For this consonant being nothing more than ajar, it unavoidably mixes with the e in this situation, and reduces it to the obscure sound of short u, (418), a sound to which the other unaccented veWr els before r have sometimes so evident a tendency.
554.	An obscure idea of the principles of syllabication just laid down, and the contradiction to them perceived in this exception, has made most of our orthoepists extremely wavering aud uncertain in their division of words into syllable*, when the unaccented e has preceded r, where we not only find them differiugfrom each other, but sometimes even from themselves:

555.	I have been the more copious in my collection of these varieties, that I might not ap-
pear to have taken the advantage of any oversight or mistake of the press: nor is it any wonder when the principles of syllabication so strongly incline us to leave the vowel «, like the other vowels, open before a single consonant; and the ear so decidedly tells us, that this letter is not always open when preceded by the accent, and followed by r, it is no wonder, I say. that a writer should be perplexed, and that he should sometimes incline to one side, and sometimes to the other. I am conscious I have not always been free from this inconsistency myself. The examples therefore which I have selected, will, I hope, fully justify me in the syllabication I have adopted; which is, that of sometimes separating thee from the r in this situation, and sometimes not. When solemn and deliberate speaking has seemed to admit of lengthening the e, 1 have sometimes made it end the syllable; when this was not the case 1 have sometimes joined it to the r: thus, asein.the penultimate syllable of incarcerate, reverberate ^ &c. seems, in solemn speaking, to admit of a small degree of length and distinctness, it ends a syllable; but as no solemnity of pronunciation seems to admit of the same leogth and openness of the e in tolerate, deliberate, &c. it is united wiih r, and sounded in the notation by short u. It ought, however, to be carefully observed, that though the e in this situation is sometimes separated from the r, there is no speaking, however deliberate and solemn, that will not admit of uniting it to r, and pronouncing it like short u, without offending the nicest and most critical ear.	.
556.	It must also be noted, that this alteration of the sound of e before r, is only when it follows the accent, either primary or secondary, (522) (530); for when it is in the first sy lia-
