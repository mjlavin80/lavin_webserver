flCj* This substantive was, till within tliese few years,universally pronounccd with the accent on the last syllable, like the verb ; but since Johnson and Lowth led the way, a ver^ laudable desire of regulating and im* proving our language has given the substantive the accent on the first syllable, according to a very general rule in tiie language (492); but this has produced an anomaly in pronunciation, for which, in my opinion, the accentual distinction of the noun and verb does not make amends,: if we place the accent on the first syllable of the noun, the ej in the la^t nm*tncccssu<

rily be pronounced like tv in barley, attorney, journey, &c. Notwithstanding therefore this accentuation has numbers to support it, 1 think it but a short-sighted emendation, and not worth adopting*. All our orthoepists pronounce the rerb with the accent on the last, except Fenning, who accents the first. Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Scott, Mr, Nares, Dr. Asb, Perry, and Entick, accent the first syllable of the noun ; but Dr. Johnson and Bailey, the original lexicographers, accent tiie last. Dr. Kenrick does not accent the noun, and Barclay has not inserted it.

Kj* Dr. Johnson says, Prior has accented this word improperly on the first syllable. To which observation Mr. Mason adds,
4‘ Perhaps it is Johnson who has impro-" perly placed the accent on the second syl-“ lable.” If Mr. Mason were asked why, perhaps he would be puzzled to answer.
If it be said that usage is on the side of Prior, what shall we think of all our orthoepists who have accented this word like Johnson ? for thus we find the word accented by Sheridan, Kenrick, Scott, Perry, W. Johnston, Buchanan, and Barclay. Entii 1: has, indeed, the accent on the first, but on the second of tuxceptivc ; and why? it may be asked. If usage alone is pleaded, it may be answered, What can be a better proof of usage than the authors I have quoted ? But Mr. Nares, with his usual good sense,rcprobates this accentuation on the first syllable, and says it is high time to oppose it. The only argument that can be alleged for it, is that which Mr. El-phinston has brought in favour of comparable, admirable, and acctptable, which is, that when the accent is on the second syllable of these words, they signify only a physical possibility of being	a/, ad-
mired, and accepted: but when the accent is oa the first, they signify a fitness or
