lxxxii PRONUNCIATION OF THE CONSONANT G.
cious in leaving it out. The former was charged with harshness; the latter, with mutilating the word, and weakening its sound; but if analogy may decide>. it is clearly in favour of the latter; for there is no axiom in our pronunciation more indisputable than that which makes g silent before n in the same syllable. This is constantly the case in sign, and all its compounds, as resign, design, con-sign,assign; and in indign, condign, malign, benign ; all pronounced as if written sine, rezine, &c. In which words we find the vowel i long and open, to compensate, as it were, for the suppression of g, as every other word ending in gn> when the accent is on the syllable, has a diphthong pronounced like along open vowel, as arraign, campaign, fiign, reign, deign ; and consequently, unless the vowel u can produce some special privilege which the other vowels have not, we must, if we pronounce according to analogy, make the u in this situation
•	long, and sound impugn as if written impune.
386.	The same arialogy will oblige us to pronounce imprcgn, oppugn, exfiugn,, proftugn, as if written imprene, oppune, exptme,proptme, not only when these verbs are in the infinitive mood, but in the preterits, participles, and verbal nouns formed from them, as impugned, impugning, and impugner, must be pronounced impuned, imparting, and impuner. The same may be observed of the rest. Pern haps it will gratify a curious observer of pronunciation to see the diversity and uncertainty of our orthoepists in their notation of the words before us.

Nothing is clearer than that all these words ought to follow the same fortune, and should be pronounccd alike. How then shall be reconciled Mr. Sheridan's pronouncing impugn, oftpugn exfiugn, and propugn, with the u long, and impregn with the e short ? Kenrick, who has not the word propugn, is consistent in pronouncing the rest with the vowel short. The same may be observed of Scott, Who adopts the lonjr sound* but has not the word impregn. Mr. Perry gives the short sound to all but ftropugn, where he makes the u Ion?;, but absurdly makes the verbsd noun propwmer ; and W. Johnston, who has only impugn and oppugn*
