166.	In these words the accent is on the o in every word, except pomegranate: but with very few exceptions, this letter has the same sound in the unaccented terminations, oc, ock, od, ol, om, on, op, or, ot, and some, as mammock, rqs-sock, method, carol, kingdom, muon, amazon, gallop, tutor, turbot, troublesome, 8cc.; ail which are pronounced as if written mammuck, cassuck, methud, &c. The • in the adjunct monger, as cheesemonger, &c. has always this sound. The exceptions to this rule are technical terms from the Greek or Latin, as dehor, a species of the herpes; and proper names, as Calor, a river in Italy.
167.	The fifth sound of o is the long sound produced by r final, or followed by another consonant, as for, former. This sound is perfectly equivalent to the diphthong au; and for and former might, on account of sound only, be written faur and faurmer. There are many exceptions to this rule, as borne, corps, corse, force, forge, form (a seat),./or/e, horde, porch, port, sport, he. which have the first sound of this letter.
163.	0, like A, is lengthened before r, when terminating a monosyllable, or followed by another consonant; and, like a too, is shortened by a duplication of the liquid, as we may hear by comparing the conjunction or with the same letters in torrid, florid, See.; for though the r is not doubled to the eye in florid, yet as the accent is on it, it is as effectually doubled to the ear as if written florrid; so if a consonant of another kind succeed the r in this situation, we find the o as long as in a monosyllable: thus the o in orchard is as long as in the conjunction or, and that in formal, as in the word for: but the o in orifice and forage, where the r is followed by a vowel, the o is as short as if the r were double, and the words written orrificc and forrage. See No. 81.
169.	There is a sixth sound of o exactly corresponding to the u in bull, full, fall, &c. which, from its existing only in the following words, may be callcd its irregular sound. These words are wonmn, bosom, worsted, wolf, and the proper names, IVolsey, Worcester, and Wolverhampton.
Irregular and unacccnted Sounds.
170.	What was observed of the a, when followed by a liquid and a mute, may be observed of the o with equal justness. This letter like a, has a tendency to lengthen, when followed by a liquid and another consonant, or by
9,	w, or * and a mute. But this length of o, in this situation, seems every day growing more and more vulgar: and, as it would be gross to a degree to sound the a in castle% mask, and plant, like the a in palm, psalm, See. so it would be equally exceptionable to pronounce the o in moss, dross, and/to.?/, as if written mawsc, drawse, and frowst. (78) (79). The o in the compounds of sohey as di#scfoc,cb-
resolve, seem the only words where a somewhat longer sound of the o is agreeable to polite pronunciation: on the contrary, when the o ends a syllable, immediately before or after the accentf as in po-lite, im-po-tcnt, Sec. there is an elegance in giving it the open sound nearly as long as in po-lar and potent, See. See Domestic, Collect, and Command. It may likewise be observed, that the ® like the e (102) is suppressed in a final unaccented syllable when preceded by corX*, and followed by n, as bacon, beacon, dcaron, beckon, reckon, pronounced beak\ deak’n, b?ck9n} reckon; and when c is preceded by another conso-
