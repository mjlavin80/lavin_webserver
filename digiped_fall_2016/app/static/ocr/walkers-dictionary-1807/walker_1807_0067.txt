DIFFERENT SOUNDS OF THE DIPHTHONG AU.
H5
Italian a. The same may be observed of taunt, which ought to rhyme with maty though sounded tavmt by Mr. Sheridan; and being left out of theabove list, supposed to be so pronounced by Mr. Nares. But Mr. Elphinston has placed the analogy of these words in so strong and curious a light, that I cannot help presenting them to the reader in his own words, though a different orthography: u V meritoriously distinguishes aunt, the parent's sister, from ant, the emmet,
*	and gives a slender shut, the servile of a broad open, yet without pretence 11 of so dangerous or any coincidence; in defiance of both sisters, his aunt had u power to retain the company of jaunt, haunt, vaunt, taunt, daunt, gaunt, gaunt-“ Ut; in all of which the u does precisely the same duty it formerly did in u ckaunt, graunt, mound, and commaund; in saunter and sounder ; as well as in tt braunch, haunch, paunch, launch, staunch; all now justly as genealogically, tt chant, grant, mand (the old basket), command, santer, sander ; branch, hanch, M pemch, lanch, stanch. Jaundice alone pleaded u radical; and yet was found u mere jandice. So with aunt, must return to truth and etymology (who do
*	not always join issue), jant, hant, vant, tant, dant, gant, gantlet; and even the u venerable Mandy Thursday, with her mand or basket in her hand. She had, " indeed, almost left the language, though Astrea had not left the land, when « analogy (or harmony) enacted; a broad (au) shall not in English precede n; 41 followed either by a dry dental, or by a sibilation; that is, au shall not be fol-“ lowed by nt, nd, nee, nch, or nge. No such sounds being sufferable in the “ English system, as aunt, aund, aunch, aunce, or aunge ; there shall be no suqh “ semblances. Alike are therefore indispensable, chant and jant; hand and u mand, chance and lance, branch and lanch, banter and santer ; Scmde and his fill] u self Alexander. In all such, a far from broad or open, is slender and shut; a yet hardly shorter than if the silent aspiration interposed in ahnt, safmter, w khnce, lahnch, and the rest. Before nge, indeed, a is also slender, but open ; “not ah, but a; guarded therefore by its own (i) servile (as we saw in u its place) against every danger of change. Faun and fawn remain doubtless “ \n fauns and/awns, unaltered by the adsdtitious depressive sibilant.’’ Propriety Ascertained in her Picture, vol. i. page 171.
215.	Laugh and draught, which are very properly classed by Mr. Nares among these words which have the long Italian a in fat her,are, marked by Mr. Sheridan v/ith his first sound of a in hat, lengthened into the sound of a m father, by placing the accent on it. Staunch is spelled without the u by Johnson, and therefor e improperly classed by Mr. Nares in the above list.
216.	Vaunt and avaunt seem to be the only real exceptions to this sound of a m the whole list; and as these words are chiefly confined to tragedy, they may be allowed to “ fret and stmt their hour upon the stage” in the old traditionary sound of awe.
217.	This diphthong is pronounced like long o in hautboy, as if written ho-boy ; and like o short in cauliflower, laurel, and laudanum; as if written coUifltmer, lorrd, and loddanum. In gauge, au has the sound of slender a, and rhymes'with Jtage.
218.	There is a corrupt pronunciation of tliis diphthong among the vulgar, which is, giving the au in daughter, sauce, saucer, and saucy, the sound of the Italian a, and nearly as if written darter, sarce, sarcer, and sarcy ; but this pronunciation cannot be too carefully avoided. Au in sausage also, is sounded by the vulgar with short a, as if written sassage ; but in this, as in the other words, « ought to sound aw. See the words in the Dictionary.
