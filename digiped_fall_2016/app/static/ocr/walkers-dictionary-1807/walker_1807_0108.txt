ACCENT ON DISSYLLABLES.
upon two successive syllables, as di-rect, somc-timcs ; but when these words arc pronounced alone, they have never more than one accent. For want of attending to this distinction, some writers have roundly asserted, that many dissyllables have two accents, such as convoy, concourse discord, shiflwrcck; in which, and similar instances, they confound the distinctness, with which the latter syllables •re necessarily pronounced, with accentual force ; though nothing cun be more different. Let us pronounce the last syllable of the noun torment as distinctly as we please, it will still be very different with respect to force from the same syllable in the verb to torment, where the accent is on it; and if we do but carefully watch our pronunciation, the same difference will appear in every word of two syllables throughout the language. The word Amm is the only word which is pronounced with two consecutive accents when alone.
492.	There is a peculiarity of accentuation in certain words of two syllables* which are both nouns and verbs, that is not unworthy of noticc; the nouns having the accent on the first syllable, and the verbs on the last. This seems an instinctive effort in the language (if the expression will be allowed me) to compensate in some measure for the want of different terminations for these different parts of speech*. The words which admit of this diversity of accent, are the following:
Nouns.	Verbs.	Nouns.	Verbs.

Absent	to absent	digest	to digest
Abstract	to abstract	essay export	to ess&y

* It is not improbable that the verb, by receiving a participial termination, has inclined m to pronounce that part of speech w ith an accent nearer the end than we do the noun : for thong'll we can without any difficulty pronounce tl^e veib with the accent on the m.un, we cannot so easily pronounce the participlc and the adverb formed from it with thai accent : thus we can pronounce to transport with the accent on the first syllable ; but n< t so easily tr'importing and trdntportingly. This is a solid reason for the distinction, and o* gat to induce us where we canto observe it. A ttpulchre and to tepulchre seem to requite it. See the word.
