CF There is a very prevailing' propensity to pronounce this word with the accent on the first syllable ; a projxjnsity which ought to be checked by every lover of the harmony of language. That very singular anal-d£y of our tongue, of placing the accent on the last syllable of the verb, and the first of the noun, (492), seems to have taken place chiefly for the convenience of forming participles, adverbs, and verbal nouns; which would be inharmonious and difficult to pronounce, if the verb had the accent on the first syllable. This analogy should teach us to avoid placing the accent on the first syllable of this and similar verbs, however we may pi-onounce nouns and adjectives; for though to Contemplate with the accent on the first syllable is not of very difficult pronunciation, yet Contemplating and Cdnteviplatingly arc almost unpronounceable.
