PRONUNCIATION OF THE CONSONANT T.
obvious in satiate and satiety j and is perfectly agreeable to that difference made by accent in the sound of other letters. (71). See Satiety.
461.	As the diphthongs ia, ic, io, or iu, when coming after the accent, have the power of drawing the t into shy so the diphthongal vowel u, in the same Mutation, has a similar power. If we analyse the u, we shall find it commence with the squeezed sound of e, equivalent to the consonant u. (39). This letter produces the small hiss before taken notice of (459), and which may be observed in the pronunciation of nature, and borders so closely on natshur, that it is no wonder Mr. Sheridan adopted this latter mode of spelling the word to express its sound. The only fault of Mr. Sheridan in depicting the sound of this word, seems to be that of making the u short, as in bur, cur, &c. as every correct ear must perceive an elegance in lengthening the sound of the u, and a vulgarity in shortening it. The true pronunciation seems to lie between both.
462.	But Mr. Sheridan’s greatest fault seems to lie in not attending to the nature and influence of the accent: and because nature, creature, feature, fortune^ mi .^fortune, See. have the t pronounced like ch or tsh, as if written crea-chure,fea-(ahure, See. he has extended this change of t into tch or tsh to the word tune, and its compounds tutor, tutoress, tutorage ,tutelage, tutelar, tutelary, See. tumult, tumour, &c. which he spells ts/ionn, tshoon-eble, Sec. tshoo-tur, Ishoo-trissjshoo-tur-idzhjshoo-tel-idzh,tshoQ-td-er, tshoo-tel-er-y, See. tshoormult, tshoo-mur, Sec. Though it is evident, from the foregoing observations, that as the u is under the accent, the preceding t is preserved pure* and that the words ought to be pronounced as if written tewtor, tewniult, tewmour, See. and neither tshootur, tshoomult, tshoomur, as Mr. Sheridan writes them, nor tootur, toomult, toomour, as they are often pronounced by vulgar speakers. See Supkrable.
463.	Hero, then, the line is drawn by analogy. Whenever t comes before these vowels, and the accent immediately follows it, the t preserves its simple sound, as in MUtiades, elephantiasis, satiety, See.; but when the accent precedes the t it then goes into sh, tch, or tsh, as na-tshure or na-tchure, na-shion, vir-tshuey or vir-tchue, patietit, £cc. or nashioti, fiashent, See. (464). In similar circumstances, the same may be observed of d, as arduous, hideous, &c. (293) (294) (376). Nor is this tendency of t before long u found only when the accent immediately precedes; for we hear the same aspiration of this letter in spiritual, spirituous, signature, ligature, forfeiture, as i f written sfuritshual, spiritshuous, signatshure, tig-atshure, forfdtshure, See. where the accent is two syllables before these letters ; and the only termination which seems to refuse this tendency of the t to aspiration is that in tude, as latitude, longitude, multitude, 8cc.
464.	This pronunciation of t extends to every word where the diphthong or diphthongal sound commences with i or e, except in the terminations of verba and adjectives, which preserve the simple in the augment, without suffering the t to go into the hissing sound, as lfiity, thou fnt’est, he fiities, dr pitied, mightier, worthier, tiventieth, thirtieth, Sec. This is agreeable to the general rule, which forbids the adjectives or verbal terminations to alter the sound of the primitive verb or
oun. See No. 381. But in the words bestial, celestial,fr ,ntier,admxtion, Sec. where the s, x, or n, precedes the t, this letter is pronounced like tch or tsh, instead of sh (291), as be$-tch:al, c des-tch&aU fron-tcheer, admix-tchion, 8cc.; as also when the t is followed by eou, whatever letter precede, as righteous, fiiteotis, plenteous, See. pronounced rgh^tcheous, fiit-cheous, filen-tcheous, See. The same may be observed of t when succeeded by uou, as unctuous, presumptuous, See. pronounced ung-tchuoux, firemmfi-tchuQus, See. See the words.
