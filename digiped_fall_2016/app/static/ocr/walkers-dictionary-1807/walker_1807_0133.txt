From th* perusal of this selection we *ee a great majority of words where the first vowel k sounded shorty and therefore, to some inspectors it may seem improbabU that the original tendency of our Saxon language was to the long quantity of the penultimate vowel. But* as Mr. Nares very judiciously observes, u the rule ia sufficiently general to be admitted, and is undoubtedly “ founded in the nature of our pronunciationfor which he quotes Dr. Wallis, who says, u Hacc videtur genuina linguae nostrae ratio antiqua.” Elements qf Orth&rfn/y page 935.
546.	Those who hare made the progress of languages their study, will observe, it is presumed, that the broad sounds of vowels change to the slender*, the difficult consonants to the easier, and the long vowels to short ones. This, it is imagined, will be found to be true in all languages, as well as our own; and such alteration seems founded in the nature pf man and of society. The next object to understanding a language being despatch, it is no wonder that short sounds have been encroaching on us, and depriving us of the tune of our words for the sake of gaining time. This is apparent in the abbreviation of sim* pies when compounded, as in knowledge, shefiherd, Ice. (518): but as it is the business of art to correct and regulate the eccentricities of nature and the excesses of custom, it should be the care of every philosophic grammarian to keep his eye upon the original genius and general scope of his language, and to suN fer custom to depart as little from them as possible. But although no in con* sistency or want of analogy can alter any pronunciation^which is once acknowledged and settled, yet when a pronunciation is wavering,''consistency, analogy, and general principles, ought to decide against a great majority of mere fashion and caprice.	* *
Thus have I endeavoured to give a distinct view of the correspondence between the accent and quantity of the learned languages and our own; aqd to rescue a plain Englishman (who, as Ben Jonson says of Shakspeare, has little Latin and leas Greek,) from the supercilious criticism of those Greeklings and Ladnkaaters, who are often remarkably ignorant of their own language, and yet frequently decide upon its accent and quantity, because they have a smattering of Greet and Latin'. If the question turns upon the accentef an Eng'ish word, the Latin word it is derived from is immediately produced, and sentence passed without appeal: and yet if the Englishman were to ask the rule op which this decision is founded, the scholar would, in all probability, be at a loss to tell him. Has every English word, he might say, the same accent as the Latin word from which it is derived ? This the scholar could not answer in the affirmative, as the least recollection would tell him that parsimony, acrimony, See. cannot be accented after the Latin fiar*imoniay acrimoma. Sec. as the Latin is never accented higher than the antepenultimate. But perhaps the English word is adopted whole from the Latin. Here is undoubtedly a fair pretence for pronouncing it with the Latin accent; and yet we see how many exceptions there
