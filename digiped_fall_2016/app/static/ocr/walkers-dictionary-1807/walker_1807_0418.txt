(£/" Dr. Johnson tells us, the first acccntua-tion is adopted by Dryden, and the last by Milton; and this he prefers. There is indeed a strong' analogy for the last, as the word ends in ic (509); but this analogy is sometimes violated in favour ofthe substantives, as in Lunatic, Heretic, &c.; and that this is the case in the word in question,may be gathered from the majority of votes in its favour: for though Dr. Joknson, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Nares, and W. Johnston, are for the latter; Dr. Kenrick, Dr. Ash,Mr.Scott, Mr. Perry, Buchanan, Entick, Bailey, and Barclay, are for the former. This word classes too with those that almost always adopt the antepenultimate accent (503) ; but the adjective has more properly the accent on the second syllable.
