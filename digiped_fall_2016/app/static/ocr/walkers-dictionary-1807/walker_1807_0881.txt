This word is sometimes, but improperly, written sehirrus, with the h in the first syllable instead of the last; and Bailey and Fenning- have given us two aspirations, and spelt it schtrrhus; both of which modes of spelling* the word are contrary to the general analogy of orthography; for as the word comes from the Greek o'Xipf'oc, the latter r only can have the aspiration, as the first of these double letters has always the tpiritus lenis: and the c in the first syllable, arising from the Greek x, and not the X5 no more reason can be given for placing the h after it, by spelling it schirrus, than there is for spelling scene from <rxwtj, sctiene; or sceptre from crKwrlgovj scheptre. The most correct Latin orthography confirms this opinion, by spelling the word in question tcirrhus ; and, according to the most settled analogy of our own language, and the constant tnethod of pronouncing words from the Greek and Latin, the c ought to be soft before the i in this word, ana the first syllable should be pronounced like the first of syr-inge, Sir-i-us, 8tc.
Whatever might have been the occasion of the false orthography of this word, its false pronunciation seems fixed beyond recovery : and Dr. Johnson tells us it ought to be written skirrhus, not merely because it comes from cnu^f, but because c in English has before e and i the sound of s. Dr. Johnson is the last man that 1 should have suspected of giving this advice. What! because a false orthography has obtained, and a false pronunciation in consequence of it, must both these erroursbe confirmed by a still grosser departure from analogy 4 A little reflection on the consequences of so pernicious a practice would,
I doubt nor, have made Dr. Johnson retract his advice. While a true orthography remains, there is some hope that a false pronunciation may be reclaimed ; but when once the orthography is altered, pronunciation is incorrigible j and w * must bow to the tyrant, however false may be his title.—See Principles, No. 350, and the word Skeptics.
