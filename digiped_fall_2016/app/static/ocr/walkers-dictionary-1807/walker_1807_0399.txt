The last mode of pronouncing this word is that which was universally current till within these few years; but the first has insensibly stolen into use, as we may observe from tbe several Dictionaries which have adopted it. Mr. Sheridau, W. Johnston, Mr. Nares, and, as far as we can judge by the position of the accent, Entick and Ba^ey pronounce it with the first a lotiar; and Dr. Kenrick, Buchanan, and, if we may guess at Dr. Ash by his accent, with the same letter short. Mr. Scott gives both ways; but, by placing the sound with the long a first, seems to prefer it. The authorities are certainly on the side I have adopted; but I wish also to establish it by analogy.
And first it may be observed, that it any argument can be drawn from the Latin quantity to the English, it is certainly in favour of the first pronunciation ; for in a Latin word of two syllables, where a consonant comes bttween two vowels, the consonant always goes to the last, and the first vowel is pronounced long, without the least regard to the quantity. Thus CrZtes, the philosopher, and crates, a hurdle j decus, honour, and dcdo, to give; ovo, to triumph, and ovum, an egg; Alima, the legislator, and Nsmen, the divinity, have the first vowels always sounded long by an Engl ish speaker, although in the Latin the first vowel in the first word of each of these pairs is short. From this universal manner of pronouncing Latin words, though contrary to Latin quantity, it is no wonder, when we adopt words from that language without any alteration, we should pronounce them in the same manner; and it may be fairly concluded, that this uniform pronunciation of the Latin arises from the genius of our own tongue » which always inclines us to lengthen the accented vowel before a single consonant in words of two syllables; otherwise, what reason can we assign for the rule laid down by our anct'S-tors for doubliug the consonant in verbs, verbal nouns, and participles, where a single vowel was preceded by a single consonant in the theme ? But an affectation of Latin-»ty seems to have disturbed the general pro-

nunciation of our own language, as much as our own pronunciation has disturbed the Latin quantity: for, though we neglect the quantity of Latin dissy llables, wheu we are pronouncing that language, yet iu dissyllables of our own, formed from the Latin, and an.licised, we seem to be, iu some measure, guided by the Latin quantity. To what else can we attribute the short sound of the first vowel in magick, placid, it:id, vigil, novel, &c. ? aud to whut but the genuine torce of vernacular prouunciatiou can we ascribe the long sound of u in this situation, let tbe quantity of the Latin original be what it will > Thus, though epic, topic, cynic, and tonic, have the first vowel short, tunic, stupid, Cupid, tumid, &c. have the u loug, though always short iu the Latin woids from whence they are derived. But howeve r this may be in words anglicised from tbe Latin, and ending in a cousonaut, perhaps, in nothing is our pronunciation more regular thau in the quantity of the first vowel in a word of two syllables ending with a vowel: in this case tiie tirst vowel is invariably long; and why the word iu question should be the only exception, ran-not easily be accounted for. We ha\e no words originally English of this form ; but those we adopt from other languages sufficiently show the analogy of pronunciation: thus Gola, Comer, China, Era, Strata, Quota, Pico, Dado; Sugo, Bravo, Tyr>, Hero, Xe-gro, See. &c. have all the first syliaMe long; and why Drama should not fail into the same analogy, I cannot conceive.. A corroboration of this is the pronunciation of Lama, Bramu, Zama, and Zara, and al proper names ol the same form from the Greek and Latin, as Cato, Ptatu, Strata, Critu, Draco, &c.; and I think it ma\ be with confidence assrrted,' tbat an Englishman, who had never heard the word Drama pronounced, would natural y place the accent upon the first syllable, and pronounce the vowel in that syllable loug and slender.
