PRONUNCIATION OF THE CONSONANT T.	xcr
able, fturtue, Sec. to be pronounced shoot, shoot-able, purshoo ? &c. If it be answered, Custom; I own this decides the question at once. Let us only be assured, that the best speakers pronounce a like o, and that is the true pronunciation: but those who see analogy so openly violated, ought to be assured of the certainty of the custom before they break through all the laws of language to conform to it (69) (71). See Superable.
455.	We have seen, in a great variety of instances, the versatility of s, how
frequently it slides into the sound of z: but my observation greatly fails me if it ever takes the aspiration, unless it immediately follows the accent, except in the words su^e, sugar, and their compounds ; and these irregularities are sufficient without adding to the numerous catalogue we have already seen under this letter.	...
456.	The analogy we have just been observing directs us in the pronuncia-
tion of usury, usurer, and usurious. The two first have the accent on the first syllable, which permits the s to go into aspiration, as if the words were written uzhury and uzhurer: but the accent being on the second u in the last word, the * is prevented from going into aspiration, and is pronounced uzurious. (479) (480).	^
457.	Though the ss in passion, mission, 8ec. belong to separate syllables, as if spelt passion, mission, Sec. yet the accent presses the first into the same aspiration as the last, and they arc both pronounced with the sharp aspirated hiss, as if they were but one s. See Exaggerate.
458.	S is silent in isle, island, aisle, demesne, puisne, viscount, and at the end of some words from the French, as has, sous, vis-a-vis; and in corps the two last letters are silent, and the word pronounced core. (412).
T.
459.	7* is the sharp sound of D (41); but though the latter is often changed into the former, the former never goes into the latter. The sound to which this letter is extremely prone is that of 8. This sound of t has greatly multiplied the hissing in our own language, and has not a little promoted it in most modem tongues That p, and by t and d, k and g hard, * and z, should slide into each other, is not surprising, as they are distinguished oniy by a nice shade of sound; but that t should alter to s seems a most violent transition, till we sonsider the organic formation of these letters, and of those vowels which always occasion it. If we attend to the formation of t, we shall find that it is a stoppage of the breath by the application of the upper part of the tongue near the end, to the correspondent part of the palate, and that if we just detach the tone^ie from the palate, sufficiently to let the breath pass, a hiss is produced which forms the letter s. Now the vowel that occasions this transition of t to s is the squeezed sound of e, as heard iny consonant (8): which squeezed sound is a spccies of hiss; and this hiss, from the absence of accent, easily slides into the «, and s as easily into sh: thus mechanically is generated that hissing termination
which forms but one syllable, as if written shun. (195).
450.	But it must be carefully remarked, that this hissing sound, contracted by the t before certain diphthongs, is never heard but after the accent: when the accent falls on the vowel immediately after the t, this letter, like s or c in the same situation, preserves its simple sound: thus the c in social goes into sh, because the accent is on the preceding vowel; but it preserves the simple sound of s in society t bccause the accent is on the succeeding vowel.
