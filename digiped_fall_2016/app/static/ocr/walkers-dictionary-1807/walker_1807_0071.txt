DIFFERENT SOUNDS OF THE DIPHTHONG EI. lxv
fie. At any rate the difference is but very trifling, and I shall therefore conr sider ce as equivalent to the long open e.
247.	This diphthong is irregular only in the word breeches, pronounced as if written britches. Cheesecake, sometimes pronounced chizcakt, and bra ch, bi itchy 1 look upon as vulgarisms. Beelzebuby indeed, in prose, has generally the short sound ot r, as in btU: and when these two letters iorm but one syllable, in the poetical contraction of e'er and ne'er, for ever and never, they are pronounced as if written air and nair.

248.	The general sound of this diphthong seems to be the same as ey, when under the accent, which is like long slender a; but the other sounds are so numerous as to require a catalogue of them all.
249.	Ki has the sound of long slender a in deign, vein, rein, reign, feign feint, rei/j hrmcus, hei r, heiress, inveigh, weigh, neigh^tkein, reins, their, (heirs, eight yfr eighty vxight, neighbour, and their compounds. Whengh comes after this diphthong, though there is not the least remnant of the Saxon guttural sound, yet it has not exactly the same simple vowel sound as when followed by other consonants; eiy followed by gh, sounds both vowels like a e ; or if we could interpose the y consonant between the a and t in eight, weight, &c. it might, perhaps, convey the sound better. The difference, however, is so delicate as to render this distinction of no great importance. The same observations are applicable to the words itruight, straighten, kc. See the word Eight.
250.	FA has the sound of long open e in here, in the following words and their compounds: To §eil, ceiling, con ceit, deceit, receipt, conceive,perceive, deceive, receive, inveigle, seize, scisin^seignior, seigniory, seine, plebeian. Obeisance ought to be in the preceding class. See the word.
251.	Leisure is sometimes pronounced as rhyming with pleasure; but, in my opinion, very improperly: for if it be allowed that custom is equally divided, we ought, in this case, to pronounce the diphthong long, as more expressive of the idea annexed to it. (241).
252.	Either and neither are so often pronounced eye-ther and mgh-ther, that it is hard to say to which class they belong. Analogy, however, without hesitation, gives the diphthong the sound of long open rather than that of i. and rhymes them with breather, one who breathes. This is the pronunciation Mr. Garrick always gave to these words; but the true analogical sound of the diphp^ thong in these words is that of the slender a, as if written aether and nay-ther. This pronunciation is adopted in Ireland, but is not favoured by one of our orthcepists; for Mr. Sheridan* Mr. Scott, Mr. Elphjnston. Mr. Perry, Mr. Smith, Steel’s Grammar, and Dr. Jones, all pronounce these words with the diphthong like long e. W. Johnston alone adopts the sound of long i exclusively ; Dr. Kenrick gives both ether and ithery but prefers the first, but give* nnther the sound of long e exclusively: Mr. Coote says these words are generally pronounced with the ei like the i in mine. Mr. Barclay gives no description of the sound of ei in either, but says neither is sometimes pronounced nither, Mid by others nether ; and Mr. Nares says, “ either and neither are spoken by
some with the sound of long i; I have heard even that of long a given to
*	them; but as the regular way is also in use, I think it is preferable. These u differences seem to have arisen from ignorance of the regular sound *f ei.39 If by the regular way and the regular sound of this diphthong Mr. Narea means the long sound of e, we need only inspect No. 249 and 250 to see tfrat
