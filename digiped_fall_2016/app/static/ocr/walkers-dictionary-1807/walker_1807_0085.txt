PRONUNCIATION OF THE CONSONANT D.
lxxix
which* by the assistance of the Rhyming Dictionary, I am enabled to give as, perhaps, the only words in the language in vrhich the ed is pronounced as a distinct syllable in the adverb, where it is contracted in the participial adjecti.e : Forcedly, enforcedly, unv,eilrdlu, d*fonnedly, ftignedly, unf ignedly, di$-cemediy, resignedly, refinediy, restrainedhj, cmcemedly, unconcernedly, discernedly, unducrmedlu) firrfiarediyy awiredlu, advisedly, dixpersedly, diff^sedly, cr)>fiisedly, uitfi rcriv dLj, resolvedly, deservedly, undeservedly, resemedly, unreservedly, avow* tdly,pe plcxr diy, fixedly, amazedly.
3oj. To this catalogue, may be added several abstract substantives formed from participles in ed : which r,d makes a distinct syllable in the former, though oot in die i otter, thus: numbedn ss, blarednesa, preparedness, assuredness, dis-taicdnes*, advisedness, rtp.nednens, c .mpjsedness, indixpj&edncss, diffusedness, con-fusedn^distrcsjedness, resdvedness, rcservedness, perplexedness, fixedness, amaz-mLcm, have ed pronounced distinctly.
566. The adjectives nak d, wick d, tiirked (pointed), hooked, crooked, forked, fwfci, tr*6H dy and wretched, ure not derived from verbs, and are therefore pronounced in two syllables. The. same may be observed of scabbed, crabbed^ ckuhhed, stubbrdi shagged, snagg-d, rugged, c^abb^d, scrubbed, dgged, rugged, tcragged, hawked, jagged; to which we may add the solemn pronunciation of tiijftiecktd i and these, when* formed into nouns by the addition of ness, preserve the ed in a distinct syllable, as wickedness, scabbed;toss, raggedness, &c.
367.	Passed, in the sense of beyond, becomes a preposition, and may allowably be written hast, as past twelve Jcl.ck: but when an adjective, though it is pronounced in one syllable* it ought to be written with two, as passed pUmnres are present pai : this I know is contrary to usage ; but usage is, in this case, contrary to good sense, and the settled analogy of the language
368.	It needs scarcely be observed, that when the verb ends in t or rf, the ed in the past time and participle has the d pronounced with its own sound, and always forms an additional syllable, as landed, matted, btc. otherwise the final d could not be pronounced at all.
36 h And here perhaps it may not be useless to take notice of the very imperfect and confused idea that is given in our best grammar, of what are called contracted verbs, such as snatcht, check t, snupt, inixt, d v It and past, for snatched, cheeked, snapped, mixed, dw il^d, and passed. To these are added* those that end in
I,	»,and n, or ft, after a diphthong; which either shorten the diphthong, or change it into a single vowel; and instead of ed take t only for the preterit, as dealt* dreamt, meant,frit, slept, crept; and these are said to be considered not as irregular, but contracted only. Now nothing cm be clearer than that verbs of a very different kind are here huddled t9gcther as of the sime. Snatched, checked, snapped, mixed, and passed, are not irregular at all; if they are ever m'iUci\snatcht,checkt,snapi, fw.\r/,and post, it is from pure ignorance of analogy- and not considering that if they were written with ed, unless we were to pronounce it as a distinct syllable, contrary to the most settled usage of the language, the pronunciation, from the very nature of the letters, must be the same. It is very different with dwelled; here, as a liquid, and not a shai'p mute, ends the verb, d might be pronounced without goin^ into : just as well as in f It’d, the participle of to fell (to cut down trees). Here then we find custOTi h is determined an irregularity, which cannot be altered. *ithoiK violence to the ian,;u-tre-; dw U may be truly called an irregular verb and dwr*t the preterit i^j ticiple.

370.	The same may be observed oi d a! i*' am, m an,feel,we~p. sle:fi, and creep. It is certain we can pronounce d after the four first of these words, as well as in
