AIL our orthoepists agree in placing the accent on the second syllable of intercaiar and intercalate; and Mr. Sheridan, Dr. Ash, Mr. Perry, Buchanan, Barclay, and Entick, place it on the same syllable in biterctUary .• but Dr. Kenrick, W. Johnston, and Bailey, on the third. This latter pronunciation is certainly more agreeable to the ear; and as it is derived from the Latin intercaiari*, a word of Ae same number of syllables with the penultimate long, it should seem we ought to place the accent on the same syllable on the English word (503); but as our language absolutely forbids Mata lagrthe stress on the a
bill!	p6&ndMin, this.
m this termination (513), I see no reason why we should not place it on the preceding syllable, especially as live termination is not enclitical (513)r and therefore does not renuire the accent on the coniunctivc part or the word (see Academy). Th® accent on the third syllable, therefore, j*s it clashes with no analog}’, and is so much more agreeable to the ear, ought, in my opinion, to be adopted.
