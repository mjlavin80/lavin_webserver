|^/* This word is sometimes pronounced as if written hog-shed: if Dr. Johnson’s derivation of this word from hog and head be a true one, this pronunciation is certainly wrong-, and arises from the junction of the letters s and h in printing, which may be presumed to have occasioned a similar mispronunciation in household and falsehood, which see. Junius derives this word from the Belgic Odhhood, ogshood, or hockshoot. Minshe w, says Skinner, derives it from Ockshood and Ogshood i but he himself is of opinion that it rather comes from the L'atin Orta, a great sea-fish, an enemy to the whale, and the Belgic hoofd, as much as to say, Ork's hoofd; that is, Qrcce caput, an Ork** head.	*
