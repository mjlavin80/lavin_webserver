Ix*iv DIFFERENT SOUNDS OF THE DIPHTHONGS OF, Sec.
it certain that crossing this tendency would produce any real advantage; at least, not sufficient to counterbalance the diversity of pronunciation which must for a long time prevail, and which n>ust necessarily call off our attention from things to words., See Enciitical Termination,'(No. 514).
OY.
329. This diphthong is but another form for w, and is pronounced exactly like it. When aUjy is written with this diphthong, it ought never to be pronounced allay. Custom seems to have appropriated the former word to the noun, and the latter to the verb; lor the sake of consistency, it were to be wished it were always written allay: but it is not to be expected that poets will give up so good a rhyme to joy, cloy, and destroy.	.
330 The only word in which this diphthong is not under the accent, is the proper name Savov; for savoy, a plant, has the accent on the second syllabic ; but the diphthong in both is pronounced in the same manner.
-	UA.
331.	When the a in this diphthong is pronounced, the u has the power of which unites both into one syllable: thus antiquate,antiquary, assuage, persuade, equal lung age* kc. are pronounced antibivate- autibivary, assii'age, &c.
332.	The u in this diphthong is si lent, m g>ard, guardian, guaranteeing piquant; pronounced gard, gardiaiu garantee, and pickant. (92).
333.	In Mantua, the town of Italy, both vowels are heard distinctly. The same may be observed of the hubit so called: but in mantuamaker vulgarity has sunk the a% and made it iqantumukrr. The same vulgarity at first, blit now sanctioned by universal custom, has sunk both letters in victuals, and its compounds victualling and victualler, pronounced* vittles, xittling, and vittlcr, See Mantua,
•	UE.	-
334.	This diphthong like ua, when it forms only one syllable, and both letter* are pronounced, has the u sounded like iv; as comue tude, desuetude, and wansuetude^ which are pronounced conswetude. deswetud^, and manswetude. ThusrcwowrvMs pronounced according to the general rule, as if written co?ikzvest; but the verb to c<>n- ur> has unaccountably deviated into conk?', particularly upon the stagr. This error, however, seems not to be so rooted in the general ear as to be alx>ve correction; and analogy undoubtedly demands conknver.
335.	This diphthong, when in a final syllable, sinks the e, as clue. cite, due* blue* glufyfntT'^fiury • ik«ue, true, mue, acc ur, entiue, endue* imbue. iwbt'ue*pursue, subdue, fierduc.a'gue, residue*avetiur, "evrnue*con‘inue,retinue,construe,statye* tis*ue*issue, virtue, valw , ag tr; in all these words, whether the accent be on the diphthong u? or not, it is pronounced like long open u, except in words where the r conies before u; in this case it is sounded like oo. When the accent is not on this diphthong a* in the latter portion of these words from a gtie, it is apt to be feeb’y and indistinctly pronounced, and therefore care ought to be taken to you:*'! it.as if these words were written q’Kw* residew', &c.
