()£}• This word was formerly always accented on the second syllable ; but the antepenultimate accent to which our language is so prone in simples of three syllables, has so generally obtained as to make it doubtful to which side the best usage inclines, Dr. Johnson, Sheridan, Ash, Kenrick, Nares, Bailey, and Fenning, accent the second syllable j and Buchanan, W. Johnston, Perry, Barclay and Entick, the first. Scott accents both, but prefers the first. In this case, then, analogy ought to decide for placing the accenton the first syllable. See Principles, No.535, and the word Revenue.
