K3TT ’hertinthis word seems floating between I long* and short quantity, as it was in the Latin Fubrica. I have, like Mr. Sheridan, made it short; for though Latin words of two syllables, when adopted into English, always hare the accent on the first, and the / vowel generally long, as basis,focus, quota, &c. wlten words of three syllables in Latin, with but one consonant in the middle,
are anglicised by reducing them to two syllables ; as the penultimate in such Latin words is generally short, and the accent of consequence antepenultimate, the first vowel in the English word is generally short from the shortening power of the antepenultimate accent in our pronunciation of the Latin word from whence it is derived ; thus the Latin Mimicut, reduced to the English Mimic, has the first vowel short, though long in Latin, because we think it short in our pronunciation of Latin: the same may be observed of the wordsJJaridy vivid, and livid, from the La-tinfioridustvividKSfOnd /rt?«A/*.Thus,though Fabrica might have the first vowel long in Latin, yet as we always pronounce it short in the English pronunciation of that language, so, when it is reduced to the English Fabric, it seems more agreeable to this usage to make tiie first syllable short.
Authority seems likewise to favour this pronunciation ; for Mr. Sheridan, Mr.Elphin-ston, Mr. Nares, Mr. Scott, Mr. Perry ,and, as far as we can judge by the position ofthe accent, Bailey, are for the a short; and Buchanan, W. Johnston, and, if we can guess by accent, Dr. Ash and Entick, for the long a. See Principles, No. 544.
To Fabrick, f&b'rlk. v. a. To build, to form, to construct.
