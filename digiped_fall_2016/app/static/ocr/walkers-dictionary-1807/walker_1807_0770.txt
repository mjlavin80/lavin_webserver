em constellation. xj* I have preferred those orthoepists who mark these words as 1 have done, to Mr. Sheridan, who makes the first syllable like the verb to ply. Dr. Kenrick, Mr. Scott and Perry, the only orthdepists from whom we can know the sound of the diphthong ei9 give it as I have, done; and Johnson, by placing the accent after the e, seems to have done the same : but the sound we invariably give to these vowels in Plebeian, is a sufficient proof of English analogy; and that pronouncing them like eye, is an affectation of adhering to the Greek, from which Pleiades is derived.— See Key to the Classical Pronunciation of Greek and Latin Proper Names, under the word.	v
