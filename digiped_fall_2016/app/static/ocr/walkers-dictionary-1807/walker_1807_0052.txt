DIFFERENT SOUNDS OF THE LETTER /.
die. A corrupt, foreign manner of pronouncing these words, may sometimes mince the i into e, as if the words were written de-amcter, de-urrud, tec.; but this is disgusting to every just English ear, and contrary to the whole current of analogy. Besides, the vowel that ends and the vowel that begins a syllable are, by pronouncing the i long, kept more distinct, and not suffered to coalesce, as they are apt to do if i has its slender sound. This proneness of the e, which is exactly the slender sound of i, to coalesce with the succeeding vowel, has produced such monsters in pronunciation as jogg^afihy and jommetry, for geograjihy and geometry, and j orgies for georgics. The latter of these words is fixed in. this absurd pronunciation without remedy ; but the two former seem recovering their right to four syllables; though Mr. Sheridan has endeavoured to deprive them of it, by spelling them with three. Hence we may observe, that those who wish to pronounce correctly, and according to analogy, ought to pronounce the first syllable of bi-ogra/ihy, as the verb to buy, and not as if written be-ografihy.
117.	When i ends an initial syllable without the accent, and the succeeding syllable begins with a consonant, the i is generally slender, as if written e. But the exceptions to this rule arc so numerous, that nothing but a catalogue will give a tolerable idea of the state of pronunciation in this point.
118.	When the prepositive hi, derived from bis (twice), ends a syllable immediately before the accent, the i is long and broad, in order to convey more precisely the specific meaning of the syllable. Thus bi-ca titular, bi-cifiilal, bi-ci/utous, bi-cornous, bi-cor/ioral, bi-dnital, bi-farious, bi-furcated, bi-linguous, bi-no-cular, bi-fiennatcd, bi-jictaluus, bi-quadrate, have the i long. But the first syllable of the words Bitumen and Bitumenous having no such signification, ought to be pronounced with the i short. 'I his is the sound Buchanan has given it; but Sheridan, Kenrick, and W. Johnston, make the i long, as in Bible.
119.	The same may be observed of words beginning with tri, having the accent on the second syllable. Thus tri-bunal, tri-corftoral, tii-chotvnry, trigin-tals, have the i ending the first syllable long, as in tri-at. To this class ought to be added, di-fietalous and di-lemma, though the i in the first syllable of the last word is pronounced like e, and as if written de-lanma, by Mr. Scott and Mr. Perry, but long by Mr. Sheridan, Dr. Kenrick, and Buchanan ; and both ways by W. Johnston, but placing the short first. And hence we may conclude, that the verb to bisect, and the noun bisection, ought to have the i at the end of the first syllable pronounced like buy, as Mr. Scott and Dr. Kenri(!k have marked it, though otherwise marked by Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Perry, and Buchanan.
120.	When the first syllable is chi, with the accent on the second, the i is generally long, as chi-rcgrical, c/ii-rurgic, rhi-rurgeon, rhi-rografihist, chi-rcgrafihcr, chi-rografihy. Chi-mcra and chi-merical have the i most frequently short, as pronounccd by Buchanan and Perry, though otherwise marked by Sheridan, Scott, W. Johnston, and Kenrick; and, indeed, the short sound seems now established. Chicane and ddcanery, from the French, have the i always short; or more properly slender.
121.	Ci before the accent has the i generally short, as ci-rilian, ci-vility, and, I think, ci-licious and ci-nerulent, though otherwise marked by Mr. Sheridan. Ci-barious and citation have the i long.
122.	CU before the accent has the i long, as cli-?nacter; but when the accent is on the third syllable, as in climacteric, the i is shortened by the secondary accent. See 530.
123.	Cri before the accent has the i generally long, as cri-mgerous, cri-terion ; though we sometimes hear the latter as if written cve-terion, but I think irnv* properly.
