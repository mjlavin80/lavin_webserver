!u the course of a •iitica) investigation of the powers of the letters in the foregoing Princi* pies, there is scarcely a word of any difficulty or diversity of sound which has not been noticed# and the true pronunciation, with the reasons and authorities tor it, pointed out; so that if the inspector should not meet with sufficient information in the Dictionary under the word, let him consult the Principles under the vowel, diphthong, or consonant, he wishes to be explained, and it is highly probable he will meet with the satisfaction he requires. Thus to know something more concerning the g in the word impugn, which some speakers pronounce and others suppress, lot him look into the Principles under the letter G, No. 386, and he will fiud additional observations to those in the Dictionary under the word. It is true that most of these donbt-ful, as well as other words, are referred to the Principles ; but if this reference should chance be omitted, it is hoped that this Advertisement will supply the deficiency.
