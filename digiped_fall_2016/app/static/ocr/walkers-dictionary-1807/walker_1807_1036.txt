■with jjrcat applause, from Skinner, derives from un pere ; in French, a father,— But whatever may be its derivation, one should think, in pronunciation it ought to class with empire .* ami yet wc find our orthoepists considerably divided in the sound of the last syllable of both these words.
Empire. Dr. Kenrick, Mr. Scott, W. John. sfon, and Mr. Perry, rhyme it "With fire; but Mr. Sheridan and Buchanan, with the first afpyr-a-vtid.
Umpire. Mr. Sheridan a:id W- Johnston rhyme it with fre; but Mr. Perry, Mr. Scott, and Buchanan* with fear; and Dr. Kenrick with the first of pyr-a-mid. ^
Amidst this variety and inconsistency we find a prcpondcrancy to the long sound of i, as in fire ; and this, in my opinion, is the most eligible.
Rampirc and Vampyre follow the same analogy ; and Satire, anti Samphire may be looked on as irregular.
Un, tin. A negative particle much used in composition. It is placed almost at will before adjectives and adverbs.
Mr. Mason has very justly observed, that “ one uniform effect is not always “ created by un prefixed. Thus the word “ unexprcssive (as used by both Sliak-
*	speare and Milton) is not barely made “ negative bv the composition, but is also changed from active to passive” To these observations we may add, that Shak-speare and Milton’s use of nnexpressiye for uncxpre&sible or inexpressible, is very licentious, and ought not to be followed. The Latin preposition in and the English un are sufficiently amb’guous without such unmeaning licenses ; which were introduced when the language was less studied; and perhaps merely to help out a hobbling line in poetry. The Latin preposition in is negative in insensible, and what is directly oppositeto it, is intensive in inflammatory. The English preposition un is privative in untried; and,if I may be allowed the word, retroactive, in to undo t a stick which has bern b< nt, may, when made straight, be said to he unbent; hut if it was previously straight, we cannot so properly say it is iino< ias that it is not bent.
