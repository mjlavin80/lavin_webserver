Interference, in-t£r-fe'r£nse. 9. An interposing, an intermeddling. ^ ^ fjr* There is a perfectly new pronunciation of this word, by placing the accent on the second syllable, which, from its singularity, bids fair for a reception among the minor criticks in pronunciation, especially when there are at first sight a few plausible analogies in its favour. Why, these „ criticks will say, should we not pronounce this word with the accent on the antepenultimate syllable, as well as conference, deference, preference, inference, and circumference, which it is evident are not formed from our verbs to confer, defer, &c. but
from the Latin conferene, deferent* &c. ? It may be answered, that as there is no Latin verb interfero, there is not the same reason for accenting this word on the antepenultimate syllable, as there is for the other words : and therefore forming interference from our own verb to interfere, seems preferable to the forming of a mungrel Latin word merely to avoid a formative of our own ; especially when we have so many words in a similar termination deriving their accent from the verb : as, defiance, from dtfy ; reliance, from rely ; assurance, from assurey 8cc. j and even in this termination condolence, from condole / and why not interference, from interfere ? Entick's is the only Dictionary in which I have found this very common and useful word; but as Dr. Johnson has not got it, this omission is easily accounted for.
