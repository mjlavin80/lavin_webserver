rj* There is a corrupt pronunciation of tnis word like the word slack. This is the word, as Dr. Johnson observes, from which it is evidently derived; but as it has acquired a distiuet and appropriated meaning, it is with great propriety that it differs a little from its original, both in orthography and pronunciation.	.
Atl our orthocpists unite in pronouncing this word regularly ; but, ai Mr. Smith observes, bricklayers and their labourer* universally pronounce it with the short a, as if written slack; and it may be added, that the corrected speakers, when using the participial adjective in the words uns acked lime, pronounce the a in the same manner; but this ought to be avoided.
