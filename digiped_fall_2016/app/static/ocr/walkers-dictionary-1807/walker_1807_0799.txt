OC/^ In compliance with so many authorities I placed the accent on the antepenultimate syllable of Interlocutor, and nearly the same authorities oblige me to place the accent on the penultimate ot this word; for so Dr. Johnson/ Dr. Kenrick, Dr. Ash, W. Johnston, Mr. Perr>, Buchanan, Barclay, Fenning, and Bailey, accent it.
