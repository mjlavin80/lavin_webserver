I had always supposed that the diphthong in this word and its* compound enfeoff was pronounced like the long open efbut upon inquiry into its actual pronunciation by the gentlemen of the law, found 1 ,had been in an errour; and though Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Scott mark feoff with the shojt e, they are in the same errour respecting enfeoff which they mark with the long e. Dr. Kenrick and Mr. Barclay are under the same mistake in feoff, by pronouncing the diphthong long; and Mr. Nares is wrong also
. ip pronouncing erf toff in the same manner.
Mr. Perry is the only one who is right in pronouncing the diphthong short in both. So much, however, had my ear been used, to the km^ sound of this diphthong, ^hat it escapcd|me in the word enfeoff and enfeoff vients which, to be consistent, I ought certainly to have marked with the short sound, as in feoff and feoffee.
