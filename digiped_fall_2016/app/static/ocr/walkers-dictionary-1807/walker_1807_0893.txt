OC/* I consider this wOrd as having altered its original accent on the second syllable, either by the necessity or caprice of the poets, or by its similitude to the generality' of words of this form and number of syllables (503), which generally have the accent on the first syllable. Dr. Johnson tells us it is accented by Shakspeare and Milton on the second syHable, but by Jon-son and Prior more properly on the first: and he might have added, as Shakspeare has sometimes done :
14 Ah me*! this sight of death is as a bell That warns my old age to its sepulchre."
Shakspeare.
u Go to thy lady’s grave and call her thence;
“ Or at tbe least in hers, sepulchre thine.”
Shakspeare.

“ Where merit is not sepulchred a\\v*?>

Tllou so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie,
“ That kings for such a tomb would wish to “ d>.”	Milton.
To accent this word on the second syllable, as Shakspeare and Milton have done, is agreeable to a very general rule, that when we introduce into our own languages word from the Greek or Latin, and either preserve it entire, or the same number of syU

lables; in this case we preserve the accent on the same syllable as in the original word. This rule has some exceptions, as may be seen in the Principle*, No. 503, («,) butha* still a very griat extent. ,Now sepulchrum* from which this word> is derived, has the accent on the second syllable ; and sepulchre ought to have it on the same; while sejtvft’ire, on the contrary, being formed from sep'iUura, by dropping a syllable the accent removes to the first, (see Academy). As a confirmation that the current -pronunciation of Sepulchre was with the accent on the second syllable, every old inhabitant of linden can recollect always having heard the Church called by that name so pronounced : but the antepenultimate accent seems now so fixed as to make an alteration hopeless. Mr. Forster, in hi$ Essay on Accent and Quantity, says that this is the common pronunciation of tbe present day; and Dr. Johnson, Mr. El-phinstan, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Scott, Dr.. Kenrick, Dr. Ash, iMr. Perry, Barclay, Entick,'and W. Johnston, place the accent on the first syllable both of this word and sepulture. Fenning places the accent ou the second syllable of Sepulchre when a noun, and on the first when a verb. Mr. Sheridan very properly reverses this order: W. Johnston places the accent qn the second syllable of Sepulture ; and Bailey on the second of both. All our orthoepists place the aeceyt on the second syllable of sepulchral, except Dr. Ash and Barclay, who place it upon the same syllable as in Sepulchre j and the uncouth pronunciation this accentuation produces, is a fresh proof •of tl>e impropriety of the common accent* (493).
