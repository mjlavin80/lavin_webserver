QCj* Mr. Sheridan and Dr. Ash accent thU word on the second syllable; but Dr. Johnson, Dr. Kenrick, Mr.Barclay,Bailey, and Buchanan, on the last. These authorities induced me, in the first edition of this Dictionary, to place the accent on the last syllable; but, upon farther inquiry, I found the best usage decidedly in favour of the antepenultimate accent; and as the secondary accent is on the second syllable of the Latin Hypotenuta, this accentuation seems most agreeable to analogy.—See Academy ana Incomparabls.

Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Scott, Mr. Entick, W. Johnston, and Buchanan, pronounce this word in the second manner; Dr. Kenrick, Dr. Ash, and Mr. Perry, in the first. To pronounce the y long before double # is contrary to every rule in spelling; and therefore if the first mode be not the best, the orthography ought necessarily to be changed.

dj* It may be remarked, that the frequent use of this letter in our old dramatic writers instead of Ay, is a proof that our ancestors pronounced I much broader than we do at present, and somewhat approaching to the sound it has at this day4n the north of England.—See Directions to Foreigners prefixed to this Dictionary.
