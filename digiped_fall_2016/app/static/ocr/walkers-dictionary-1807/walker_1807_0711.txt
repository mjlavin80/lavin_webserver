GC? What was observed of the e in Efface is applicable to the o in the first syllable of this word. From the tendency of the vowel to open, when immediately preceding the accent, we find ele^an^ speakers sometimes pronounce the in occasion, offend, ojficioui, &c. as if written o-casion, ojrnd,	&c. This seems to be one
of those *l faults true critics dare not “ mend.”. But as it is an evident deviation from the orthography, I have not dared to mark these words in this manner. See Efface. It must, however, be remarked, that this deviation only takes place before double cin the word occasion and its compounds.
