. ’* prove the pfopriity of our elocution. As therefore, there are certain deviations fro«h analogy whic^are not at any rate tolerable, there are others which only, as it were, tarnish the pronunciation, and make it. less brilliant and agreeable There are few who h%ve turned their thoughts qn this subject, without observing that they sometimes pronounce the same wort or syllable in a different manner; and as jieither of these manners offend the ear, they are at a loss to which they shall give the preference; but as one must necessarily be more agreeable to the analogy of the language than the other, a display of these an^lnRif.gt a £)ic_ tionary of this kind, will immediately remove this uncertainty ; and in this view of the variety we shall discover a fitness in one mode of speaking, which will give a firmness and security to our pronunciation, from a confidence that it is founded on reason, and the general tendency of the language. See Principles, No. 530-547j 551) 8cc.
But, ala&! reasoning on language, however well founded, may be all overturn# ed by a single quotation from Horace:
«	■	------usus,
“ Quem penes arbitrium est, & jus & norma loquentli.”
This, it must be owned, is a succinct way of ending the controversy; and, by virtue of this argument, we may become critics in language, without the trouble of studying it: not that I-would be thought, in the most distant manner, to deny that Custom isjthe sovereign arbiter of language; far from it. I acknowledge its authority, and know there is no appeal from it. I wish only to dispute, where this arbiter has not decided; for, if once Custom speak out, however absuixily, I sincerely acquiesce in its sentence.
But what is this custom to which we must so implicitly submit? Is it tha usage of the multitude of speakers, whether good or bad? This has never been asserted by the most sanguine abettors of its authority. Is it the usage of the studious in schools and colleges, with those of the learned professionsTor that of those who, from their elevated birth or station, give laws to the refinements and elegancies of a court ? To confine propriety to the latter, which is too often the case, seems an injury to the former; who, from their very pro-
•	fession, appear to have a natural right to a share, at least, in the legislation of language, if not to an absolute sovereignty. The polished attendants on a throne are as apt to depart from simplicity in language, as in dress and manners ; and novelty, instead of custom, is too often the jus & norma loquendi of a court.
PerXaps an attentive observation will lead us to conclude, that (lie usage which oujht to direct us, is neither of these we have been enumerating, taken singly but a sort of compound ratio of all three. Neither a finical pronunciation of the court', nor a pedantic Graecism of the schools, will be denominated respectable usage, till a certain number of the general mass of speakers have acknowledged them ; nor will a multitude of common speakers authorize any pronunciation which h reprobated by the learned and polite.
As those sounds, therefore, which are the most generally received among the learned and polite, as well as the bulk of speakers, are the most legitimate, we may conclude that a majority of two of these states ought always to concur, in order to constitute what is called good usage.
But though custom, when general, is commonly well understood, there arc several stares and degrees of it which are exceedingly obscure and equivocal • an* the only method of knowing the extent of custom in these cases, seems to he an inspection of those Dictionaries which professedly treat of pronunciation We have now so many works of this kind, that the general current of custom
