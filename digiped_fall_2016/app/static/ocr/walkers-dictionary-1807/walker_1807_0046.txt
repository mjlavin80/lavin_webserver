DIFFERENT SOUNDS OF THE LETTER it
which I have found the most difficult to appreciate, is that where it ends the -syllable, either immediately before or after the accent. We cannot give it any of its three open sounds without hurting the ear: thus in pronouncing the words abound and diadem, ay-bound, ab-bound, and aw-bound; di-ay-dem, di-ah-dem and di-aw-dem, are all improper; but giving the a the second or Italian sound, as ah-bound and di-ah-dem, seems the least so For which reason I have, like Mr. Sheridan, adopted the short sound of this letter to mark this unaccented a: but if the unaccented a be final, which is not the case in any word purely English, it then seems to approach still nearer to the Italian a in the last syllable of papa, and to the a in father ; as may be heard in the deliberate pronunciation of the words idea, Africa, Delta, &c. (88). See the letter A at the beginning of the Dictionary.
E.
93.	The first sound of e is that which it has when lengthened by the mute e final, as in glrbe, theme, &c. or when it ends a syllable with the accent upon it, as se-crc-tion, ad-he-sion, See. (36).
94.	The exceptions to this rule are, the words where and there; in which the first e is pronounced like a, as if written whare, thare; and the auxiliary verb were, where the c has its short sound, as if written wer, rhyming with the last syllable of prefer, and ere (before), which sounds like air. When there is in composition in the word therefore, the e is generally shortened, as in were, but in my opinion improperly. *
95.	The short sound of e is that heard in bed, fed, red, wed, &c.; this sound before r is apt to slide into short u ; and we sometimes hear mercy sounded as if written murcy: but this, though very near, is not the exact sound.
Irregular and unaccentcd Sound#.
96.	The e at the end of the monosyllables be, he, me, we, is pronounced ee, as if written bee, hee, See. It is silent at the end of words purely English, but is pronounced distinctly at the end of some words from the learned languages, as epitome, simile, catastrophe, apostrophe, &c.
97.	The first e in the poetic contractions, c9cr and nz'er, is pronounced like a, as if written air and nair.
98.	The e in her is pronounced nearly like short u; and as we hear it in the unaccented terminations of writer, reader, &c. pronounced as if written writur, readur, where we may observe that the r being only on a jar, and not a definite and distinct articulation like the other consonants, instead of stopping the vocal efflux of voice, lets it imperfectly pass, and so corrupts and alters the true sound of the vowel. The same may be observed of the final e after r in words ending in ere, gre, tre, where the e is sounded as if it were placed before the r, as in lucre, maugre, theatre, &c. pronounced lukur, maugur, theatur, &c. See No. 418. It may be remarked, that though we ought cautiously to avoid pronouncing the e like u when under the accent, it would be rdmis Attice, and border too much on affectation of accuracy to preserve this sound of e in unaccented syllables before r ; and though terrible, where e has the accent, should never be pronounced as if written turrible, it is impossible without pedantry to make any difference in the sound of the last syllable of splendour and tender, sulphur and suffer, or martyr and garter. But there is a small deviation from rule when this letter begins a word, and is followed by a double consonant with the
