      Assignment Description:
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Portfolios play many roles in academic and professional life. As we have discussed in class, artists, architects, writers, and teachers make use of the genre. This is especially true for creators of digital media. In "Creating Your Own Showcase," Carolyn Handler Miller elaborates:
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     A well thought out 'calling card' of original work illustrates what your special talents are, where your creative leanings lie, and  also reveals something about who you are as  a  person.  A  showcase  of  original  work  also  bears  a  powerful  subtext:  you  are serious enough about working in this field to spend your own time putting together a  demonstration  of  your  work.  It  carries  the  message  that  you  are  energetic, enterprising, and committed.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     Miller describes the importance of a digital portfolio to aspiring professionals. She also discusses why you should think about purpose and audience when designing a showcase of work.
    </p>
    <p>
     For this assignment, you will assemble a portfolio that represents your hard work and growth over the semester. Building on the static website you have been making all term, you will submit a written reflection and revised samples of your work. This assignment also asks you to assemble the materials as a cohesive whole. As a result, the design and composition of your digital portfolio will draw on the very same strategies that youâ€™ve been practicing all term.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Reflection Essay: 1,000-1,200 words
    </h3>
    As with previous reflections, this written portion of the assignment should read like a personal essay (Saying "I" is encouraged) and, at some point in the reflection, you should address your development as a writer/maker over the semester. This reflection should be specific and supported with examples from your work. Provide a general overview of your work this term, what issues or ideas recur your work, what you expect from your imagined audience and how they might react to your portofolio as a whole, and how any recurring techniques or topics are important to your work. Subjects such as the interplay between content and process; multimodality and modal considerations; and affordances of the medium were central to the class, so I strngly recommend addressing them with at least a few quotations from the readings. The same goes for thematic topics from our weekly clendar: emphasis, expectations, indirect expression, invocation, structure, meaning, iteration, access, and dialogue.
    <h4>
     Additional Points to Raise
    </h4>
    <ul>
     <li>
      How do you define revision? What steps have you taken to revise for different audiences and contexts?
     </li>
     <li>
      To what degree does the target audience, purpose, or context impact the work in your portfolio?
     </li>
     <li>
      What role(s) has peer review played in your development  as a reader, writer and thinker?
     </li>
     <li>
      What do you consider to be the most important components to your writing process? Why? Has that changed over the course of the quarter?
     </li>
     <li>
      How do you edit? What considerations figure into your editing?
     </li>
     <li>
      Describe your approach to writing in different genres.
     </li>
     <li>
      What individual goals did you have for your reading and writing this term? What have you accomplished that you feel proud of? What would you like to continue to work on?
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
     Showcase of Revised Work with Short Reflections on Each: 150-200 words per item
    </h3>
    <p>
     For this component, select five samples of revised classwork submissions and work you turned in for major assignments. Each sample should correspond to a category below. Once you have made your selections, build a showcase of your selections into your individual website for the class. Each item that you include should be accompanied by a short reflection on the individual piece. Using two different examples from a project for two different questions is allowed. Using the exact same example for two questions from a project for two different questions is not permitted.
    </p>
    <h4>
     Selection Criteria and Questions to Address in Short Reflections
    </h4>
    <p>
     <b>
      1. An example of how you made a choice related to genre or audience.
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     If you had to reimagine this work in another genre, what would you choose? How would might user experience change if you made this change? How would you revise for an expert on your topic, or for someone who knew nothing about your topic?
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      2. An example of how you made a choice related to color, fonts, captions, scale, or other aspects of the visual mode.
     </b>
    </p>
    Discuss how you would change these design elements under different circumstances.
    <p>
     <b>
      3. An example of how you made a choice related to comparing one thing to another.
     </b>
    </p>
    Why did you choose this particular comparison? Would the comparison be more effective with more revisions? If so, what revisions?
    <p>
     <b>
      4. An example of something that frustrated you or took a larger amount of time than you would have liked.
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     How did you finally overcome this obstacle, or when did you know it was time to move on? What did you learn by facing this obstacle?
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      5. An example of something you are particularly proud of
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Why does this example stick out in your mind? How might you adapt what you like about it for future work?
    </p>
    <h3>
     Final Version of Your Website
    </h3>
    <p>
     Earlier in this assignment, description, I mentioned that you are required to assemble your materials as a cohesive whole. Here are some guidelines to explain what I mean:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      Web Design Strategy: How will your main website look at feel? How will these attributes reflect the version of yourself (persona) you are trying to present to an imagined public? Will the design of the final portoflio differ from the rest of the site?
     </li>
     <li>
      Rhetorical and Narrative Techniques: How will you use storytelling elements (e.g. plot, characterization, suspense, structure) or rhetorical devices (e.g. exhortation, appeal to logos) to shape the viewer/reader's experience of your work?
     </li>
     <li>
      Clicking Through Your Work: How will things like links, menus, and other display options provide choices for the user? How will help a confused user navigate the site/portfolio?
     </li>
     <li>
      Order of Items: I've provide a default order, but is it an arrangement that best showcases your talents? If not, how will you change it?
     </li>
     <li>
      Showing How You Revised: I've asked you to revise work in tandem with your portfolio. How will you use design, interface, rhetorical and narrative techniques to demonstrate that you've made significant edits to your work?
     </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
     Grading
    </h3>
    <p>
     I will use the course's primary descriptive, non-numerical rubric for this assignment. It includes the following criteria:
    </p>
    <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
