     <strong>
      Assignment Description:
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     The second Work-in-Progress Submission will be a revised and expanded version of an image (Photoshop) or sound (Audacity) project begun during one of our in-class activities. As with Work-in-Progress Submission 1, you will publish your revision on your Github Pages website. Since many of these classwork assignments were made with partners or in groups, there will be a stronger emphasis on how you have revised the work individually, perhaps even by moving past its original purpose to make something substantially new.
    </p>
    <h4>
     Revisions of Your Written Classwork
    </h4>
    <p>
     As with Work-in-Progress Submission 1, you should revise written components of your Github Pages website, especially, anything I marked as needing revision when I graded the last submission. Take a fresh look at your biography, your previous design concept, and prior revisions to  classwork assignments. You should also update your website with new media from classwork assignments that we did week 5 and after (since the previous submission only included work through week 4). Link in-class work to the main "Work in Progress 2" page, following the pattern established with the first assignment.
    </p>
    <h4>
     Written Reflection
    </h4>
    <p>
     As with Work-in-Progress Submission 1, you will submit a 750-1,000-word-long reflection on how you have approached in-class assignments so far for this class, how have you engaged in revision for this assignment, and how have you integrated web design principles into your website. Lastly, you should lay out a sense of direction for your own work. You are encourage to revisit what you wrote for the first submission and compare your thoughts now to what you wrote then. As with the previous reflection, this piece should read like a personal essay (Saying "I" is encouraged). The written reflection should be published under the main "Work in Progress 2" page, following the pattern established with the first assignment.
    </p>
    <h4>
     Grading
    </h4>
    <p>
     I will use the course's primary descriptive, non-numerical rubric for this assignment. It includes the following criteria:
    </p>
    <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
     <tbody>
      <tr>
       <th class="class=" col-xs-3="">
        Item
       </th>
       <th class="col-xs-9">
        Description
       </th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
       <td>
        Assignment Process:
       </td>
       <td>
        Evaluates whether students have followed directions properly. All materials are turned in on time and in the right place. Assignment directions are followed. Required components are all present and submitted on time.
       </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
       <td>
        Attention to Detail in Writing and/or Code:
       </td>
       <td>
        Language shows thought, precision, and control in word choice. Uses forms of grammar, punctuation, capitalization, spelling, and syntax that are appropriate for published work. Demonstrates careful attention to proofreading. For websites, links work properly, images display, all html tags terminate properly. Page design renders as intended.
       </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
       <td>
        Interface Functionality and Design:
       </td>
       <td>
        Interface is easy to navigate and aesthetically balanced. Appears to be designed with an overall vision or sense of purpose. Visual elements or interactives are clearly contextualized and show evidence of attention to design. Features that may seem out of place are well contextualized in written materials.
       </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
       <td>
        Synthesis of Form and Content:
       </td>
       <td>
        Digital functionality extends research in some way. Clear connections between design and subject matter. Approach conveys care and creativity. Work successfully imagines its audience and choices seem consistent with that audience. Elements that may seem out of balance are discussed in written materials.
       </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
       <td>
        Evidence of Effort:
       </td>
       <td>
        Supplementary statements and process assignments clarify and contextualize choices. Work shows no signs of last-minute, unresolved complications. Student has shown the professor drafts in office hours or during class.
       </td>
