<h3>Course Policies</h3>
<h4>Required Books</h4>
<p>There are three required books, but you can probably get away with buying only two of them, as <em>Digital Pedagogy</em> was an OpenBook Publication and therefore available online.
  I recommend buying a hard copy because I am secretly a luddite who hates computers. </p>

<h4>A Note on the Readings (and the field in general)</h4>
<p>Digital pedagogy isn't really a field, per se. It's actually more of a topical focus drawn from a many fields,
  some of which have interests and agendas that differ significantly from one another.
  There are several major paradigms of thought, and I have chosen to do my best to depict them with our course readings,
  which is to say that I've included readings that you and I might disagree with politically. Similarly, there's an issue of
  uneven quality (or scholarly rigor) in the discourses from which these readings are drawn.
  Pedagogical writing, in general, is like this. Some would argue that selecting readings
  for a course is in itself a tacit endorsement of those readings. I would agree in the sense that I'm endorsing these readings
  as important perspectives to know about, important voices to be aware of, but not always "good" or written with the goal of
  counting as top shelf scholarship. Differentiating and engaging with various types of discourse for various audiences is
  an important skill when studying digital pedagogy and digital humanities.</p>

<h4>Attendance:</h4>
<p>Since we only meet once per week and I have already structured the class to lose a week when I am out of town,
  I do not recommend making plans to miss any classes. Accommodations can be made in case of a legitimate emergency.</p>
<h4>Office Hours</h4>
<p>I will be in my office for regular office hours Mondays and Wednesdays, 1-3 p.m., beginning the week of 9-12-16.
  I won't have regular office hours next week because Monday is Labor Day and I just happen to have a big meeting next Wednesday.
  That said, I'm usually in my office much more often than my stated office hours would suggest, and I encourage you to drop by at your convenience.
  I'm also happy to meet with you by appointment. </p>
<h4>Pedagogy vs. Praxis</h4>
<p>Praxis is thought to be the synthesis of theory and craft. Many (including me) believe that theory needs to be informed by experience.
  This is especially the case in a pedagogical context, where theories of how one ought to teach often diverge significantly from how
  one is likely to teach when faced with limited time, resources, etc. This course is designed as a seminar and not a practicum, which is to say that
  our focus will be on the central ideas of digital pedagogy. We will strive to cover the broad social forces that inform digital pedagogy's historical development,
  as well as the major interventions in the field in past several years. Our hands-on assignments (e.g. teaching philosophy, lesson plan, skills) are
  meant to be supportive of our theoretical work. I believe that hands-on experiences will bolster the immediacy of our theoretical discussions and further,
  that these types of activities will help prepare you to teach with digital tools and methods.</p>
<h4>Sexual Harassment:</h4>
<p>The University of Pittsburgh will not tolerate sexual assault/sexual harassment. Complete details of the University’s Sexual
  Harassment Policy may be found and read in its entirety at http://www.provost.pitt.edu/information-on/antiharassment_statement.html.
  This policy provides a variety of individuals on each University of Pittsburgh campus who should be contacted with questions
  or concerns.
<h4>Plagiarism: </h4>
<p>You are expected to comply with the university’s policy on academic integrity.
  Anyone suspected of violating this obligation for any reason during the semester will be required to participate in the
  procedural process, initiated at the instructor level, as outlined in the University Guidelines on Academic Integrity,
  which can be found at www.fcas.pitt.edu/academicintegrity.html. Plagiarism is the use of someone else’s work without giving
  proper credit. Plagiarism is not tolerated by the university, so don’t do it. The minimal consequence of plagiarism
  in this course will be failure of the assignment with no opportunity to make it up.</p>
<h4>Disabilities:</h4>
<p>If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an accommodation, you are encouraged to contact both me
  and Disability Resources and Services, 216 William Pitt Union, 412-648-7890, 412-383-7355 (TTY), as early as possible in
  the term. DRS will verify your disability and determine reasonable accommodations for this course.</p>
