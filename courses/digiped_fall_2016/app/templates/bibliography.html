<h3>Thursday, November 17, 2016 and Thursday, December 1, 2016</h3>

<p>Tonight in class, we're going to begin the first half of a two-part activity. After last week's brainstorm session, I wanted to provide a way for us to engage more closely with the work of planning a lesson with critical making and team-based components. Since we've been using Zotero as a case study, I want us to stick with that but really push the envelop on integration of theory and practice. For this classwork project, we will work as a team and address the scenario below. The deliverable to this classwork assignment will be notes/brainstorming rather than a polished lesson plan. You may not cover every aspect of the prompt, but it will important to have a strong sense of what you have decided to address and what you have left unaddressed. You are encouraged to use class time tonight and during our next meeting to discuss ideas, take notes, explore and/or review some of the core skills listed below, and connect your ideas to our readings. We will break at the halfway mark (per usual) and wrap up our discussion by 8:40 so that we can talk about homework and other logistics.</p>

<p>Here's the scenario:</p>

<p>It's registration week and your team-taught course, "Programming for Humanists" isn't enrolling very well. You've been summoned before the program heads to argue for your course. If you fail to sway them, you're going to be reassigned as a grader for your arch Nemesis Zaphod Lecturely. In other words, the stakes are high and time is short. The program heads have asked you to come with teaching materials that demonstrate your approach to teaching code to students with no coding experience. They're skeptical but willing to be convinced that you deserve more time to find students.</p>

<p>You've decided to use materials from a unit that focuses on Zotero because they highlight your innovative approach to individual skills development, team-based learning, and critical making approaches. Heck, it even responds to critical conversations about universal design principles in an educational context. </p>

<h4>Some Priors</h4>
<ul>
        <li>You must articulate how you have covered the basics of managing citations using Zotero with a prior, more traditional assignment </li>
        <li>You want a method to ensure student competency Zotero before commencing the team-based project</li>
        <li>Ideally, you can explain how students have already been introduced to some basic Python programming concepts</li>
</ul>
<h4>Some Learning Goals</h4>
<ul>
<li>You'd like the assignment to reinforce the importance of careful “data curation” of a library of sources</li>
<li>Assignment scaffolding (or prior work) should cover the following skills</li>
<ul>
    <li>Setting up with an API key</li>
    <li>Accessing the Zotero API, traversing json in Python (and/or traversing python dictionaries)</li>
    <li>Articulating a research question that can be addressed by examining a collection of Zotero items at scale? </li>
    <li>Making a basic data visualization (pie chart, scatter plot, word cloud) in Python </li>
</ul>
<li>Some component of the project should be self-guided and individual </li>
<li>Students should work in teams to complete a task that would be difficult for any individual to complete in isolation</li>
<li>Students should feel like they have a way to weigh in if a team member doesn't pull their weight</li>
<li>You'd like the assignment to have multiple means of engagement, multiple means of representation, multiple means of action and expression</li>
<li>A final process assignment should ask students to write about the project using non-technical language</li>
</ul>
