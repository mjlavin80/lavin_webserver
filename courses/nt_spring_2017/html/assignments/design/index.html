      Assignment Description:
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     The idea of of this assignment is to stretch your creative side! How do story, characters, mechanics, and user experience come together to create an engaging video game?
    </p>
    <p>
     Imagine that you work for a video game company. Your team has two weeks to prepare a game concept for your board of directors. Everyone is flying in from corporate headquarters just to see you! The company is in a bit of financial trouble, and they need a big concept for a game to release by Christmas. Don't worry--this assignment doesn't involve giving an actual presentation to anyone! The goal here is to pretend like it's real so that your conversations are richer and more fruitful.
    </p>
    <p>
     In class for four sessions after spring break (3/14, 3/16, 2/21, and 3/23) you'll meet with your teammates and plan out the elements a brand new game. You'll engage in collective discussion and make plans as if this whole thing is real.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the assignment, you will use Inform 7 to flesh out your concept, make sample play-throughs, and effectively "wireframe" your game. Inform 7 is am interactive story game platform (to make games like Zork) so you will have to focus on things like setting, characters, and story. Don't worry if the Inform 7 version of your game is substantially different from the game you would ultimately want to make. This will give you more to write about in your reflection.
