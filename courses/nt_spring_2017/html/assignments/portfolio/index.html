     <strong>
      Collect, Unedited from Any Major Assignment:
     </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      One introductory paragraph (with thesis statement)
     </li>
     <li>
      One body paragraph that highlights a clear, central example
     </li>
     <li>
      One paragraph that you wish you could have proofread more carefully
     </li>
     <li>
      One sentence from the end of a paragraph and one sentence at the start of the next where a change in topic occurs.
     </li>
     <li>
      One sentence that has exceptional stylistic qualities but quite doesn't fit the assignment.
     </li>
     <li>
      One sentence that is too long, or unnecessarily wordy.
     </li>
     <li>
      One conclusion paragraph
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     For each of these, title the selection with the name of the assignment and the topic, like this:

     <strong>
      <blockquote>
       Introductory paragraph from videogame review:
      </blockquote>
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Each selection should be unique. Do not chose the same or overlapping items for more than one category.
