     <strong>
      For Each Collected Item, Discuss a Topic or Address a Question from Below:
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      A dataset that you manipulated or queried using Python
     </li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
     <li>
      How did your manipulation of the data change how an audience might interpret it?
     </li>
     <li>
      What is something that is lost in the process of making changes, and why that might this matter?
     </li>
     <li>
      Was there a different type of dataset you would have liked to have used? If so, why didn’t you? If you couldn’t find your ideal dataset, which do you think it was so difficult to find?
     </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
     An example of how you made a choice related to visualization type
    </li>
    <ul>
     <li>
      If you could convert this visualization to something else (bar graph vs. scatter plot, etc.), what would you choose?
  How would might user experience change if you made this change?
     </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
     An example of how you made a choice related to color, fonts, captions, scale, or other design elements
    </li>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Discuss how you would change these design elements under different circumstances, especially in terms of your imagined audience. How would you revise for an expert on your topic, or for someone who knew nothing about your topic?
     </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
     An example of how you made a choice related to comparing one thing to another
    </li>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Why did you choose this particular comparison? Would the comparison be more effective with additional revisions? If so, what revisions?
     </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
     An example of something that frustrated you or took a larger amount of time than you would have liked
    </li>
    <ul>
     <li>
      How did you finally overcome this obstacle, or when did you know it was time to move on? What did you learn, procedurally, from this obstacle?
     </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
     An example of something you are particularly proud of
    </li>
    <ul>
