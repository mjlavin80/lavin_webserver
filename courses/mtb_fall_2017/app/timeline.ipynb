It’s not only important to education but to cultural languages and communication as well. Since the invention of the typewriter and computers, cursive writing has lost its dominance. As it is no longer part of the educational curriculum core in most states because standardized tests are on computers, it may never regain its dominance. Cursive writing is a lost art form, a sacred style of penmanship, and an important part of our historical language that must be a mandatory part of education curriculum and everyday life. <a href='Option 1'>View Full Essay</a>},\n",

The term digital library was first made popular by the Digital Libraries Initiative of 1994 and even before this academic institutions had been at the forefront of creating digital repositories, with the eventual goal of these being made available to the general public through open access. While digital libraries have in some ways revolutionized the potential for access to texts and books, it also may have caused issues of its own, especially in academia. It may be creating a fundamental difference in how we read, but has brought us to a new era of freedom of access (and all the legalities that come with it) that have status barriers of its own that will, in all likelihood, keep it from becoming the downfall of the physical book.<a href=''''>View Full Essay</a>},\n",

      " 'text:' Some stories have the power to transcend time and culture. Before stories were written, they were passed down orally from generation to generation. The story of Beowulf, which was not written down until years after it was first told, may never be understood in its original context. It’s impossible to know which parts of Beowulf, if any, are based in fact, and which details emerged during the telling and retelling of the legend. Written versions of these stories offer clues to their origins. Many scholars believe that the re-occurrence of the flood story throughout Mesopotamia prove that it is built upon an age-old myth. This essay will explore how textual variance can lead one to interpret the great flood as either a shared myth, interpreted metaphorically, or a historical event based in fact. We will see that the answer is often ambiguous.<a href=''''>View Full Essay</a>},\n",

      " 'text:' The history of cursive writing cannot be defined as being invented on one specific date. Rather, cursive writing was developed over time where many civilizations contributed to its establishment. Cursive writing has shaped the way people write, learn, and think. It’s not only important to education but to cultural languages and communication as well. Since the invention of the typewriter and computers, cursive writing has lost its dominance. As it is no longer part of the educational curriculum core in most states because standardized tests are on computers, it may never regain its dominance. Cursive writing is a lost art form, a sacred style of penmanship, and an important part of our historical language that must be a mandatory part of education curriculum and everyday life. <a href='Option 1'>View Full Essay</a>},\n",

      " 'text:' Does the digital revolution signal the doom of printed texts? The term digital library was first made popular by the Digital Libraries Initiative of 1994 and even before this academic institutions had been at the forefront of creating digital repositories, with the eventual goal of these being made available to the general public through open access. While digital libraries have in some ways revolutionized the potential for access to texts and books, it also may have caused issues of its own, especially in academia. It may be creating a fundamental difference in how we read, but has brought us to a new era of freedom of access (and all the legalities that come with it) that have status barriers of its own that will, in all likelihood, keep it from becoming the downfall of the physical book.<a href=''''>View Full Essay</a>},\n",

      " 'headline:' Is the story of the great flood built on myth, or reality?,\n",
      " 'text:' Some stories have the power to transcend time and culture. Before stories were written, they were passed down orally from generation to generation. The story of Beowulf, which was not written down until years after it was first told, may never be understood in its original context. It’s impossible to know which parts of Beowulf, if any, are based in fact, and which details emerged during the telling and retelling of the legend. Written versions of these stories offer clues to their origins. Many scholars believe that the re-occurrence of the flood story throughout Mesopotamia prove that it is built upon an age-old myth. This essay will explore how textual variance can lead one to interpret the great flood as either a shared myth, interpreted metaphorically, or a historical event based in fact. We will see that the answer is often ambiguous.<a href=''''>View Full Essay</a>},\n",
