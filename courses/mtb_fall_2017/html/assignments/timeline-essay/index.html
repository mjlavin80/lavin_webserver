      Assignment Description:
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     A timeline is a well-regarded method for showing a series of events in chronological order. But what is an event, exactly, and what does it mean to delve into the rich history of that event? This is an assignment about the crucial process of deepening one’s understanding of the historical development of the book as we know it today. You will can choose a central event or development related to this subject and write an 850-1,000-word essay on that event (about five paragraphs). In the essay, you will cover the event’s most important details, its importance to the history of the book, and its complexities and nuances. Some potentially interesting topics that we’ve already discussed include Bi Sheng’s invention of movable type, the development of quoc ngu, the rise of the codex, and the destruction of the Great Library at Alexandria. Alternatively, you might decide to investigate the earliest known use of italics, the origin of the fountain pen, the invention of rotogravure, or the first ebook format. For part 2 of this assignment, will add our events to a digital timeline but, for now, the focus is on the depth and sophistication of our historical investigations.
