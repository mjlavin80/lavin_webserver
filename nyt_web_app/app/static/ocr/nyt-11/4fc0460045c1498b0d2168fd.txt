THE PRINCIPLES OF THE ADMINI8-TKATIVK LAW OF THE UNITED STATES. By Frank J. Good now. X.L.. D. New York:	G.	P.	Putnam's	Sons.	$3.
N O one else in America is so well qualified to. guide the student through-the mazes of the difficult subject of admin istfalive law as Prof. Goodnow. Some years ago he wrote a work on comparative administrative law which dealt with the administrative law of the principal European countries, as well as of the United States. The purpose of this volume is to accord to American administrative conditions fuller treatment than was possible in the earlier book.
The subject is one . upon which a vast deal may be written, yet Prof. Goodnow succeeds In the comparatively moderate compass of 4T»0 pages in. saying all that is really important. A glance at the ; table of contents indicates the scope .of the work. ' It is divided into a dumber of ! books, treating of- general subdivisions of ; the main subject, such as 4* Central Administration,” *' Local Administration,”
** Control Over the Administration,” &c.
The study of administrative law has until recently bc^n generally Ignored in the United States as well as in England, and even the possibility of. the' existence of such a science has been denied. This attitude of mind Prof. Goodnow attributes lo a narrow interpretation of administrative law, which, he says, exists and must exist " in all countries which have attained any political development worthy of the namo/’
Administration find administrative law have to do with ihe Governmental system in operation. Hence administrative law has to take account not merely of the formal Govern men till system' as provided for In Constitutions and charters, but also of those extra-legal conditions which have grown up and which so vitally influence the character of that system. The power and control of political parties, for example, is a subject not contemplated in the Constitution, but one of which administrative law has to take account.
By his masterly grasp of the subject and his power of lu<*id exposition Prof. Goodnow has rendered great service to students and administrative officers. He has also mad*: a distinct contribution to political science.
