One could have heard a pin drop in the Belasco Theatre last night while the Girl from the Golden West was playing a game of poker for the life of the man she loved. When she plucked a pair of aces from her petticoat, and her opponent—the Sheriff—threw down his hand with a confession that he was beaten, the sigh of relief that was heard all over the house indicated how keenly interested every man, woman, and child in the theatre was in seeing the girl win. That is the wonderful part of David Belasco,
In this newest effort he.has once again demonstrated his ability to accomplish the impossible. There was not a soul in that audience last night who did not know that the girl would win—there never was the least shadow of a doubt about it. But Mr. Belasco, with liis amazing faculty for creating illusions, for getting a very great deal out of a ver3* little, once again performed his wizard trick—and the illusion held us.
In ** The Girl of the Golden West ” he has taken the simplest sort of a love story—which after all is probably the best sort of a love story, when you come to think about it—he has taken characters that have been a part of romantic fiction and the romance of the theatre from time immemorial; lie- has even utilized as his chief dramatic situation one that in some form or another has always belonged to the common stock of playwrights; but so skillfully has he blended all these elements that the resultant play has all the freshness of a brand-new work- He has, in short, woven imo this oft-told tale the qualities which are sure to stimulate public curiosity, occasion discussion, and bring a popular success.
For two acts *• The Girl of the Golden West ” is melodrama—but it is tense, moving, absorbing melodrama. Then Cor a while its serious interest merges into scenes not so very far from burlesque. But it is most agreeable burlesque. And throughout it has one very manifest excellence; its characters seem true to life —not a life that most of us have ftnown, for the California ot “’40” is not the California of our experience, and we must take the^e people of Cloudy Mountain largely on faith/ take them in the spirit in which they have been revealed to* us, for instance, by Bret Harle.
Here we have upon the siage such figures as he* would have reveled in—chief among them Jack Ranee, Sheriff and gambler, carrying with him into the Sierras some of The courtly chivalry of h's native Louisiana—a gambler, it is true, but a man of boner, a “ gentleman ” as the word is understood at the foot of '‘Cloudy/’ which, be it said, is a somewhat different interpretation than that which obtains in place of more effete civilization.
But under the peculiar code of honor which prevails among these rough people, it is no wonder he is outraged when he discovers that the woman of his choice (he has a wife in New Orleans, by the way, but that is neither here nor there) has fallen in love with a road agent; no wonder that his professional desire to compass the man's capture is intensified. Nor it is unusual thar he agrees to leave the man’s fate and his own at the same time to, a iall of the cards. Credulity is perhaps strained a trifle throughout, but it is quite as true asNit ever was that truth is stranger than fiction, and in those far-away days in that land of strange, quick impulses we may well believe that truth was even stranger than it ever has been since.
Be this as it may, however, the character of Jack Ranee is splendidly, picturesquely, forcefully drawn, and each one of these qualifying words may be used to describe Prank Keenan’s interpretation of it. He reveals all these incarnated qualities, mingled with a peculiar, grim kind of philosophy, and a grimmer sort of sympathy. One remembers with especial satisfaction his illuminative facial expression in the final scene where hopelessness and sense of failure mingle with the shrewd intuition of the officer of the law—all quite simply conveyed without a single unnecessary movement of face or body, and wholly through the shifting glance of his eyes. He typifies the man whose business it is to be always completely under control, even to the intonation of his voice.* A more abslute repose than Mr. Keenan's as Jack Ranee can hardly be imagined.
Miss Bates's performance though generally excellent, was an uneven one. There were situations where she gripped her audience—such a moment occurs, for instance, in the second act. where the Sheriff finds blood on his handkerchief and discovers the whereabouts of her wounded lover. The tenseness of that scene was felt throughout the audience, which was so still that one could hear One's neighbor’s ^,*alch ticking. And once again she reaches the proper heights —In the last act where she realizes that the Sheriff has taken the road agent into custody, and that, far from going free, he is to be hanged.
But in the poker game scene she falls short of the possibilities, using a blend of the weakness ow a woman and the saccharine innocence of a child, where the situation would recm to call for all she has of strained and vital concentration. The note of childish innocence, in fact, seems a trifle strained from beginning to end. It is practically impossible to associate the quality of this girl of the Golden West, whose whole life is spent in the trbid association of the Polka saloon.
Mr. Hilliard’s playing of the road agent left much to be desired, but a particularly capable and interesting characterization was contributed by John W. Cope. J. H. Benrimo and Harriet Stirling contributed colorful bits as the Indians, who in this play are not conceived along very naturalistic lines. Considering the conditions under which they labored the two players of the rOIes did all that might be reasonably expected.
In respect to staging, David Belasco lias done nothing better than this latest play. Atmospherically suggestive throughout, there are occasional moments—as in the blizzard scene in the second act— where the sensitive and imaginative spectator is forced in spite of himself to share In the discomforts. The cabin interior of the second act is a masterpiece of scenic realism, full of correct minutiae.
It is worthy of note that as an added touch of naturalness or colorful ** atmosphere/* Mr. Be lasco has removed the huge baskets of roses which have always stood to right and left of the proscenium, close to the boxes, and has had substituted a growth of cacti on either side. This detail, and the preceding tableaus and the epilogue, (which, by the way, is beautiful to the eye but most unnecessary,) and the new descriptive curtain, are evidences of the thorough and artistic manner in which Mr. Bel^~co puts on a plav. But the moon in the first scene picture needs rehearsal.
