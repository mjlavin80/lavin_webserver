Reid won his title of Captain as a soldier
of the United States In oar war with
UTexico, -and . that while there he gained
much information from trappers and"
other wanderers of the "West, which then
included the region between the MIssIs-~ > ■ - . . ■' ■ sippi and the Pacific, and up to that time
Mexican territory, but afterward ours by
.conquest, diplomacy,, and ptlrchase. It
was little known to explorers, but" many
of its secrets had become familiar, to the hardy adventurers who haC penetrated Its wilds. Held met these men, acquired their confidence, and they told him many ' things, stories of the chase* of fights with Indians, legends of settlements that had heen made, had flourished for a time, and then disappeared from human ten. Communications were not \asy in those days, th* traveler had to go well armed, with a strong escort, to carry supplies with him, relying upon the chase for subsistence, and always running the risk of being ambushed and scalped, c From his own expedience *s a soldier, from observation as an amateur hunter, and from the wild and marvelous stories he heard, he found material for the tales with which he delighted the men and boys of more than fifty years ago. One of these, written, as he saye, for boys, was " The Desert Home,” relating the adventures of a wandering family from Kngland by way of Virginia, seeking a home in the West. They traveled with a caravan, which was attacked by Indians. Delayed by a breakdown, they stayed behind while the caravan went on to be wiped out by the savages. Left alone in what was afterward known on the maps as the Great American Desert, they lit upon a marvelous valley in that. desert, where they found shelter and abundant game, and, making It their home,'lived in comfort and solitude until the young people grew up. They are afterward discovered by a hunting party, one of whom was a relative of the valley dwellers. There is a little love story in the tale, but that is secondary.
Here truth was close to fiction. The hunters whom Reid had met, who had roamed over the great plains, and had penetrated the mountains of the Far West, had certainly seen the Tosemite, had described It to him, perhaps with ' some exaggeration, and out of what they told him grew the story of " The Desert Home." It was published before 1852; I know I read It in that year. To the grown man the story was wild and improbable; to the boy it was all true. It seems clear that Reid had heard descriptions of the wonderful valley, and worked them into his story. The Yosemito did not become fully known to the world until after the story was published. The hardy men who roamed the plains did not often come in contact with civilization, and they werej reticent concerning what they knew of their hunting grounds. They trusted Reid, and, while he may not have believed all they said to him, he certainly used their stories as material for his romances.	I
“ The White Chief ” b a weird tale o* j Spanish rapacity, cruelty, and misgovern- I mf:nt, which ended in the extinction of a settlement in what la now New Mexico, but which then formed part of the Spanish Province of Texas. Back of the tale, which is one of terror, there surely lies | a solid base of fact, for such ruined towns j have been discovered, abandoned by their former inhabitants, and a lively imagina- , tion could readily evolve a good story, if the scene and action were only suffi- i ciently remote fro* the days of telegraphs and well-made roads. There is 1 far more fact in Capt. Reid's stories than his readers imagined, and It-must have gratified him in his old age to have been so well vindicated by the results of exploration and the opening up of the country.
In 18G7, and subsequently, Capt. Reid was for a time the London correspondent of the Philadelphia Press, then owned and edited by John W. Forney.
