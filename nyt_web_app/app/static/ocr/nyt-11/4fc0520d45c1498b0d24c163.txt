AMERICAN INDUSTRIES.
THE INDUSTRIAL HISTORY OF* THB l:\ITED STATES. For High Schools and Colleges. By Katherine Coman, Ph. 3. New York: The Macmillan Company. ■
A SHORT Industrial History or the United States has long been needed. There are u number of special works on Industrial conditions In America, but it has been difficult, if not impossible, to find anywhere a succinct account of the whole subject. This little volume is well i suited for the use of the college students, and the general reader who consults It
i	for a serious purpose will find it very in-
i	forming.
The author's point of view is that *' the story of America can be comprehended j only in the light of her material aspirations and attainments,” and that " the exploitation of virgin territory by a rate of extraordinary intelligence, resource, send energy fs the essential theme of our National history." ■
The book Is exceptionally accurate in detail and free from even the sort of errors we expect and are ready to excuse. It is a praiseworthy .compilation from monographs and special works, the important information from whlch^ It has extracted and placed within the reader’s ; grasp.	.

This is The New Idolatry/* , which McClure, Phillips & Co.. are now issuing,
! and of'which the author says .in his preface:	.
The papers which have been- brought to: gether in this volume deal with questions of sociaL morality, which are now recelv-; ing much attention from the American people. The burden of these'discussions'
■	rests upon the problems-^raised' by the
i	rapid accumulation of wealth- In '.this country and by the manner in Trhich its use*and distribution affect the characters of - men and* the Institutions :of 7religion,-education, and government^' They <bave ■ beenwrittenand spoken under 4 deep con-. Eviction that the* ethical*- principles which should ' govern ourv conduct ' in all - these I*matters have ‘been: greatly.confused .and * need to be cleaxed. aiiden fo reed.~
