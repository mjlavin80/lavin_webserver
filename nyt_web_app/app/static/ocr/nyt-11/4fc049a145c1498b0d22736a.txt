VERSAILLES.
The Palace and Its Frequenters in the R.eijjn of Louis XIV.*
R. FARMER has made*"!! very entertaining and interesting book. He has not discovered new sources for the history
*	of the time of Louis XIV., but he has gone carefully over the extant records of the reign of the Grand Monarque, and from them has selected portions that, put together skillfully, make a complete, reproduction of* the Frencii Court and its surroundings during the brilliant period that ended almost three hundred years ago. His work may not be that of' the great historian, but tiie result has its own value, even alongside more pretentious histories, and is Tar more interesting than those are apt to be.
Louis XXV. had dreamed of an allpowerful King, and he saw his dream come true; not by wara, but by building up a Court, and making that the " fountain of honor.” If a noble lived away from the Court, “ his sons had no careers, his daughters no chance to marry well; he was rated as being too poor to go to Court, or as having incurred the displeasure of the King." In no long time the Independence of the noblesse had vanished, and Louis was, as he truly said, the French State. ** Throughout France there was not a single estate of any size the proprietor of which was not at Court. The new hotels of the nobility lined the streets near the royal palace, and their owners filled its salons and formed each day a cortege for the King." Versailles Is ^s dead as 'Nineveh to-day;

the man who made' It Is gone, not a pinch of his dust remains. The orange tree which Louis especially admired, the Grand Bourbon^ still lives at Versailles, j the only Bourbon there, one of the few j I living things where once all was life and gayety.
The first two parts of Mr. Farmer’s volume deal with the creation of the pal- ■ ace and the laying out and construction of the park and its famous fountains. These we can but mention here. The third part of the book describes the King, , the creator of the whole world of Ver- ; sailles, as well as the orbit around which fl revolved. Mr. Farmer sees .more in Louis -than the puppet caricatured by Thackeray.	■
The world has failed to confirm the title conferred on him by the City of Paris, Louis the Great, •	*	* but
the title of Grand ^Monarch, which sprang spontaneously vto the lips of his contemporaries. Is rightfully his, for he won it himself by his majesty and bearing, by his courtesy and grace, by the dignity with which he ruled his Court, by his continuous labor, by his unvarying punctuality, by his steadfast faith In the lofty origin of his office, and by his consistent endeavor to live up to his conception of his duties and responsibilities.
He was not merely a butterfly. If he seemed to live to dress, it was because he thought it his duty to do so, the duty that W owed to his Court. But he was a hard worker. He held councils twice a day, even if they had to meet in his bedchamber; every evening, after dinner, he worked with a secretary In Mme. de , Maintenon’s apartments, while his wife ; sat by reading or working on tapestry, i He died in harness, holding councils as he lay in bed, unable to be moved, and I working with various secretaries.	j
j As Mr. Farmer says, Louis could not ; remember a time when he was not King J all this pomp and parade—he dressed sur-i rounded by from 150 to 200 persons—was j become more than second nature to him I from the time he was five years old. The wonder is that he accomplished so much.
A chapter on Mme. de Maintenon is Interesting. Without being the King’s mistress, she was as callous and venal as if she had been. The year after her marriage she founded St. Cyr, a school for daughters of poor nobles, with the ifro-viso that she and her household must be taken care of if ever she wished to retire there, and she deserted the King on his deathbed two days before he died.
" The one genuine thing about her,” says th$ author of this book, ** was her personal beauty.” The others of the King's family are described:	Monseigneur,	the
Grand Dauphin; Monsieur, the King’s brother; the Due and Duchesse de Bourgogne, son and daughter of the Dauphin; the Due d’Anjou, who became King of Spain and the others. Saint Simon’s memoirs afford only a part of the information which Mr. Farmer has woven Into his story; Dangeau, Henri Martin, L’Etat de la France, the.Mcrcure Galante, are all drawn upon. Mr. Farmer has joined his threads skillfully; there is no suggestion of patchwork about his book, which Is entertaining to Its last page.
