That Valerian Law.
New YorJi Times Saturday Review of Books:
In your issue of to-day, 14 M. V. Z. asks about the Valerian law, under which, as he thinks, Caesar was executed (not assassinated) by Brutus and I^s as- : sociates. In Ihne's 4' Early Rome, (Scribner’s,) p. 120, I find the following with reference to the proceedings of Valerius Poplicola, or Publicola, left as sole ! Consul by the death of his colleague, the elder Brutus, just after the expulsion of I Tarquinius Superbus, the last King:
He (Valerius) proposed and passed a law in the Centuriate Assembly by which It was declared high treason in a citizen to assume public authority which was not legally and freely conferred upon him by the people; in other words, a la^ pumsh- | ing by outlawry and confiscation any attempt to restore the monarchy.”	j
In Plutarch's life of Valerius Publicola j we read:	j
He made it lawful, without a form of | trial, to kill any man that should attempt to set himself up for King, and the person that took away his life was to stand excused if he could make proof of the intended crime. His reason for such a law, j we presume, was this:	Though	it is not i
possible that lie who undertakes so great . an enterprise should escape all notice, ! ye+ it is very probable that, though sus-
Sected. he may accomplish his designs efore he can be brought to answer for it in a judicial way, and as the crime, if ; committed, would prevent his being called , to account for it. this law empowered I
any one to punish him before such cognizance was taken.
A fairly close parallel may be cited from Athenian history. It will be found related in Grote (c. 63) that, after the overthrow of the Four Hundred, (the rich conspirators who had temporarily succeeded in subverting the Constitution,) ono of the first acts of the restored popular assembly was to adopt the following decree:	.
If any man subvert the democracy at Athens, or hold any magistracy after the 1 democracy has been subverted, he shall be an enemy of the Athenians. Let him ; be put to death with impunity, and let ! his property be confiscated. * * * Let | tlie man who has killed him and the accomplice privy to the act be accountcd I holy. • • * Let all Athenians swear an : oath * * * to kill him. Let the oath bo as follows: “ I will kill with my own hand, if I am able, any man who shall subvert the democracy at Athens, or who shall hold any office after the democracy has been subverted, or shall rise in arms for the purpose of making himself a despot, or shall help the despot to establish himself. And if any one else shall kill him, I will account the slayer to be holy
•	* * as having slain an enemy of the Athenians. * * * If any man shall perish in slaying or in trying to slay the despot, I will be kind both to him and to his children.” Let all Athenians swear this as the regular oath, * * * invoking upon him who keeps it good things in abundance, and upon him who breaks it destruction for himself as well as for his family.
This idea that any man who seeks to usurp power for himself or his class, overthrowing the liberties of the people, was to be regarded as a public enemy, an outlaw, to be slain with as little compunction as a wild beast, was undoubt-edlr common to all the ancient democracies, and " M. V. Z." is no doubt right in thinking that Marcus Brutus regarded his killing of the usurper Caesar, not as an assassination, but as a lawful and laudable act, in accordance with that ancient Constitutional regulation which the colleague of his great ancestor had helped in establishing. A modern parallel may be found in the fact that Russian revolutionists never speak of the “ assassination “ of Alexander IL or Plehve or Sergius; the removal of these tyrants Is called " execution."
