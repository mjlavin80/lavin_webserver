THE publication of Lady Fanshawe’s story is decidedly worth while; for her memoirs are bright and full of good stories of the doings of two and a half centuries ago, and of moving accidents by flood and field—more than fall to the portion of women in these peaceful times. She wrote her book In 1676 to inform her fourteenth child and only surviving son what manner of man his father was, who had died when the son was but a year old; and in describing the father she tells a good deal about herself and her adventures during the Civil War and of her experiences after the Restoration.
Anne Harrison married Mr. Richard Fanshawe in 1G44, when he was Secretary i of War to King Charles, A year later he was made Secretary to the Prince of i Wales; and thereafter he and his wife 1 were almost always traveling, together or separately, to raise money for the i King- or the Prince; when not so doing | they were In attendance upon one or the other. In July 1647 they said farewell to the King, preparatory to a journey abroad , in search of money. Lady Fanshawe? thus ' describes the scene:
The last time that I ever saw him, when I took my leave, I could not refrain weeping; when he had saluted me,
I prayed to God to preserve his Majesty with long life and happy years; he stroked me on the cheek and said:	M Child* if
God pleaseth, it shall be so, but both you and I must submit to God's will, and you know in what hands I am;" then turning to your father, he said:	" Be
sure, Dick, to tell my son all that I have said, and deliver those letters to my wife; pray God bless her I I hope I shall do well;’’ and taking him In his arms* said " Thou hast ever been an honest man, and I hope God will bless thee* and make thee a happy servant to my son, whom I have charged in my letter to continue his love and trust to you;’* adding, ** I do promise you that if ever I am restored to my dignity I will bountifully reward you both for your service and sufferings." Thus did we part from that glorious sun, that within a few months after was murdered, to the grief of all Christians that were not forsaken by God.
Lady Fanshawe—her husband was made a Baronet by Charles IL in 1650—managed to have about as many escapes as one could want. Shortly after her first child was born she was watching some Royalist troops come into town, when one company, commanded by a friend, gave her a salute: “ and one of their muskets being loaded shot a brace of bullets not two inches above my head as I leaned to the tree, for which mercy and deliverance I praise God.” In Ireland she had to flee with another baby ** through an unruly tumult with swords in their hands”; she and her husband were robbed by sailors and set ashore on the Scilly Islands almost destitute; at Portsmouth they were taken as a target by a Dutch man-of-war, whose shots passed so near them that they could hear them whistle, and they were shipwrecked in the Bay of Biscay, Lady Fanshawe at the Restoration came from Holland in th% Speedwell frigate, while Sir Richard was on the King’s ship. Sir Richard took the King's j
picture to Catharine of Braganza, and I was the King's immediate attendant when ! he married her at Portsmouth In 1662. j From that time he and his wife were generally abroad, Sir Richard serving as Ambassador first at Lisbon and then at Madrid* Of the Portuguese, Lady Fanshawe wrote:	"The people generally
are not handsome.*’ To this day the Portuguese and the Swiss contest the title to being the ugliest people in EUirope.
Sir Richard’s state in Madrid recalls the glories of the Arabian Nights; be went to the palace with twenty footmen, gentlemen, eight “ camaradoes," eight pages, many coaches, and Spanish gentlemen who rode in his train. He died in Madrid on June 26, 1666; the next day he was embalmed and was burled on July 4. The same day, however, his body was sent tp Bilboa; •• he went out of town privately, being accompanied only by a part of hfe own retinue.” On July 8 Lady Fanshawe —with a baby—followed her husband's body and waited at Bilboa until Oct 3, when she started through France, reaching England finally on Nov. 22. The King owed her some £7,S00 for unpaid salary and disbursements, but two years later she was gladi to get £5,600. She died in 1679-SO, after thirteen years of quiet, which must have been pleasant after a score of years of travel and hardship. She was always cheerful, however; as her editor remarks* she must have been born under a dancing star.
