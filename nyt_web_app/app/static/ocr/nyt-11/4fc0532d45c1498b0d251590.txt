LET tho stranger who longrs for a responsive smile and alert intelligence turn to the children of Spain, who seem so full of that pathetic vivacity which leads to no goal; let him get a child-guide who will point him^out everything good -or bad, fair or foul, with lively impartiality, continually looking up at him with large dark' eyes in which but the shadow of settled gloom hj^s as yet penetrated. He need search for no better guide through the labyrinth of Toledo to all the sights of the city, to the Cloisters de los Reves, white and flowering with harmonies of Spring and discordant reliefs; to the old Taller of the Moors, where duennalike old women sit and gossip in the afternoon during the desultory sale of milk and butter, while the hot sun works round the dusty stucco of the inner walls; to. the Casa dc Mesa, ,on which the Moors inscribed their exquisite lettering. He will guide as though he were the man, and his follower but a helpless child/ through the casual goats, the pack-laden donkeys or persistent beggars# up side streets and secret alleys, naming with swift decision everything at which the stranger may happen to glance. " Sefior, a dog; ” “ Sefior, It is a cat or a trim ass, or whatever it be, his alertness roused by the firm belief In his companion’s complete ignorance of everything under the sun.
