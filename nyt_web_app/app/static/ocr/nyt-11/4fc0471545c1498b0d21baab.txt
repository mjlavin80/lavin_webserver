Mr. Saltus introduces you to his people at a fashionable small dinner, where you listen to some very small talk and some vary cheap wit, for which (assuming the scene to be photographic) you need not blame the author. There are further scencs at Sherry’s, at an uncanonized flat In Twenty-second Street, at a young man's rooms in Madison Square on the morning after, and at Narragansett Pier—all serving to tie the threads of the narration into a hard knot, which consists in marrying the right man to the wrong woman. It Is the business of the rest of the story— whose climax is the murder trial already mentioned—to untie that hard knot—and other scenes ensue with more movement and less small talk.	*
In the matter of thoroughgoing punishment of the sinners and reward of tlie (comparatively) virtuous no old-fashioned melodrama can outdo ** The Perfume of Eros.” For tho matter of that, the plot itself is so perfectly melodramatic that one of two things is certain. Either Mr. Saltus is (like many other cj-nics) a rank sentimentalist at heart, or he has deliberately (and maliciously grinning in his sleeve) borrowed his dearest enemies’ thunder.
A NOVEL of New York life by. Edgar Saltus, which appeared serially under the name of ^ The Yellow Fay," Is now published in book form' as “ The Perfume - of' Eros.” (A..

And the story is interesting, especially if you regard it as^ a hooded
satire.	.
What Is more remarkable, perhaps, Mr. Saltus has not allowed his cynical turn to di’ive away all tlie' old-fashionedr sentiment. If he spares no hard (or tailored) detail of the perfidy of a certain young man with no .more- conscience than the least of -the brutes that perish after nocturnal serenades upon the bade'fence; if he draws an equally unflinching- picture of a professional beauty—little and-blonae and pertly shocking—who had; if possible,
