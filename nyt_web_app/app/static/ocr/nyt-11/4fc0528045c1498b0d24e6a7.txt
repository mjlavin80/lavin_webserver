A history of Scotland from 1005 to 1747,
■' Scotland and the Union," Is being issued here by the Macmillan Company. It is by William Law Mathieson, and is a completion of his book, published about three years ago, dealing with “ Politics and Religion In Scotland, 1550-11>U5: A Study in Scottish History from the Reformation to the Revolution.’* The present work, however, is written on a broader and more comprehensive plan. Its scope is indicated by the title, extending from the completion of the Revolution Settlement to the enactments occasioned by the last Jacobi t2 revolt, which may be distinguished as that of the origin, the accomplishment, and the consolidation of the union.
The period which succeeded the Revolu-tion^jthe author writes at the outset of his book, is remarkable in the history of Scotland for the decline of those religious and ecclesiastical interests which had dominated the country for nearly a century and a half. Before treating of the subject of his work, he makes a survey ■ of the current of affairs from the Ref or-mation onward as will enable us to under-i stand how it was that ideals of a more .
practical nature were now taking posses- |
' sion of the national mind. The chapters | that follow this survey deal with the
' commercial expansion from between 1605 | I and 1700, the Scottish ISast India Com! pany, the Darien scheme, the antece-[ dents of Union, the treaty in 170U, the ! Church and the Union, the Church and i i dissent, the Civil War (1707-1710), the Re-I bellion of 1715-1<}, the ascendency of Wat- , pole, the completion, of Uniop and indus- I trial progress, through the rebellion of i 1745-46, and the death of Duncan Forbes. 1 The many notes are explanatory as well as descriptive, and include references to works on the subject, old documents, &c.
