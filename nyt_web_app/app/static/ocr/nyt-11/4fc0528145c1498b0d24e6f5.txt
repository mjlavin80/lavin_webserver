ROF. PALMER begins ills preface with the woists, " There are few to whom this bo^k ^vill seem worth .while/’ . Thig ,
** doubtless is so; comparatively few.read-era will see why an elegant scholar should defeite a good share of some fifty years*r of his life to studies in and about a mtnor English ' poet whose works not one American in ten thousand 'I' ever glances atl And when such study culminates in three large volumes of over 1,300 pages, excellently ' printed and-bounteously illustrated, the, average man * riaturially re'gards it all as a prodigious waste 6f time and pains and money. ‘
Yet were George Herbert far less of a man and a poet than he is, were his iife and writings less inter-’ pretative of an epoch in English religious and literary history, were his connection with a -host of famous and effectual people less intimate, were his influence upon certain select minds of later, generations less powerful—even; then it would be a mistake to disparage such zeal and toil as Prof. Palmer has given to bringing out this edition of his works. Such monographs are of the utmost value to the historian and ! the critic; only out of their particularities can broad . generalities be safely constructed; they are the brooks which make the rivers. Had Prof. Palmer spent his labors on some one of the other poets com/ moniy ranked . with Herbert—on Donne or Quarles or Vaughsin or CrashaW or Wither—he would still have laid the literary world under much obligation. _ _
. But in selecting Herbert—or perhaps one should say .injhaying had Herbert thrust upon him. by.. the ha^py. bestowal in' his cradle of Herbert’s-name—he^ lias taken a man who, not only in his relation to and elucidation of ilie larger life around him, T>ut aTso in -himself" and his product, is a fascinating character and a lasting possession.
Tt is unfortunate for that great mass who seek their opinions in cyclopedias and collections that-mos^ of these are singularly unfair to Herbert. Thus Hallam, in his “History of European Literature/* does not mention his poems at all, though giving pages to i Ear inferior verse. The notice in Ward’s " Selections from the British Poets ” Is unsympathetic and cap- . tious. Sidney Lee, In the “ Dictionary of National . Biography,” seems briefed to write Herbert down. Against these may be set the Britannica, whose short -article is discriminating and kindly, and Appleton’s/ which gives praise, commonplace, but still praise. -There is a arreat offset to the general neglect or depreciation by these authorities in the fervent admiration of such men as Baxter, Leighton, Cowper, Ruskln, Emerson, Lowell, Clerk-Maxwell, and Fitz-~
Gerald.	"
But there is a still greater one in the fact that Herbert's poetry took strong hold upon hJs country-.
1 men. tti« volume, published after his death and her-aided by no flourish of trumpets, passed through edition after edition. Izaak Walton says that within forty years twenty thousand copies of it had been .* sold—d,n enormous circulation for those days.

BUT on$ must also reckon.--with defective culture. Herbert ' la* no Burns; hej’writes as a scholar and a fine gentleman.;; This.does not mean that there is either- pedantry of affectation. Fro f.. Palmer justlynotea howhe,had assimilated all his- learn!ng; how be never -'flaunts .his ctej^icaracquirements. Greek acdT^mji history aria, mythology are rife . in most of the epic^dramas* satires, and ' even the song§^ of .-the day. Herbert knew that history and mythology as well as any of his 'contemporaries; as Palmer says. “ his Latin letters and orations .abound in them.’* Yet-there are only two clear casesin ‘‘ The Temple*’ of.even, an allusion to ‘classic tale ormytb. The erudition necessary’~to understand-Milton is needless for Herbert. ' And as for his acquaintance _ with nobility 'and., royalty, with politics and society—this, while modifying.his thought, has not much affected Its expression. He does not speaSr foppishly or condescendingly. In the pitose of “ The Country Parson v one findijj as direct and naked statement as is possible In our language; it is a model of simple discourse.	,
Yet we must allow that the poems are often difficult; It Is often a labor, before It become a pleasure, to read them. ,
The reasons of which are admirably set forth by Prof. Palmer In his remarks Upon Herbert's " obscurity ” and “ con-eeitsM—remarks which might well be commended to Mr. Edmund Gosse, who talks about Herbert’s ** sinking to writing in the shape of wings and pillars and altars.** The fact is that there is just one example of each, and these only sub- , ordinate trifles which may be regarded | as mere chapter headings or tail-pieces.
When ail discounts have been made it remains that George Herbert stands in the front rank of what—according as one reckons—may be styled the secondt or the third, class of English poets. And the man who thus leads his class is In many ways more Important and valuable than the bulk of those in the class above.
*.* ■
HE Is—his devotional worth aside—a really great man, original and powerful. “ The Temple ” is, as mere literature, golden thought curiously hammered out. There is depth in it, weight In it, splendor in it* as well as quaintness and fancy and delicacy. It is the work of a conscientious artist, one who had a clear plan and adhered to it. With all his variety of forms and metres, his many systems of rhyme, his refrains and doublings back, there are a severity and a restraint which denote a man who holds himself! in hand. His swiftest and sub-llmest thought can never carry him off from a sober and concise expression. "Withal he often has a Shakespearean largeness of utterance, though a largeness which is rarely vague. It is largeness that is due. If one may so say, to condensation—to the packing the phrase with a meaning and intimation which swell as we gaze at them, as. for instance, in the wonderful sennet, “ prayer/*
Prof. Palincr justly emphasizes Herbert’s originality. This is the more needed because usually he is regarded as only one of a school which he did not create and In which he is not the best scholar. Those characteristics which belong to all poetry In his age are taken as being his only or chief ones—the fresh, virile wording, the frequent intricacy of thought, the grotesques of Imagery, and the involutions of style. But he was, as his present editor points out, the practical creator tn English of *’ the religious lyric,” and one o‘f the " pioneers in poetic structure." When Charles Kingsley wrote “ There are those who think that if mere concet-tiwm be a part of poetry, Quarles is a ten times greater poet than Cowley or George Herbert, and equal perhaps to Vaughn and Wither," his critical mis judgment is on a par with his historical blundering. He is counting Quarles as a Puritan and Wither as a Royalist, whereas the facts are exactly the other way. But his slap-dash estimate Is still the prevailing one, and it is good to have it corrected by the sober reasoning and displayed proof of such a scholar as Prof. Palmer.
*	Before to-day three men rendered great and lasting service to Herbert’s fame. The first was his friend, Nicholas Ferrar, to whom he sent from his deathbed the little book,” wherein was “ a picture of his many spiritual conflicts Nicholas Perrar, who saw that book safely through the press and stoutly refused to change a single line of it, although the licenser at first demurred;

The third was Alex-' ander Balloch Grosart, that .enthusiastic and Indefatigable student of Elizabethan . and. Jacobean literature,, who unearthed, a mass of material concerning Herberts ' life and writing. Prof. Palmer tells, ua that Grossart was hasty and inaccurate —which; alas! is true.- Tet. but - for him Prof. Palmer could never have Issued his own volumes, for it' was^ Grossart who discovered - that. Williams manuscript which is , the solid basis of this present work.	.

T?OR now comes Prof. Palmer with Jp what must: be called the first scliol-
-	arly^edition of ' -George Herbert, a book -which Is not a-'m^re mass -of -matter, but an-orderly and illuminated grouping of the facts/	-v,
; It contains everything that Is now j known to. have come from Herbert’s pen— that Is, in English—for his Greek and ! Latin compositions arc wisely omitted, i though they are drawn upon for all they | afford in the way of information and ex-pl&nation. Here are not only ** The Coun-j try Parson ’* and " The Temple," but also the translation of Comoro, the notes on Valdesso, the letters and the will. Here also are those “ doubtful " poems as: -cribed ta Herbert, some with and some without good reason. -Here are all the ** various readings ” of extant manuscripts* and reprints of all the useful . notes of former editions. Here with each poem is given an exegesis of it—its date, its meter, its idea and purpose. Its relation to the others, and explications of its peculiar words and difficult turns of thought. Here are all the pictures of people and places which could possibly be asked for by anybody except an “ extra-illustrating " faddist.
And,. above all, here for the first tim< are given a systematic and comprehensive view and analysis of the man and his poetry, here Is an attempt to treat both as a whole. .
SUCh an attempt as regards the man was indeed-made long ago. Izaak Walton, in one of his immortal biographies, drew a portrait of George Herbert which Is still the one whereat all of us look. Prof. Palmer dissents from some of its features and objects to its general expression. And it probably is rather one sided; but It Is lovely to contemplate yet, and one side is one side.
Some objections might be made to Prof. Palmer’s portrait. It exaggerates the difference between Herbert the layman and Herbert the priest; It overrates the violence of the change from the one state to the other; it forgets that those were the days when a "John Inglesant1’ was not Impossible, or perhaps uncommon. That Herbert's chief reason for taking boly orders was di^PPoittted ambition or ill-health, or even tiereavement, seems out of the question when one considers his .behavior in holy orders, his serenity and sweetness and assiduity and joy. Of course verses of his can be quoted which would bear, out almost any accusation of rebellious worldliness and enforced submission. But these verses were written by a saint in whose eyes gray looked black; and, as Prof. Palmer himself excellently puts it. ** Moods which exist in him merely In germ, or which coexist with much else, he heightens, Isolates, renders dominant and exclusive."
It is, however, in Its arrangement of the poems so as to form a spiritual autobiography that we find the chief novelty and the chief value of Prof. Palmer's work. That some of them had this significance was known from the start; it is stated in the author's words when sending his book to Ferrar. That they all have it may be reasonably doubted. But that as a whole " The Temple ’* reflects the spiritual life of George Herbert, scholar, courtier, statesman, gentleman, and priest, does now stand proved.
Prof. Palmer sums up that life under four heads, “ Education," ” Hesitation," “ Crisis," and " Consecration.” To each of these he gives an ample discussion in his introductory essays; and under these, with several subdivisions, he arranges all the poems.
Were he to thus sort out and locate these poems simply from internal evidence, one might well hesitate to accept his theory and his table. Such evidence Is exceedingly precarious. But he has solid ground to start from. The Williams manuscript, discovered by Grosart, Palmer argues convincingly, contains the verses of Herbert’s earlier days. This being granted, there is then a good deal to present in J he way of external evidence. For poems not in that manuscript are presumably of later date. And then a comparison of style and thought brings out the Internal evidence.
That Prof. Palmer is correct In his dating of every piece he himself would of course be the last to claim. Some of them are sufficiently neutral to be placed almost anywhere But with the Williams manuscript to back him he is secure in his general thesis that " The Temple " is indeed the autobiography of a wonderful and lovely soul. And the majority of stu-
