HIS work is one of the largest among the popular accounts of polar explorations; but with a total of 1.09G pages it must still yield the palm to Peary's book, with 1,230, and Nansen’s, with 1,323 pages. Fortunately the handling of Capt. SeotPs
I	volumes is not a notable muscular feat. Very "few illustrations are set into the text, and these are line drawings. The hundreds of full-page photographs, or of sma'ler photographs grouped on pages, require sized paper; but the text has escaped this distinction. We have bulk, but not the affliction of excessive weight, which might have dulled the ardor of the most enthusiastic reader.
The author gives 105 pages to a general discussion of sledging, G pages to the performances of the Royal Terror Theatre company and the Dishcover Minstrel Troupe, and no phase of the work lacks ample descriptive detail. He says that in studying the records of former polar voyages the party sometimes suffered from the paucity of facts and descriptions. In writing his book he kept the fact in view that the guidance of future voyagers should be his first purpose. He may therefore have made some pages tiresome to the average reader, but not many. Few polar chapters are more into.rastiner than Capt, Scott’s discussion of sledging; his remarks on antarctic theatricals are entertaining, and there is little dullness in the work: there scarcely could be unless the telling of the story were very bad, for it is all about the glorious mountain country of Victoria ' Land,""which Ross discovered sixty-five years ago with its great barrier ,wall. smoking volcano, and many peaks vying in stature with some of the taller of the Andes.
The only survivor of the Ross expedition is Sir Joseph Hooker, the famous botanist. He welcomed the Discovery back to England over sixty years after he had gazed on those same antarctic scenes. No wonder he could not remember whether snow

covered the slopes of Mount Terror when he ‘ saw them.	.

If we compare the maps in this volume with, tjie excellent antarctic charts published earlier in the year we may observe one of the peculiarities of polar explorers. They come home with-their new- charts far advanced, the capes, bays, and mountains all outlined, the elevations and soundings noted in figures, but most of the new features they discover are still unnamed. They record on the spot the geographic truths they discover, but there is no time or wish to think of names when the mercury is freezing, in- the bulb and a forty-mile gale is blowing. Most polar explorers give little thought to the nomenclature of their discoveries till they are comfortaJWy seated in the study at home, and long before they have parceled out the mountains, glaciers, and other objects among their friends and the great of the earth, charts may be issued, as was the case this year, with the discoveries outlined, but d scanty nomenclature. In Capt. Scott's book we find that all the notable things he .saw have at last been named. .
From the declc of a vessel the sea horizon meets the eye a few miles away, but Capt. Scott tells us that as the expedition steamed southward the blue outlines of the high peaks erf the Admiralty Range were seen at the great distance of more than 100 geographical miles. That antarctic Summer day Was marvelously bright and clear when the ship Discovery, with the British National Expedition on board, approached the largest continuous land mass that has yet been seen in the south polar regions. Victoria Land was to be the home of the party for two years. The building of the ship, the equipment of the explorers, and the two relief expeditions coat $500,000. It was one of the costliest of polar enter- ‘ prises, but its results were great, and England is satisfied.
Scarcely a man in the party had seen polar service before. Capt, Scott of the navy, who proved him-self'so worthy of the leadership confided to him, wa& not even a studght of polar literature till, the first Winter night gave him time to read both arctic and

No fuss was ever made. unless there was good reason for it. We are impressed throughout these volumes with the fact that every emergency was coolly and quietly met. Here is an instance: :One:nignt, if -we may speak of night in the polar Summer, most of the men were 'sleeping in their bunks, and only those on watch, including Capt, Scott, were on deck, it was suddenly discovered that a mighty and relentless tide, against which the engine contended in vain, was "bearing the vessel forward to possible destruction on the shore. It was a des-•perately anxious hour for the1 men on ‘deck, hut' the danger gradually passed with the weakening of the tide. The men below were blissfully unconscious of the really great peril till they heard of it in the morning.
The active volcano Erebus and Mount Terror were found to be on an island Instead of the mainland. After the Summer work the Winter quarters were made at ‘ the south end of this island, where the Discovery was frozen in for two years, escaping at last just in time to keep out of the clutch of a third Winter.
. ’ THE GREAT IC^ BARRIER.
SOME of the most brilliant discoveries Qf the expedition were made in the i -'first Summer. One of the njost interesting problems was to solve the mystery of the Gjeat lee Barrier, a frowning cliff of ice, which Ross traced for 400 . miles to the east. Scotfe’s party saw it where it abuts on the shore at Cape Cro-zier, under the shadow of Mount Terror, followed it past the point where Ross turned north, and traced it to 103 degrees west longitude, a distance of 450 sea miles. They found that its edge was afloat, for it rose and fell with the tide; and back of the edge they saw the ice as high as the wall itself, and named it the-Barrier Ice. From their balloon, at a height of 500 feet, they could see no southern limit to th!s vast ice plain, many scores of feet thick. Later they made two sledge journeys over the Barrier Ice to the south and southeast. Capt. Scott traveled over it for 300 miles southward., and saw no sign of its end. He believes it is afioat throughout with about 600 feet of water under it. The Barrier at its edge has retreated about fifteen miles since Ross saw it, and its perpendicular ice cliffs are from 60 to 280 feet in height
This ice covers what is known as Ross Sea. In the opinion of Capt Scott, it was formed at a. time in the distant past when the glaciation was far greater than It is to-day. Immense glaciers pouring from the land were at last unable to float away In the comparatively shallow water and spread out over Ross Sea, completely filling it with a vast sheet of ice.
Ross suspected that there was land beyond the barrier edge where he left it. Scott found the land rising from i!,000 to 3,000 feet in height, and named it ICing Edward VII, Land. He could see the coast for many miles, and its outline suggested a-volcanic country, but the'bare rock peered out of the snow In only a few places. It may be^an island, but is more likely a part of the antarctic continent and the gastern side of the wide bay that incloses Ross Sea.
THE ANTARCTIC NICHT.
THE results of two years’ work in this remarkable region cannot even be outlined in this place. It included all phases of scientific observation the detailed results of which are yet to be published. The wonderful Alpine region around the Winter quarters was carefully mapped, and the long story is told of life in the antarctic night with its frightful cold, terrific blizzards, and Us amusements as well, which included actual enjoyment of minstrel shows and camp-made drama with the indoor temperature below zero. But only two or three of the most conspicuous events may be mentioned here. One was the sledge journey 300 miles south, which Scott and **■ „small party made when dawn came after the first long night The leader , had expected that dog power would be the chief motive force in taking him as near the pole as possible. The event proved what great embarrassment and , disappointment may follow a blunder. ' It had been decided at home not to take dog biscuit for the sledge journey because Norw c^mn codfish had proved to be fine dog foo£ In the Arctic, and, weight for weight, it was thpught to be more strength-sustaining than biscuit. It occurred to no one that the fish was likely to be spoiled on the voyage across the warm seas of the tropics. A sledge was leaded with the fish, bad as it was. There was no other food for the dogs, and the fish was poison to them. They languished and died. Long before Scott reached his furthest south none of the surviving ani- 1 mals could pull a pound, and all perished before the return to the ship. This deplorable .mistake probably cost Scott a degree or two of southing, though, as it, was, lie made the- splendid record of 82' degrees 17 minutes. At his furthest point he was 463 geographScai miles, or
536% • square iailes,*.
' 'SVith every,. step ^ouaVwra?$ fScdj;t; and hts-men .were mapping the Hne .of^a new coast on .the white :spac'e of ,the antarctic chart.;i£ was a terribl&puil* allthe way, for the snow was deep. But each march was cheered by the magnificent panorama of that long eas.t coast of Victoria Land. Rarely a day passed that not reveal some wonderful feature as they -tramped along, and, naturally, .they were elated by the tljought that they were the first to gaze on these splendid scenes of huge perpendicular cliffs aiid the high ranges rising behind them. Where are the dauntless mountaineers who will* dare to seek theSe summits when they have put every peak in northern lands beneath human feet?
Nearly all the coast is high and steep, sinking abruptly to the sea from heights of 1,000 to 2,000 feet. For the last two or three days of the march they could scarcely stagger another step, but they were wonderfully rewarded for their dogged effort to push endurance to the limit. All the mountains they had seen could not compete in' height and dignity with those that came into view on the last day. Leaving their .sledge, they started off on skis, and soon saw Mount Markham, looming before them, its full stature of 15,100 feet revealed; and beyond this giant of the-coast range was Mount Longstaff, rising to 10,000 • feet above sea level; and they could distinguish that this stretch of high mountains extended to the limit of tfceir vision, about fifty miles.
The sledge journey ended with the return to camp on Feb. 3, 1003. For ninety-three days they had been plodding over the vast snow field and sleeping under fluttering canvas. They had covered 960 statute miles, and though they had not gone as far toward the pole as they had hoped, they had done all that men could do.
THE INTERIOR.
THE second Winter passed quietly and in comfort the chief interest being the preparation for the Spring sledging campaign. A number of expeditions into the unknown were to be made, but the great event was to investigate at all hazard the nature of the interior ice cap; and Capt; Scott, with two of his sailors, took this formidable undertaking in hand.
About 100 pages are given to the story of this journey into the interior of .Victoria Land on the ice cap, where the men, much of the time, were at an altitude of a mile and a half above the sea. High* wind and snow storms compelled them to remain in their tent for nine days, but In fifty marching days they traveled 723 miles into the land and back again, or a daily average of 14.5 miles. The rigors of a poIarT climate were added to those due to very high altitude. The conditions of that sledge march were perhaps the hardest on record. Under the circumstances the men came near the limit of possible performance, Scott may be excused for “ devoutly hoping ” that his future wanderings may never again lead him to the summit of Victoria Land. This ice cap is of very great extent, and where Scott traveled it is comparatively uniform in altitude. All he says about it gives the impression that the tremendous cube of ice, the greatest in the world, probably covers the entire antarctic continent at a nearly uniform level.
Most of us would never see that wonderful south land even though we were rich and had plenty of time and fondnesfs for travel. We may thank our stars for the art of Dhotoirruphy that has caught, In the most vivid and admirable way, the wlltVond wonderful grandeur and beauty of these valleys, mountains, and ice basins. No finer views ever enhanced the interest of an explorer’s book, and many of them are unique. For over sixty years the scientific men of all nations disr cussed the Great Barrier, and here are plenty of first-rate views showing all the phases of that ice front as it rises low or high above the ocean level. The colored plates from Dr. Wilson's sketches are very striking, and among the hundreds of photographs may be mentioned, as especially novel, such scenes as the bow of the Discovery ripping up the floe ice as she drives into the pack, the ice flowers formed on the surface by the salt that is excluded from sea water during the process of freezing; sunlight on the steam from the crater of Erebus, for the volcano only steamed in 1002-03, though it emitted plenty of flame and smoke in 1841; the junction of the Great Ice Barrier with Cape Crozier, and the breaking of the ice with explosives, by which means the Discovery was at length freed from her long prison, and the British for a tims said good-hve to Antartica.
Capt. Scott has written a book that will have a conspicuous place among, the annals of polar effort, and it is worthy of it.
The Appendices, by Messrs. Ferrar and Wilson, give a summary of the geological observations and briefly describe the antarctic fauna,	CCA-
