BROWN AND BLACK.
A Real English Woman in Borneo and on the African West Coast.*
FELT," says the author of these pages. like a cross between royalty and the latest addition to the zoo.” Por she had been in places where never a white woman had been before her, and	|
been	stared	at by black folk and brown	j
with	a	frankness and persistency which	,
spoke volumes. The author is obviously i not a woman adventurous by choice, but she has followed her husband, a Commissioner of the British Government in Bor- 1 neo and on the west coast of Africa, into the darkset recesses of the evil and outlandish regions in which he has administered British justice. Now she writes of what she has seen upon her travels with “ Dick,” and writes with a mixture of girlish simplicity and womanly shrewdness which is not bins short of charming. Her book, in fact, reads so little like a book that you might imagine you were listening to a naive and informal recital from the lips of a woman young and eager enough to babble as she talked, to mix trivialities with serious matters, and to fall only now and then (and then in such a fashion as to increase tlie illusion) into the schoolgirl composition style.
We needn’t pretend here to follow Mrs. Cator in her wanderings, but she spent two years in Borneo and lived among the gruesome “ head-hunters ” while her husband dealt with lawbreakers among them. She visited China and Japan, (before the last war,) and has spent several years upon the worst parts of the African west coast, living there much of tbe time in mud huts among the natives axid seeing
them as they are.
Some passages from her narrative may -well find place here—though the difficulty , of deciding which to take and which to ;
leave is embarrassing.
On shipboard, eastward bound, a certain old Turkish vizier paid her compliments, spoke of eyes like stars and teeth like pearls and hair like the setting sun. Mrs. Cator says:
"Which showed a more than vivid iniag- ! ination, but was quite pleasing except to Dick, who only lookea on him as a dirty old man. To speak truthfully he wajnt very fax wrong, as a shipwreck had once caught him in his bath, and from that day, whenever he traveled, however long the voyage, he abjured ali water.
Then she observes the mania on the ship for " drinking, gambling, flirting, and praying.”
Excess in all four is constantly going on at one and the same time.- The first two hurt the people themselves most, and the third is the most common, but to the general public the last is certainly the most trying.
~ In Borneo she speaks frankly and disapprovingly of the morals of the lcpre-sentatives of civilization, and tells how the natives gather nests for birds nest soup. It is a most fantastic performance, but too intricate to describe here.
Passing over into the head-hunting country, she describes the local wedding ceremony—which is Quaint—and adds.
The festivities are kept up till the morning when the bride goes home with her husband. The next day it is etiquette for her to run back to her father s house, and when a lot of women come from her husband’s village to fetch her back she would be considered bold ar.d forward if she didn’t pretend not to want to go, but she eventually lets herself be persuaded, and this little play has to be repeated several times before she is allowed to settle down as a married w oman.
This passage refers to crocodiles, which are. it appears, pervasive in Borneo riv-jers:
A crocodile swimming upstream with a man in his mouth was not an uncommon sight. I remember four out of six Chinese, just opposite to where we being taken one day all at once, which looked like a deliberate concerted attack on the part of the crocodiles. The only comfort Is that it is a very quick death. It is really the quickest form of drowning. They don’t play with you like a cat; they just hold you under water till life is extinct, and then put you up some creek, where they have the selfcontrol to leave you till you are in proper condition for their dinner.
Mrs. Cator speaks of the excellent morals of the head hunters—In spite of the habit they have of housing a whole village In one house. “Their girls are as safe and sacred as If each of them were under lock and key.*' In Afnca she remarks with comical dismay upon tho frightful artistic effect of putting clothes upon the savages—a chief part of missionary enterprise, it appears. She adds this:
Father Browne, the head of the Roman Catholic Mission, was deploring the same thtfng when he was staying with us last year, but he didn't seem to think my remedy of leaving them without clothes was practicable. He Is dead now; he died of blackwater fever a few months ago.
Mrs. Cator proceeds calmly to remark that ** black races have a rooted objection to the truth in any form," and that tM-q trait complicates “ Dick’s " judicial duties tremendously. Finally she tells

how the West Coast negroes take newly elected kings into the bush, where “ their duties are instilled into them in the most forcible way.”
Those responsible for them pay them constant visits, ask them impossible questions, and then, in the pidgin-English they talk out here, “ larn them plenty sense " by thrashing them most unmereir fully. Their shrieks, poor things, while‘s they are thus painfully having wisdom instilled into them may sometimes be heard rigrht into the town, and the same thing goes on night after night.
