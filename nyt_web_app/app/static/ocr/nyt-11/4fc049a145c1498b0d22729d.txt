IT certainly does mate a difference ■whose ox is gored; and Great Britain has been finding out that, homely fact during’ the last few years- From a time to "Which the memory of man runneth not to the contrary she has opposed any extension of the rights of neutrals in war—this because the Question of neutral rights Is confined almost wholly to naval wars, Jn which she has, as a rule, taken a part. But the recent Russlan-Japanese war, though fought out on land, had a maritime side; and in the course of. thp naval warfare certain events occurred which affected Great Britain and have made the few publicists of that country protest. Mr* Smith and Mr. Sibley voice that protest in their volume.
The North Sea - incident," though treated of at some length. Is not really of any Importance to international law. It was an unfortunate occurrence, whfch the International commission characterized as unjustifiable. The passage of the Dardanelles, by two vesseis^?f the Russian Volunteer Fleet, and the depredations of these two vessels on commerce (chiefly British) after they had put off the lamb and assumed the lion, are the chief incidents of the war as regards International law. Naturally, the British ox having been gored, the British protested violently against the seizure of their vessels and invoked the decision of the Alabama court most earnestly. The two sessels passed the Dardanelles disguised, *ne as a hospital ship, the other as a -oilier, by fraud obtaining the consent df the Turkish Government. Thereafter they took on the character of war vessels and seized various merchant ships in the fled Sea, all of which were released, and others in Pacific waters.
It Is Turkey who was Insulted ty the deceit practiced on her, not the signers of the treaty of Paris; and Turkey alone has any right to call Russia to account therefor, Our authors insist that the case parallels that of the Alabama. Of course, it was discourteous, to say the least, on *he part of Russia to cheat Turkey; but we are inclined to think she was justified in her action. If the signatories of the treaty of Paris wanted Turkey to keep the Russian fleet in the Black Sea, they should have helped her enforce the’ treaty. As to the seizures, It seems to us that they must be considered separately from the passage of the Dardanelles. Once out of the Black Sea, the vessels were at liberty to fly the naval- flag at any convenient time.. Again the Alabama case comes up; in' our angriest moments we never claimed formally that the Alabama had no right to fly the Confederate flag; we claimed damages from England, for having let the ship escape. The Smolensk and the Petersburg, once past the Dardanelles, were properly commissioned in the Russian Navy. It casts an amusing light on England's present anger at the Russians' successful trick to recall that her fleet of ten warships forced the passage in February, 1ST8, doing by force what the Russians did by fraud, though she herself was not a belligerent.
Our authors wax almost eloquent over the " undis criminating comprehensiveness ” of Russia’s .list of contraband articles, and over her " repudiation of the distinction between conditional and unconditional contraband-’' This latter point, hnd the wholly new cases arising from the inventioh^oCwireless telegraphy/’ are far more-important than some of the more insirfar -subjects discussed at greater length; •: It: is' an interesting sign of • the time's that two. British barristers. ' should take the stand the authors of this* book have taken; we may yet find Great Britain as zealous for the rights of neutrals as hitherto she has been, careful cf the rights of belligerents. As,the chief commercial power of the world* her adhe- : elon tip the side-of the neutrals will be of 1 enormous weight.	~
