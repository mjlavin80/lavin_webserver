OiXB years ago Mr, .Douglas Campbell wrote a book that at the time excited, much interest. “ The Puritan in England. "Holland/and America.” The author'Sf the book before us has made a volume
-	in some measure complementary to that: **.The England and Holland of the PI1-. grims.*’ Yet this later bock so mors th^n.
an account of the manners and customs of
. i
... the two countries which gave blrtli' tp and nourished the Pilgrims; it is a study of those countries in their spiritual as well as their material aspects;: and though the author died fifteen years ago, even before Mr. Campbell's book was published, his son has taken advantage of recent discoveries and finds in the archives of England and Holland to make his father’s narrative as complete as possible—up to date, so far as a history of old time ■ can be.
The story is divided into six books, four of which deal with the Pilgrim in England, while the fifth book covers his stay in Amsterdam, and thd sixth that in Ley-^"ilen. The first book describes England _ and Its people as they have been described before—interestingly, but in no new way, but the second, dealing with the Protestantism of our father:;, te novel. Dr. Dexter describes the slow enrooting in England of the reformed religion In its Anglicized form; he says that at Eliza-betli’s accession there wer° 9,000 priests In England, of whom only 200 refused to take the oaths necess^rj to secure them in their cures; the othei* 8.SOO accepted the change caused by the coming of the new Queen as they might have accepted a change in the weather. In fact, one gathers irom Dr. Dexter's book what is sometimes stated in other books, that England was certainly not Protestant for some years after Elizabeth’s accession; and it seams evident that had the Roman Catholic Church and powers been less insistent the spread of Protestantism there might have been delayed for some time, to say the least But when, owing to Catholic mistakes, the line was drawn between Catholicism and loyalty to the Queen, Protestantism triumphed—England was loyal, and therefore—and only therefore— was Protestant.
BUT Dr. Dexter spends little time on the greater side of the conflict in England; ho considers the growth of the Puritans, and of the Pilgrim element, which he says stood for the reformation of the reformers. He describes the discussions to which the Pilgrim movement gave rise, and then takes us to Scrooby, the birthplace of the Pilgrim Church. This Nottinghamshire town he almost reconstructs as it was at the opening of the seventeenth century, giving plans of it as it was, and views of the manor house as It now is, wherein dwelt William Brewster, Bailiff of Scrooby, and later the Elder Brewster of the Mayflower company. This book is followed by a study of Brewster’s life, involving an interesting account of university life in England. It continues also the history of the Pilgrims down to their exodus to Holland.
*c*
THE last two books describe the growth of the Pilgrim body in the Netherlands; the separation from these of the Brownist Separatists; the removal from Amsterdam to Leyden, and finally the great esodus westward to England and then to America. Mr. Morton Dexter's hand is apparent iuore plainly in these books than in the others; for many new facts concerning the Pilgrims have come to light since Dr. Dexter died. The son, too,' adds an appendix, giving a census of the Pilgrims in Leyden until lCH'J; this alone should m^ke Vhe volume of value to those having the ancestral bee In their bonnets.
