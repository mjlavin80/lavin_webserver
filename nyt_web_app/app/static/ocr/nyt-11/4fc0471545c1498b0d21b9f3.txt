ALTHOUGH the title, M Twisted Eglantine," refers to the heroine of Iv^r* Marriott Watson’s novel, the value and interest of the book lie in its portrayal of a Beau of the " decorative time ’’ of George, Prince Regent*
Mistress Barbara Garaway is a young woman who is truly “ twisted ” around the fingers of first one lover and then the other, and who contrives to do as much harm as possible to both herself and her swains—especially to the ojpe whom she almost brings to a shameful death. Nor are we particularly Interested in this young gentleman, whom we find, as did his rival, somewhat blustering and unmannerly.
Sir Piers Blakiston is the raison d’etre of the novel, and he is excellently well i done, albeit, perhaps, a little exaggerated—though much less, by the bye, than Sir Piercie Sbafton of1-" The Monastery.'
As the author points- out. he was “ an idealist In dress and manners,’*^ and of unimpeachable-courage, withal. If his attitude toward women was utterly indefensible* it can but be admitted that his moral code was that of .the men of fashion of his day, with the Prince of' Wales and the Duke of York well in the lead. At the same timtf' he certainly spared more than once when he* :might .have plucked; he .was\ without^ petty resentments; and-he showed, himself capable of a generous magnanimity. .	.	.
Altogether, Mr. Marrott Watson’s old Beau, for all his fine feathers and foolish airs, his heartless selfishness and fashionable <vices, was very much of a man— as, no dohbt, many-were who ruffled as bravely as he. ’	‘	•
If he portrait is one of: much interest, and, while not allutingv Is painted with so much skill that we perceive the drop of good red human blood which makes us all kin; and we give a sigh, if not to the passing of the Beau, at least to the passing of his manners—especially as the novels of modern society do not indicate a compensating moral lustre.
Mr. Marriott Watson has put his best ^\w>rk into “ Twisted Eglantine,” and has scored a distinct trhimpn in Sir Piers Blakiston—an achievement, we should* imagine, of no small difficulty.
“Spellers” for Students.
The Macmillan Company Is issuing for students Part II. of the. Spaldlng-Morse " Language Speller ” and William E. Chancellor’s final volume of the ** Graded City Speller/* which contains useful words for the eighth year elementary school grade and was prepared with the co-operation of teachers and Principals in six cities. Each word, as far as possible, has been presented, first in a sentence or paragraph from a well-known writer, then syllabicated, and finally repeated several times in reviews. The second part of Miss Spalding and Mr. Morse’s " Language Speller" supplements and completes the course In spelling, letter writing, and composition begun in Part I. Much attention is given to the formation of words, together with a synthetical presentation of stems, prefixes, and suffixes; in almost every lesson there are groups of synonyms; unusual or persistent errors in expression are corrected; the book also teaches *the student where to find material and how to assort and arrange it for the writing of a composition. There are many extracts from the writings of standard authors.
