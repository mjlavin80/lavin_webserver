CHILDREN'S BOOKS.
The Outdoor Boy’s Scientific Experiments—Natural History—English Schoolboys, i v.
11C11K is nothing that \>rom-„ more permanent interest for hoys who hare a little ingenuity and a desire to reenforce it with knowledge th;iti “The Scientific American lioy; or. the Camp at "Willcw Clump Inland/’ by A. Russell Bond. (Munn & Co., $2.) The book is a volume of practical directions by means Of which the out-door boy can fit himself out for all kinds of sport, particularly for camping, making everything _ needed himself. It is a record of the labors and pleasures of the organization known as the S. S. I. E. K. of \V. C. I., or in plain language the " Society for the Scientific Investigation, Exploration, and Exploitation of Willow Clump Island.'*
" Bill " is the President of the organf-zation, and through tlie information and instruction obtained from *' Uncle Ed " he has come to have a general knowledge of how to do many tilings. He rooms at boarding school with one of the boys who tells this story, goes home with him, for the Christmas holidays and there begins the club. One of the interesting things Bill can do is to make skate sails. These are great fun in a strong blow, each boy having one and riding before the wind without an effort. It was while experimenting with skate sails that the boys discovered Willow Clump Island. It would be just the place for a camp. Bill thinks, and almost immediately the club is formed and the boys return to school to save their money for materials for tent making, &c., when the warm weather arrives. Uncle Ed, who is off in Brazil, volunteers to become one of the party, the older people agree to the expedition, and the fun begins. There is not much the boys do not do under the generalship of ; Uncle Ed.
They begin scientifically as boys belonging to a club of the kind should, and survey the island. There is a tent made at first, but later the boys build a grass hut, a house in a tree, and eventually they put up an ambitious log cabin. Pictures of the finished work and diagrams showing it in process of construction, with full directions, make it possible for other boys to go and do likewise. There are anv number of things the boys do before they have finished, besides having fun swimming, shooting rapids, and other jolly good times. They make canoes, tramping outfits, including the camp 7beds, build bridges, water wheels, and windmills, with ice boats, sledges, &c., ar;d the fun lasts from vacation to vacation.
BROWNING'S “ Pied Piper of Ham-elln," illustrated by Van Dyke, Is a large flat volume with heavy black type, with colored full page and text illustrations. It is in paper-covered boards upon which appears , the piper, and upon the inside cover pages sport innumerable rats. (A- W'esselsJCompany.)
The Golllwogg’s familiar form, with the modern dolls, is to be seen off for a fox hunt this year. The pictures by Florence K. Upton are even better than usual, and Bertha Upton, in the verses, has written an exciting story. (Longmans, Green' & Co., ¥2.)
** McLaughlin Brothers’ Christmas Annual ” is about the size of “ The Chatterbox," with a bright Christmas cover and contents of Christmas stories, poems and games. It has marginal illustrations In color and black and white reproductions from familiar pictures. The book is edited by Matilda Blair, (McLaughlin Brothers.)
“Josie Bean, Fiat Street," by Harriet A- Cheever, (Dana Estes & Co., $1.25,) Is not one of the most satisfactory of children's stories. The little milliner's apprentice who dresses windows and then a Christmas tree In the home of a wealthy woman is almost too free from self-cons cions ness in the house of her patroness, and the enmities and Jealousies of halfgrown girls are not edifying.
A ZOOLOGICAL garden in a book is a handsome volume from England, “ A Natural History for Young People," by the Rev. Theodore Wood, with twelve fuU-page color illustrations and over 300 black and white by different artists, members of the Royal British Academy among them, (l'utton, New York, $2.50.) It is a comprehensive book, covering a wide range of beast, bird, fish, and fowl. The typographical work is beautiful.
One of those excellent books of English schoolboy adventures is “ The Boys of Bad minster," by Andrew Home, (Lippi n-cott Company.) It is not a probable story, but it has the merit of originality. The boys are a good sort, natural, and their pianks are interesting. The .adventure of Jack Coverdale, the hero, which forms the plot of the story, is not , less so. Jack is the kind of a boy wlibsj will never ** split M on the other boys, but a good many of those at Huxham School' are less honorable, and If Jack. la pun.
* . * ished lor their misdemeanors they let it go because they say Jack doesn’t mind.
But this time it is serious. Jack is to be expelled, and through no fault or his own, and he feels pretty blue. To relieve his mind he decides to take a swim. That is against the rule, but Jack feels that he has passed the stage where he need mind. lie Is a good swimmer, and feels better when he leaves the water, but runs into a new difficulty, for another boy has walked off with his clothes and left in their place a gray suit. Jack puts on the gray suit, but in his anxiety to find the boy who has played him the trick, forgets his school cap, which is left near the water with a, book with bis name in it.
Every one knows what that means— that the Huxham schoolmasters will take it for granted that Jack is drowned, particularly as he is whizzed off about as —soon as he is dressed by two masters of another school in search of a runaway boy in a gray suit. That Jack Coverdale can masquerade Cor months as Jack Price is hard to believe, but that Is what happens in the book. Jack feels pretty mean about it himself. There is an attempt at kidnapping, with exciting cricket games and boys' pranks, all of which must be read to be appreciated. There is another good story, ** A Row in the Sixth,” at the end of the book, which Is a big one.
A MORE natural story, and also^ a very good one* is a companion book for girls, brought out by the same publishers, “ The Girls of St. Gabriel's," by May Baldwin* A patriotic little English girl is sent to a French convent school. She does not like anything French, and is sure she will dislike the French girls and be unhappy in her school life. There is an excellent account of this, and the discipline turns out to be a very good thing for the English- girl, who learns to appreciate it. The brother of Ursula, the heroine, is one of the characters in the book, and there is brought in a little of French home II Te, and it is all entertaining.
Art exceedingly pretty book and charming story is " Two Little Knights of Kentucky," by Annie Fellows Johnston, a holiday edition, with Illustrations in color by Harold Matthews Brett, (L. C. Page & Co.) Besides the full page pictures there are attractive marginal Illustrations. The Little Colonel and other old friends in their younger days are in the book, two of them being the knights, young Sir Galahad’s. It is a difficult thing to be a true knight, and these boys get into trouble, leaving •* Ginger " bound to a tree when they play Indian and forgetting her until after dark, a most ungallant and un-knightly act; they bring a trick bear into the house, and there are exciting handcar adventures on the railroad track. But they do a real work in the end. It is one of the most interesting of Miss Johnston’s book.
“ Our Holidays,” retold from St. Nicholas, makes a new kind of book. There is an account of the different holidays observed in this country, beginning with that of St. Saturday, which is a weekly event for the schoolboy. After that comes Hallowe’en and the other festivals in their order, closing with the Fourth of July. There are illustrations. (The Century Company.) By the same publishers and also retold from St. Nicholas are “ Colonial Stories,” dealing with the early Dutch and English settlers, and a third and fourth volume of “ Civil War Stories " and “ Revolutionary Stories.” Short historic accounts with Illustrations retold from the magazine.
