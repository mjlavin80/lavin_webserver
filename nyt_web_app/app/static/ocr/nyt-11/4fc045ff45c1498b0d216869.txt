THE.intelligent texts that Mr. H: Ncol 1 Williams has so often furnished .to describe and Emphasize various'sal- ‘ leries of French beauties Invariably present tiie illusion that he writes biography ancl then seeks out fitting illustrations; whereas in truth he writes ‘4 around ” the pictures. In other words,* the aru-thor’s not inconsiderable learning, tact, taste, and elegant literary style actually do honor to the careers of the ladies whoso portraits painted by famous contemporary brushes "are among the art treasures of the world. Cheaper, although scarcely more popular, editions of air. Williams's work usually follow elegant imprints in which the pictorial feature is done by the Paris house of GoupIL . The last book in the. former category is called “ Queens of the French Stage.”
In it are reproduced tho most famous portraits' of Armande Bfejart, wife of Molidre; Marie de Champmesle, Adrienne t/ecouvreur, Mile, de Camargo, Justine Favart, and Mile. Ciairon, together with biographical matter of t^ie highest value and aesthetic interest. Some of the artists represented are Charles Coypel, Henry Houssaye, Vertud, Hyancinthfe, Rigaud, JeAn Haoux, Sir Joshua Reynolds, ■ and others. .	•	.	*.
Beginning with the wife of Moli&re, Mr. Williams shuns later historians and biographers and goes straight to original sources of information. The career of the curiously consorted couple, in private life, hi theatric , victories, ^ and matrimonial quarrels is carefully followed, and the honor of Moli6re*s name, if not the woman's character, is rehabilitated* The curious situation which grew out of Armando’s singular likeness^ to. La Tourelle
is given with , full details. Armande’s death certificate contains no mention of the great man whose name she. for a time. bore. Nevertheless, posterity has deCtded'to *ignore'her second husband; the worthy Guerin, and always speaks of her as the *’ wife of Moli&re.’* Marie de CImmpmesIe, "Inseparable from both the immortality and the frailties of the Racine as Foucher once wrote—comes next on Mr. Williams’s list, and then that most sympathetic figure on the French stage, Adrienne Ijecouvreur,' who, possessing an attraction for French writers above that of. ^ny other actress, has‘been immortalfzed iri a play by Scribe and Le-gouvfi. The other- actresses treated of in the book are not so well known to English readers,- but under the pen or Mr. Williams they become interestIng1*e£fson-alities well worth acquaintance and study.
