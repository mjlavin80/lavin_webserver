A Story of War.
THE NORTH PACIFIC. A -Story of tho Russo-Japanese War. By Boyd Allen. P*p 325. New York: E. F*. Dutton. & Co. $1.50.
After the masses of newspaper accounts of the Russo-Japanese war,' at" first inaccurate, then confusing, and finally clear but vasty, a book like " The North Pacific " ts a positive godsend to boys who don’t read newspapers and their1 felders who want the history told over again, but with something fresh to compel the interest.
We are left to judge whether this book was written for young or old, but aside from the fact that it is written in juveiiile style it contains * information' oh naval matters, descriptions ol foreign ports, and bright pictures of the action in the Par East'to make it of interest to all.
•	The book is^n either a story nor a treatise. It is a queer jumble of both; but that is the merit of it. ' Just as the reader grows tired of statistics and historic facts, in comes the Midshipmen of the United States gunboat to enliven things by raising a row in the streets of Malta or among themselves aboard the Osprey, which is ordered to Eastern waters to protect American interests.
The book begins with the trial of ill-fated " Ketvizan ’* in Boston Harbor, and follows the course of events right on to the battle of the Sea of Japan, after which the - American gunboat. is ordered home. The history between these two points Is naturally lively.
