ONE can imagine the scope which Mr. Charles Battell Loomis finds for his peculiar humorous powers in describing ihe experiences of a family who spent an entire Summer trying to reconcile their city-bred servant to a lodge in the wilderness, rind succeeded so well that when they themselves were ready to return that invaluable lady had made arrangements to marry and remain where site Vas. As Minerva’s James utterly refused to migrate to the city, and as the Vernons could not do without Minerva’s cooking, nothing" remained for them except to become permanent dwellers in the country in Minerva's immediate vicinity, and that they proceeded to do.
This is the bare outline of Mr. Loomis’s plot, but plot counts for little in one’s enjoyment of *' Minerva's Manoeuvres.** Minerva herself, with her hysterical fears of all natural sights and sounds; her long-continued inability to understand why any one should wish to exile himself from the light and gayely and abundance of human companionship in New York for the gruesome loneliness of Clover Lodge, and her capacity for ludicrous adventures of all kinds and degrees, could, we are sure, successfully fill half a dozen books • if Mr. Loomis were willing to go on with the narrative. And Minerva is, after all, only one among several performers that served to enliven things for the dwellers In Clover Lodge. There is the midnight burglar, who, having been so unfortunate as to awaken Minerva while trying to get out of the house, where he had found nothing worth stealing, entered into a plot with her master for concealing his real occupation, In the guise of an unexpected guest, consumed one of Minerva s choicest omelets, and then departed—for
the next house.
There is Pat Casey, whose ** ould scut of a harse *’ was at the Vernons* disposal when better ones were not available, and whose ability for using profane language in a perfectly pleasant and harmless manner was phenomenal. One of the pet diversions at Clover Lodge was " to go down and hear Pat swear.*’
Lastly, there is the week-end party that arrived to stay over a Sunday and remained the rest of the Summer, much to the delight of Minerva’s lonely soul. Unlike most servants, Minerva enjoyed company.
As a star performer at an entertainment given by the village Y. M. S. C., Mr. Vernon recites that gem of the author’s wit entitled “ The Mother of Little Maude and Little Maude "—a thoroughly up-to-date story of a runaway. But Minerva's Manoeuvres *’ Is more in the nature of a vaudeville show than anything else, and it is not possible to describe all of the attractions which Mr. Loomis offers. They are surely worth a reading.
