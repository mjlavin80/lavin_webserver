F writing1 on English fictiotv*&s of English fiction itself, there surely has been no Jack in these later days. The two lines of production have so much in' common that the. most interesting and, fn .some respects, the most valuable of the criticism lias come from the fictionists ..hem-' selves, as American readers recognize gladly enough in the case of Mr. Howells and Mr. James, while in the cass of Mr. Brownell we have the critic born and trained, whose penetrating imagination and subtle sympathy would form no mean equipment for the observer and creator of characters had his pen turned toward that crowded but always spacious field. On the other side of the water, and especially among the writers of our elder brother nation, the business of comment commands a curious variety and a great number of active workers. It is by no means confined to those who devote themselves to it alone, largely, probably, because of the existence there of a much more considerable class than we have, who are closely and constantly interested In letters, from which the most absorbing daily occu-^ pat ions do not dissuade them.	^

TFTE latest example of the critic who finds time and zeal, amid engrossing labors in other lines, to perform	task	of	criticism,	is	W.	J.
Dawson, whom most of our readers probably know as an evangelist of remarkable energy, gifts, and success. It will be generally admitted that the temper and qualities of an evangelist of the type most familiar, especially in this country, are not those likely to make a fair, calm, discriminating critic. Sentiment and emotion play an important part In the success of an evangelist, as success has been usually reckoned, and the intellectual processes to ■which he is commonly—though certainly not necessarily—accustomed, are not those of deliberate judgment. But, as we have intimated, there is another sort of evangelistic work from that with which we are familiar, and we infer that this is the sort to which Mr. Dawson has consecrated himself, for nothing could be plainer than the fact that he is an efficient, careful, thoughtful, and extremely helpful critic. He is a patient and systematic reader; -his powers of analysis are considerable, his sympathies are broad, and he has, what is an extremely valuable gift, the historic sense.
We do not mean by this that Mr. Dawson has simply the kind and degree of historic sense essential to writing a connected account of *' The Makers of English Fiction,” (Fleming Revell Company;) that, really, would not amount to very much. A writer who could treat fairly each of a dozen novelists in the order of their succession in time, giving to «>a_nh an appreciation that would be impressive, and tracing merely the jnore obvious interrelations of their works, might turn out a readable work, not without its value. But Mr. Dawson does a lot more than this. He holds that a great writer both feels and influences the tendencies of his time, and he seeks to trace these tendencies and to show how far the greater writers Influenced or were Influenced by them. The result Is that one rises from reading his' book with a fresh, If not a novel, impression of . the very different atmosphere^in which the earlier and the later fiction were produced, and a clear understanding of the way. in which the earlier tic-, tion reflected in part and in part affected that atmosphere. Practically, It was a century between the appearance of " Robinson . Crusoe/* in l719, and that of 11 Waverley,” in 1814, and since the.appear-' ance of thelattern early anoth ei\c entury has elapsed/ Mr, • paw^nvregari&s^-pefoe
of his volume to him and to his successors, Swift, Richardson, Fielding, Sterne, Smollett, and Jane Austen, whose first work was issued from the press three years before M Waverley.” it Is a small group compared with the multitude that was to follow in the next similar period, but it was immensely important in its individual members, as well as in its output and Lho influence thereof, and Mr. Daw- . son succeeds extremely well in showing why and how it was important.
IT is characteristic of the spirit as well as the method of Mr. Dawson's work that he gives for each of the writers whom he discusses the date of birth, the date of death, and the dates of publication of his works. Were his book to be used by instrutftors in literature, especially in our high schools, for which it is particularly well adapted, nothing would be more useful than to put these dates before the pupils and ask them to commit them to memory in a general if not minute way,' and also to ask them to make up a brief table show- ] ing the age at which each writer produced his chief works. On this simple framework of knowledge of the succession in time of the works to be studied, the superstructure of accurate and critical comparison would rest firmly, and its lasting utility to the student would be substantially promoted.
In dwelling on'this feature of Mr. Dawson's book, we do not wish to seem to ignore the merit of his.
*
treatment of individual writers. That, after ail, is a test, and a searching test, of a critic's worth.
1Vo amount of grouping and classification can make up for careless or mistaken* or clumsy analysis and estimate of the several writers. Obviously the estimate must be adequate or the classification will be unsatisfactory or misleading, and the development of historic sequence will be of little use. No such charge can be brought against .Mr. Dawson. He is, a thoroughly alert and intelligent student of the' individual twrilfer. His judgments, are at once sympathetic and impartial, acute and interesting, and, above all, sane. We would call the attention of our readers particularly to a brief chapter on “ Religion In Fiction,” as showing the admirable temper in which Mr. Dawson deals with a question that might readily be supposed to arouse his most intense feeling and tend to the obscuring o£.-hls critical conclusions. No such result ensues. We may add that In a chapter on “American Novelists,” devoted mainly to Hawthorne and Poe, the author Is very nearly at his best.	E.	C.
