Several years ago John Hay, the late Secretary of State, prepared for delivery in Chicago a scholarly lecture on " Franklin In France.” Then failing health caused the abandonment of many plans, and the address was finely laid aside. It will be published in an early number of The Century.
Dr. S. Weir Mitchell has just finished a new novel the scene of which is laid in France at the time of our civil war. The same periodical will shortly begin its senal publication.
The Century Company will issue in Jan-| uary the new novel by Mrs. Mary Dillon, author of 4‘ The Rose of Old St. Louis.” The title is " In Old Bellaire,” and the ^ scene is a small college town in Southern Pennsylvania just before the civil war.
