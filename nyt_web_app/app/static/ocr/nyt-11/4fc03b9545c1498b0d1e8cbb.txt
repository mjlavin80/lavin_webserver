R E. V. LUCAS’S new “ Life of Charles Lamb,1' ubw ready in two handsome volumes, (Putnam,)	which, if	portly, are
none too large, turns out to	be not only
a “book of the hour," but something better—a book for all time; for we hold that Elia’s delightful humor, his tolerance, his well-informed modesty, his sympathy with his feUow-men, will endure in English literature for all time that literature endures, after "which there shall be no time that concerns any of us, Mr, Lucas retells clearly the story of Charles Lamb's life, its tragedy, its joys, its penalties and its compensations, that already had been told delightfully, to be sure, by Talfourd and Canon Ainger, and other writers. But there is a difference. This patient, sympathetic, well-equipped biographer has compiled self-revelatory passages from Lamb’s essays and other writings so diligently,	and to such good	purpose;	has gone
through	the pertinent parts	of Crabb	Robinson’3
diary, including many pages of manuscript yet unpublished, which Hr. Lucas was permitted to examine; Lamb’s letters and those of his friends, and every document and existing publication pertaining to the subject, to such good effect that we have here a wonderfully complete picture of a literary epoch, in which the characters of Charles Lamb and his unfortunate sister, Mary, his life-long companion, the objcct of his greatest affection and constant solicitude, occupy the foreground.

THE character of each is thus depicted with no trait blurred, with no merit concealed, ^vith no fault extenuated. The surrounding figures are delicately and faithfully limned. The young reader of the twentieth century, who has inherited no traditions of that glorious age in English letters, (when Wordsworth was beginning to write, when ” The Ancient Mariner ” was a new poem, when Hay don was painting, and Leigh Hunt, who first spelled the word " beauty ” for countless thousands of his fellow countrymen, was serving imprisonment for libelling the fat Prince of Wales,) has spread before him its full history. He can know much of Charles Lamb from this book alone, and will surely take up the ** Essays of Elia ”'as soon as he has finished with it. The biography will serve, too, as an admirable introduction to the works of Lamb’s contemporaries, including, besides those we have named, Southey and Hazlitt, Godwin, De Quincey, and a host of others. One gets to really know these men of might, who reads Mr. Lucas’s biography of Lamb. Many other friends of Lamb, too, who are known in literature now simply because they were his friends, from pompous, amiable Samuel Salt, his earliest patron, to poor George Dyer, everybody's butt, and Fenwick, the flamboyant journalis^ are here portrayed with a measure of distinctness impossible in the earlier biographies.
Women, fair and the reverse, witty and wise, gay and grave, gentle and shrewish, crowd the pages, among them sprightly “ Alice W.,M Lamb’s earliest love, who married a brewer; Dorothy Wordsworth and her sister-in-law, the wives of Southey and Coleridge, formidable Mrs. Godwin; plain piquant Fanny Kelly, and the friends of Lamb’s later years, Mrs. Jameson, Mrs. Procter, and Mrs. Cowden Clark.

MR. LUCAS'S own critical Instincts are true, and his judgments sound and valuable. He does not obtrude them. So far as possible, he permits Lamb’s work to tell Its own story.

the discriminating reader feel that he has a safe guide.
Of course, biography of this description has its
inevitable pitfalls. Some who have attempted to
piece out the story of a man's life from his letters
and books have failed miserably. Mr. Lucas has
succeeded brilliantly■ in this very effort, but he has
not entirely avoided the suspicion of straining a
point here and there. Especially in his endeavor to
clear from obscurity every passage in Lamb’s early
life, he seems to us to have wasted a few words over
a few trivial points. But, taken as a whole, his book has not many blemishes, and those it has will annoy comparatively few readers. The attempt to get at the facts, in every case, is made with a purpose good and clear, and the result as a whole justifies all the thought and industry expended on it.
Mr. Lucas, as we have said, sets down all the ascertainable faults of Charles Lamb’s life without extenuation. “ I am ashamed,” he declares, In that unavoidable chapter touching the great •'essayist's personal habits, and dealing with the famous and much-discussed “ Confessions of a Drunkard,” “ I am ashamed to touch the rule of an apologist.” Doubtless Lamb did drink more than was good for him, especially in his darker hours. Doubtless he never was a drunkard, for he securely held a position In a Government office many years, and there are proofs that the discipline of that office was particularly severe in cases of drunkenness.
CHARLES LAMB was, to be sure, no saint, and he was the last man In the worid to pose as a model of goodness. But, all the same, there are few characters in the history of literature more closely associated in one's mind with goodness. He consistently did unto others as he would have had others do unto him. The elements of true righteousness were strong in his nature. He was stanch in his adherence to duty. Firm In his convictions, enthusiastic in his pursuit of his ideals, he was ever tolerant of the beliefs of others, and tender in his treatment of their slightest vagaries. He was sure that Shakespeare was the greatest of poets, and " Lear ’* his highest achievement, but he could listen to Barnes’s arguments in favor of Dante and applaud his opponent's eloquence. As he was tolerant in argument about books—which to him were life— so was he tolerant in all the trials and - contests * of existence. He suffered hardship and: injustice; his career was hampered by sordid cares, which he might have shunned, as his estimable brother John, a living monument of respectability, shunned them; as his friend Coleridge eluded material cares. It was not that he accepted his lot, but that he accepted it cheerfully, turned good into evil, drew from the humble sources accessible to him inspiration for great work, that .the “ Life of Charles Lamb" is so well worth reading.
