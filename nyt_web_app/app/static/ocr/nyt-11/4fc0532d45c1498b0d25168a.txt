An Excel Ian t History of the City’s Great Market by Competent Writers.*
HE completion of its new ] building has moved the Now York Stock Exchange to cause Its history to be written—a history of more than a century—and It confided the task of preparing sucli a
chronicle to ■ its chief literary member, Mr. Edtnund Clarence Stedman. With him as editor in chief were associated other able writers on financial matters, and the result of their labors is a first volume of great Interest and much value. Although there are to be three volumes of the history, the first alone deals with the events since the Exchange was founded. Probably the other two will contain the usual biographical sketches of the members fortunate enough to be alive now. For purposes of review, then, the history may be considered as completed with the
first volume.
To this Mr. Stedman contributes an Introduction, and Mr. Matthew Marshall, long known as one of the ablest writers on finance, follows this with a brief article on " The Functions of the Stock Exchange.” Mr. Marshall—who Is really Mr. Thomas Hitchcock—does not consider that any defense of the Exchange Is needed, but he explains Its uses clearly, and incidentally shows that it is not the cormorant or viper or Moloch or octopus that the average man is but too apt to consider it:
The Exchange is for the time the common meeting place of all the sellers and buyers in the country. Being thus the central market for securities, it also demonstrates their value in public estimation. Because, too, of the facilities for buying and selling afforded by the Stock Exchange, borrowers seeking large amounts of money find it much easier to obtain them than they otherwise would. * * * Another important service which the Exchange renders to the community is t*.at it enables men who huve previously invested their capital in stocks and bonds, and desire to withdraw it, Lo do so speedily and without loss.
Speculation, insists Mr. Marshall, bad as it is, is not dependent on the existence of the Exchange:
To suppress the Exchange In* order to prevent speculation would be like cutting* off a man's head to cure his headache,
*	* * Were It abolished because of the evil accomplished by its aid, then Its functions for good would also cense. The immediate effect would be nothing less than the upsetting of existing financial systems. Governments as now constituted would suffer in common with the holders of property which could not be utilized. After the convulsion a readjustment might in time ensue, and something better be* dlscernlble. But there would first be ruin and a long break in the evolution of tne general weal to which mankind looks hopefully forward.
It was in May. 1702, that the New York Stock Exchange was founded. In the 113 years of its existence It has weathered great and little panics—those of 1818-10, of 1837, of 1857, of 1873, of 18S4, of 1001—and has constantly grown stronger, until now it is one of the great financial institutions of the world. At first the Exchange met under a buttonwood tree between GS and 70 Wall Street; of course its members " went in when it rained”; but Mr. Stedman does not say where they went. It Is not probable, however, that they met in the open air from 1702 to 3817. In the latter year, however, the Exchange reorganized and hired a room at 40 Wall Street. In 1810, when the cholera came to the city, the Exchange hired rooms at Broadway and Reade Street; in 1824 it used “ the lower back room In the rear of the Protection Fire Company,” and in 1827 it had the second floor of the Merchants' Exchange, at Wall and Hanover Streets, allowing the Chamber of Commerce to occupy it " after 1 o’clock P. M. on any day." The room was leased from the Chamber of Commerce. After 1S35 the Exchange used a room at Howard's Hotel, S Broad Street, a back room in 41 John Warren’s building,” and in 183G used a hayloft at
43	Wall Street—all because of the great fire of 1S35. In 1S42 the members met in the new Merchants' Exchange, the present Custom House. There they remained until 1854, when they moved to the Corn Exchange Bank, at William and Beaver Streets, and two years later to a room in the Lord’s Court Building. This was the home of the Exchange during the civil war; but In December, 1865, the members removed to 10 and 12 Broad Street, and there, with the exception of the few months that they used the Produce Exchange Building while the new and present edifice was under construction, they have remained ever since. Possibly they will always remain there; but it is not impossible that a century may see their successors meeting in Harlem.
The removals of the Exchange simply indicate Its growth. Mr. Stedman and his co-workers give a full history of American finance as exhibited to the

members of the Exchange: they tell of the panics,, the.deals, the “slumps” and the recoveries, the great speculators, the rise and fall of men like James Fisk, Jr.. of- tlie times when Erie was a. football, of Black Friday and the Gold Room were more than memories. They tell also of subsidiary activities of the Exchange— the Stock Clearing House, (if we . are not mistaken, this was adopted from the .Consolidated Exchange, anathema to the older concern,) the ticker, the unlisted securities market. These special articles are by experts, as is the rest of the book; and nJl together serve to complete, an interesting account of the Exchange.
