The Harpers announce that the advance
demand for Booth Tarkingrton’s new novel
** The Conquest of Canaan,” was so eager
that on the day set for its appearance in
hook form the novel was already in its
fourth edition. Mr. Tarkin^ton, by tho
way, and Mrs, Tarkington are now with
Mr. and Mrs. Harry Leon Wilson, in Italy.
The two novelists have leased a villa on
the Island of Capri, where they will spend
the Winter.
