Mr* c. S. Humphrey m i U s (Oct. that ho has '* discovered a curious and interesting misstatement of fact ” in Macaulay’s History of Kurland. Mr. Humphrey nays that while the charge is frequently mu lie that Macaulay is " inaccurate and unreliable, specific examples oi his inaccuracies are rarely at the tiny* r tii.s ot his critics.” Mr. Humphrey has one, however, un his.
In Chapter VI. Macauliy states:	"	On
the h of November (10vO> the House of Commons resolved itself into a Committee on the Royal Speech. The Solicitor General, Ileneage Finch, was in the chair," &e. Mr. Humphrey characterizes this statement as a “ careless error,’* because he says that Heneage Finch was Solicitor General only from lUUO to lOTO, and died In l«ks*j.	'
It is true that there was a Heneage Finch who was Solicitor General only from 10U0 to 1070, and who did indeed die in \GSr2. lie, however, was the Heneage Finch who, having been niudc Lord Chancellor in 1U75, was created Earl of Nottingham, and under his title of Nottingham is famous among lawyers as the founder of the modern system of equity jurisp ruder cc.	-
But it is of another Heneage Finch that Macaulay is speaking as having presided in the House of Commons in 16Sr», for Lord Nottingham had a younger son named after his father, Heneage Finch. This second bearer of the name was Solicitor General from 1679 to lG8l>, when James II. dismissed him for refusing to support the dispensing power. Two years later Finch took a leading part In the greatest trial ever held In England, for be was of counsel for the seven Bishops. He sat In the House of Commons from 1G79 to 169S, was elevated to the peerage on the accession of Anno and served In the Cabinet, was raised to be Earl of Aylesford on the accession of George I., and did not die until 1719.
Mr. C. S. Humphrey has confounded these two celebrated statesmen. He must make a more profound study of history before he really has on his finger tips a *‘ specific exampleM to convict Lord Macaulay of “ Inaccuracy ar.a unreliability.” A. AL MONELL-SAYRE.
