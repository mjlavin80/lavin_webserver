A DIARY OF WASHINGTON
WASHINGTON AND THE WESTi Being
George 'Washinsrton’s Diary of September, 17R4, kept during his journey Into the Ohio basin in the interest of a commercial union between the Great Lukr-S and the Potomac River; and a commentary upon the same by Archer Butler Hulhert. Maps. One volume. Pp. 217. Svo. Cloth. New York: The Century Company. $2.
THIS book is or interest for several reasons, not the least important of them being that it throws much light on the little-known and less-appre-] ciated business side of Washington's 1 character. As the editor truly says, it increases our esteem for Washington to know the details of his business; without such knowledge we are apt to think of him only as the " General ** and the " President,” and to overlook the "Man."
The hook consists of the diary kept by Washington during his trip in 1784 into the Ohio basin to inspect his property there, and to further a plan for a commercial union between the Great Lakes ! and the Potomac River, and commentaries on it by a competent editor.
Having found it indispensably neces-! sary to visit my Landed property west of the Apalacheon Mountains, and more especially that part of it which I held in Co-partnership with Mr. Gilbert Simpson. Having determined upon a tour of that Country—and having made th« necessary preparations for it—I did, on the first day of this Month (September) set out on my journey.
So begins the diary, which ends on Oct, 4, after a trip “ on the same horses since the first day of September by the computed distances 680 Miles." During that month Washington had gone as far west as Cannonsburg, Penn., not far from Pittsburg, and as far south as Staunton, Va. He was looking not only at his own lands but for an all-Virginia water route to the Ohio and the Great Lakes, and in the summary of his reflections, which follows his diary, suggests and comments upon various routes; this one, " (unfortunately for us) within the jurisdiction of Pennsylvania *' for some distance; that one too long, while the route by the Great Kanawha to the Ohio River ** most assuredly ought to be investigated."
" It Is hardly too much to say," asserts Mr. Hulbert, “ that it was George Washington who called the West to the deeds witnessed during the last century. In all phases of the awakening of the West —the Mississippi question, the organization of the Northwest Territory, the formulating the ordinance of 1787, the ceding of lands te the National Government, the handling of the Indian problem—Washington’s Influence and knowledge were of paramount usefulness."
Mr. Hulbert has devised a new method of editing. He prints the diary alone, with reference numbers in the text; the references, however, are not at the foot of the page, but are run into a commentary printed after the diary, which is a complete account of the journal, and not tho usual disconnected collection of notes. Mr. Hulbert's notes, therefore, are as interesting to read as the diary.
