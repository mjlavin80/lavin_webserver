$1.50.
THIS is a book of short stories of the sea, the first three of them connecting in the adventures of a quaint ■ creaUon called Angus McPherson. Angus Is a mixture of two parts Captain Kettle, three parts McAndrew, and five parts Angus McPherson. He is something new.
The story entitled “ The Dollar ’* is also something new. McPherson is down on his luck, and an opportunity presents itself where he possesses himself of a silver dollar dropped by the skipper of a barge on which the Scot works. Angus means to give back the dollar. He needs it badly, yet his religious nature turns uncomfortably around his conscience. Finally he is swept overboard just as he had made up his mind to return the dollar. His ill luck begins right there. He is picked up by a steamer outward bound.- The ship meets with a sad fate. Again McPherson Js picked up; and again he carries ill luck with him. He is a Plying Dutchman, and he’ll never see land again. After traveling around the world, at the entrance to New York Harbor he sees the old tow barge. There is a fog coming down, and in it the Scot sees the usual impending disaster to the ship he is on. He jumps overboard, swims to the barge and astonishes his old skipper by presenting him with the unlucky dollar. His Ill-luck ends there—at least in that story. And after all It was only a counterfeit dollar.
There are two erHier unusual stories in which McPherson appears. After tlie Scot meets with a stroke of luck that gets him up for life, Mr. Robertson gives us a number of stories which are varied enough to take the reader from tar to science, from Cherry Hill to Utopia. But the book is always interesting .
