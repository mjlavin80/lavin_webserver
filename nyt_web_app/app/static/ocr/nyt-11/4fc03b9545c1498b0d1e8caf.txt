MISS REPPLIER does not know how 'to be anything but delightful, and '	she has never been more delightful
than in this little volume. For the writing thereof she has dipped her pen into her recollections of the convefit school In which the “ Elizabeth *’ to whom she dedicates the sketches was her closest friend—the Elizabeth now known as the artist and author, Mrs. Elizabeth Robins ^
Pennell.	‘
With mucn ITQmor are recounted the little adventures and emotions, the trivial ^ happenings which loomed so large within I convent walls, and all are touchcd I “ the tender gr^ce of a day that is dead. * for Miss Repplier has a great love for the grass-grown educational path3, and that in the teeth of “ modern methods ** and women's colleges. In spite of the^ modest assertion of the preface that “ our successors to-day know more than we knew, (they could not well know less,)” we think It would not be easy to find school girls of eleven and twelve years so at home In literature and history, so capable of as-^ si inflating their knowledge as tho little group of whom Miss Repplier charmingly
discourses.
Indeed, there is food for thought in tho fact that few of our women writers are college bred. Mary Johnston, Mary Wilkins, Ellen Glasgow, Margaret Deland, Mrs. Roger A.. Pryor, Sara Jewett, Katrina Trask, Alice French, Mrs. Phelps-Ward, Mrs. Burnett—these are but a^few of the host of authors whose early education was much like Miss Repplier*s, with post-graduate courses similar to those of Mary Lamb, Jane Carlyle, and Julie de Lespinasse in the university of great books and of brilliant men. Since woman is not creative, it is our theory that her college training, especially the English course, which so prominently develops the critical faculty, tends to make her shy of her own powers, to nip her timid buds of originality, and to produce professors rather than authors. This, however, is a subject too complex for
easy empiricism, i At all events, It is certain that the large majority of women enriching literature today have not been molded by the colleges. After all, the kind of education of which they are the flower does not show up badly, even beside the most imposing modern curricula. How far it Illustrates the law of cause and effect is worth look-
inWentsr>eak for all of Miss Repplier’s readers when we demand '* more^memories '* in the near future, for the one thing which has marred our enjoyment or "In Our Convent Days” is that we have been permitted to share so few of them.
