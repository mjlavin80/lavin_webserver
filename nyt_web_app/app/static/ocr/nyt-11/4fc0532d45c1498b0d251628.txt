HE latest addition to the “ Country Life ” Library of Sport is remarkable not only for the interesting quality of the text, contributed by authorities specially well versed in the natural history of the country, where they have pursued big game with the rifle, but also for the excellence of the photographs and illustrations with which the text is supplemented and illuminated. Horace G. Hutchinson, who lias contributed many interesting volumes to this library, has supplied two volumes, which open up new fields of possibilities for hunters throughout the regions where big game abounds.
The first volume is devoted to sporting rifles, showing the development and adaptability of weapons for different sizes of game, with many valuable hints for the hunters. In the opening chapters he deals exhaustively with big game in Europe, describing deer stalking in Scotland and Norway, Scandinavian reindeer hunting and sporting experiences with the Norwegian elk and chamois. The style is graceful, easy, and animated, and the interest never flags, because the author is unaffectedly interested in the subject. Lnder the head of American big game the author includes the wapiti, caribou, but-falo, bears, muledeer, blacktail, white-tail, o\'is dalli, muskox, and moose of Alaska. The habits and most desirable hunting grounds for these animals are set forth in an interesting chapter, which is concluded with a short treatise on American and Canadian game laws. In the deer stalking Mr. Hutchinson describes with conciseness the way to succeed, showing the keen scent of the animals and the most desirable position for the hunters to assume when waijting for their game. There are several interesting descriptive stories which should be of value to hunters, and considerable space 1s devoted to the peculiarities of the habits of the chamois. The observations on elk hunting show considerable keenness on the part of the writer and a fund of information is contained in a chapter on Alaska hunting, in which Mr. Hutchinson strongly advocates the game preserving spirit of both Americans and Canadians, closing with a synopsis of the most important provisions dealing with big game in the various States of the Union and provinces of the Dominion, together with the closed season for game in all States.

PERHAPS the most interesting portion of the work is that which is devoted to big game shooting in Africa, Asia, and India. He corrects the erroneous impression that African shooting is getting played out, and points out that there are many areas of country in the African I continent where the white man’s face is still unknown and the report of the rifle unheard. Even in the last year or two i regions between Abyssinia and the Nile abounding in many kinds Of game have for the first time been opened up by explorers, and the sportsman who is not ambitious to make a holocaust of game can still find first-rate shooting in various parts of Africa among the many kinds of game, from the elephant, the rhinoceros, the lion, the buffalo, down to the tiniest antelope if he knows where to go and can shoot reasonably well. Big game hunting in Africa, as elsewhere, is shown to be a fine education; It necessitates a clean, hard, and self-denying life, It renders a man strong, self-reliant, quick, and courageous; it toughens the nerves, improves the constitution, and the sportsman returns from the hunting veldt a far better and more capable being than before he entered it.
Intending hunters of big game in Africa will find much valuable information as to the outfit desirable. The necessity of rifles of comparatively small bore and
•	smokeless powder capable of delivering an impact of terrible force is made plain, and the -cost of such outfit and commissariat, supplies will be of much value to sportsmen. In pointing out the most de-sir^ble territory for hunters Mr. Hutchinson describes the habits and peculiarities of the afilmals, and relates many interesting incidents which occurred during actual hunting trips. He says lions are still found in many parts of Africa from Abyssinia to the confines of Algeria arid _ the Transvaal colony. Leopards * roam all over Africa. from Algeria to within a few miles of Cape Town, and are widely distributed throughout the continents of Asia and Africa.

for ivory, and must now be sought In the furthest and most remote portions of Central, Eastern, and Western Africa, There are two kinds of rhinoceros—white and the common or black. The former Is almost on the verge of extinction, and now only found between the Orange Free State and a line formed by the Cunene ana Zambesi Rivers. The black rhinoceros is widely distributed and found in regions southeast of Kassala to North Mashonaland and Matabeleland, along the Zambesi Valley and in Portuguese South Africa. The amount slain in the last fifty years is enormous. Hippopotami are still found in most of the rivers of the African interior, and a few schools still linger in the Orange River.
To the uninitiated there are many features dealt with by the writer which will prove exceedingly interesting as well as . instructive. The courage of the wild ass and zebra is shown, and, while these animals are not classed as sporting game, they furnish excellent sport for the hunter, as they are both high bred and enduring. Hunting the giraffe and the okapi is shown to be the most fascinating of all pursuits, and to have a wonderful charm, leading hunters a headlong gallop through miles of country. The okapi is a near relative to the giraffe* although very little is really known of this strange and ! puzzling creature and its sporting possibilities. Antelopes are shown to furnish sport all over both continents, while the 1 gazelles, which are divided into a dozen | different classes, are found near rivers in all localities.

FIVE well-ascertained species of buffalo are found in Africa, all of them . more or less allied; these are the' Cape, the Abyssinian, the Senegambian, j the Congo, and the Lake Chad. It is one of the finest sporting beats in Africa, and found all over the continent. Other ani-| mals furnishing good sport in this location are stags, ibexes, wild boars, bush pigs,
| and ostriches. Considerable space is de-| voted to hunting in Asia, with valuable information on the habits of sheep and goats, which furnish exciting sport in Siberia, Turkestan, and Tibet. Deer hunting in the vailey of Cashmere and other points of interior Asia, buffalo and sloth bear shooting tn tropical India, and other game which attract sportsmen, from all over the world, are mentioned in detail. Of special interest ux hunters will be found the chapter on tigers in the Himalayan Mount-iins, which is the finest of hunting grounds. -There are not as many of these animals as formerly, but owing to the difficulty of hunting them in-the dense forests and swamp regions that they frequent it is improbable that they will ever be exterminated^
The concluding chapter deals with sport in Burmah, with advice and suggestions, the result of experience in hunting elephants, tigers, and leopards, which is the principal sport of that cojntry.
Many of the incidents encountered by the writers during their expeditions, together with a record of adventure and observation, furnish attractive reading, and the entire work shows not only thoughtful study and a deep knowledge of sport in hunting big game throughout the world, but will be found of special interest to those whose knowledge on these subjects has heretofore been a sealed book.	.
