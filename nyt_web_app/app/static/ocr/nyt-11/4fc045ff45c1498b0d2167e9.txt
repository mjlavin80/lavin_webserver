PICS OF THE WEEK.
PPLETON’3 BOOKLOV-ERS MAGAZINE has an interesting monthly feature in the causerie of Mr. E. S. Martin called ” Current Reflections.’* The pressure of news is a matter the monthly ✓ -magazine need not bother about. The writer of such a “ department ” in such a periodical as Appleton’s would surely fall in an effort to keep it closely in toucU with the drift of current events. The seeming “ timeliness ” of Mr. Martin’s reflections is due as much to the brightness of his treatment as to his choice of subjects. It seems for instance as if nothing new could be said of certain revelations in the insurance investigation a month or six weeks ago, but Mr. Martin finds a fresh point of view. He is a believer, too, in the efficacy of the short paragraph which, we fancy, increases the value of his causerie in ti:e view of many of his readers. Another contribution ,to the current number of Appleton’s Booklovers is David Belasco's essay on " The Art of Acting,” in which he quotes freely and ably from Shakespeare and Cibber, and presents a vivid portrayal of the manner of actor Shakespeare was i which does credit alike to the fertility of his imagination and the intelligence which governs it. Just three sentences from Mr. Belasco's article we have space to quote:
Acting is an art, but like other arts it is obstructed by a mass of unsystematized opinion.
The rarity of fine acting is due to the difficulty there is in being at one and the same moment so deeply moved that the emotion shall spontaneously express itself in symbols universally intelligible, and yet so calm as to be perfect master of effects, capable of modulating voice and moderating gesture when they tend to excess of ugliness.
It is because few actors are .sufficiently reflective that good acting is so rare, and the tameness of the few who are reflective, but not passionate, brings discredit on reflectiOE.
All of which we hold to be strictly true, especially the first sentence. The art of acting is an art without a formulated theory—that seems to be the trouble with most criticism of it.
THE late L. F. Austin, a London journalist and reviewer of distinction, left in the hands of the editor of The North American Review an article in appreciation of Sir Henry Irving which, though it was designed for publication at the time of Irving’s projected visit to this country next year, is put in this month's North American as an obituary essay. Both the great actor and his eulogist have suddenly passed away. Mr. Austin was regarded by many as the best-equipped man to write an authoritative biography of Irving. A sketch he wrote of the actor and work twenty-one years ago, under the pseudonym of " Frederick Daly,” is now out of print, we believe,* as are also the little hooks by William Winter and Percy Fitzge.-rald. Austin Brereton’s account of Irving's career and the London Lyceum Theatre has long been in preparation and is about to be published. Probably the authorized t blog-

r; HENRY HOLT’S article in ttte : November , Atlantic on •* The Commercialization of Literature ” has the charm ' of vivacity • arid frankness. He has his doubts whether publishing is a profession or a trade. Undoubtedly many of the publishers conduct their work (or some portion of it) with 14 professional dignity^'— which is Mr. Holt’s own phrase. The article is a review of that much-discussed book, 41A Publisher’s Confession,” but it is much more than that. It throws a stronger light upon a high-minded publisher’s relations to authors and to literature than the book which is its text. It is not overburdened with 44 confessions ” of the faults of others. He has his opinions of " literary agents,” but the agent sometimes has been little more than a pretentious nuisance. There must be room, even in America, however, for competent, fair-minded agents. Mr. "Holt discusses not only the' relations of publishers to agents and authors, but their relations-to each other. Certain recent methods employed in writing and in publishing he does not like, and he says so vigorously.	'
MR. JOHN MORGAN RICHARDS, who has long been conspicuous among the Americans resident in London, has written a book of personal reminiscences which will soon be published in London under the title of “With John Bull and Jonathan/* Mr. Richards is the father of "John j Oliver Hobbes,” (Mrs. Craigie,) and was -for a time the owner of The London Academy, with which he incorporated , .Literature, purchased by him when | The London Times gave, it up. He is { well known In literary circles, there- | fore, but is still better known among | merchants; and much of his book, we understand, will be devoted to a comparison of English and American systems of trading.
DR. ALFRED RUSSEL WALLACE'S book, ** My Life: A Record of Events and Opinions,” which is soon coming from the presses of Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co., is sure to prove a noteworthy work, and to arouse a fair share of discussion. In the evening of his long, varied, and useful career Dr. Wallace steadfastly clings to many of his old Ideas. He is something of a spiritualist. He is still an anti-vaccinationist He believes firmly in phrenology. He is, in theory, an extreme Socialist With it all he is a scientist of high standing, in spite of some of the astounding scientific “ heresies ** associated with his name, such as the theory that the earth is the centre of the universe, and the only inhabited globe, a theory which once gave him great vogue among old* fashioned pious folks disturbed by modern materialism. As a naturalist he holds a high place. He hit upon the theory of '‘natural selection" before Darwin's great book was published. He declares he derived it from reading Malthus’s "Essay on Population,*' a work which also influenced Darwin's thought At the age of 82 Dr. Wallace's mind is seemingly as alert as ever, and the 'Bjrtgitaft reviewers, who already have his book, find it extremely interesting.
WE learn that another exponent of decidedly unconventional theories, namely, Herr Johann Host, the advocate of anarchy, is diligently working on his autobiography, two sm^ll- volumes, of which * have ajK

and Mr. .John Luther ling’s bopk of ! senLimental tales, 44 Heim\^Ji?' deserve consideration as literature* Melvin Severy's new detective story, “ The Mystery of June 13/* has qualities that baffle an indolent critic as surely as its mysterious happenings baffle Mr. Severy's imaginary detectives. These books and others of note, such as “ Caroline of Courtlandt Street,” 44 The Game and the Candle/* ” The Yellow Journalist/’ and " Squire Phin,” will be reviewed as representative works of recent American fiction in the Sunday edition of The New York Times to-morrow.
CAPT. HARRY GRAHAM’S new volume of comic verse, 41 More Misrepresentative Merf/’ (Fox. Duf-field^ & Co.,) sustains his reputation as humorist and rhymester. He is as fluent as Hood, and his most outrageous rhymes (such as 44 jester ” and 14 siesta ”) will not arouse the resentment of his most sensitive . critic, because of the irresistible flow of high spirits in his jingles. Of course there Is only one Roosevelt. Graham’s glad song about our President did more to make his fame than all his other rhymes put together, and in his present book such minor “ misrepresentative ” men as Andrew Carnegie, Robert Burns, King Henry VIII., Euclid, and Omar Khayyam are comparatively feeble substitutes as subjects of the songs. Still, we are willing to swear that these verses are as good as any the author has written, if not quite as worthy as he suggests they are when he declares that they will live—
When Herford is a thing forgot
And Ade an ancient fable.
Of course the verses are not brand new. Competition in periodical literature would not permit trifles so amusing to remain in manuscript until enough of them were written to fill a little book. It is an attractive little book, by the way, well printed, bound in red boards, and illustrated with some astounding pictures by Malcolm Strauss, a gifted caricaturist.
THAT pictorial monthly, The Four Track News, devoted largely to impressing upon the public mind the desirability of much travel by rail, but always varied and entertaining in its contents, contains tills month a pertinent reply to a question lately asked in these notes. Referring to the disposition of reviewers to speak of
G.	E. Mitton (a lady Who writes many , books) as " Mr/' Mitton, we asked why women who write so often try to con- I ceal their sex. The editor of The Four Track News tells of a lady whose manuscript was very favorably considered, by an editor until he learned that it ! was written by a woman. He infers that magazine editors and publishers are prejudiced against women. This is
