** An Habitation,** &c.
Few York Times Saturday Itemcio of Books: During all the many weeks the above subject has been ventilated in your Review I have not seen a single com muni-cation which seemed to me to present a satisfactory opinion one way or the other.
Some sixty years ago, while a boy at school In England, our grammar book* as I well remember to this day, contained the following words treatins' of the indefinite article “ but * a ’ becomcs * an * before a vowel or a silent h.”
As “ everybody ’* knows, the English language contains a very large number of words which were imported from the French language. In the latter language the " h ” is always mute.
It ever been my opinion that In ail those words now part of the English language which were ** made In France ” the “ h" is not aspirated, and so take “ an ” before them.
No educated Englishman would ever think of saying or writing *4 a hotel," “ a hour,” or ** a honor,” &c., but always “ an hotel." " an hour,” ** an honor.” &c.
The word '* habitation ” is French, and was so long before it became English, and for this reason It seems to me “ an " Is correct as its indefinite article. A. C. New York. Oct. 30, 1905.
