GiiOse the Xutocrat and the Professor and the Poet once shed wit and wisdom ovcp breakfast cups and tea cups. Is no^ reason why we should not have, after something of the same rashion, the wit and wisdom of a' modern salon.
Certainly the talk of Mrs. Van Twiller and her friends, despite its strong reminiscent flavor, mab^s hgreeable reading; all the more as it is the calyx of a very pretty romance: Ah! that Autocrat again!
Mps. French assembles a collection of
•	typical moderns—an artist, a chronicler- of social functions, -a Major, of course a professor, and various men of the world and mondaines of differing’ de3Tee. He would be a happy man who should have the entr&e to such a salon as Mrs. Van Twiller* s, wherein the almost lost art of com'ersatian still flourishes, and the In-;terlocutars-have real*ojrtnftms And ideas to impart. The author usually keeps the light touch	go	of	unpremeditated
talk, though sometimes she strays to the borderhood of -harangue. The book is not only eminently readable, .but .very' suggestive, just the kind to lie ready to one’s 1 * - ' i hand, and to be dipped into in a casual
leisure moment. It fs always on the right side, sound and Wholesome, a pleasant and not too didactic corrfffcinion. Its note of modernity -^waakes it particularly attractive.. It is as if. a charming circle were opened to us here and now, in the city we ail denounce and lerve, and among the people-, the accent of whose minds we understand.
