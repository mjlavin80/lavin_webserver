As usual, Mrs. Edith Wharton has written an Interesting1 book—interesting1 in story and in style. She has also given it a good title. The onilieu in which she has placed her dramatis personae Is as fasci-i nating as It is irite and vulgar. Her ! heroine, Lily Bart, is presented with all j the art to the readers’ interest of which-Mrs. Wharton is mistress, and in spite of her weakness and errors holds his sympathy to the tragic end, and this, too, in spite of the fact that her position in the story is from first to last a degrading one^ and every step she takes, and takes deliberately, is downward to her inevitable doom. The microscopic analysis of a soul struggling with—not against—fate is as illuminating and masterly os is the art ! of the skillful surgeon, who with a bare bodkin dissects the tissues of the human body.
Mrs. Wharton writes from the inside, with the familiar eyes and the blunted sense that familiarity breeds. She “ nothing extenuates nor sets down aught in malice." She paints with the unconscious self-detachment of the artist before hts easel . the 'picture she sees. She takes things for‘granted, as though the scenes through which her people move were a world apart from any acknowledged ethical standard, if, indeed, to such a circle there were an ethical standard other than that of the crime of discovery, or the worse crime of poverty. Society per' se in Mrs. Wharton's book is presented in all the details of fashionable i life, Intrigue, divorce, gambling, excessive cigarette smoking by women, drinking, scandal-mongering, and wasteful extrava-I gance in living. Among all the tribe one ! man and one woman shine conspicuous because of comparison—Selden the artist and his cousin, Miss Farlsh, neither of whom is in the smart set, being far from rich and notorious. GIrty Farlsh is a 1 settlement worker and the good angel of Lily Bart, (who badly needs one,) and Selden is the colorless lover of Miss Bart, who fears \o put his fate to the touch until the grave has closed over his opportunity.
For the rest, the men and women are coarse, vulgar, immoral, slangy; utterly selfish and self-seeking; willing to use a friend to the extremity, and when no longer useful to drop him ih his extremi-tj', and, in the case of this woman, hound her to her piteous death. If this is a true picture of society, written with the art. and knowledge of one who is said to be a member of it, what an appalling picture* it presents! We confess the obligation-we owe to Mrs. Wharton for turning the-searchlight of her genius upon this pageant of decadents. Consciously, or unconsciously, she has written a sermon that thunders in the index, and reveals to the eyes of the innocent and igno-ranL, who mistake the whito light that beats upon the pampered rich for the sun, the hideous skeleton beneath the gilded trappings. The question arises to those who are only the surface of fashionable life. Is It impossible for the hereditary rich, who hold the world in a sling and have time -.by the forelock, to be other than brutal and vulgar? Are the gentlemen who dwell in Fifth Avenue palaces,
. own splendid country seats, and wear purple and fine linen every day, truly represented by the Trenors, the Dorsets, and Rosedales of Mrs. Wharton’s story? Are the wives of these men as heartless and immoral as Mrs. Wharton’s fashionable women? Does education, refinement, religion, and morality dwindle and shrivel in the opportunity and medium in which they are supposed to have their root? Does being a rich man or woman conduce to the manners and slang of the Bowery? If so, why do we send missionaries to Japan (or Timbuctoo, for that matter,) when the most conspicuous circle in the greatest city of America, according to Mrs. Wharton’s showing, knows but one evangel—the evangel of self-indulgence? In a word, “The House of Mirth,” with its spacious halls, barren of all nobleness, empty of all high ideals, might truly be called ** The House of Dearth."	M.	L.	LIVINGSTON,
