The November Critic has a portrait of Henry Irving1 as Dante for a frontispiece. Miss Gilder's causerie, " The Lounger,” touches lightly and entertainingly on many literary, theatrical, and artistic topics. There is an article by Randall Blackshaw on the development of Wallace Irwin as a Trumorist. Other articles on literary subjects are " Sonic Recent Books on Russia,” by Henry James Forman; ** The Popularity of Bernard Shaw,” by Lionel Straohey; ** New Orleans in Fiction,”.by W. S. Harwood, and “Lady Dilkes ' Book of the Spiritual Life,’ *' by Charlotte Harwood. F. B. Sanborn continues his Concord reminiscences, and Myrtle Reed contributes a significant article on “ Women’s Clothes in Men’s Books ”—a capital subject, by the way.
