persons, anti it is suggestive to recall the fact that Mr. Glider’s pen has never been used to exalt occasions of petty interest or to support unworthy causes, .The title poem is written in memory of Col. John B. Proctor, one of the most single-hearted “ reformers ” engaged in the struggle against the spoils system. Another memorial poem reflects the author's constant and discriminating interest in the American stage, paying to Joseph Jefferson a tribute of combined affection and appreciation. Among the occasional poems are the ode read at the opening of the important Albright Art Gallery in Buffalo and the hymn written for the service in memory of . Dr. Curry held by the Southern Education Conference in_1903. There is no poem in the present collection as directly and nobly pertinent to present National and civic conditions as that published in the collection of 18U7 and entitled "The Heroic Age”; but the stanzas called " Home Acres ” are impregnated with the beneficent and altruistic temper characteristic of the author’s mental attitude:
A sense of purenesa in fche air,
Of wholesome life in growing things; Waving of blossom, blade, and wings; ~	'
Perfume and beauty everywhere;
Sky, trees, the grass, the very loam—
I love them all; this is our home.
God I make me worthy of Thy land . Which mine I call a little while;
This meadow where the sunset’s . smile
Falls like a blessing from Thy hand,
And where tlie river singing runs ’Neath wintry skies and Summer suns!
Million on million years have sped To frame green fields and bower in g hills;
The mortal for a moment tills His span of earth, then is he dead;
This' knows he well, yet doth he hold His paradise like miser’s gold.
I would be nobler than to clutch My little world with gloating grasp; Now, while I live, my hands unclasp, £)r let me hold it not so much For my own joy as for the good Of all the gentle brotherhood.
And as the seasons move in mirth Of bloom and bird, of snow and leaf, May my calm spirit rise from grief.
In solace of the lovely earth;
And though the land be dark or lit,
Oh, let me gather songs from it.
