FORTHCOMING BOOKS. ]
HAT the American decadent poet, Walt Whitman, was -gradually and securely gaining:	English attention lias
long been a matter of comment in literary periodicals. ' It 13 natural, therefore, that I this growing attention should receive some j permanent form of expression. This J Henry Bryan Binns has attempted to do | in his volume, " A Life and Study of Walt i Whitman," which is presently to be is- ’ sued here by E. P. Dutton & Co.	|
\	The work is, how-
Walt Whitman ‘ever, as the author j In the Eyes of points out in his pref- , an EngliNliman. ace, not a “ definite **
life, for, the subject being dead only a dozen years or so, the time is not yet ripe for a final and complete biography. Mr. Binns writes from the point of view of an Englishman who " loves *r the United States. He explains his attitude as follows:
I have not attempted, except parenthetically here and there, to make literary decisions on the value of Whitman’s work, partly because he still remains an innovator upon whose case the jury of the years must decide—a Jury which is not yet complete—and partly because I am not myself a literary-critic. It is as a man that I see and have sought to describe Whitman. But as a man of special and exceptional character, a new type of mystic or seer. And the conviction that he belongs to the order of initiates
has dragged me on to confessedly diffi-| cult ground.
The book may be regarded as a supplement and commentary to the chapters of Whitman's life written by himself and scattered throughout his works. Suggestions are here also offered to the serious student of the poet in reference to the re, lation of Whitman’s personal attitude toward the problems affecting his life and drawn in his books. For the English reader Mr. Binns has supplied the volume with ** those elementary facts of American history of which we English are too forgetful."
The thirty-three illustrations will Include portraits and views.

The Riverby. Edi-
John Bnrroaghn tion of the complete Complete and writings of the well-Up-to-Date. known American
naturalist, John Burroughs, will be in fourteen volumes, ^arranged in the following order: " Wake-Robin,” ** Winter Sunshine," " Birds and Poets,” ** Locusts and. Wild Honfey.” " Pepacton," "Fresh Fields,’* "Signs and Seasons,” “ Indoor Studies,” ** Riverby," " Whitman,” " Light of Day,” " Literary Values," " Far arid Near," and " The I Ways of Nature,” in which Is included the [ essay on " Do Animals Think and Reflect?" Arrangements have been made by the publishers, Houghton, Mifflin & Co., to incorporate later writings, which will make the edition always up-to-date.
The volumes are being printed from a font of Scotch \full face, and in size will be handy 12mos. The paper is heavy, but light in weight, and a special make, similar to that of the Riverside Press Editions. An important feature of thfs edition will be the bird pictures reproduced in the colors of the original paintings by the well-known artist, Louis Agassiz Fuertes. There will also be contributed, by Herbert W. Gleason, photographs of many interesting views, including scenes in'forest and mountain, streams and lakes, birds’ nests, and wild flowers; by Clifton Johnson, who has long been associated with Mr. Burroughs, several portraits of the author and scenes In and around his home,'and by the Walmsley brothers, a series of English landscapes.
Mr. Burroughs’s writings are familiar to many readers of nature literature. But this Is not the only subject he treats of. He has to his credit four volumes of essays on literature in general, science, criticism, philosophy, religion, and a study of Whitman, which is his most important achievement in this field. In writing of streams and woods, and fn particular of
•	birds, Mr. Burroughs tries to make it as interesting for the reader as possible. He does not, he says, “ give a lot of details ” about his feathered friend, but he relates " the bird In some way to human life *’ and shows what it is to him and in the landscape and the season. He spends his time, when not at his desk, strolling through the woods and fields around his home on the banks of the Hudson, where he has lived since 1873, when he left the “ iron wall *' in front of his desk in the Treasury Department at Washington.
The long-awaited Moliere, Hi*	“ Life of Moli&re,"
Workd, and the	by Henry M. Trol-
French Stage.	lope, proves to be
-	a voluipe of 578
pages, hearing in America the imprint of Dutton & Co. The introduction, as is natural enough, is confined to a general view of the French stago before Moii&re’s genius as playwright, actor, and stage manager began to enliven it. Then, after a couple of chapters of biography, come two dealing with the French theatre at the period of Molidre’s early successes. Then are traced his " strolling" in the provinces and the story of his return to Paris. Henceforth chapters dealing with biography, play writing, and -acting, quarrels between actors and writers, between the Court and the stage succeed one another, and at a proper interval Is sandwiched In an essay comparing Moliere*s ideas of comedy with those of Shake-spearc. On this point the author says:
Shakespeare put some comedy into almost all his plays, purposely mingling it with historical or tragic Incidents, but If . one can consider his plays that are called comedies apart from'his other work, thev are so different from MoliSre’s that any fair comparison or judging of one beside the other is nearly impracticable. Not. only is Shakespeare’s level higher in general and in many particulars,- but compli* cated side issues constantly arise which show that their intentions and their styles were much .at variance....'*,^^-.Shafce--spcare wrote’ more imaginatively, with higher idealism, with-more poetic feeling: Molifcre more playfully, with greater satire or Irony and a stronger vis< comlca—each one drawing and painting.] fijs; jiictures -• truly, but with different aims or ambl--tions. *■ *	*	Shakespeart^rwrofe:r)?Oet'*.

Macmillan	Company is bringing out,	has	'
been rev is--d by William Aidis Wright, at the request of the author. Mr. Wright j explains that Bishop We.^teolt expressed i his wishes in a letter to him. in which he ! saia thut lir* wrote it after :i conversation 1 with Mr. Wright apropos of a lee tun* de- I liveryd by the Bishop, adding: “ What, i then, can be more appropriate than that f you [Mr. Wright] should complete It?"
, And the editor points out that he has en-1 deavored to do thfs. The plan of the. work lias not been changed; every statement and every quotation has been verified; corrections have been made wherever necessary, and additions have been placed in the notes, while the appendix on the revision of the authorized version of the English Bible has been revised, and appendices on translators of the authorized version and rules for its translation reported to the Synod of Doj*t have been added.
In his introduction to the volume, Bishop Westcott writes of the external and internal history of the English Bible* which properly began in -the fourteenth century with the dissolution of the Papa* cy. He says of his work:
This history is twofold. There Is the external history of the different versions, as to when and by whom, and under what circumstances they were made, and there is the’ internal history which deals with their relation to other texts, with their filiation one on another, and with the principles ‘ by which-they have been •successively modified. The external history is a stirring record of faithful and victorious courage; the internal history is not Jess remarkable from the enduring witness which it bears to that noble catholicity which Is the,glory of the Kng-lish Church.
O.	Eltzbacher’s 1 The Expansion of volume on "Mpd-j the German Empire, ern Germany ’’ is j	an attempt toan-
swer questions concerning the empire’s po-i litical and economic problems, her policy, ambitions, and the causes of her success— the author follows Germany’s economic history for the last sixty years, shows how the country has prospered and .developed, how.correct have been the economic views of her political economists, and how* " eminently ” successful her statesmen have been in their fiscal policy. Special attention is paid .to Germany's relations with Great Britain and the differences between the two nations. Concerning this, the author says:
Unintelligent Government interference by incapable or selfish administrators who , abused or ill-used their poeltJrrrf * * • i provpd so disastrous to this country at the time when Great Britain was cursed ! with class rule that nearly all Governmental interference is now opposed and j condemned jn advance as certain to prove , a costly failure. On. the other hand, a 1 higher conception of the duties and scope of the State and intelligent Governmenfal-Ism, Governmental initiative * * * which sprang from that higher conception of | the functions of the State have made Ger-t many united, powerful, wealthy, and successful, and have rapidly converted a backward and conservative military peasant State into a progressive modem Industrial nation.	.
The chapters, including several which
have appeared in English periodicals, deal
with the expansion of Germany and the'
problems of Russia and Austria-Hungary, the Kaiser as a political factor, the Social Democratic Party, the rural industries, waterways and canals,-railways, chemical industries, the armed forces of tlie empire, &c. There are many extracts from reports, speeches, and writings dealing with the subject, statistical and other tables, &c. A list of tin* many sources of information consulted by the author is given at the beginning of the book. There are no foot notes.
