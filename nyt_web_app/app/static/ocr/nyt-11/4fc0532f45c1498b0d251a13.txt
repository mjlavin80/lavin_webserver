MRS. BROOKFIELD.

Remembrances of an English Salon of the Middle of the Last Century.*•'*
Bv Arrangement wHh London Times.
VKX in hor old age Mrs. Brookfield was a beautiful woman, with soft, caressing manners und an oxrjui^itelj’' melodious voico. In her youth her admirers Included, besides Thackeray, men distinguished for various accomplishments in different walks of life, and there were few people worth knowing whom she did' not know. Tho letters and anecdotes which Mr. and Mrs. Charles Brookfield have here collected are so rich and abundant that the most copious extracts must give an inadequate idea of what they contain. In Mrs. Brookfield’s circle dullness was unknown. Her friends were all interesting, not for their position, but for themselves. It would be difficult to find in the same compass so much which, though only meant to be ephemeral, is really worth preserving as these pages preserve. While there ’Is an entire absence of pretentiousness of anything showy or flashy, the brilliant and yet spontaneous wit, the mutual sympathy of the correspondents both In writing and in conversation, make an almost ideal picture of what society properly understood may be. Clevedon Court, which belonged to Mrs. Brookfield’s father. Sir Charles Elton, Is the original Castlewood of " Esmond,” and Mrs. Broukfic-ld herself is thought to have sat unconsciously for tlie portrait of Lady Castlewood. Mrs. Brookfield, however, wrote to her cousin, Harry Hallam, the historian’s son, on Oct. I!, 1847:
There is a new* " Vanity" not good— except the wicked ones—Mr. Thackeray has now got a second Amelia. Lady Jane Sheepshanks. I wish he had made Amelia more exciting, especially as the remark is he has thought of me in- her character. And on the plea of two negatives making one affirmative. I suppose I may take the two dull ones of the book to make one Mrs. B. You know he told William that, though Amelia, was not a copy of me, he should not have conceived the character If he had not known me, and though she has the right amount of antiphlegm and affecttonateness she is really an uncommonly dull and a selfish character, anti very apathetic to the only person who cares for her, the quaint Captain Dobbin.
The truth probably is that traces of Mrs. Brookfield, who was the romance of his life, may be found in most of Thackeray’s female characters, in Blanche Am-ory for sure. Her own novels were never successful. except, perhaps, M Only George," and have been long forgotten. Her letters, though not equal to her husband’s. are excellent, and few were the men whom she did not Irresistibly attract.
William Henry Brookfield belonged to a type of clergyman now almost extinct. An eloquent and fashionable prcacher, a born actor, a really great humorist, he was a brilliant light in London society when that phrase still corresponded with an existing fact. Wealth had nothing to do with it, and rank very little. The Brookflelds were almost as poor as their intimate friends the Carlyles. It was a real intellectual aristocracy in which Mr. Brookfield lived from his friendship with Tennyson and FitzGerald at Cambridge to his intercourse with Goldwln Smith and Henry Taylor at the Grange. He never received any clerical .preferment except a chaplaincy to the Queen, and he had a vein of sardonoic humor which might have seemed incongruous In a' Bishop. • • •

FROM his undergraduate days at Trinity, Brookfield was noted as a humorist, the best whom that most fastidious of Judges, William Hepworth Thompson, had ever known- His pupil, .the late Lord Lyttelton, who did him credit- as a senior classic, records his answer to the question of Monck-ton Mllnes, “ Why did I see you coming out of that pothouse .the other day?" “Because. Dickey, I thought it too bad a place to stay in any longer.” He was then only a freshman, but the habit stuck. Cambridge men thought a good deal of themselves in those days, and correspondingly little of Oxford, as Brookfield made a point of writing it. ** I often wonder,” said his contemporary, George Venables, piously, “ what we have done to deserve being gifted as we are so much above those cursed idiotic Oxjford brutes.” Mr. Brookfield, we are told by his son and his son’s wife, the authors or compilers of this work, “ in the discharge of his clerical duties was punctilious as well as enthusiastic.” We should not have guessed It, nor that he was gifted with “ a genius for. persuading adults who had not received baptism to seek that sacrament." jfis constitution also must have been remarkable, for when he had smallpox, a highly contagious sickness, Jby the way, he’ “ walked, talked, preened as usual.” But these are not the reasons why his letters and . his talk "were'so vastly entertaining.

fool?” was the ready rejoinder. As Inspector of Schools, Brookfield wrote such rosy and candid reports that Robert Lowe declined to lay them before Parliament, thereby incurring a vote of censure from the House of Commons. They must have been a delightful change for ” my lords.” On the whole, we should be inclined to pronounce this the best examination story that has ever been told. Brookfield asked a little boy-of 11 to write on a slate his ideas about a race horse. He wrote:
The race horse is a noble animal, used very cruel by. gentlemen. Races are very bad placcs. None but wicked people know anything about races. The lust Derby was won by Mr. l’Anson’s Blinkbonny, a beautiful filly by Melbourne, rising four. The odds were 20 to 1 against her; thirty started, and she won only by a neck.
When this precious document was shown, to a manager, he remarked solemnly: “I am very sorry indeed for this. He was always a very good little boy till now.” He w:ur the son of “ an honest and industrious groom.” Mr. Brookfield was a terrible listener. On a visit to Monckton Milnes at Fryston he heard the curate preach, " evidently a pet sermon. I found out afterward he fancied Lord Palmerston was there.”

THE hero of this book is Carlyle. Nowhere does he appear in ’ a more amiable light. Nowhere does one get a more vivid Impression of the hearty, almost boisterous, humor which so easily evaporates in print. Brookfield often saw him under the influence of Lady Ashburton, who could make him do, anything except listen Lo Tennyson reading Ms own poems. But he also saw him at home, and Carlyle took to him as he took to few men. When Mrs. Carlyle pressed Brookfield to dine alone with them on Christmas Day, Carlyle, on coming in, ” put out his hand, and with genial, hospitable face said, ‘ Well, you’re a glorious fellow/ and at dinner the talk was incessant. but remarkable for nothing but clieeriness.” This is rather a new and an entirely wholesome view of that volcanic household. More characteristic is Carlyle's advice to Tom Taylor about lecturing: .** Just say what you think, but find out first just what you do think, if that be practicable.” Of Lady Ashburton, who had written that she would be in London on a specified day, “ D. V.,” ho said, “ D. never is willing; entirely declines-co-operation on any terms whatqyer.’* ** Fine moon to-night, Mr. Carlyle,” said somebody in the conservatory at the Grange. “ Ay, poor .old girl, she’s been hanging about this planet off and on for a good number of months now.” Another evening, as the guests separated, Carlyle whispered to' Brookfield for the name of one, and being told that it was Zincke, soliloquized: " Oh, *.jincke*s the name of him. Well, God give Zincke a good night, and may the like of him never cross my path on this planet again for evermore— Zincke ? ”
Carlyle, in the ordinary affairs of life, was the most practical of men. Not so Tennyson, who came down late to breakfast at the same hospitable mansion with a perturbed expression of face, his watch in his hand, saying with great gravity, My watch has stopped; what am I to do? ” After dinner he suddenly remarked to a lady who had been introduced to him earlier in the evening, "I couldn’t find anything to Ray to you before dinner, but now that I have a bottle of port In me I can talk as much as you like.” He was not drunk. Ho had only ceased to be shy.	,
Mr. Brookfield not merely read Shakespeare and Sterne aloud as no one else read them. He could personate anybody In any circumstances, as for example the mother of a devoted clergyman who had just been consecrated to a Bishopric in New Zealand.
** I suppose they will cat you, my dear— I try to think otherwise, but I suppose they will. Weill we must leave it in the hands of Providence. But if they do, mind, my dear, and disagree with them.” Happily no colonial Bishops have boon eaten, though some have disagreed with their flocks.
Mr. and Mrs. Brookfield do not seem to have known any unintevesting 'people. Even Lord Lyttelton’s humor, no ikugh-ing matter, is sanctified by a kind of scholarly halo. Even Mr. Brookfield’s dentist told him that his forceps had been ** in no less a mouth than that of the Prince Consort.’' When he came back to his parish after a visit In search of health . an old woman exclaimed, *' Lor, Sir, how you did startle me. I thought as how you’d gone to glory.” If adventures happen to the adventurous, humor besets the humorous. And, In spite of George Rich-znond’s lovely portrait, it is Mr., not Mrs., Brookfield who makes the chief interest of this collection. Tennyson compared him with Jaques. But Jaques had been a " brutish libertine." His cynicism was-earthly, sensual, devilish. Mr. Brookfield’s life was dignified, intellectual," austere. The fascination of his humorous-melancholy was quite g.s much In tlie . melancholy as In the humor.
