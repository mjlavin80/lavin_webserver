PLATITUDES! ” cries Dr. Van Dyke in his urbane manner. “ It is by forgetting platitudes that men and nations are ruined. Platitudes are truths that are flat, level, and therefore fitted to use as foundations. It is by building on sucii foundations that social and political fabrics are made firm, square and enduring.” "With this ingenious definition before us, the doctor can account it nothing but praise if we name these essays platitudinous. It should only mean that , he builds upon the commonly admitted j truths and looks therefore hopefully upon the world as it stands, seeing in it, at the worst, a needful and not unendurable stage of the world as it should be.
That is, indeed, Dr. Van Dyke's position. He names himself a “ meliorist,”
%
and, as such, discusses cheerfully tho matters which to the pessimist seem to doom our civilization while to the Socialist they prove clamorously that it is all a ghastly mistake. .
Dr. Van Dyke names his remarks Essays in Application," because he applies his principle of hopefulness or faith to the problems of lif“. And first, he inquires if the world is growing better.
Here, he confesses, the existence of appearances to the contrary, but he marshals enough on the hopeful side to convince himself that the world, after all. is growing better—with a slow, secular mo lion. Most men are of his opinion as to that—though, to be sure, some men would see little in some of his arguments. Piracy is gone (these would say) not because men are better, but because piracy in the old crude shape no longer pays. Murders are less numerous, for the same reason; ** woman’s rights " is a product of a change of economic conditions, not of a completer sense of justice— and so on.
The next ** application *’ deals with *' ruling classes ” as they exist in several forms of government, and argues that the ruling class selected by democratic methods is, after all, the best, sanest, and safest for a people in any wise enlightened. The means to get and keep “ enlightenment ” is, of course, education* As to tbe tendency of democracy to produce “ boss rule,” Dr. Van Dyke denies that there is any such tendency. The boss, he says—the gang and graft—are (in spite of the figure the words cut in newspapers) exceptions and not the rule— even rare exceptions.
Elsewhere Dr. Van Dyke deals with the rage for getting one’s social doings into print. He calls the thing “ publicomanla,'’ and suggests as “ one of the best antidotes a love of poetry.” Still other essays deal with American ideals, with the powers that be, with the " flood of books," with *• literature and the people,” with " Christianity and literature,”' with ** property and theft,” and with “ creative education.”
Dr. Van Dyke’s manner of saying things and the things he says have justly found great favor ’with the public ere this. These essays bear his stamp. They are not written solely for scholars. They are easily understandable, readable, while his “ sane idealism ” shines through them all.
