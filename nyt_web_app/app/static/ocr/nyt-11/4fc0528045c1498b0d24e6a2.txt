American Men of Letters.
Wcio York Times Saturday Review of Books:
In your Issue of Nov. 18 you publish .Mr. H. W. Boynton's review of Mr. Ferris Greenslet*s biography of James Russell Lowell, from which he quotes the astonishing assertion, reproduced in large type, in the heading of the article, that Lowell was the first true American man of letters. Where, then, are we to put ■Washington Irving and Ralph Waldo Emerson?
They both antedate Lowell, and to judge by Mr. Greenslet’s own criticism, are far beyond him in point of standing as men of letters. For he says: “ Lowell was not a finished literary artist, either in poetry or prose.” That criticism could scarcely be made of either Irving or Emerson. It might be claimed that, Irving’s parents being English, he could not be said to be a genuine American, but he was so essentially so in his work and ' sentiments that that criticism would amount to nothing, and as a literary artist he will stand comparison with any man of letters In his line—if, indeed, he does not stand alone.	*
But Emerson, with his three generations of New England clergymen behind him, was surely an American of Americans, and his philosophy, so far in advance of his time, ^.embodied in perfect form and style, both in poetry and prose, will, presumably, live when Lowell’s more ephemeral fame has been consigned to the space we keep for those who wrote especially for their own generation.
