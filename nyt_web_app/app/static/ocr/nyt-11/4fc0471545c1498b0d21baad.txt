CHILDREN'S BOOKS.
The “ Peter Newell Mother Goose ”— Virginia Gerson’s Droll “ Heart Family.”
VI.
[E “ Peter * Newell Mother Goose ” (Henry Holt & Co.) is one of the new children's books that is worth while. A long continuous story of 2G7» pages has been wov^n around the familiar old nursery rhymes by Carolyn Bailey, reproduced. so the book explains, " in connection with their veracious history.” Goose-land, so it seems, is situated down deep under the Enchanted Mountain. It is a very jolly country to live in, for the Mother Goose Rhymes people are always doing and saying such interesting and jolly things that no one can be unhappy. Being happy, however, with the Gooseland, as with many other people, consists in making a noise, and th.u Is the way this true story of the country came to be written.
Such a very great noise the Gooseland people make that the people living on the Enchanted Mountain above them hear it and cannot sleep at night because of the constant commotion. Then the dryads, who seem to be having most of the trouble, make a visit to the wood witch who lives within a hedge of magic mushrooms on the tip top of the Enchanted Mountain to aslc her what can be done.
Give this sleeping powder to the Princess Felice,” advised the wood witch, without looking up from the caldron where she was brewing potions, n and she ■will grow small and you can shut her up in a walnut shell. "When she is gone the Gooseland people will be so sad that there will be no more singing or music or noise.”
All this happened, for a mole took the sleeping potion down to Gooseland, and every one mourned for the little Princess Felice, who -was jolly old King Cole’s daughter. But it was not for long. A dear little girl named Debby, who lives near the Enchanted Mountain, finds the walnut, just misses killing the poor little Princess in opening it, lets a tear fall out of sympathy for the little lady’s troubles, and there the story really begins. The tear restores the Princess to her natural size, and she takes little Debby by the hand, and off they go to Gooseland, and the sights Debby sees give a chance for the pictures. There are nearly a couple of dozen of these, with a little
“ Gcod Night ** candleman for the tail- ! piece at the end.
They are not as Peter Newellesque as j many of the Peter Newell pictures, but I that does r.ot mean that a quarrel is to j be picked with them* They begin, not counting the title page, with the old 1 witch, her black cat, and the mushroom | hedges and the long-haired dryads and the mole returning with the nut in which I is concealed the little Princess Felice, j From there they carry Debby and the Princess through Gooseland. A little | wooden sheep runs away from Bopeep , while Boy Blue sleeps under a haycock; , Miss Muffet is frightened away by a spi- j der with a Hibernian face; Mrs. Pumpkin Eater, rescued from the pumpkin ; shell, is trundled off in a wheelbarrow ! fn front of Jack Horner's restaurant; there is Mother Goose’s house with Mother Goose on the back of a gander appearing out of a night-black sky; Debby | taking tea with Dame Trot and her friends; Old King Cole dancing with the j beautiful Queen of Hearts, and altogether j a very excellent Peter Newell book with a good story to picture.
IN “ More Adventures of the Happy Heart Family," (Fox. Duffield & Co., 51.10,) Miss Virginia Gerson has given the public another one of those delightful children's books which the grown-ups like | as much as the little people. It is all Miss Gerson's work. Inside and out, cover decoration, dear little colored crayon text pictures, and full-page colorcd illustrations. The Happy Heart Family and their cousins, the Valentine Family, are dear little people who cavort over the pages in a fascinating manner. If any* thing could be more attractive than the little creature with the ermine muff and her companion In the peaked-cap cape heading the table of contents It would be hard to find them.
The Happy Heart Family makes its appearance in the book in an exciting manner, being turned out on the beach from a catama-nanny-boat to figure in the frontispiece in the most delightful of soft colors, with the two jolly jumper sailors putting the boat straight while the teeny Mother-Heart and Papa Good-Heart gather up all the little Hearts, Mrs. Fancy Valentine, who dresses always in lace and an ermine mufr, and Mr. Funny Valentine, who wears a green suit and tall hat, fly around in other pictures, and . still another tolls the secret that the lit- 1 tie bird told—that Papa Good-Heart is j really no one but Santa Claus himself. The book is bound in soft rose color, with ‘
the Heart family in a heart in the centre of tho front cover. Papa Good-Heart riding a white reindeer and carrying his striped peppermint walking stick. There are illustrations on every page, and on the title page a little Happy Heart carries on a banner the motto of the book: ** Love Everybody and Feel Jolly.”

BARBARA YECHTON has one of the best of the children's books in her '* Some Adventures of Jack and Jill ” (Dodd, Mead & Co., §1.50) this year. Jack and Jill arc the two oldest members of the Carstairs family, a boy and a girl of just the right sort, who have the best kind of times. Their home is on a coral island, and a hurricane is one of the exciting times in which they have a part. But there are exciting times of many kinds, and interesting ones, which keep Jack and Jill busy from one end of the book to the other. There is an adventure In a cave into which the water comes at high tide, and the children are nearly caught, but manage to keep the antiquities they have dug up; there is a colored boy saved from the wheelbarrow gang, goat races, birthday parties, quicksands, and all through it all kinds of nice things to eat for the children’s treats. The boys In the book are " just perfectly dear and splendid,” as Jill says of Jack sometimes, and they think enough of Jill to make her a member of their “ Santa Cruz Club,’* and that is the highest compliment they could pay any girl. It is a good story for boys or girls, any one, in fact, and the pictures by Anna M, Upjohn are excellent.
There seems to be an extra number of girls' books out this Fall, and Annie Fellows Johnston's ** The Little Colonel's Christmas Vacation," (L. C. Page & Co., Boston, $1.50,) is one of them. This is a story of the little Colonel at school, of her breakdown and enforced stay at home, and the work sne finds to do to put pearls on a rosary she is stringing, begun at school as a record of days well spent. There is a progressive Christmas party, with many holiday good times, the little Colonel opens a sunshiny path in
the life of another girl less fortunate than herself, and there is the story of an engagement at the end of the book and the little Colonel, who is growing up and has reached her sixteenth birthday, wonders what the future has in store for her.
Laura E. Richards is another good writer for girls, and her "The Armstrongs," (Dana Estes & Co., $1.25.) sustains het; reputation. There are three nice girls who tell the story of their Summer in the country to their mother by letter. There-
is Pliil, a nice boy, who is ^also an Armstrong, and who figures largely in the story, though the three girls tell it. May, one of the girls, drops into poetry occasionally, and the following stanza was inspired by the discovery of what she felt sure was a haunted chamber, though other practical people suggested rats:
In the glGom. In the gloom,
I am going to meet my doom,
And I should not be surprised If it led me to the tomb.
But I perish sword In hand To defend my native land.
There was no sword around, and the *' Native Land ” hardly seemed to be endangered at the time, but the poet felt that the poem was too " short and barley ” without the last lines.

HOW Barbara Kept Her Promise,” by Nina Rhodes, (Lee & Shepard, $1.) is a nice Uttle story of two little girls who came from England to America after their grandmother’s death to live ! with an uncle. An aunt, unaccustomed to j children, separates them, and the older girl, little Barbara, broken hearted, starts off in search of her sister. This makes the story, for Barbara disappears for a month, having found a kind but mistaken friend In a stranger, who takes her in.
“ Helen Grant at Aldred House" is a
continuation of the history of that young
woman told in two previous volumes by
Amanda M. Douglas, (Lee & Shepard,
$1.25,) In this book Helen returns to the
school and starts in to make up lost time
in her studies. There is much about
school life and friendships In it, and a
few young men try to get into the story
at the end. There are pictures. " Amy in
Arcadia," by Helen Leah Reed, (Little, Brown & Co., $1.50) is a pleasant story of the experience of a number of girls in Arcadia. There are descriptions of the de- : scendants of the early Arcadians, with the historic associations, English and French. The girls become interested In some of the young people whom they adopt as protegfis. The illustrations are J by Katherine Pyle. " Cordelia's Pathway Out," by Edna A. Foster, editor of the Children’s Page of The Youth's Compan- j ion, (Lee & Shepard, ?1,) is a thoughtful book, bringing in characters the author has written of previously, although this is an independent story. Cordelia’s father has always said of her that she would , turn out to be a "sort of a carpenter.’* She goes a little further than that, and at'the close of the book has entered an architect's office to study and with a salary. There are Illustrations.
