PLAYING CARDS.
A BIBLIOGRAPHY OP WORKS IN EKGLISU ON PLAYING CARDS AND GA3I1NG. Complied by Frederic Jessel. Ooe volume. :Pp. vi.-3i2. 8vo. Cloth. New York: Loneroans. Green & Co. 1005.
MR- JESSEL. has compiled a very fair list of books on cards and card games—probably as complete "as any other in Hjngllsh. Of his work he writes In explanation:	'* I have described the
title of every work, however slight, on cards or gaming that 1 have been able to
' discovert and bave ,also included all-books \ which contain allusions of sufficient, importance ).o those subjects. Among books ; pn conjuring I have of course Included all books on tricks with cards.” He has also described books on conjuring and recreation in general, which deal with cards, -and are Interesting because of their an-tiqulty. A short study of the book seems ‘ to show that most of the entries are or Ameri<San v books, but probably Mr. Jes-seFs ignorance of American literature of the past fifty years or so prevents the ^proportion from bfeing even larger than it . is He should not be ignorant of English literature, however; yet while he might ~ pardonably omit uor ** Arkansas Traveler/', he ought not to leave out Bulwer’s *.* Money or Pinero's1*’ Money Spinner ” or “ A QuTet Rubber/' "There must be other:plays omitted which have, gambling -scenes or deal with the subject of cards Importantly.	,
t ‘ There are few cross-references from title to Author-or vice versa; possibly It is because of‘this defect in the construction of the volume that we do not find “ Whist or Gumblepuppy *’ recorded, and that In- . stead of twenty-four entries under " Bridge ** in the latest American cata* logue. Mr. Jessel’s book gives but thirteen. The book, apparently, is the work of an amateur; but if it does not fill the famous long-felt want, at all events it makes a place for itself with other bibliographies, and will serve as a basis for a fuller list when any professional bibliographer shall be ready to get to work upon one.
“ Childhood.1*
Prof. G. Stanley Hali, the well-known authority on “ child psychology." has written the introduction to Mrs. Theodore V?. Birney's new book, “ Childhood,** which -the Frederick A. Stokes Company publishes this week. He says of the value of the volume:-
The, proof of this little book has been mostly read aloud in my family with growing pleasure and profit. It makes liXUp pretense to erudition, and there are no' learned foot notes or bibliographies, but the author must have absorbed or quietly digested the best that the authorities have' to offer, or else she writes with a head and heart so full of motherhood and so freighted with its lessons and with the new and higher sense of its meaning that she has found the right way by intuition. X regret that I have never seen the home or children of my friend, the author, but it cannot be the fault of her instincts or insights if they are not both ideal. * * * The book * * * leaves for the most part to other manuals suggestions for the physical care of early infancy, and is devoted chiefly to childhood and youth and to both boys and girls.
Mrs. Birney is the founder and honorary President of the Mpthers* Congress.
