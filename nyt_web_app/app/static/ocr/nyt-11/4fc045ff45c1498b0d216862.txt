THE “ waif ” of Miss Broughton's story is no shivering and starving urchin of the streets, but a beautifully gowned, bewitching girl of nearly eighteen Summers—a waif none the less. In that nothing save grudging hospitalities stand between her and homeless destitution. She has an inheritance of '* drink on both sides, immorality on both sides, selfishness on both sides, extravagance and folly on both sides," as summed up by a stern benefactress. The girl has grown up beside a mother early left a widow, who, after an unspeakable career, has died of drink at the age of tliirty-fcur, repudiated by her family. “ Bonny-beli " has been well educated in the ways of the demi-monde of Paris, and in little else; yet her one object—pending some desirable marriage—is to make herself acceptable in certain strait-laced English houses which offer her shelter, simply because she is, in a manner, thrust upon them.
The plans of her shrewd, false little soul, the dire mistakes she makes, her failures and successes, Miss Broughton relates with her own captivating ease. Her presentation of her waif is singularly adroit. ^Despite one's abhorrence of the child's moral obliquity, the knowledge that she has “ never had a chance,” a certain innocence in her very familiarity with evil, her firm resolution to hold on to ** respectability "—all combine to overlay condemnation with pity. The character Is drawn with spirit and clearness, but there is almost too much of it. Tho reader begins to ask himself Why, after all, such a minute study of the abnormal? and to feel almost as tired as the poor little actress herself must have been of fier endless poses and hypocrisies.
The fine, though severe, Camilla Tan-cred, and her husband, a gentleman not only in veneer, but through and through, are the characters upon which one most cares to linger. To create these was^ worth while, and Miss Broughton has done it with rare skill and sympathy.
It is needless to say to those who know its author that this novel Is full of bright bits of talk, keen-edged shafts of insight, deft, light touches. While not up to her best work, it is still Rhoda Broughton— and that is a guarantee of interest, and of quality unusual and piquant.
