A3IKK[(’A\ COMMONWEALTHS. Louisiana. A Iteeord ot Expansion. By Albert l?helps. Boston:	Houghton,	Mifflin & Co.
THIS volume of the American Commonwealth Series is a part of that extensive and growing historical literature on the West to which such prominence and stimulus were given by the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. Mr. Phelps, as a contributor to this excellent series, has. of course, produced a work with'"Some claim to historical value.
" The mere fact.” he says, (hat the possession of the Mississippi Valley by a foreign power prevented and would forever prevent the United States from becoming an ecjual nation among the powers of the earth gives the final acquisition of this wide territory an importance fully ap great as the act of independence " which definitely committed the Confederate Colonies to a destiny free from European control." This is its importance from the point of view of the United States. Mr. Phelps shows alsrf that Louisiana was one of the finds on which Latin and Anglo-Saxon battled for supremacy.
Mr. Pliejps begins with the early French explorations of the Mississippi, fn the seventeenth century. Tlie fortunes of Louisiana under French and Spanish rule arc described in the finU half of the volume. and its history as n part of the "United States forms thf* second half of the volume. No formal division of this book into parts, however, is attempted.
In 1S04 Louisiana. was divided by the thirty-third parallel. The region north of this was called the District of Louisiana; that lying south was called the Territory of Orleans, and later became the State of Louisiana. It is with this latter only that Mr. Phelps is concerned after the division of JS04. In the later history of tho State, while guiding us through
the mazes of civu war and reconstruction, Mr. Phelps is clear, concise, and temperate. Even his designation of the Reconstruction bill of 1SG7 as unconstitutional . and tyrannical in every line ” seems quite justified.
While the specialist may not find much that is new in this work, it has for the general reader the advantage of being based upon the sources, and is not a mere compilation.	■
