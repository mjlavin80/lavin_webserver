Between them last night at Daly’s Theatre Miss Viola Allen and Clyde Pitch—If one may Judge by impressions and effects —made something- very delightful—something which but for two much sugar in the last act would have been a real play-real in spite of powder and patches- and the original “ Lady Betty Singleton ” behind the new “ Toast of the Town.** -
As for that act, tor the quality of it, Mr. Pitch has to answer. Miss Allen'S handling of it made it almost* inoffensive to the cynics and (judging by queer little laughs among the women in the house) moving and pleasing to many whose taste for sweets Is etill childlike and bland.	*	*
That act, too, offered an excellent opportunity for the character work of Ferdinand Gott'schalk—an opportunity which he filled admirably, ably assisting Miss Allen in lifting it from the commonplace where it belongs as one of th6 trltest of stage situations. Becky Sharp In her attic gives the clue, though you must imagine Becky as good as gold;
So much of dispraise to,h£fve lt-over and done with. For the rest; the play is full of good parts, well played, good lines well delivered, good situations excellent 1y realized; and is In an extraordinary degree a personal triumph f&r Miss Allen. She is charming, human, delightful, lovable throughout, even as Bfetty Singleton the favorite actress* of London town, Betty, who loved a Duke and married him (and found him more or less of a drunken beast) ought to be.J	.
She is Betty—a woman of frank emotions. high courage,- unspoiled belief in loveliness, delightfully vain, Insplringly inapt for neglect and unfitsfor compromises, hasty in word, impatieht in deed, but loving singly and to the point of sacrificing herself and the romantic other man—in all lovable. ■	■ .	.
At one point in particular Miss Allen did a wonderfully difficult thing wonderfully well. Mr. Fitch was daring enough to hnv« h^r answer a cur+ain cau—a farewell and tumultuous curtain call on Betty’s nig hi from her houseful of London admirers. And the Broidwnv ence at Daly’s had to serve for those enthusiasts and .listen to the kind o£ speech the Londoner?! of long* aero would have heard from an actress who was adored and knew it, a*vi gloried in it. whose heart swelled nigh to breaking with the pride and jov of it. Miss Allen actually made that speech and seemed to be Betty—made the Broadway audience thus suddenly, made a part of the play wish it Was that imaginary house (long dead) to which Miss Allen spoke with a gasping voice and a hand hard pressed upon a heaving bosom.
The parts of the Dowager Duchess of Malmesbury (the. mother-in-law) and of Roxana Lane (Betty’s -theatrical understudy) are two w;h!ch exhibit in different ways and with equal skill, Mr. FitctTs skill in exposing womanly foibles. The* dowager (well played by Fanny Addison Pitt) made a nutnber of reiriarks whose impropriety was amply excused by her '’■ener^ble years,, the|r jfoit; and.the.hearty applause of the company. Miss Isabel Irving as Roxana was a perfectly delightful iittle cst. Miss Alice Wilson was dignified and pleasing, convincing even as 9 very good young;woman; Mr. Harrison Hunter was mucn less^ efiective and horribly stiff as a nobly good yOung man ^the sacrifice, in fact.
Robert Drouet as the. Duke made a realistic brute in his cups. Mr. Grottschalk, who appeared only , in the second act. has already been mentioned. Theysettings— the green room of .Betty's theatre, a saloon in the ducal palace, a college on Thameside, and the attic already mentioned. are as satisfactory and complete us Mr. Fitch*s settings always are* The story is best got from seeing the play.
