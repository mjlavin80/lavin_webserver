ANIMAL STORIES
THIS RACE OF THK SWIFT. By Edwin Carlllc Llteey. Illustrated. 1—mo. Bostoo: Little. Brown & Co. $1.25.
WE read so many stories these days j of wild animal life> wherein the j
------- coon and the bear and the, gray
wolf* and all the other denizens of field and forest conduct themselves like ' ra-tlonal human beings, that these seven j tales by Mr. Edwin Curlile Lltsey, pre- | senting his four-footed heroes as animals j and yet showing- the pombre tragedies of their lives, are unusually interesting reading. There is a vivid picture of the she-fox, famished and murderous with hunger. The story, as Mr, Lltsey tells it, is almost terse, and yet one reads it breathlessly to the ena. He watches the starved creature glide stealthily along in search of her prey, he almost hears the feebla <?rWs of the hungry broody in the home cave; he sees the hounds suddenly scent the trail, and then begins the ^fa.ce—" the race of the swift,” and in spite of himself, the reader draws a breath of relief when the ppent fox finally " i:urls her tired body protecting-Jy around her sleeping little ones."
The other stories arc all more or* less interesting and well told'. There is one about the hen-hawk, a robber baron of the woods, and himself the victim of the great horned owl, the only foeman which could make the bold'hasvk quake with terror. Others touch upon other things^-one tells of the maraudings of a gray wolf; another of the sheep dog that “turned bad” and became-an outcast hupted by dogs and men; another of a wildlcat, and still another of a fierce Uttle raccoon that fought like a wildcat for right of way across the narrow bridge of a fallen tree. In all of them there is that Indefinable yet ever present atmosphere of vastness and the loneliness and the solemn noises of the woods. Mr. Charles Livingston Bull has made bis illustrations in keeping with the text.
