It the men who created the myths bad set to work to make wonder tales, as stories are sometimes made, to instruct while they entertain children, they would have left a mass of very dull tales which few people would have cared ■ to read. They had no idea of doing anything so artificial and mechanical; they made these old stories because all life was a , story to them, full of splendid catterrible figures moving across the sky orT.li.ro ugh the-'sea and in the depths of the woods, and whichever way they looted they saw, or thought they saw, mysterious and wonderful things going on. They were as much interested In their world as we are •In ours; we write hundreds of scientific books every year to explain oiir-‘world; they told hundreds of stories every ryear to explain theirs.	*t	^
This explanation of what Is- commonly called the myth la made by Hamilton Wright Mabie In his Introduction to “ Myths Every Child "Should' Know." which Is being issued by Doubleday, Pago & Co. *
