tri'C war of 1S12 is the subject chosen by Capt. Mahan for his latest contribution to his .verfes of works on " The Influence of Sea Power Upon History." His purpose, as those who have read his earlier volumes will remember, is to show the Influence upon evei.ts of sea power. The war of ISli! was, as every one knows, preeminently a naval war. The questions not maritime and commercial were distinctly subordinate, and would of themselves never have brought on hostilities. The subject is one which lends itself readily to treatment by a naval historian.
On the causes and preliminaries of the war, to which he devotes the bulk of the first volume, Capt. Mahan is most illuminating- His discussion of the conditions which caused the war is the best wo know of anywhere. He goes back to the nctb of trade and navigation passed during the periods oC the Protectorate of Cromwell an<3 the Restoration , for . the ultimate causes of the war. The primary purpose of these acts had been protection. to protect the English carry*11*? trade and to foster English mercantile interests. It had come to be a principle ingrained in the British mind—a ** national prepossession,*’ Capt. Mahan calls it— that colonial trade should be so ordered as to benefit in the highest degree the mother country with but little regard for ‘ the welfare of the colonies. In colonial
*	days, for exemaple, it had been possible to make,England the distributing centre ' for. colonial exports and imports, the entrepot, as it is called. Under normal circumstances it would have. bt,en impossible for Great Britain to revert to this pulicy after acknowledging American independence, for, of. course, Parliament could not legislate for the United States. But to effect the overthrow of Napoleon J^ngland pursued a policy which, as far as it concerned the United States, was virtually, a continuation of that pursued in the days when America- was still colonial. Capt, Mahan goes to the root of the matter in these words:	" In concep-
tion and purpose the Orders in Council of 1801 were simply a development of the entrepot system. Their motto,' * No trade save inrounh Encland ’—the watchword .of tho Ministry of Canning, Castlereagh, ^and Porcival, 3SC7-12—was merely the re-.vival toward the Unite# States, as an independent nalion. of J.he methods observed toward her when an assemblage of colonies fori i years before."
Tin* "Orders in Council" constituted onf> of tli** ift" clti'-f c.'iusi'S of the war. The Other w:is the praetiee of impressment. cGre;;t I'rit.iin asserLcd that her subjects could u< vf*r fhange their allegiance, and !h;it sreh subjects, even though found under a neutral flag, were properly to be *• iniptv.-^ed " ’-by her naval* power. That is, American mf-rrhantmen could be scarchod for British deserters. The principle upheld by the United states was fundamentally opposed to this. She main-tuined vliat the only jurisdiction over a ship on tho high seas was that of her own Nation. The whole course of action pursued liv Great Britain may have been necessary to compass Napoleon's downfall, but'it is unquestionably true th£t it-involved invasions of h^r rights to which the United States could not honorably submit, to whieh no free nation could submit. ** The war of 1S12 * * ♦ has not in.ipWy been styled the Second War of Independence."
The United States was slow in going to war. yet unprepared when it did go and overanxious for peace. Capt. Mahan’s conelusions are that at an early stage of the Kivnch revolutionary wars Washington's warnings to prepare for war should have been heeded and a navy should lia ve been l>uilt, that resort should not have been had to commercial restrictions, and that war should have been declared not later than 1807. Instead of declaring war when Napoleon’s power was at Its height, the United States wait-’ ed till that power was crumbling on all sides- As soon as the naval power of Great Britain was free to blockade effectually the Atlantic seaboard, the war was virtually over. All his readers will agree with Capt. Mahan about the “ mortifying condition to which the country was reduced by parsimony In preparation." Had the Government from 1801 to 1812.. been less hdxioiiS ?tr>;' re^ucerfjife; public; debt the war of"* 18T2 might have been morer pleasant to look, back upon. That^the United States, having just" declared war, . was overanxious for peace is showtr'by* the instructions given to our representative in London-at the outbreak of hostilities and by ,t!^e. precipitancy. with which, president Madfso'h' accepted* the Czar's Si-timed oTfer or mediation. In overtures . <jf this kind, os Capt. Mahan says. the£ British Cabinet saw not magnanimity,' but apprehension. The United States had

been unwilling to insure peace by timely preparations for war.
The correct plan for the conduct of the war bv the American Government was to take the offensive along the Canadian frontier, and to act on the defensive along the Atlantic, with such diversions as American cruisers and privateers could furnish by ravaging English commerce. Before the British settled down to a systematic blockade of the coast the little American navy and the privateers, as is well known, did excellent service, but along the northern frontier, where the United States should have been relatively stronger than the enemy, the incompetency of the army was such that a retrospect of the land operations in that region is not pleasant.
To one who reads this work carefully, and it can be read no other way, it will appear that the- United States did not come to the peace negotiations a victorious nation. The instructions issued to the American Commissioners show unmistakable signs of wavering. ** If found Indispensably necessary to terminate the war you may omit any stipulation on -the subject of impressment." The Commissioners were to do their best, to act on the defensive. The Instructions issued by Castlereagh to the British Commissioners are very different In tone. The abandonment of impressment was not so much as to be entertained. It was on a side issue that the British allowed themselves to be outmanoeuvred at Ghent. 'They endeavored to get complete military control of the lakes, and made a demand which the United States Commissioners refused. On this point Great Britain backed down to escape from a false situation. On the question of territory; the principle of the status quo ante bellum-was agreed upon. While nothing was said in the final treaty of impressment,.Great Britain did not in theory relinquish her claim. On the whole, however, the peace negotiations form one of the most creditable chapters for America of the whole war.
