CORTES.
HEEtNANDO CORTES. Conqueror of Mexico. By Frederick A. Ober. Heroes' of American History. 12mo. New York: Harper & Brothers.
MR. OBEK'S story of .Cortes belongs to the older rather than to the newer school of biography—that is, It seeks rather to. interest .the reader than to dissect the man. As a matter of fact, it would be hard to make a career like that of Cortes’s anything but interesting. As a briefer account of that career, intended apparently for young people’s reading, Mr. Ober*s book has fts merits. It takes up the history of the young Spaniard in nativ« village in Estremadura, (he was bora in 1485.) and traces briefly the tale of his yQuttx, how he was born to poverty and designed for the law, how bis tastes turned rather to arms, and how in 1504 he shipped for Santo Domingo with design to make his fortune in the new world.
In that island the Governor gave him a plantation and slaves, and be led an evil, idle life till 1511, when Velasques took him to Cuba. In Cuba, after some lively adventures, he was married (under compulsion) and presently sent~-out at the. head of an-armament to get. gold^ from Mexico. The story of that conquest, of the destruction of the ships, of the treachery and cruelty with which the Indians were treated, of the woman whom tbe Spaniards called Dona Marina, of Monte-_ zuma, and the end of Aztec glories, is in ' Its general lines familiar, to every;'school*, boy,' and. has been better told than-Mr.' Ober now'tells it. However,*1 the'telling is well-enough, and the facts seem suffl-dent for the purpose In "hand. 'Except for that purpose the book strikes one as distinctly superfluous. . . .	'	-
