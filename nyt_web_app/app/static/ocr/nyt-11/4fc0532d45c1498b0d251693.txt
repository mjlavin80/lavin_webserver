THOUGH lacking for the most part the indefinable charm that has so long endeared Miss Fothorgill’s' ** First Violin *' to sentimental readers, “ The Professor’s Legacy," by Mrs. Allred Sidgwick, strongly reminds one by its at-
mojsphcrt: of thxiL poj»uliLi- study in .Anelo-
German alliances. In this case the sexes are reversed, and it is a German maiden who captures the fancy of a highly inexpressive young Englishman. The legacy from which the book takes its name is not of a financial nature, but consists of an unfinished book on corals and of a young daughter, both left by a celebrated German proft*ssor to his favorite pupil and helper, the Englishman already mentioned. It Is needless to say that the book on corals, saving absorbed the professor's attention to the entire exclusion of his daughter, and very much to the detriment of her childish happiness and comfort, drops into the background ot the story after his death, while the feminine portion of the bequest immediately begins to cause her guardian sleepless nights and anxious days. Incidentally Rosamond has a wickedly 'coquettish aunty who entices her into various frivolous offenses against the conventionalities. From the consequences of these transgressions Guardian Dacre rescues her in a manner calculated to touch her heart. There is also a fat German musician named Christian Witte whom Rosamond thinks she loves, and whose coldness she finally decides to punish by accepting Dacre’s proposal of marriage and going to live in his English home. This arrangement results in the usual misunderstandings, and from this point on the story describes that most interesting
phfT.omenon—the wooing of a wife by her own husband.
The plot may not sound exciting, but the tale is a »?ood one in its quiet way, told with much humor and much excellent character study. The scenes, too, shifting from a German university town to a country place in England, afford an opportunity for varied pictures of life and manners, and Mrs. Sidgwick has made the mGst of her backgrounds, sharply contrasting the order and system and bleakness of Rosamond’s German home with the happy-go-lucky comfort of the house over which Joan Dacre presided until her brother brought home a wire. Joan, by the way, is one of the triumphs of the book, and the very girl to put the lady-killing- Mr. Christian Witte in an attitude of humble devotion at her feet. One hopes she treated him to a few harmless heartburnings In payment for the many he had caused, but Joan could hardly be depended on to wreak vengeance in any form.
Altogether “ The Professor s Legacy Is a verv readable little romance—a .good comranion for a railway Journey or a rainy afternoon.
