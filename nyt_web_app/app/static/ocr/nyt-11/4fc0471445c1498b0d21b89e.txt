is nothing so delightful In tlie holiday season aB the children’s hooks. Charming many of 'them are, and with illustrators who find their best opportunities in working for the little people, they alone mate the holiday season a delight for old and young. There are individuals with old and prosy minds who *say that the pleasure many older people take in children’s literature is a pose—they-have even been known to scotf at the universal admiration expressed for “ Alice in Wonderland,” and, incidentally, there does ~seem to he an almost too general admiration for that interesting book to make it all entirely sincere. But that is .neither Juere nor there. There are certainly-many books for the little people which‘are so sweet and fresh and fragrant in all their sentiments that it would be a great misfortune not to find an. infinite amount of pleasure In them.

That is a roundabout way of starting ln to say that there Is one of the new pub- ' Iications that every one will welcome with joy, “A Garden of Child's Verses,’* by I Robert Louis Stevenson, with illustrations ! by Jessie Willcox Smith, (Scribner, $2.50.) | Could there be a happier combination of j author and artist? There is not much to : say about the verses, for that has been said long. ago. They are all there, every one of them, singing themselves sometimes by their own rhythm and some- ! times by other music. One of the latter is I that pretty little one, "My Bed is a i Boat," which Cecilia Loftus set to a ! lullaby and May Irwin sang once upon a time and other people in their homes have sung since because it is so charming. This is the familiar first verse:
My bed is like a little boat;
Nurse helps me in when I embark;
She girds me in my sailor’s coat And starts me in the dark.
And the pictures tell, the story' of the verses. There are black and white text pictures and exquisite full-page .colored ones. The illustration on the cover is excellent. The book is a large, square one, 125 pages of heavy paper, the cover a dark blue, the design done in blue and green and gold and white all in soft tones. There is a gateway with white posts on either side, the gate in iron grille work, and behind it a pathway, upon which two children can be seen, stretches out j between lines of trees In-the dull blues and greens. Between these the sky shows in the gold, but soft and dull, and the white ! of the gate posts is softened with blue.
There is undoubtedly that strange little 1 boy Robert Louis Stevenson himself in , the first of the pictures, a little chap high jjp ln a big tree who tells of it;
Z held the trunk with both my hands And looked abroad on foreign lands.
There is another picture of soft brown rocks, an indigo blue sea, and more blue with a touch of green in the sky, while the boy who, with his shadow, is the central figure, says;
He stays so close beside me, he’s a coward, you can see;
J*d think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me.
There is ** The Land of Counterpane," a picture with the soldiers and little villages making bright tones upon the subdued white of the bed* there is another charming shadow picture, the brave little man with hie; candle who can
Face with an undaunted tread The long, black passage up to bed;
*
and a flower picture with long stalks of many-colored blossoms and the figure of ft child, who knows them all, crouched In among them:
All the names I know from nurse; Gardener’s garters, Shepherd’s purse, Bachelor’s buttons, Lady’s smock And the lady Hollyhock.

Avery nice new book with many delightful full-page colored pictures and black and white sketches is M Humpty Dumpty," by Anna Alice Chapin, pictured by Ethel and Franklin Betts, (Dodd, Mead & Co., ^L40.) This Is another large square book of 206 pages.
It Is a brand new story of Humpty Dumpty, and the author says it is the true one. It is long, in prose, a history of the experiences of Meg, Bab, and Dick. The three are not the best children that ever were, they complain about always having eggs for tea—that Is where Humpty comes In—and through this they have many novel experiences. This Is the kind of children they were:
They were quite pretty children. Meg had yellow hair, Bab black, and Dick brown; they looked far too nice to be so horrid. And, as a matter of fact, they were really down in their hearts much nicer than they seemed. The whole trouble with them was that—and this is a dreadful thing to say of any child—they would have nothing to do with Make Believe Land.
The inside cover pages of the book show the three children flying away on the , hack of a big owl, with black bats hover-
ing around, which proves conclusively that they are making a midnight Journey.
A bright colored book for this very little people, every page a picture, with the text o?Iy an Incidental, is " Flower Babies," by Elisabeth May, illustrated by Ida May Rockwell, (The Saalfield Publishing Company, $1.25.) It is a large square book of paper covered boards, each page devoted to an individual flower, verses and the flowers themselves In colors with always .a few figures of the little people. A colored ^frontispiece shows a picture of Dorothy, the little girl to whom the book is dedicated. . ,	‘
The story of Noah’s Aik, told and pictured by E. Boyd Smith, (Houghton, Mifflin & Co., $2,) Is. excellent It is one of the books with greater breadth than depth, bound in paper-covered boards. The cover decorations are goodr Noah Is there with paper—or papyrus—and compass, deep in meditation; evidently trying to fit the large company of animals gathered before him In hieroglyphic form into a very small and primitive ark.
Inside the hook are full-page pictures, beautifully donef in charming, subdued colors. There is a paragraph or so of text opposite each picture. An interesting chapter is "The Dinosaur's Dilemma,” accompanied by a realistic picture. The reason these creatures are extinct is because they could not get into the ark.
“ And then came even .the huge dinosaurs," says the book, " for in those days were mighty beasts. But they were too big for the door, and could not squeeze in.”

builds a boat which Is launched in great ceremony with a bottle of soda pop cracked over the bows by a pretty little girl, and Gilbert playing upon the violin the while.
