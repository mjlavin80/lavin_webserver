B depart for once this week from our custom and give space on the readers* page to a communication, from which the writer withheld
-	her signature; for we may reasonably assume that the author of the fierce protest against the opinion of- " The House of Mirth ” signed " Newport,*’ which we printed ■ as a communication last week, is a lady. Her letter is' obviously sincere and an authentic expression of opinion, and for her sake we break a rule, which shall not be broken again. She is mistaken, however, in assuming that any one who regularly reads The New York Times Book Review has obtained from it the idea that Mrs* Wharton’s novel is not a worthy work of literary a£rt. From the very beginning of its serial publication we followed it, so to speak, step by step with admiring comment. Since its appearance in book form The New York Times has published a very favorable review of the novel. Of course, our readers’ page is open at all times to sane expressions of honest opinion on all literary subjects. It is a poor book that does not provoke discussion. We were very, glad to print " Newport's " adverse opinion of “ The House of Mirth-'* It, too, was o&viausly sincere, and it was ably expressed. Such things increase the gayety of living and tend to the development of literary culture by stirring up trains of thought where thought has previously been sluggish. “ Newport," by the way, is not, as “ Lenox ” supposes, a woman, but a mere man, of mature years, who, we doubt not, has " heard the chimes at midnight '* and has, off and on, mingled in fairly good society. He is a correspondent from whom we would be glad to hear frequently, So, for that matter, is “ Lenox,” whose communication we cheerfully print, al- j though she has neglected to send us her name and address, “ not neces- ! satfly for publication,” but as a guarantee of good faith.
ANEW book of the near future (it , is- even now in the press) is Mr. Holman Hunt’s history of an art epoch, •* Pre-Raphael!tism and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood." This will involve a revelation from an authority of the inner sanctuary. But it will be more than a panegyric of pre-Raphaelitism. It .will be truly a history of art development. There will be two volumes, appropriately illustrated.
OUR London correspondent announced some weeks ago the further postponement of the publication of the long-promised ** Letters of Queen Victoria ” until the Autumn of 190G. It seems that this book is to have even more importance than that which naturally attaches to a fresh revelation of the personality of a sovereign. One of the London literary paragraphers declares that it will " throw new light ” (blessed phrase!) on historical matters of vast importance, to wit, the causes and conduct of tSie Crimean war, the agita-

N EXT Friday and Saturday, as already announced, . the Holiday Book*. Number of The New York Times Book -Review will be issued in two parts, which will be combined in-' ■ , ** - ■ -“one perfect whole ” for distribution among the out-of-town and foreign subscribers to The Book Review and the booksellers throughout the coun-" " * try. Besides the special features already announced,, including two classified descriptive lists of books for holiday reading, and special articles on timely subjects by &Iay Sinclair, Bran-der Matthews, Clement' K. Shorter, Hamilton W. Mabie, and Max Pemberton, there will also be a selection of signed reviews of important books by such specialists in various branches of literature as Prof- William E. Dodd, Edward Cary, William Aspenwall Bradley ^ Christian Gauss, -Bliss Carman, Montgomery Schuyler, Elisabeth Luther Cary, Wolf von Schierbrand, and others. Miss Sinclair will write of certain young American poets, Prof. Matthews of biographies and critical editions of MolISre, Mr. Shorter of " American Books in English Bookshops," Dr. Mabie of ” Some Books Worth Reading," and Mr. Pemberton of *' Some Tendencies of the English Novel.” This will easily be the most notable literary publication in the history of American daily journalism.
MR. OLIVER HERFORD’S annual Christmas offering to the multitude is called ** The Fairy Godmother-in-Law,” and it tells in fluent verse, with many Herfordlike quips, the story of the early married life of Cinderella and her Prince, until their inevitable divorce, since which, we are given to understand,, they have lived happily. Nobody before Mr. Herford had ever realized that Cinderella’s Fairy Godmother became the poor Prince’s Fairy Godmother-in-law. Mr. Herford shows how she developed into an even more trying personage to live with than an ordinary mother-in-law. Mr. Herford’s verses are fine examples of “ airy-nothingness,” as for instance:
Who was the Somebody of Note?
(I never could remember names.) Was it Mark Twain or Mr. Choate,
Or Mrs. Ward, or Henry James That'penned those words of wise import,
44	Who weds in haste repents—in court V"
The little book, published by the Scribners, is illustrated with some remarkable pictures drawn by the poet himself, and contains a fair selection of other jingles by Mr. Herford. There Is, by the way, another Herford book' on hand for consideration, and one of quite another sort, although in the published writings of the Rev. Brooke Herford, so long a pillar in Boston Unitarianism, there is an appreciable hint of the whimsical humor which has made his son famous. The American Unitarian Association has published, in a pretty volume for holiday circulation, a collection of the early
► j
” Pulpit and Pew ” papers of Brooke Herford under the title of “ Eutychus and His Relations,” These were written in the years 1SG0 and 1301, and, it is said, ” made some little stir in their day.” Some of the subjects are ** A ‘ Lay ” View of Sleeping in Church,” " Some People Who Always Come Late,” “ A Country Tea Party,” and “ Parsonic Acid.” The “acid” described in this last essay “ is a certain pungent kind pf talk which is usually emitted where parsons do much congregate together.”
ELISABETH LUTHER CARY edits for Messrs. Moffat, Yard & Co. a comely new edition of “ Aesop’s Fables,” which is illustrated in new,, style, and cleverly, by J. M. Condfi. The humanized animals of the fabulist

Townsend’s translation from the Greek. Miss Cary finds in Aesop “ theplay of reason over the vast unreasonable - human world, the dance of the comic spirit in the . psychological recesses of man’s aston-lshing nature.”	..
MR. GEORGE MOORE'S new novel, " The Lake,” as might have been expected, is another intimate study of animalism. A priest denounces a girl for sin, and thereafter fears his denunciation has driven her to suicide in the lake, by whose shore he walks daily, and whose mysterious beauty affects him strongly. But the girl is not dead. She triumphs over certain formidable obstacles, and presently begins a correspondence^ with him. Hence much splendid raving about Wagner’s music and the fine arts. The girl does arouse a spirit of aestheticism in the priest, but her evil influence undermines his character. The book ends with an interrogation point—which may be taken as a promise of a sequel. Mr. Moore is given to sequels. His novel is praised in London for many passages of good writing, and will soon be published here, where it may secure the commendation of many who have been moved to enthusiasm by “ The Garden of Allah.” We doubt, however, if Mr, Moore is ever quite as sincere as Mr. Hichens can be in his sincerer moods.
A CHARMING book for a holiday gift is Thackeray’s “ Henry Esmond,” (Macmillan,) with an introduction by Austin Dobson and many good pictures by Hugh Thompson.. Mr. Dobson’s little essay, written as lately as this very Autumn, is all in his gentlest, most sympathetic mood. What other work of English fiction, indeed, could better enlist the best efforts of Austin Dobson? He tells the story of the book's origin, the manner of its composition, its reception by the reviewers, lucfdly, tenderly, and with sound judgment. Mr. Thompson has lately been illustrating books of Jane Austen, "Cranford,” and James Lane Allen’s 11 Kentucky Cardinal." We have seen no work of his more agree-
*
ble and appropriate than these ” Esmond ” pictures. Beatrix in her prime and in her childhood is as near to one’s ideal as possible. So Is Esmond’s ” dear lady.” The composition is all good, and the subjects selected for illustration are appropriate. The book is handsomely bound and well printed.
SOME striking books of the season are largely made up of blank leaves. Such is “ The Beautiful Birthday Book ” (Macmillan,) an octavo volume of handsome appearance, containing numbered spaces, for every day In the year, wherein you may record your friends’ anniversaries, and at the beginning of each month a quotation from some notable work of literature, with a fine colored print illustrating it. Milton, Dickens, Thackeray, George Eliot, the Brownings, and Lord Lytton are among the authors drawn upon. The book is^ood to look at, and doubtless it is useful. An “ Essay on Silence,” by Elbert Hubbard (East Aurora) is made of fair blank 'pages.

R. JOHN MORGAN RICHARDS, sometimes politely ^called ” the Dean of the American- CoUmy in London,” accompanied his daughter, Mrs. Craigie, to this country, and sails on his return voyage to-day on the Caronla. Mr. Richards’s new book, " With Johh Bull and Jonathan,” to which we referred a. fortnight, or so ago, has - already been published in England, and .will be brought out here by the Appletons in January.
