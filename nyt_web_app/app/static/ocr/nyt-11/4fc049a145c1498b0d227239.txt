LOVE ALONE IS I-OltO. By F. Frankfort Tklooro. r*p. SOU. U!mo. G. 1*. Putnam's Sons. $1.50.
IT has always been the custom of the historical novelist to introduce Imaginary personages, upon whom he depends for his love-story. The reader has thus the pleading element of uncertainty, which incalculably heightens the Interest of romance. The writer of the biographical novel has no such resource; If he departs from fact we feel defrauded; If he adheres to ft we are likely to be bored. Mr. Moore follows closely the career of Lord Byron from his boyhood to the point where Mary Chaworth passes out* of his life, but we so well know the end from the beginning that we read languidly the many pages, stirred only to an occasional protest against the presentation of the hero as a rather estimable young man, by no means *' mad, bad, and dangerous to know." Mr. Moore's Byron Is hotly pursued by women to a degree confirmatory of Bernard Shaw’s most radical .utterances. Lady Caroline Lamb is prominent in the story, as well as Lady Melbourne, Moore, Sheridan, Kean, Mme. de Stael, and all die brilliant London world upon which Byron flashed like a meteor. The London life 13 much the best feature of the bcok, full of clever talk and dramatic action. The author has made a careful and sympathetic
study of his hero, concluding, we think correctly, that at least until his marriage, nine-tenths of his escapades were undertaken with intent to " make the British matron sit up."
But somehow .the book leaves us cold— perhaps because we know the story too well, perhaps because there Is too much of it, perhaps because It is more photographic than artistic—dud perhaps because wo have read “ The Miirrlage of William Ashe/'
