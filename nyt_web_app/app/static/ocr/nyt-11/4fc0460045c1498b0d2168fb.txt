Then comes the Ugly Prince, who always wears a mask because he is so ugly, and frees the Princess after many adventures. That brings the suffering, because, seeing the Prince without his mask, the Princess refuses to marry him. The golden heart gives good advice just here.

For a first-class, interesting story there Is nothing that has appeared this season much better than •* The Brass Bound Trunk,” by Evelyn Raymond, (Dana Estes & Co., $1.25.) It is a story of village life into which a little city girl appears, ar.d it is with her arrival that exciting things begin'to happen. TKe brass-bound box is one of them, and so is a Hallowe'en '* Corkis," by means of which Uncle Moses Jones is elected Constable in an irregular but entirely satisfactory manner. There is the return of a lost son; hidden jewels and valuables, to reinstate an old family, are found, and with all the excitement ft ’s a thoroughly healthy and wholesome story, as well as a most enjoyable one. It is supposed to be a girl’s story, as the principal character is a girl, but there is a nice boy, too, and not many older people beginning could help finishing the book, and neither the boys nor the girls will complain of it.
*• Tommy Joyce and Tommy Joy,*’ by Harriet Cheever, (Dana Estes & Co., $1.25,) is the story of a rich and a poor boy who meet by chance, and whose lives after that run on together. The rich boy is a spoiled little chap, and the poor boy, who has had to look out for himself all his life, »iuite the opposite. They take "a sailing trip together, Tommy Joyce learns some important lessons,*and Tommy Joy, who Is sent by Tommy Joyce's father on the same trip, gets the opportunity of his life and makes the most of it. He was pretty sure to get on any way, being that kind of a boy, but the appearance ofTtfr. Joyce to play fairy godfather adds to the interest of the story. There are pictures.
WHEN Grandmamma Was Fourteen,” is a Marion Harland story for girls. It is a biographical story, the story of the writer’s life as a girl. It is one of the trup stories which go to prove that romance is often better than realism. There is a school girl's attempt at an elopement in the book. The little girl who is known as Molly Burwell tries to reform a young man who is intemperate—things which very likely happened, but in a book of fiction for children would never have been introduced, and they could hav« been omitted hero and the book improved. Amanda Douglas'? '‘A Little Girlin Old San Francisco.*’ (Dodd, Mead & Co.. $1.50,) is, like the stories of her other little girls in the early days of other big cities, a Jove tale. Laverne is the little girl who is brought up in her early years by rough old Unde Jason, whom she loves. She has ms-ny interesting experiences, and might have married a lord, with a real title, but instead goes back to marry a nice young man without one, as all heroines should.
There is no doubt about ** Mary *n ’ Mary/' by Edith Francis Foster, (Dana Estes & Co.. $1.25.) being a real child's story. It is for the smaller girl, but it is such a charming, natural little story, so thoroughly human and childlike, that It will be a delight to bigger people. Mary Muvphy is one Mary and Mary Merrlng-ton is the other. The stations in life of the two are widely difVerent, but both being n*ce. wholesome, natural little girls, they meet on a common plane. The first meeting is a funny *me. Mary Murphy has a dear little boissy which is the delight of her heart, and also one of her trials when she has to carry many heavy pails of water for tlie always thirsty little animal. She Is feeling this a trial one day when on reaching the place, where
But mamma said If I would speak She’d buy a Coll For me next week.
There is a little boys’ section, one for older children, and part of ’the book Is devoted to Christmas poems.
HERE are several books ot not very long stories, some of them by well-known writers for children—continuous stories covering from 100 to 150-odd pages. The first book, by Molly Elliot Seawell* is a good newspaper story, “ The Great Scoop/* reprinted from The Youth’s Companion. In It a bright office boy makes the “ scoop " and becomes a full-fledged newspaper man. There are pictures by W. F. Stecher, (I* C. Page
&	Co., Boston, ."in cents.)

44 Tlie System of the Stars,”
This hook, by Miss Agnes , M. Clerke, author of “A”History of Astronomy during the Nineteenth Century/*/ “Prob-j lems In Astrophysics/’ &c„ first appeared ; In 1S90. <It has now been revised by the | author, and is brought out here, by the . Macmillan -Company. . Extensive modi-' ficationa have been introduced. Consider- I able sections of the book. Miss Clerke I writes, have • been recast, and- all have I been revised thoroughly. Some new chapters have been inserted, while old ones have been taken out. Most of the illustrations are entirely new. So that this may be ‘considered as practically a new work on the subject, and presenting mod--ern slderlal research.
Miss Clerke, -In describing the '* system . of the stars/* has endeavored-to be plain and to present her subjects in simple language, to bring it before those even who have no preliminary knowledge of astronomy. The book embodies an attempt to combine, in a generSl' survey, definite *' particulars of knowledge ” regarding our si derial surroundings. The plan she has pursued has been to instruct- by illustrative examples, to select typical instances from each class1 of phenomena, dwelling upon them with sufficient de- -tall to awaken interest and assist realization, While avoiding the tediousness inseparable from exhaustive treatment."
She begins her ,study with a description of the physical constitution of individual bodies, and goes on through the " complexities of' mutual relationships ” until she comes to the ** crowning problem of the construction of the heavens.”
The Children*s Crusade*
Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. have on sale '* The Little Crusaders/' which was first published last year by the Abbey Press. The author declares that this is the first book dealing with the children's crusade. It was the wickedness of Lothario, Count of Segno, who called himself Innocent III., that conceived the monstrous crime of sending an army of innocent children on the journey to the Holy Land, and In this story Mrs. Isobel Scott Stone relates all the hardships and sufferings that the little people endured. There are several romances also running through the story, and throughout the narrative there is exHibited a devout Christian spirit.
