it needs courage in a painter to wield the goose qiiill of the - art critic and distribute praise and blame to his comrades and contemporaries in the profession is a matter of which Mr.

Kenyon Cox has had sufficient knowledge these many years; but in putting out a Uttle
book of essays in art criticism he has avoided as far

as possible the peril of judgments passed on those in close contact with him. Augustus Saint Gaudsns is the only all-rounfl American whose work he reviews, tor John Singer Sargent and Whistler are to all intents and purposes foreigners. He may be congratulated on the wisdom of silence regarding all other American artists. What he has to say about Perugino, Paolo Veronese, rKirer, Rubens, Frans Hals, and Rembrandt lias all the more Interest because he is a painter himself.
It may be due to the Umlts necessarily established by any painter who has gone through tho schools, is himself a teacher, and has to . read the rules and regulations in art to his pupils that Mr. Cox is sometimes unsympathetic toward wayward geniuses like William Blake. ^Wheri he says pf Blake: " On the other hand, he had a strong imaginative sense of the weird and awful, a feeling for grandeur of style, and an ability., to suggest space and movement. Sorne of the Inventions to the Book of Job reach a very high level of dignfty and beauty, and are more essentially large in, their small dimensions than many a twenty-foot canvas or fresco” one feels that perhaps the very profession which* Mr. Cox has.followed with .success puts up bars against a .full * appreciation of a nature like Blake’s. A11 through the little essay one feels the hatred of the Paris-taught artist for the exaggerations and rhapsodies with pen and pencil which give a particularly delightful' flavor to most of Blake’s work. It is a curious fact that some of the latest painters in Germany, England, and America offer examples of the more or less unconscious influence exerted by William Blake. .	.
MORE sympathy is shown with Rubens. 'The Chapter on Frans Hals is written with much more inner feeling than that on Rembrandt. The wizard of Leyden seems to leave Mr. Cox very cool, as if he could scarcely understand the intense admiration felt for him In recent times. It Is the sculptors rather than the painters whom this, critic seems to appreciate best. The leading chapter on* the early * Renaissance sculptors of .Italy and those
on the earlier work and the Sherman Statue by
*_-*■*+ * * ’ ■ *1 -Saint Gaudens, and also that on Michael, Angelo,
are the -best of the little volume. Baudry, the painter of- the Paris Opera House, comes In for more praise, perhaps, than will be granted him in the,..long run;, while Whistler is treated from the , standpoint - 'of Qne whose training must inevitably prevent, a complete r sympathy. In; Pavis de Cha-. vfcnnes he finds a modem after his own heart, not perhaps so warmly admired as Baudry, but a mas- -ter who “ is still, one of* the most vital influences of contemporary, art, still a leader of ihe' young school,'* still: one of the most discussed and criticised of artists.*' Short as they, are, these ** Essays .in Criticism/’ expressed in " an excellent style, 'may be * warmly recommended to lovers ot" art.

ONE may agree that visitors in Florence who do not find the ordinary guide books and official catalogues sufficient may use Miss Edith' Harwood’s volume of selections from the picture galleries of the fair city on the Amo to advantage. But a general demand for such a wcrk is, to say the least, problematical. Miss Harwood indulges from r time to time in generalizations out of place in a’

Abundant illustrations and brief biographies of fourscore painters represented in accessible collections, together with descriptions of notable pictures, combine to form a volume a little larger than the ordinary guide book, which contains one person’s view of several hundred masterpieces. The pleasure it has givep the writer to set down her impressions may do something toward removing the suggestion that the book lacks a good reason for existence.

MANY writers have attempted to instruct us how to study pictures, but Mr. Caff in has imagined a new way to dip profitably into the mass of paintings and extract interesting comment. He takes half a hundred or more of masters and places them in files of two, giving to each pair a chapter of comparison, description, and biographical comment. This method, which Plutarch used in his biographies of celebrated Greeks and Romans, has the merit of -breaking up the history of painting into digestible portions. It cannot fall to suffer from the evil that belongs to all systems of the kind, which consists in the "temptation to compare painters who have little In common: but the advantages outweigh the drawbacks* There is no doubt that the pointing out of similarities or of powerful contrasts tends to fix in memory the painters so compared. The artists selected are usually contemporaries, and representative paintings by each couple are supplied side by side for further comparison. As often as possible the masters belong to separate nationalities, and a chronological sequence is preserved. Thus Rembrandt has Murillo for a running partner, and Monet is compared with Hashlmoto Gaho of Japan; Israels is bracketed with Manet, Piioty with Fortuny, Raphael with Wolgemuth, and Fra Angelico with Van Eyck. The apparent incongruity of many if not most of these collocations of painters disappears when one -perceives that .the writer deals as much in contrasts as in parallels. It is a scheme he has devised to put some kind of system into his materials. Says Mr. Caffin:
In the sum total of comparisons I have tried to include as many as possible of the motives and methods which have from time to time prevailed, so that the student may gain a basis of appreciation from which to extend his observations with understanding and enjoyment. For the object of study should he to put oneself in '.ouch with each artist in turn, to enter into his point of view, to see as far as possible with his eyes, and to estimate his work, not for what it does not contain, but for what it does.
What Mr. Caffin has to say is always worth reading, for he puts each painter’s character forcibly before one, and manages to be entertaining as well as instructive. The reader may be a trifle deceived. however, by the title of the work and expect a much drier volume than he will get. “ How to Study Pictures ” suggests the textbook, but it is really a misnomer which does the author injustice. Talks or chats about assorted couples of artists, fortunately, do not constitute a Work_Uiat lays down methods of studying pictures. He recognizcs something far better than the given title threatens when he says in the concluding note:
Step by step we. have marked the evolution of modern painting from the I?v-zantine traditions which prevailed before Cimabue down to the latest possibilities Introduced by the point illiste method of Monet. * * * Wo have gained a fairly comprehensive bird’s-eye view of the whole field of painting; sufficient if our study must stop hero to onablf* us to recognize the landmarks of the subjcct; but offering. If we are able to step down and pursue the study in detail, a convenient groundwork for investigation*
A bibliography of books on art easy to obtain and a good index make this very readable volume one of the most helpful to the student of the history of art—an Introduction or primer, let us say. without any of the cut-and-dried quality of the compilations usually found under that title,

A COMPREHENSIVE work and a very beautiful piece of bookmaking is the '* Artist’s Way of Working/’ by Mr. Russell Sturgis. Tfie two large volumes, with their wide margins and large type, abundant illustrations and thorough index, form a book of reference for those curious to learn the methods employed in handicrafts and the arts of design. It is concerned with the processes of the artist or artisan, not at all with the history of art, and the author takes his illustrations and subjects indifferently from any race, place, or epoch. As a veteran systemizer Mr. Sturgis separates five mechanical processes and treats of them in Part II., viz.: Carving, modeling- and embossing, painting, staining and dyeing, and drawing. The several '* fine arts of hand work ’’ described in Part III. are twenty-f&e in number, and include keramlc and vitreous art, metal and leather work, textiles and embroid-
cry ;; building,; plasterlng'. and jofneryi in-^ lay.incrustationand.mosaic;^ engraving,; gem engraving and die slnkirigjspairiting *In flat-with stenciling; cali&raphy and printing,' rep resentatlvo ’ sculpture; and painting, &c. Finally; Fart IV. treats of., "fine arts not of handwork,’* under which'\ be classes the decorative treatment of buildings, interiors and landscapes.. As -be says, the purpose pf the work Is to explain, little by littlef how the creative artist goes at his work in each one of the numerous crafts and processes which are within his reach. “ The past has been ransacked and the far-away lands of Asiatic civilisation have been explored, in order that In every ’.case the most marked and the -most generally recognized triumph of each art. might be brought to. the front and explained.”
The wide reading and artistic tastes of Mr. Sturgis give him every advantage in a work of this Itind. Not architecture alone, but a score of other Interests relating to the-arts and crafts have enriched his life, and so he will often hang a very Interesting bit of discussion on the description of the making of a terra cotta relief or a mosaic.
