This book Is a, compilation by many hands, and undertakes to show what the Russian Jews have been doing and are doing in America, as well as to Indicate the quality of those refugees from Russian territory who have in the last few years entered the country in such numbers as to overshadow the older settlement of German Jews as these (within a period beginning with the middle of the century just closed) overshadowed the still earlier and smaller settlement of Portuguese Jews. The Americanism of these last dates back in many cases to the days before the Revolution. The Americanism of the Russian Jews (including in that designation Polish, Lithuanian, and Roumanian Jews) Is even now in the making.
It is the Russian Jew 3peaking for himself and making out his case as good material for American citizenship. Naturally, the authors speak from the inside, and as each deals with conditions which have cogie within his own observation and experience. there Is a variety of Intimate Information not easily-obtainable by alien investigators. Generally the conclusions arrived at .are that the Russian Jew, if he lives at first In squalor, does so by no choice of his, and improves his condition as fpst as may be; that he tends to leave poverty behind with the first generation; that he has not yet raised up captains of Industry; that he Is eager tot an Arrier-ican educations that, considering his style of life, he is extraordinarily healthy and prolific; that he does not burden his adopted country with paupers; that he tends to . awell in cities. The curious reader who is not seriously a student of populations will prefer, no doubt, the sections in the book whlclLdeal with Jewish religious activities and social, peculiarities - like the “cake and coffee" sa-,Ioon where the thQUghtful. and talkative of the race gather nightly.
