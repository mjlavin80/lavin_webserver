DR. MADISON C. PETERS, author of *' Justice to tho Jew,” “ The Jew . as a Patriot,” Will the Coming Man Marry? ” &c., has brought out another little took, (*' The Jews in America: A Short Story of Their .Part In the Building of the Republic.” 12mo. Pp., 138, Cloth. Philadelphia: The John C. Winston Companj'. $1.,) which shows the part played by Jews In the building of the United States. In hts opening chapter he makes an attempt to destroy the popular tradition concerning the outfitting of Columbus's fleet for the first voyage. He shows, through tho writings of contemporary Jews and others who have studied the subject, that it was not Isabella’s jewels, but some Jews, who were the financial basis of the expedition, and, be continues, " without the scientific achievements of the Jews, the subsequent voyages would have been impossible."
In the chapters that follow Dr. Peters writes about Jewish pre-Revolutlonary settlements—their arrival In New Amsterdam and Gov* Stuyvesant’s persistent hostility; the Jews in Newport, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Boston, -&c;; Jews in the wars of the Republic, in American politics, finance, the arts and sciences, the number of Jews in this country, their characteristics, and anti-Semitism In America,
The book has been written apropos of the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the arrival of tlie first Jew In America, which will be celebrated on Thanksgiving Day. It is, the author asserts, a book of facts rather than opinions.
Tt puts into hrief space for the busy reader some facts the American public should know. The book is written with the hope that it may modify the views which the Gentile world holds with regard to the position of the Jew, and tho author’s fervent prayer is that Its facts may lead Christians to grant to the possession of the Jew the mental, moral, social, and spiritual qualifications which history af-. firms.
Portraits are given of some living and ‘ dead men prominent in the various fields— art, science, finance, music, &c.
