R. THOMAS W. EVANS’S memoirs of the Court of Napoleon III. are extremely in. teresting. As Gen. Grant, wasreported to hove written . In commendation of one of.
......Mark. Twain’s .maps; “ It
throws an entirely, new light on tho. matter.’* The. doctor makes out the Court as perfect—almost a heaven on earth; the Emperor, the Empress, the Prince Imperial, the members pf the Court as heaven*, ly visitants.. It is; interesting—it ought to be conclusive, but It Is not, for some reason. Where other evidence supports the , doctor’s statements, they may be accepted as additions to the history of tfte Second Empire; where such evidence Is wanting, Dr. Evans’s memoirs may be regarded as the friendly reminiscences of one ; favored by the Emperor and his Court,' who in turn had conferred a favor on the most important of the Court, the Empress Eugenie.
The book In which these reminiscences ' are set forth is carefully edited by Dr. Evans’s partner. Dr. Crane. It consists, he writes, “ of practically everything In the doctor's ‘ Memoirs * that relates to the Second Empire,” and In addition, the ac- j count of the Empress’s flight from Paris. | Of such events as are within Dr. Crane’s knowledge, the latter vouches for the ac- i curacy of the story: he says he has verl- j fied the statements " whgjre errors of fact j seemed possible," and he has added various appendices which go to support the ! statements made by Dr. Evans. He has been painstaking, and is to be credited with much of the book’s effect.	j

DR. EVANS went to Paris In 1847, as | assistant to Dr. Brewster, an " American dentist of repute,” then 1 settled there, and because that dentist was ill one day found himself called on to relieve some dental ill from which the Prince-Presldent of the French Republic was suffering. So began an acquaintance that ripened into intimacy and proved profitable to both sides. When Louis Napoleon had made himself Emperor he made Dr. Evans Court Dentist, with the same rank as the Court Physician and Surgeon held; during our civil war he consulted with Dr. Evans, who came to this country In the Summer of 18G4 to investigate the war for the Emperor, and on his return reported that the end Was near at hand, and advised against the recognition of the Confederacy. In September, 1870, when the republic followed the empire, the Empress fled from the Palace of the Tuileries to Dr. Evans’s house; he and Dr. Crane escorted her to 1 the sea coast, and the former went with her to England and selected the house where the exiled imperial family lived until the Emperor’s death. He remained a correspondent of the Empress until his own death, some three years ago.
The account of the Empress's escape has been told in Dr. Evans’s own words within a few months, and need not be retold here; the Court Dentist's reminiscences of the Emperor and Empress, however, are new, and even if they are colored by personal feeling, they are decidedly of interest.

OF the coup d’6tat which changed the Prince-President to an Emperor Dr. Evans has this story to tell: Hav-. ing been asked to look over some chapters of the life of Caesar, which the Emperor was writing, Duruy, the historian,
. criticised it from time to time, but ob' jected strongly to a passage in which the Emperor had spoken In favor of the usurpation of authority when public order was In danger. *' I cannot allow this justification of a violation of the law to ' pass without notice. There have been coups d’6tat, but we should try to forget them.” The Emperor smiled and said, ** 1 quite agree with you; we will strike it out.” More directly of it, the Emperor aaid, after 1870, that though in his opinion, the coup d'fitat was necessary, it was *' nevertheless a violation of the law.” Royalty Is always tactful and clever, according to the chronicler, and Napoleon was, as Dr. Evans shows, The -Emperor had an exquisite way of bestowing favors. On one occasion he engaged a young man to make some researches for . a literary work he was interested in. The !. young man' was to have a certain sum paid monthly in advance. On the first I day of the month th'e Emperor paid him double the sum agreed upon. ‘ Sire, you have given me too much,* said the young man. ' * Oh, no/ * replied the Emperor, ' you began yesterday—a month ago/ ” Once while ’walking in the Bois de Boulogne, a child rolled his hoop against him; an aide-de-camp caught the lad, and told

petulantly remarked, to him that he had nothing of his uncle (the first Napoleon) about him; The Emperor replied, * are quite'mistaken. I have his family. . -

The Emperor’s good’ nature was never ruffled by trifles, says Dp. Evans; even when a waiter squirted a syphon in his face he ‘merely remarked that the levers of syphons were often treacherous. I cannot remember any trifllng^n advertence that really seemed to annoy, him except the neglect of a person leaving his room to close the door he had opened. If he never forgot a kindness, he never forgot an injury. When, on the re-establishment of the imperial dynasty, the Emperor Nicholas declined, in acknowledging the announcement of the event, to address him as * Mon frfire/ according to the diplomatic usage, but used Instead the words ‘ Mon ami/ the Emperor was cut to the quick. * * * It has been said that had the Czar addressed the Emperor as ‘ Mon frftre * there would have been no Crimean war.”
The masterful composure of Napoleon m. in every situation and circumstance was no concealing mask to be put on and off. but a quality of the mind that reveals very clearly the intellectual elevation. the moral force, and the commanding character of the man. * * * Unmoved by calumny, silent under criticism, the serenity—the superb stoicism—with which Napoleon III. accepted his destiny makes him one of the most remarkable characters- In history.

OF the Empress, Dr. Evans was a great admirer. She had been a patient of his before her marriage. He had arranged a marriage for the Prince with the Princess of Vasa, but the latter’s mother broke off the engagement. It was In the doctor’s waiting room, however, that a friend of the Prince President saw Sefiora de Guzman, Countess of Teba, and thereafter she and her mother were regularly invited to the President’s entertainments. On Jan. 22, 1833, the Emp^rpi^iimounced his engagement to the Countess of Teba. and ten days later he married her. By quoting the remark of a distinguished Senator, that he admired the Emperor’s speech declaring his engagement, but preferred “ the sauce to the fish,” Dr. Evans apparently, marks as genuine the story that the Empress’s mother, the Countess of Montijo, pushed her daughter Into the water that the Emperor might see what a beautiful figure she had when she was “ rescued ” with her light dress dripping and clinging to her; but otherwise he does not even admit that the Countess of Montijo had worked for many years to make the match. Of the Empress’s kindness of heart, of her charities, the doctor writes at some length, and thus he sums her up:
Notwithstanding the great change In her rank, the Empress remained unchanged in character. * * * I have seen her frequently during many years; I have' seen her surrounded by luxuries and the pageantries of the most brilliant Court in Europe; I have witnessed her greatest triumphs, but I cannot recall one moment in which her demeanor toward others, no matter how humble their station, in life, was different from that by which she attracted the sympathy of all those who knew her as a young lady. * * * The distinguishing quality of her Majesty’s character, I should say, is her perfect naturalnei.#.”
