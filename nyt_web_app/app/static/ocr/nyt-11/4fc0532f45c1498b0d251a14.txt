A year ago, Mrs. Wharton’s - * Italian . Villas anfl Tfieir. Gardens," accompanied.; by a number of Maxfield Parrish’s col- ‘ ored pictures, gave.the foreigner an idea of^ how certain, districts, of Italy .have been beautlfied^hv an^ excessive expendi-ture^ of _artisticzeal; wealth, anOuman labor.'

’ both author' and '^artist seemed" to imply that these examples-were merely Isolated, emphatic cxpreesions.Ju Although Mr.. , Latham's folio Is necessarily pStnvin its expression of color and atmospbere^-pres-ent In Mrs. Wharton’s volume through Mr. Parrish’s art—it is, nevertheless, strong and abundant in Jits general aspect. , No other work with which we are ac~ qualnted so expressively demonstrates the number and expanse of these villas and palaces and their gardens, the millions expended ln their construction and elaboration, the human toil consumed and the human ambitions attained or brought to-naught.
The famous Homan villas and their gardens first occupy the attention of author and artist-photograpber—the Bor-ghese, the Vatican, the Quirinal, the AI-bani, the Parophilj, and the Doria, to . mention the most famous; then come the famous villas and gardens of Tivoli, Frascati, Florence, and other places^ touched by that revival of villa building which owed its wealth and profusion to the great Papal houses of the Renaissance* rather than to the princely houses of mediaeval Italy. The very elements— color and atmosphere—which are lacking, as we have said, in Mr. Latham’s pictures, support their absence by dint of a cause which actually contffbutes to the reproduction of wonderful detail In sculptures and foliage with no marring or obscuring shadows. Hence, what the pictures lose from an artistic point of view through lack of the sunshine in that rainy year of 2903 is more than compensated tor by. their architectural, archaeological, and practical value. The eleven full-puge with the seven half-page plates which are devoted to the Vatican gardens represent scenes In which the historical' value is subordinated to the landscape and architectural. It Is so with the others. "Wherever he went, the historical Importance of a site primarily appealed to Mr. Latham, but he pointed his camera at that portion of It which was most beautiful and suggestive of the general theme. And very often a second picture was required to bring out the sculptured beauties wnich* in the first picture, had been obscured by the foliage.
The freedom of shadow which we have noted will make these pictures of special value to the architect and landscape gardener; for the intelligent, untraveled observer they form a wealth of pictorial material concerning the outdoor works of an artistic people who have known how to Improve on nature in a manner the gift of which Is given to no others.
Miss Fhillipps brings to her descriptive text those elements of knowledge which are most conducive toward a pleasant and worthy realization of her work—she knows the Italian people, their history and literature, is acquainted with the buildings and tlie grounds which Mr. Latham has so splendidly pictured, and she is measurably versed in the literature that Prince and prelate, with their architects and gardeners, have inspired in others. Her text, therefore, deals with the conditions which produced these palaces and gardens, the careers of their owners and constructors; moreover, there Is sufficient criticism and connoisseurship in her work to show that neither historical fame nor superlative magnificence distorts her appreciation of comparative artistic values.
