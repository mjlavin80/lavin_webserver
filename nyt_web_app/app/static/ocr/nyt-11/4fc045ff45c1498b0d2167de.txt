CHINA'S DOWAGER.
WITH THE EMPRESS DO WAGE II. By Katharine A. Carl. Illustrated l)y the author, and with photographs. One volume. Pp. Scacv.-SOG. 8vo, cloth. New York: The Century Company. -$2.
MtSS CARL, as nearly as we can make out, spent rather more than . nine months in the imperial palaces in and near Peking, during which time she lived in a palace next to the throne room and saw the Empress Dowager almost daily, painting some four portraits of her. She was, she says, ** the first foreigner to he domiciled in any residence of a Son of Heaven since the time .of Marco Polo, and the only foreigner who frm/i ever been within the Ladies’ Precincts.” She thus had an excellent chance to learn some of the ins and outs of ^he Chinese Court, some of its manners and customs. Unfortunately, Miss Carl is not an observer or a writer; she was very greatly af fee ted by the divinity that hedges royalty; and her book of more than 300 pages Is much such a record as a schoolgirl with an easy pen might send to an admiring club of "friends. The physical appearance of the page is typical of her style; capital letters are scattered broadcast. His Majesty the Emperor, her Majesty the Empress, the Imperial Person, the Proprieties, the Throne Room. Imperial Audiences, are some of the words that smite the reader's eye; one is surprised not to find the personal pro-nouns*referring to royalty capitalized.* But there is much of interest in the book. The part relating to the Empress, like the portrait, is without perspective; the Empress is perfection itself to Miss Carl. There are, however, glimpses of happenings, apart from *' Her Imperial Majesty,’* that entertain, and even under the heavy coating of enthusiasm one gets occasional sights of comparatively unvarnished facts—such as the statement
\ that an vofHc^l grahted^anrAud ierice hasr to bribe1' "the palace euriuc h £o 'be* ‘ permit-l ted to approach the-Throne. ' The author
does -well - in . insisting on the difference ' ‘ between the reigning* family and their subjects; the’ former are f Manchus,, the latter- Chinese. Those with' whom she came in contact during her stay at the ; Court were Manchus, who do not look like the Chinese, do not dress like them, do not bind their feet or wear their hair like them.	~	'
J Miss Carl gives plenty of court gossip— 'like the piece of gingerbread in .the child's game, it is served up "on a golden saucer." She tells us iilmost nothing of the portraits themselves—she .! painted three or four; one of them shown. a.t .Sfc Louis last year and now In Washington. That picture was quite flat ‘ in effect., representing a young .woman; the only things in it that looked real were the eyes.
It ^vould bo more valuable, though perhaps less interesting to ** the general/* If Miss Carl had explained why the. portrait was so flat, without perspective or shading. Did she make it so out of deference to Chinese, or Imperial, etiquette or demands? Or was it because she did not know how to paint it otherwise? It would be Interesting, too, to know Miss Carl’s qualifications for the work of painting “ Her Imperial Majesty the Dowager Empress of China,” for neither in the portrait shown at St. Louis, nor in the sketches reproduced in the book, are these visible. But we have little about the artistic side of the portraits; merely an insistence that they were the first ever painted of the Empress, and were painted in the palace; that the painter lived in the palace, saw many things not setn by foreigners usually, and that the Dowager Empress Is the cleverest, wisest, sweetest, dearest, kindest, most accomplished and . altogether cutest woman on the face of the earth! StiU, however much we should have liked a more balanced judgment on the ruler of China and her Court, we cannot blame Miss Carl for her enthusiasm. She is the only person of her sort In the world, just as the Empress Is in hers! No wonder that she ends her book thus: *' My sojourn at the Palaces of Her Imperial Majesty the Empress Dowager of China, my association with herself and the Ladies of her Court, I shall always remember as one of the most charming experiences of my life.”
