IR JOSHUA REYNOLDS seems to be a never-ending source of biography, criticism. and connoisseurship for writers on art. This your he has alrerdy had two biographies (one entirely new) dedicated to his career and genius '• Sir Joshua Reynolds. First President of the Royal Academy/’ by Sir Walter Armstrong, (with fifty-two plates in photogravure and-tinted half tone. Nev.* York; Imported by Charles Scribner's Sons. $3.50 net.) and ** Sir Joshua Reynolds. P. •R. A.," by William B. Boulton, (with forty-nine illustrations. New York: E. P. Dutton & Co. $2 net.)
The first is a popular reprint ot a monumental work on the English portrait painter, first published five years ago, by the greatest living authority on the subject. He has been Director of the National Gallery of Ireland since ISO-, and . has written many monographs on art subjects, notably dealing with the work of Gainsborough, Velasquez, Turner, de Wint, and Reynolds. Particularly is Sir Walter Armstrong to be congratulated for his fine sense of selection, by which he lias drawn what is truthful and distinctive from the early biographies; also for his critical estimates, which have stood the most searching and eager tests of five years of criticism—sincere and acrimonious. Besides, the author's originality, which first attracted attention to his work, has since received wide popular approval. His endeavor to paint Reynolds as a consistent human being, and not merely as the child of genius, lias found sincere approbation and respectful imitation.
Mr. Boulton, while having access to cer- i tain resources unavailable to Sir Walter, undeniably wrote under the latter's in- i tluence, and has produced a book nearer the general reader. Following the cue of his predecessor in regard to the artist's human aspect, he lias incorporated large extracts from diaries and letters. Also, he Intelligently elaborates certain points which Sir Walter offered as mere sugges- ; tlons—the contradiction between the art- : ist*s teaching and his execution, and the i illuminating fact that none of the famous Reynolds so highly prized to-day are examples of that ** grand style.** of that principle that color should be subordinated to correct, almost mechanical, drawing. Color was the true vehicle of Reynolds's expression; he devoted years to expcri- j ments in pigments while he scoffed at their prevailing effects and made light of their most wonderful combinations in his teachings.
Mr. Boulton has written a most useful handbook, entirely trustworthy and keen on the elaboration of what others have suggested. Of a wealth of material he has also made splendid and always proportionate use.
AN attempt is made In “ Seven Angels of the Renascence," by Sir Wyke Bayliss, K. B., F. S. A., author of !	*■ The Likeness of Christ Rex Regum,"
&c., (Svo. Pp. 238. Illustrated. Cloth.
,	New York; James Pott & Co. $3.50 net,)
to show the growth of art from Cimabue, who Is erroneously belie\ to have awakened art in the middle of the thir-tenth century, to Claude, who closed the ,	Renaissance, The “ Angels." or messen-
|	gers, are: Cimabue, Leonardo da Vinci,
I	Michael Angelo, Titian, Raphael, Correg-
,	gio, and Claude.
The author opens his book where his j	earlier volume, " Likeness of Christ Rex
i	Regum,'’ closed. His main argument goes
to show that the likenesses of Christ are the same—there is no difference in the appearance of the Christ of the Decadence, the Christ of the Catacombs, the Christ of the Basilicas, the Christ of the Awakening, the Christ of Michael Angelo, of Da Vinci, of Titian, of Raphael, of Correggio. It is the only thing, he asserts, that passed through the ordeal brought about by the three forces straining the art ot the Renaissance—the orthodox traditions of the Catholic Church, the individualism of the Reformers, and the recoil toward paganism of those who rejected the old faith without maklnc peace with the new.
Only a small part of the book is given over to Cimabue and Claude, the author’s real object being to bring before the reader the five great painters above mentioned who bore the stress and strain of the day.
Each of these men brought to the service of art his own special and divine gift. Da Vinci irradiated the studio with the light of the intellectual life. Michael Angelo came with the message, direct from heaven, that men should be as gods. Titian came with the revelation from Olympus that the gods are as men. By this time some of our lamps were flaring In the darkness, some were flickering and going out- Then Raphael showed us how to keep them trimmed and to see with clearer eyes. Last of all, Correggio discovered how not until the sixth day was the world finished, when God brought Eve into Paradise.
Each chapter has prefixed to It- a portrait of tho artist discur'^ed, with a fac
simile of his signature. The other'illustrations, (all are, by the way, in halftone,) are reproductions of some of the ivories of the masters.
We think that Sir Wyke overestimates the status of general knowledge when he Imagines that his title will bo readily un. Cor stood—Seven Messengers. It is- also a pity that he clings to convention and regards Cimabue as “ the first painter of the Renaissance," when that honor rightly belongs to Giotto. Giotto w.ls the reformer, the creator of a new art, which was to take the place of the old, (Dante's lines, “ Purgaturto '*—XT., y-4, have been too long misinterpreted.) Cimabue, of whom there is not a single authoritative canvas known, to be in existence, was the last of the Tuscan artists to paint great works in the imported Byzantine style*

THE two latest additions to tlie Library of Art (l^mos, illustrated, cloth. New York:	Imported	by
Charles Scribner’s Sons, $2 net) are “ Pis-anello." (pp., 203.) by O. F. Hill of the lSritish Museum, and " Cony table," (pp., 239.) by M. Sturge Henderson. Pisanetlo’s work in Venice, 1lome, Milan, Ferrara, Mantua, and elsewhere is described, the medals and frescoes being placed according to the time of the'lr execution; to the paintings is curiously given first place. In the final chapter the author deals with a certain number of paintings which have not come “ naturally ’’ to be considered in the main body of the book, and sketches the development of the medallic art in its early stages from its inception at Ferrara. The appendix contains a chronological summary of the life and times of Plsa-nello, his drawings in tho British Museum, with brief descriptions of them, and a bibliography.
The fame of Vittore Pisano or PIsanello reposes in thj exercise of an art, which, developed oy him to great perfection, has since been the just pride of Italian miniature sculptors. Before him medallists and their work had little true artistic value; from a purely aesthetic point of view, what came after rarely equaled him and never surpassed. Possibly Mr. Hill gives disproportionate consideration to his paintings, for the few examples that have come down io us show little more than veisatility In an age which produced Leonardo and Raphael. But he was a good draughtsman, and was, although his biographer docs not say so, the first Italian to observe animals and lo render their attitudes true to life. Mr. Hill has written a scholarly essay, which, on the whole, reveals very thorough researcn along what is almost a bypath of art.
In recording the life of the celebrated English landscape painter, Mr. Henderson has aimed at presenting " the actions and interests of the artist as vividly as is compatible with a strictly chronological arrangement.” The letters and extracts from Constable’s writings have been taken from C. R. Leslie’s biography. Following the account -if the career of the artist are chapters on his lectures, characteristics, his influence on landscape painting, and a general estimate of his .character and works.
THE volume of "Franciscan Legends in Italian Art," by Emma Gurney Salter, (12mo. Pp. Z2S. Illustrated. Cloth. New York:	E.	P. Dutton & Co.
51;SO net;) presents the first attempt ever made to bring together into English and in small compass the stories around the pictures of Franciscan saints. The book opens with a chapter discussing Italian painting in the thirteenth century, and the influence of the Franciscan movement. It also includes a brief outline of tho life of St. Francis. Succeeding chapters treat of the personal appearance of St. Francis, the pictures of him at Subiaco, Parma, Assisi, and elsewhere, the figure of the Saint in Italian art—his dress, emblems, &c., as patron* in allegories, &c., and other stories. In an appendix are to be found some hints for the traveler to Pescia, Montefalco, La Verna, Subiaco, Gubbio, and its neighboring suburbs. The Illustrations, twenty in number, and in tinted half-tone, show St. Francis in various places and company and from different brushes; St. Anthony, St. Bernardino, St. Clare, and two or three other saints.
The volume serves a twofold purpose; it is an adinirahle spiritual guide for the use of those already impressed by the superhuman genius of St. Francis, who may be interested to aciuire a knowledge of the impression he made upon his contemporaries and successors. Moreover, the book plctorially reveals the entire Franciscan legend together with the conditions which inspired it; tlie pictures themselves furnish a faithful record of a certain epoch of the Middle Ages, when an absolute religious faith guided the artists’ hand. The depleted St. Francis himself shows the development of portrait painting of the times—how a crude realism ultimately gave place to a luxurious, fanciful, yet not aiways sincere, idealism. Finally, a direct comparison is made possible; As the short, sturdy physique and unimpressive countenance of the saint became more and more Christlike under the brushes of succeeding painters, so the stories of the saint’s career become legends which approach within plagiaristic vicinity of those in the Scriptures.
THE sixth and seventh parts of Vol. II. of Percy Macquold’s “ History of English Furniture," (New York:
G.	P. Putnam’s Sons,) on ** The Walnut Age,” deal with various pieces of furniture made during the last quarter of the seventeenth century—chairs, day-beds, settees, stools. m*i * >rs, &c.— carved, inlaid with marqueterie, and upholstered. These " parts" are not independent, but are mechanical divisions of tlie.voiume which the subscriber, it is presumed, will later assemble. It Is unnecessary to add anything to what we have already said concerning the importance and elegance of this work, which is absolutely unsurpassed in its field. The color scheme, as the parts succeed one another, seems to prove Its raison d’etre in a delightful manner. So cunningly, indeed, is it devised that the observer can, with a little practice, detect the difference between '* solid" and " veneer.” The text continues to be as informing as eveft
HALF of the ten papers which maKe up Ralph Adams Cram’scenes of impressions of the aesthetic voicing of Japanese civilization, '* Impressions of Japanese Architecture and the Allied Arts,’’ (New York: The Baker & Taylor Company, $2,) have already appeared in
The Architectural Review, The'‘Churchman, and two or three other magazines. The genian of the art of the Japanese is first considered in this volume, followed by a coup'e of chapters on the early and later achltecture of tne Island empire; temples, shrines, gardens, &c„ are then described; the interiors of dwelling houses are next considered, after whicli Mr. Cram writes on the minor arts, describes a color print of Yelgan, provides a note oh Japanese sculpture, and then draws a forecast of Japanese art. He makes the startling declaration that, with the beginning of the present century, art " as a vital thing, a racial attribute," came to an end in Japan, after having been for 1,300 years an " essentiui part of a varied but unbroken civilization." And he goes on:
The art of Japan, like the art of Hellenism and of mediaeval Christianity, was the natural and inevitable expression of this plexus of conditions and tendencies, (a sign of wholesome life, and influenced in some manner by religion.) It was one of the first fruits of- the Buddhist mission of the sixth century, and as that mission within U00 years fixed a permanent type of lofty civilization in Japan, so did art follow step by step. * * * Japanese character is one of the very great forces In contemporary world civilization. Japanese art, the intimate and exact expression thereof, has ceased.
The book is supplied with many tinted half-tone reproductions of paintings, photographs of sculptures, &c.

PHEBE ESTELLE SPALDING has attempted to interpret the story " hidden ” in six famous portrayals of womanhood—Venus de Milo, Ernest Dago-net*s " Eve." Leonardo da Vinci’s ** Mon-na Lisa,” Guido Reni’s ** Beatrice Ceuci,” Raphael Sanzio’s '* Madonna of the Chair,” and his ** Sistine Madonna." " Womanhood in Art" Is a thirty-four-page small square quarto, printed in large typa on tinted paper, and the six illustrations are tinted half-tones. (San Francisco: Paul Elder .& Co.) The whole is bound in dark brown boards, with a buck’ ram back. Taking all the types of women together, the author writes in conclusion:
It is not in the solf-pojse of the unrivaled Venus, not in the passionate womanliness of Eve, nor In the witchery of Monna Lisa, nor the ungulded heroism of gentle Ben trice, nor yet in the sweeter beauty of the* Madonna of the Chair, that sculptor, poet, painter, has dreamed his loftiest dream. Something oth^r— deeper. more stable, further reaching in Us vision, its import, its fulfillment; some—more embracing, godlike woman-meaning must be that which satisfied his noblest mood and ours. And such a vision, such an assurance, such an inspiration, the divinest of all painters has left to
us—the care-cncumbered women of yesterday, to-day, to-morrow—in the spiritual insight, the soul strength, the unmatched service of sacrifice, of the divine Sistine Madonna,
The book is of the popular sort—full of elemental, moving impressions, but marred by Insufficient historical and critical reading.	v
