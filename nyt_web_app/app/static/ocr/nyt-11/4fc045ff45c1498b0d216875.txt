.	Times on the “ War
in the Far East,	which	E. P.
Dutton & Co. are bringing out, is dedicated to the Mikado, ** to whose illustrious virtues his statesmen, soldiers, and seamen ascribe the merits of their great achievements." It was necessary to rewrite some of the letters, while others, from other Times correspondents, were incorporated with these. The author writes that most of the articles were translated into Japanese and published in book form by the leading Japanese paper, the Jiji-Shimoo, and its popularity among the Japanese Army and Navy officers really influenced the publication of the present volume.
The book has been written so that, the author says, the reader may be enabled “ to picture himself more nearly in the position of the leader in the field than he can contrive to do when studying a •historian, who surprises the secrets of the future by writing after it has passed, and knows beforehand the direction in which he is going and the catastrophe of the tale." The work is “ offered to the public ” as a “ preliminary study of the campaign," so that the account of the war, unlike other such histories, may not “ find us oid men before it saw the light, and interest had been diverted to some other stage and other players."
There are several illustrations, including photogravure portraits, the frontispiece being a picture of Nicholas II. of Russia, seated in his royal habiliments. The numerous maps and plans are from the pen of Percy Fisher, who returned from Japan last year, and who had been working on them for many months.

A short account is given in George C. Williamson’s new biography of Richard Cosway, R. A., which the Macmillan Company is publishing, of the artist's work in miniatures:

Miniature Painter. miniature painter wno realized the beauties and advantages of ivory. It had certainly been used before his time, and by many artists, but no one appears to have properly appreciated the charm of its brill ant surface, the exquisite transparent effect that could be obtained upon it, or the manner in	which	the ivory
Itself could be left to suggest some of the lights in the portrait, or some of the airy effects dosired by the painter. He was also the first person to introduce the use of a fresh, clear, blue, cloudy background, largely composed of	brilliant Antwerp
blue, of which he was particularly fond.
*	* * A special characteristic of his work is to be found in his treatment of the hair. It is light, free, and easy. * 6 * But the special feature thut distinguishes Cosway’s miniatures » * * ccns'sts in the fact that the portrait is so lightly laid unon the ivory as to appear almost as though It had been blown into position. * * * The ease with which this effect is produced is remarkable.	-
There is also a concise review of the most noteworthy collections of Cosway’s 'works, including Windsor Castle, J. Pier-pont Morgan's, which is believed to b<* the second in importance to that at Windsor Castle, and others.
The volume is founded upon a wor'.c on Cosway, issued in lSDtJ, but which is nDw out of print. Much of the text has been rewritten, and the whole book has been compared with recently d scovered sources of information. The author has had access to papers and other material relative to the artist's early life, his married life, Mrs. Cos way, and the work of both.

The .present work * * *.

The “ Aufrobiug-Silninel Smiles, raphy of Samuel the Well- Smiles, LL. D.," known Reformer, which T h o m a s
Mackay, author of M The Life of Sir John Fowler,” has edited, is, he writes, the popular author’s last message to his readers, “ who have been pleased and encouraged by Uls work." Dr. Smiles, it may be remembered, wrote the volumes entitled ’* SelfHelp," “ Thrift," " Duty," “ Lives of the Engineers," “ Life of George Stephenson,” “ The Education of the Working Classes," &c. The autobiography was written at different times during the author’s life, the later portion in extreme old age and with failing powers. With some omissions it has been printed just as it was left by Dr. Smiles.
The editor has provided a preface in which he explains the representative character of Dr. Smiles's work. He writes:
Dr. Smiles has noticed the remarks of those who charge him with an excessive adulation of mere success. Such criticism seems to recoil on those who level it at Dr. Smiles. The whole point of his philosophy is that good work can be done, character and independence built up, and happiness preserved amid humble surroundings, and notwithstanding thelab-sence of worldly success. A materialistic view of life must rather be imputed to those who are contemptuous of the merely spiritual triumphs ascribed by him to the virtues of patience and thrift, because they have based their hopes of
