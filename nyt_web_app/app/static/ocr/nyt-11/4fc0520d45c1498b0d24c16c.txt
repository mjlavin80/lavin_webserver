HI? publication of a new edition of Lippincott’s Gaz-evtv;ec is aAwaj s greeted with pleasure. But now we have to note, not a revised edition of the familiar gazetteer, but a new gazetteer, In shape like the old one, and bearing: the same naine, with a change; but otherwise a book new from cover to cover, a new creation. Prof. Heilprin of Yale and his brother Louis Heilprin, the one known as a geographer, the other as a student of history, are responsible for the new volume. However great their responsibility may Tiavc been while passing the book through tlie press, it should not affect them now; for there is little with which fault can be found, and abundance to praise in the volume.
In their introduction the Messrs. Heilprin write interestingly of the changes in-the divisions of the world due to politics, discovery, and the extension of existing activities.
The views that for generations were held regarding many parts of the earth’s surface have given way to entirely new conceptions, and the gaps that have marked terrae incognitae have been effacedJrom the map. The Tibet of the Britishoxpedition of 1004 is very different from the picture of that region which the mind had constructed. No period in the annals of polar exploration has been so prolific in results as the ten years which close with the year 11105.	*	& * Ap largely subversive of
the old-time doctrine that geographical influence is paramount in determining man’s sphere of activity on the globe, one need merely point to the great northerly migration of 1K!»7-S initiated by the discovery of gold in the Klondike region; to the construction of the trans-Siberian railway; to the establishment or extension of steamboat navigation on the great lakes of Central Africa; and to the survey and construction in great part of the Cape to Cairo Railway. *	*	*	Not the least inter-
esting results of recent geographical research have been gathered from the domain of mountain exploration. The _ mountains of Western Canada, which were practically unknown except' as forbidding buttresses ten years ago, have recently risen into prominence as an; alpinistic field; Alaska has during this period seen the development of Mount McKinley into the culminating point of the North American Continent, vying with the giants of the South American Andes. The geographer cannot well leave the field of mountain exploration without adverting to the steady conquests of points of view by mountain railway; to attain the sum- _ mit of the Jungfrau by rail was hardly more than a dream ten years ago—today the project is largely in process of realization.
No survey of the world would be adequate without a reference to the changes that have talien place during recent years in the sources of the mineral supply of the world. The aurifer-* ous fields of the Tmnsvaal colony have developed into the richest on the face of the globe; Colorado has outstripped California in the yiotd of gold, and become the foremost silver-producing State in the Union. *	*	* The prod-
uct of the iron mines of Germany has eclipsed that of the nvnes of Great Britain: New Caledonia has found a rival in the district of Sudbury, Ontario, as a leading source of the world's supply of nickd; immense stores of petroleum have been discovered in California, Texas, Kansas, vying with those of the Appalachian fields, and the Ohio Valley; in the yi*Jd of this mineral Baku, on the shores of the Caspian Sea, has risen to the foremost position in the world.

TRULY a busy ton years of exploration: and its fruits are wonderfully well garnered by the editors of this new gazetteer.	.
With justice the editors claim that their book is up to date. We have tested it on many points, and only once have we found it, not in error, but not quite so recent as we wished; even there, however, we do not assert that the book is wanting—editors have rights even against reviewers. We should have liked to see the recent State census report on the population of the City of Ttfew York, but have to be contented with the figures for the Federal census of 1900, But in other points we have tpied and proved the Gazetteer, Take Sakhalin, for example; the cession of the southern half of the island is recorded; so in its proper place is the fact that the treaty of

STRICTLY speaking, there seems no reason why historical'data should appear in a geographical work; yet one can see, even from the few instances we have already noted, how the historical facts enhance the value of the geographic statements. That the end of a great war was negotiated at Portsmouth makes alive the comparatively dry statements of the town’s population; so, too, does the remark that T. B. Aldrich was horn there. * We suppose that it is proper to follow the decisions of the United States Board on Geographic Names, though in many cases these are utterly at variance with facts, customs, history. We wonder, however, at the use of the name Alsace-Lorraine for the Reichs-land, which for thirty-five years has been known as Elsass-Lothringen; we dislike the use of Mac instead of the prefix Me when the latter is the real one. Thus we have Mount MacKinley in the book, though in the preface the name is spelled . correctly. We object also to the lavish use of adjectives. But with these criticisms we stop; more would be a breach of privilege.

Jean \laures*s New Book.
G. P. Putnam's -Sons have arranged for publication, probably in February, a translation of a collection of essays by Jean Jaurts, the well-known French Socialist leader, entitled " Etudes Social-isles.” The English version is being done by Miss Mildred Mintum, a sister of Robert Shaw Mintum, niece of Mrs. George William Curtis and the late Mrs. Josephine Shaw Lowell, and a cousin of J. Howard Overing Sturgis, author of “ Bel-chamber.” which, by the way, Is appearing in a new edition, and was, according to the Putnams, one of their bestselling novels during the Summer. A new novel by this writer is also announced— “All That Was Possible’’-which will appear in January.
M. Jaures’s collection of essays is the third of a series by him, and succeeds “ Action Socialiste," made up of speeches in the Chamber, and “ La ConstUuente," which tells of the development of Social-, ism in France since 1789. The forthcoming volume contains editorial articles on
Socialism, written by M. Jaur^s for his paper. La Petite R&uubliaue, during the first ten months of 1001. F*rance during that period, it may be recalled, was governed by a coalition Chamber, in which
Menace of. Privilege.	"*
Henry George, Jr., is having published by the Macmillan Company a study of wKat lie believes to be the dangers to this country from the existence of a " favored class," entitled M The Menace of privilege. He strives to show briefly “ how privileges granted or sanctioned by Government underlie the social and political, mental and moral manifestations that appear so .omnious in the Republic., The monopoly of natural opportunities, heavy taxes upon production; private, owership of public highways, and other lesser privileges cause the great inequalities in the distribution of wealth which are evident all about. For these are not powers to produce wealth, but powers to appropriate it." .
Mr. George writes on the extent and nature of " privilege.” the "Princes of /Prlvilege," (in plainer . language, the
-wealthy classes*) Bind their '‘victims," (the ‘ laboring people,)„organization of laborers, the dangers of unionism, " Weapons of Privilege," " Privilege the Corrupter of Politics," the influence-over " public opinion " o? -privilege," foreign aggression,
. the centralization of Government, and the " remedy "—“ to free natural opportunities," and " to gtop taxation evils, grants, and immunities^" He quotes from the writings of Americans and foreigners, re-I ports, &C:	‘	.	.
Mr. George will be. remembered as the son of the well-known political .economist who, it may be recalled, died suddenly during the'New York Mayoralty campaign of .1807, The present writer ’has-been Identified in journalistic circles since ISSi. He is the'author of a biography of his father as well as articles on political economy, and its- various b ranch es.
