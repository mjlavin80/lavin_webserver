IKK Ann and June Taylor. Kate Greenaway was the daughter of an engraver who lived at Islington* She* was: horn in ltvtG; had an ordinary middle-class childhood with rather more liberty in slirr-ts than most children in that state; visited as a child at u farm in the country; received some simple schooling; sttulied art at Heatherley's, the Slade, and South Kensington: came unaided to her own style and v;as first encouraged in it by Mr. W. J. Loftie; attracted popular notice in 1877; reached the summit of her vogue in the middle eighties: was taken up by critics, notably Ruskin and Lof-k^r-Lamrson, and died unmarried in li*01 * For the rest one must go to her most perfect characteristic works, her '* Language of Flowers,*' '* Under the
*	Window." “Little Ann and her Mother,” and the almanacs. The essential ICate Greenaway is there.
Ruskin wrote to Miss Greenaway often and regularly in the eighties, but, his letters to her show him only in a feminine and amiable mood. He rarely said anything important, and was, we feel, not altogether inspired in wishing his friend to study from the nude and paint seascapes. Certainly Miss Greenaway’s work gained nothing in charm after Ruskin took her in hand. Hers was indeed a talent that needed outside criticism or stimulus less perhaps than any in the history of art. Without assistance she evolved from her own brain a formula, delicate, quaint, and fascinating in its slightly archaic and formal yet daintily fresh simplicity, and wholly adorable. For such a crafts woman Ruskin could do nothing. She was fully armed. His only duty was to praise and praise, and say, “ Go on and never diverge.” Instead he worried ner for the ** altogether "—pretty enougli worrying, it is true, and yet a little irritating to read; and we are very grateful to Dock-er-Latnpson for his better instinct urging her not to be influenced wrongly. Here are a few of Ruskin's spurs:
This cloud lady is very lovely, and you really must draw her again for me without any clothes, because you've suggested a perfect coalheaver’s leg. which I can't think you meantT and you must draw your figures now undraped for a while— nobody wants anatomy—bat you can’t get on 'without Form.
1*1! forgive you the pig!—but we must draw dogs a little better* And we must learn just the rudiments of perspective— and draw feet and ankles—and—a—a little above—and purple and blue things—and— the sun not like a drop of sealing-wax— and then—well—we* H do at! that first, won't we?
•	Oh, dear, think how happy you are with all .that power of dmwingv-and ages to come to work in and paint Floras and Ncralis and Fairies and Marys and Goddesses and—bodices—oh, me, when will you do me one without any?
I Ruskin also wanted Miss Greenaway to paint on glass. And here are three or four roo'c general remarks from Brant-wood:
I have never told you about “ Villette,"
K &c. They are full of cleverness, but are I extremely harmful to you in their morbid excitement; and they are entirely third-rate as literature. You should read nothing but Shakespeare at present.
In 1883.—A great deal of the time I have lost in the mere friction of life—scarcely any sense of peace, and no hope of any life to come. I forget It all more in the theatre than anywhere—cathedrals are no 1 good any more!
I think flowers in my order of liking would come nearly like this:
Wild rose,
Alpine rose,
Alpine gentian,	1
Wliite lily.
Purple flag,
Purple convolvulus.
Carnation—all the tribe,	I
Pansy—all the tribe,
Thistle—all the tribe,	1
jDaisy and hyacinth.
Snowdrop and crocus.	I
I	only put the last so low because they have such an unfair advantage over all ! the rest in coming first—and of course j I've some out-of-the-way pets like the 1 oxalis and anagallls, hut then they have an unfair advantage In always growing In 1 pretty places. The wood anemone should go with the daisy, and the “ Blossoms apple and almond, hawthorn and cherry— have of course a separate Queendom. 1
The present work, by the way. once i more brings to mind a question in what might be called typographical tact. The narrative of Miss Greenaway’s life is printed in a type chosen, we assume, with regard to the length of the line—a Ions one—and the size of the page. But when we come to Ruskin's letters, which, after all, are a more valuable part of the book, we have to read them in small type, too small for the line. Historic usage has, we know, been followed here; but is it not time that a great man's letters were considered to be as well worth making legible as the matter which introduces them, even at the cost of adding a few pages to biography? We think so.
Miss Greenaway’s own letters, from
which many extracts are given, are simple, talkative, and not particularly interr esting. Her best expression of Jierself was In her drawings.
With some of Messrs. X.ayard and Splel-marm's opinions we axe not at a U in agreement. VTe see no advantage ’whatever in

dragging in Fr£ro and Richter and Bou-tet de Monvol, more or less contemptuously. in order to exalt Miss Greenaway's modest genius. There is no comparison possible between Richter and Kate Greenaway; they did totally different things. Richter had Tun and fancy and quaint humor and a sense of German homeliness that has not been surpassed; Mif-'s Greenaway merely drey/ little decorative children divinely. To deny charm to Boutet de Monvel as our authors do Is surely to fail to understand his delicate powers. We are alt for Ivnte Greenaway, but we do not wish oLlier and greater draughtsmen to be disparted in her company—certainly not to her gain. Her work was, within the borders of its trim parterre, as near perfection as human beings have any right to expect any artist's work to be; her radiance and sweetness are indescribable; only Blake, who was a genius to whom all things were revealed, surpassed her in the delineation of the unthinking happiness of the soul of the child; but Miss Greenaway never approached greatness or force, and that must not be forgotten; she was essentially circumscribed ami superficial, a Hampstead illustrator with the inind, when she took her pencil in hand, of a happy brook or a sunlit meadow.
Exquisite things have been written about her gifts, from Ruskin and M. Chesneau to Mr. Dobson; but there should j have been more rivalry still in this gentle
art, and some of the best results should have wandered into this rather frigid book. At the present moment Miss Greenaway is comparatively forgotten; and as the authors havo studiously omitted any reproductions of the drawings which gained her her reputation, amounting twenty years ago to something like a craze, the reader of the future, supplied only with the biography, will have great difficulty in understanding her vogue and Mr. Dobson's verses upon her special genius. For the book, though lavishly illustrated with colored plates, has takeu note only of Miss Greenaway's less known and less characteristic paintings, which, by tho way. lose in vahie. by being undated. It would have pleased us more to have seen her only at her best—even although we knew each drawing well. For such unfamiliar masterpieces, however, as " The E1C Ring," ‘'Waiting," and “ Spring Time,” (which is sheer Botticelli tamed for thfe nusory,) we are sincerely grateful.
