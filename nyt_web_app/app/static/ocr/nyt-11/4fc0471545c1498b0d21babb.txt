New York Times Saturday Review of Hooks:
I cannot resist calling attention to a very remarkable case ol foresight,- or intuition, or -whatever one ‘may. calllt, displayed in the^ book “ The Giants/* by Jirs. Fremont Older. We have had books -described as .** journalistic , novels ** In which tha author haa dramatized yester- ^ day’s frenzied finance, international marriage, or other topical subjects. When I -* picked up "The Giants” I jumped to.the conclusion that here was another, lor I found in its pages a description In detail ot the election happenings of tho past • week and the forces that led up to them. But as I knew it was impossible to write and print a book in so short a time, further Investigation revealed that the novel went to press In September, long before the political situation shaped. And so, to my amazement, the book was revealed as a prophecy. And how closely events have followed the prediction shows what a grasp and understanding this author has upon the social and political life of the present time. There Is the brilliant young District Attorney fighting the allied grafters; the editor of the popular paper; the holding off of fusion until there seemed an easy victory for Tammany; the formation of an independent party. And all this was probably written last Spring, or at the latest July! Bearing this In mtnd, witness the following description of the formation of the Independent Union Party, (It Is not, as one would suppose, referring to the Municipal Ownership Party:)
Long-haired, loquacious believers in single tax; advocates of Government own' * ershfp of public utilities; men overflowing with honest indignation at complaisant Republican rascality; men rebellious against Tammany; men in whom even the Dutch commercial atmosphere of New York had atrophied the moral sense; men - disgusted with vice flaunted In the-face of citizens: men who cried out in alarm that the life of the city, that the heart of the country was corrupt, that,, the police were in the pay of gamblers,
Srostltutes, and saloon keepers, that the [ayor was bribed by the trusts, that the minor officials of the city were incompetent; men, gentlemen of 'blrtb, wesUtYi. leisure, and culture, who conceived that it was the duty of every citizen to give his support regardless of party to the betterment of government—all these were united In what was known as the Independent Union Party.	*	-
But it is useless to quote. The whole campaign is there. It is the best analysis in the form of fiction of present, political conditions in the United States yet written. And the clever way in which it Is intertwined with the love story of the novel makes it a very interesting book-Its apt concrete illustrations of the M dual conscience ’’—the business versus personal—ethics of Jnbez Band and his ilk. the revelation of the root of corruption of business and politics—these should be put in the hand of every young man of the land.
As I have said, the campaign is all there, all except the contested election, | the alleged frauds at the polls, and—but let us hope that Mr. Jerome will follow the example o£ Jack Ireton and reach up to the very throne of graft and corruption itself (as Xreton did) successfully.
