FRENCH EXPLORERS
FKEXCH PATHFINDERS IN NORTH AMERICA. By William Henry Johnson. With seven full page plates. Boston: Little, Brown & Co.
MR. JOHNSON begins his series of sketches with the frank declaration that he makes no claim to originality, and that he has dealt with material that has been much used. His purpose has been to outline the story of the achievements of the great French explorers in such fashion as would attract young readers.
In Chapter I., on “ The Origin and Distribution of the Indian Race/* he makes some statements open to criticism. ** It is the universal opinion,” he says, “ of scientific men that the people whom we call Indians did not originate in the Western world, but, in, the far distant past, came upon this continent from another— from Europe, some say; from Asia, say others/' This Is certainly altogether too strong in view of the evidence obtained and- the conclusions reached by’the recent Jesup expedition, which appear to point to a contradiction of the traditional theory stated by Mr. Johnson. The remark that “an Indian tribe was in many respects an ideal republic.** Is not so novel as his description of Indian society on Its lighter side. *' Of a Winter evening, for instance, with the fires biasing brightly, there was a vast deal of boisterous hilarity, In "which the deep guttural tones of the men and the shrill voices of the squaws were intermingled. Around the fires there were endless gossiping, story telling, and jesting, jokes, by no means delicate, and decidedly personal, provoked uproarious laughter, In which the victim commonly joined.'1 One would rather like to know where Mr. Johnson got this from.	'
The volume Is, as he says, a collection of sketches, concerned with the famous “ Pathfinders/’ the founders of New France—Cartier, Champlain, La Salle— these are the greatest of them. Mr. John-scn makes one thing very clear, the causes of the difference between the policies pursued by Frenchmen and Spaniards. The Spaniard, above everything, wanted gold, and to obtain the object of his desire did not hesitate to, conquer, exploit, and enslave the natives. The Frenchman wanted trade. The good-will of the Indians was for him a financial asset. The Indian had to hunt that the Frenchman might trade, and you cannot make slaves out of hunters. This is really an important point to be remembered by those who maintain that the Spaniard1 was naturally cruel and the Frenchman naturally kind.
Mr. Johnson's descriptions of the great French explorers are calculated to serve the purposes he had in view and to stimulate curiosity. He wisely steers clear of all critical '.controversies of which the history of New France -furnishes not a few.	.	'
"THE BURNING;"
IT was as long ago as 18C1 that Sir 1 GeorgB Webbe, I?asent introduced the English public to the Icelandic masterpiece which Is here presented' again In a form of-^yjiiph Sir Georges translation of the original is-frankly the baste. The •' Saga of Burnt Njal ” <LiUie, Brown & Co.) is a sort of Icelandic Iliad, and, as translated at large, Is too ‘massive for busy folks' reading. Mr.- Allen French has .abbreviated . It by cutting, out of ; Dasent's version^ certain /passages, especially the genealbgles inwhich, like Homer and .the Bible, it abounds—genealogies enormously long, and historically and ethnologtcally valuable, but quite . dispensable by the man'who is' seeking : a general impression of . -Icelandic liter-atura. .	.
