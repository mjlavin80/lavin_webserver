It Is a matter of the utmost difficulty to invest the English translation of a "French play of such purpose and Intensity *as Paul Hervieus’s “ Le Dedale '* /with any measure of its native potency. The Gallic temperament is so" dissimilar in every phase to the Anglo-Saxon that the correct transmutation is a problem which few adapters solve to any decree of satisfying 'completeness.
There is more in “ Le Dedale” than is apparent in “ The Labyrinth/' under which title, in an English version by W. X*. Courtney, Olga Nethersole produced the play at the Herald Square Theatre last night. But il hardly seemed possible that from so fine an original the adaptation would prove so commonplace, crude, and distorted an affair as is the case*: Indeed, the play in its present form justifies that title in more senses than one. Motives entirely clear ln the original are here hopelessly confounded, characters drawn with knowledge and skill become mere conventional theatrical figures.
To begin with, the play, written for the i^rench theatre, had apparently a more Fpecific purpose than the mere exploiting of a familiar sex problem. The divorce theme about which its story revolves is, to be sure, sufficiently general, but the conditions under which the complications develop are of peculiar application.
The conflicting views of Vilard-Duval and his wife, contrasting the strict literal acceptance of the Catholic dictum on divorce with that of the more elastic conditions imposed by the free thinkers, involve a problem essentially Gallic*
In this country it is apt to be the exception, not the rule. In France it is a vital subject of discussion. M. Hervieu’s play likewise develops in the original a specific intent in the emphasis of the fact that A and B divorced^and A now married to C. A shall not remarry B, except C shall have; died. Here, in intent
at least, the author may have had in mind some such reconstruction of the French laws as inspired—or at least were comprised in—the plays of ihe younger .Dumas, concerning ihe question, of divorce. .
J " Le Dfedale ” is in many respects, tre-inendousiy powerful. I is chief characters are superbly drar. n. with the finest subtlety in differemation, the most convincing contrasts of individal type r.nd human emotion. The two men, with their widely d.vergent ideas of relationsh.p and responsibility, indicate a most sympathetic realization ot contrasted masculine mentalities. Paradox.cally speaking, the play’s greatest strength lies in ;ts greatest weakness. It holds that claim upon the intellect which makes possible discuss.on and debate.	.
It leaves one a certain choice of opinions as to the ethioal point It embraces and serves as a stimulus to, and evidence In, the oft-discussed and never-conciudeu divorce question. Considered, however, 3n the light'of decisive argument upon the problem of dissolution of the marriage contract, it loses a certain amount of interest because of what mifeht be termed its specious pleading. It discusses a universal topic from the point of view of tho particular.
."Briefly M. Hervie^a confronts us with *tliis condition:	Marianne,	the	woman
Whose labyrinthian perplexities form the problem-subject of the play, h-^s been the wife of Mas de Fogis. They had one child, ja son. They lived together in all happiness until De Fogis lorgot his duty and became involved in an intrigue which Marianne discovered., A divorce followed. Two years later she marries George de Breufl, whom she respects and is devoted to* but. does not love in the ordinary acceptance of the word.
Her child, who is with De Pogis, the. fatlier, falls ill with diphtheria, and Marianne goes to him. While unnerved with anxiety, and weary from Ion? hours of nursing, she is importuned by De Pogis to an iadmission of her love for him, and too weak to resist his solicitations, she yields The woman is in no sense a woman of the light or frivolous type, and ski Hfn’ indrawn as a strong but intensely emotional character, she offers a study in complexities which is none the less convincing because it is intricate.
^But in translating her to the English
stage it t has -/been found1: necessary/r-foxv What reason it is impossible ' tosurmise— to emphasize a note of Vvengefulness", in -Her character, which if it'exists at^aU'in; the original is . present ..only*..as,—the' merest' suotle suggestion. -	:
In the cha racters of the two chief tnale protagonists of the drama, where Heifvieu nas been particularly ^successful, • the adapter again tails. George de Breuil is 1 a magnificent symbol of disinterested afr i fee tion, a man ready to make any sacrifice necessary to insure the happiness of the woman he loves. In 44 The Labyrinth ** he becomes a mere figurehead, a means by which the woman indulges her pique at her first husband's infidelity.	|
The last act is the weakest of the five acts of “ Le Dedale," but in ** The Labyrinth ’ it becomes a chaotic mass of , melodramatic impossibilities. M. Hervieu, as has been suggested, failed to bring his i play to a natural conclusion, and the problem is summarily disposed of by killing th£-two men .off, during an unsatisfying but convenient catastrophic struggle on the edge %of a cliff. But there is a dignity in even the crudity of 44 Le Dedale ^ which is absolutely lacking in
4 The Labyrinth.”
It would be difficult to imagine anything more crudely incompetent than the bombastic, grandiloquent, wholly false dialogue, and the resort to theatrical trickery in * situation, business, and scenic accompaniment, which combine to make the last act an absurdity.
Miss Nethersole has not appeared in th s cit3r for four years. During that time her method has taken on only added qualities of theatricalism. Her manner, her speech, her gesture, are all of the theatre most theatrical. Of reality, in this part, which to be effective at all calls for the strictest observance of naturalistic rules, she suggests almost nothing. Her method of enunciation is so artificial as to practically amount to chanting. Applied to the loose, uneven, unliterary prose of Mr. Courtney it be- ; comes ridiculous.	.	I
Badly as the adaptation is written, an 1 actress of more sympathetic method might have succeeded in touching the i^eart at occas'onal moments. But she did nothing of the sort. At times, indeed, she succeeded in awakening a feeline: of extreme resentment, as in the scene of her last meeting with de Breuil, when, 'instead of the remorseful tenderness to which the situation would be naturally conducive, she meets his questionings and advances with a mingled coldness and petulancy suggestive of anything rather than the attitude of a woman who has wronged a man and is overwhelmed by a sense of her treachery.
