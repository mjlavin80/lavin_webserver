the lack of any novelist to •write a ‘‘ Billy Duane *: for her, Massachusetts modestly proffers a spirited ll€tle pamphlet, to be published In December by the W. B. Clarke Company for Prof. Edward S. Morse, the author of “ Japanese Homes.” The title Is *■ The Steam Whistle an Enemy to Public, Health,” and as the railway companies having yards in Boston do not cashier engineers for leaving a locomotive ■whistle in full blast for five minutes at a time, and as the city ordinances do not forbid a small laundry to awoken a whole Suburb by its daily shrieks an hour before working time, properly appreciative readers will abound.

: The publication of Mr. Charles Ferris Gettemy’s “ The True Story of Paul Revere ” so soon follows the outbreak of a chorus of congratulation to Mr. .Curtis Guild, Governor-elect, on having chosen him for his private secretary, that the resultant curiosity will without doubt Increase the number of its readers, but from its first announcement it was sure of a place on the shelves of all students of the Revolution. The book is to have twelve full-page illustrations from photographs, and among them is a reproduction of the Stuart portrait.

Mr. Gettemy’s publishers, Messrs. Little, Brown & Co., announce the speedy Issue of “ In and Out of the Old Missions of California,*' the book which has waited for Mr. George Wharton James, an Englishman, to write -it, although the subject long ago attracted the attention of Pacific Coast magazines and newspapers. Mr. James deals with the Franciscan missions, established by the Span* Ish Government in 1767, to take the place of those conducted by the Jesuits expellet} at that time without warning and without compensation after nearly a century of fruitful labor. In their turn, the Franciscans were partly supplanted by their rivals, the Dominicans, and in 1830 their missions were abandoned, and the mission buildings, huge, rambling structures, including granaries, factories, barracks, stables, and quarters for the niissionaries, in addition to the church, the motor power of the whole fabric, soon fell into decay, tn addition to the visual evidence of the photographs, Mr. James gives a piquaqt chapter on the secularization of the missions, a subject concerning all students of American possessions in which .^rnUnr processes have been effected.

An especially lively book Is expected In Mr. John T. Morse’s " Memoir of Col. Henry Lee,** most outspoken and fearless of all the group gathered about Gov. Andrew in the days of plain speaking during the civil war. Col. Lee’s manuscripts gave many ^gem to the Andrew biography, but a rich treasure remains.

Miss Mary E. 'Waller, the author of “ The Wood Carver of 'Lympus,” is traveling In Europe in the comfortable consciousness that the tenth edition of the book Is selling better than any of its predecessors, and that “ A Daughter of the Rich *’ is In a new edition for the holiday season.

Miss Frances Nimmo Greene and Miss Dolly Williams Kirk, the authors of that thoroughly wholesome and inspiring little book of knightly tales, “ With Spurs of Gold/’ are cousins, it seems, and both are teachers. It sounds like a pretty story written for good little girls, but It is true that one year Miss Kirk won the prise offered by the Alabama Federation of Women's Clubs for the best paper written during the year by a club member, and that Miss Greene won the next year’s prize. Miss Kirk writes stirring little lyrics of the sort beloved by boys and romantic girls—the sort that leads readers to Scott and Lockhart.
Messrs. John W. Luce & Co. announce the postponement of Mr. Lewis Perry’s “ Intimate Letters of the Presidents ** until after the holidays. It is to be followed by Intimate Letters ” of Generals, Admirals, and other personages. V The Plays of Oscar WTJde/* to be issued In two volumes, is nearly ’^eady, and it seems -more than probable that it will reap the reward of the ingenuity by which Its author made every act of his life an advertisement of his wares. Mr. Henry L. Mencken's “ George Bernard Shaw; His Plays/’ is also near publication. Meanwhile “ The Foolish Almanack ” is really in its fourth edition, having been reprinted twice to fill new orders before its first list could be shipped.

The late Hon. Charles Denby’s “ China/* published by Messrs. L. C. Page &. Co., has very llttle* likeness to the other’vol-’umes of the Travel Lovers Series in which it appears. The authors of those agreeable volumes could conscientiously content themselves with being agreeable, but the late United States ;MInlster is in ear-', nest in his statements and in the exhortations based upon them. He deplores the advantage which present conditions give to the promoter; he laments the quarrels between the missionaries; he discusses past policies, and in pursuance of the same general plans his son vigorously summarizes the conduct and causes of the Russo-Japanese war. The pictures ariT not the less interesting- for the strength
of the text, but ?he spirit of the book will surprise many a buyer who expects only to be amused.

Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. a,re confining iiz2mselves to educational work this season, diverging' from it only in the Belles Lettres Series, of which some volumes have already been noticed -in-The New York Times Saturday Review of Books. Some two hundred will be included in the seven sections covering its eight centuries; each volume will contain a play, a poem or group of poems, essays, or a novel, and each is provided with all necessary critical apparatus. The series
has a pretty cover and the price Is nominal, so that here, as in London, it is cheaper to read standard books than to buy new, untried novels.
