After several postponements “ Jung: Heidelberg/* a German comic opera by L. Kren, C. Lindau, and Carl MilHJcker, was presented for the first time in this city at the Irving Place Theatre last evening. It is the second comic opera to be produced at the German playhouse this year and the last before the regular dramatic season begins.	\
Lina Abarbanell, who has become a strong favorite with the patrons of Mr. Conried’s theatre, appeared in the_ rOle of Lieut, von Vogel, and played it with vivacity. Her vocal numbers were well received. One of the best played bits of the evening was by Georgine Neuendorf f, who gave a deiicatc portrayal of Kathe.
The plot of the opera, which is more or less a sequel to “ Old Heidelberg.” concerns Prince Erich, son of Prince Carl Heinrich of the other story. The son is opposed in a love affair by his father, but it eventually turns out all right, as the girl *the Prince wants to marry is the father’s choice, the Princess Irene, in disguise. There are twO scenes, one at Heidelberg and the other at Hollstadt.
WILDE’S “ SALOME ” SEEN.
Produced by the Progressive Stage Society in Berkeley Lyceum.
George Bernard Shaw might have fancied he caught a faint twinkle of promise for the future of American taste had he attended the performance at Berkeley Lyceum Theatre last night.
“ Salome,” a piece in one act, by Oscar Wilde, and two one-act plays, “ The Revolt ” and “ On the Road,” by Villiers de l’lsle, Adam and Clara Ruge, respectively. were presented by the Progressive Stage Society as the beginning of a series of international modern dramas. The society aims its choice of plays to be both artistic and fearless. The performance last night had a marked flavor of “ progressiveness/' in spite of obvious pruning.
Oscar Wilde wrote “ Salome ” in
French in the later years of his life in
Paris. He possibly had Sarah in mind
when he conceived the play, and its whole
scenic side suggests Sardou, with touches
of "Wilde. The whole play really hangs
on the persistent “ 1 will kiss thy lips ” with which Herodias’s daughter pursues Johanan, supposedly John the Baptist, to his slaughter.
The piece was acted last night by volunteer members of the Actors’ Society. The scenery was simple but effective, and the incidental music was well chosen. The audience filled the small hall.
The cne-act pieces which preceded “Salome " dealt with problems of modern domestic life. ** The Revolt ” showed the despair of a wife who w dreams,” tied to a husband wl'o, as she says, “ counts banknotes like butterflies but never knows a real emotion.” The wife leaves him— for four hours, and returns to be greeted with ironic forgiveness and the remark that ” from all this romantic nonsense even the most respectable people are not safe/'
” On the Road ” is a study of maternal afTection in extremes of the social scale. Thc three plays will be continued through the present week. 3.,ater, feats of dramatic daring are promised in the shape of plays by Nordau, Gogol, and Hauptmann.
