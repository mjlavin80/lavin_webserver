History for Students.
THE STUDENT'S AMERICAN HISTORY.
By D. B\ Montgomery, autbor of " The tieadlng 'Facts of History ** Series. Revised edition. 13oston: Glnu &. Co. $1.40.
The present work dif fers^from the same author's " JJeading: Facts of American History.” though it follows it in its treatment of constitutional history and the general development of the Nation, and Is evidently intended for the use of more mature students than those for whom the M Leading Pacts ” Series is designed. In attractiveness of presentation and clearness of diction it compares favorably with
such manuals as McM as tor’s and Chan-ning*s. A valuable feature of the work is the quotation of the statements of public men. the reproduction of original documents, &c. Besides the references to' important works in the footnotes, there Is a classified bibliography in the appendix, which will be found helpful. This last revised edition of the work comes down to-the Presidential election of 1904^
