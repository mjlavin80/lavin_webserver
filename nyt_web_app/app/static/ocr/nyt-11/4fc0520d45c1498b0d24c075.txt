Neto Yorfc Times Saturday Review of Boots:
A CORRESPONDENT, writing: over the initials of «L H. H./' whose communication appeared in the last number of The New York Times Book Review, gives some interesting information about early title pages; i but he is not quite correct in his inferential statement in relation to the first, which he leads us to believe may' have been printed by Mathias Moravus at Naples in the year 1476.
, During the first half century of printing with movable metal type, the colophon page at the end of a book was as much the title page then as the first page is the title page now, the colophons of the first printers .usually setting forth the information we now find upon the recto of the first leaf.
The earliest title page as now known is to be found in a little volume of twelve leaves issued from the press of Arnold Therhoernen at Cologne in the year 1470, which gives the following information:
Sermo ad populum predicabilis in festo presentacionis Beatissime Marie semper Virginis noviter cum magna diligentia ad communem nsum multo-rum sacerdotum presertim curatorum collectus. Ed id circo per Impres-sionem multiplicatus, sub hoc currente anno domini MCCCCLXX. Cuius quid-em collectionis atque eciam multipli-cacionis ejus non pervipendenda sacio si placet. Videre poteret in hujus folii latere sequenti.
Upon the verso of the title leaf there are other items of information about this interesting little work, among them the name of the printer and some laudatory Vords about printing in Cologne.
The second book with a title page,
'* Exhortatio de celebratione Missae per modum dialogi inter Pontificum et sacerdotem,” was issued from tho press of Conrad Fyner at Esslingen in the year 147^». From that^time the use of the title page increased so rapidly that soon after the close of the fifteenth century it had come into general use; but the colophon did not entirely disappear until a considerable time after.
It may be said of the title page that it was the crown of tlie printing art, or rather that it crowned the many essentials which then stood for the completion and perfecting of the art of printing. And since the days of those old printers, no more artistic work has come from printer hands '£ian that which has been handed down to us from the presses of those accomplished workmen who gave to some of their I work a quantity of dignity and beauty I that has never been surpassed.
