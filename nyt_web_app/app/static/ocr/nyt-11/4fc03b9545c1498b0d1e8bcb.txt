; .Candor, however,- -compels one tft deiiy the accuracy "of the first statement at ill t-events."' Count Paul was not behind .the ‘-Scenes in. those.great events; he was;”as a: matter rof fact, chief clerk to Blsmarfik, "* brought along with the royal and later imperial headquarters because he could * speak French. He took no part In the planning, the consulting, the deciding; what he did/was ta write at Bismarck’s -dictation. IJe had a good time, which
bored him very greatly according* to* the
i j translation;.-., “ bored must have been
Count Paul’s favorite word—he dined
often with the King, but he was not “ in
the know,” ::nd his letters throw much
Kiss light on the great events than do
those of any newspaper correspondent of
the day. But they were not intended to;
they were merely family letters to his
wife, to keep hei* Informed of his welfare;
and more than once the writer remarks:
“ You'will see all about it In tfte papers,** -
or words to that effect As to throwing
light on the diplomat's character, they
niay do that; but merely that he loved
his family, wanted to be with them, and
was glad that his wife was glad that the
new baby was a girl.	t
The letters were written almost dally— sometimes more than one a day—from , B ■*
Aug. 2, 1870, to March 6, 1871, those from and after Oct. 7 being dated from'Versailles. The Countess Paul was an Ameri-cajdf whose parents had a country place near Paris and a city house in the Rue I de Courcelles. There Mr. and Mrs. Moulton took refuge when the siege began, and almost the most interesting paragraphs In the letters deal with them. They would not do anything—expected Count Paul to do It, blamed him for everything, claimed
as their own all the good luck that came

to them. For example:
[Jan. 18.] Your mother is sulky with me because of the bombardment. This seems very absurd, but so it Is. * * • [Feb. 0.] Your mother is looking exceedingly well, and only complains that she has been eat-—' Ing too much sinc^ the signature of the
■	armistice. * '* .* When I mentioned the ! name of the Emperor you should have I s#*cn. her pout! She reproaches him for having allowed himself to be taken at i Sedan -and for having smoked cigarettes ! In the inidst of the disaster! * * * [Feb. 24.) Your father, sent me word in haughty terms that as an American he hadn’t to pay a sou [toward the contribution exacted from Sucy.] I replied to your mother that there was no necessity for him to pay, not because he was an American, as this would not protect him anywhere against taxes, but because I was there. I wanted to let them know that, after all, they owe it all to me that they have got off so cheaply, because I know that very soon they will assert just the contrary.
The letters were written in French originally, but have been translated into English of admirable smoothness, so that all suggestion of a change from one language to another is wanting. In fact, so far as the public is concerned, the translation is far better than the letters themselves. “The Hatzfeldt Letters,” translated, “by request,” from the French by Mr. J. L. Bashford, Is published here by Messrs. B. P. Dutton & Co.
