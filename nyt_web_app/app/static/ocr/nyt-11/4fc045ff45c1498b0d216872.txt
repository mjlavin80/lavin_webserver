-	“ Mr* Hyjde said nothlrigworseof Father * Damien . than Stevenson said,V and‘that
.'' Stevenson* s attack on Mr. Hyde was* simply a tour -de force.” That-such a statement as this could appear iri The New1 Tohk Times Book IUtvxew Is surprising^ for «it Is grotesquely devoid of truths--If the writer of that paragraph will please .take down his copy of Robert. Louis Stevenson’s “ Open Letter to the' Rev. Mr^IJyde of Honolulu," and read it again, i,'am:g'ui'e that he will promptly ..tako back* the 1 aspersion which hty'Tins„ castr upon the memory of Father Damien, the beloved apostle to the lepers of Molo-kal, and upon the literary honor of Robert Louis Stevenson, Tusitala of. the mighty heart that loved the world and worshipped truth, two noble men no longer able to speak in their own defense.-■ To say that Stevenson’s letter was a tour de force is to describe it accurately, for English literature contains nothing in the way of defensive writing that surpasses this powerful apologia. As a working model for the refutation of-a slander-it is a classic that stands pre-eminently above all others.	.
Stevenson's dominant characteristic was love of truth, and he was Incapable of using Father Damien and Mr. Hyde simply for the purpose of accomplishing a tour de force. Furthermore, it was wholly unnecessary that he should do anything of the kind, for at the time the letter was written Stevenson had won his spurs in literature—“ recovered his glove,” as he put it, in one of ’the most pathetic letters in the whole range of English literature. To say that the letter In which he excoriated the Rev. Mr. Hyde was ** not one of the least injudicious of his writings,” or to lead people . to think that Stevenson was not sincere In this matter and was only seeking to accomplish a tour de force for the mere pleasure of doing so, is such a grave reflection on his literary honesty that The Times owes It to its readers and to itself either to produce proof of its assertion or promptly retract it; for all true Steven-sonians believe, as the writer of the very Interesting Foreword to the edition published by Alfred Bartlett of Boston says, that *
Stevenson’s sincerity In the matter cannot be questioned. The letter Is resonant with genuine feeling, as with righteous Indignation. He persistently refused to accept payment for his defense of Damien, and once wrote a London publisher:
44 The letter to Dr. Hyde Is, yours, or any man’s. I will never touch a. penny of remuneration. I do not stick at murder; I draw the line at cannibalism. I could not eat a p'enny roll that piece of bludgeoning brought me.”
