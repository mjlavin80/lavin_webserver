WILLIAM L. COURTNEY, an English literary critic, has been commenting on the lack of good novels and stories of Oxford life. “ Tom Brown at Oxford,” he points out, was keenly disappointing after the success of “ Tom Brown at Rugby.” One of “ the most curiously successful stories of undergraduate life ” was “ Verdant Green/’ whose author never was at Oxford. We need not follow Mr. Courtney in his speculation that " the monastic conceptions on which the university was founded ” are incompatible with the spirit of romance. The monastic idea is not very strongly impressed upon the visitor at Oxford nowadays. But Mr. Courtney seems to make out his case pretty well. Oxford undergraduate life has not hitherto inspired a novelist to any striking effort. We know that Max Beerbohm has written an Oxford novel, which ought to be delightful, but it has never got nearer publication than a pub-

H OWARD PYLE’S colored pictures which illustrate his own historical fantasy in the Christmas Harper, 14 The Fate of a Treasury—Town/' are even more striking. than his illustrations in Mr. James Branch Cabell’s studies ln mediaeval romance, ” The Line of Love,” which will serve to make that book an object of interest with seekers for holiday books. This is not saying that we like .Howard Pyle interpreted by the modern color processes in printing better than we like him in plain black and white. He has long held a foremost place in that branch of art, and we do not . believe that the color printers always do justice to 'his work. But the charm of some of these new plates is irresistible. Besides this noteworthy contribution, the Christmas Harper will have some capital studies of child life by Elizabeth Shippen Green, and other good pictures. It will contain “ Eye’s Diary/’ which Mark Twain has “ translated from the original/* This reveals sosne facts about the origin, of firethat have not-been known hitherto;. A new Maeterlinck essay, a" paper * by Mr. Cleveland on ” The IntegrityAmerican. Character,” and coritrfbiitions by Mr. Howells, Mrs. Mary E. Wilkins Freeman, and other writers of note wlif serve to make this number of the magazine * memorable.

i -71/1 ARK TWAIN’S seventieth birth** day will be celebrated Tuesday, Dec. 5. Mr. George Harvey of Harp! ers has invited a large number of literary folks to dine with him and Mr. Clemens at Delmonico's that evening,
I to fitly celebrate an anniversary eo interesting in tfie. history of American I letters. More than a generation has I passed since “ The Jumping Prog/' in I IS67, transformed the humble but alert Western printer and journalist into a I humorist of international repute. “Innocents Abroad ” was published in 1800, *' The Adventures of Tom Sawyer ” in 1876, “ Life on the Mississippi ” In 18S3, and “ The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn ” in 1885. Mr. Clemens is still at work, and in good health.
SUPT. J. M. GREENWOOD of the Kansas City Schools has been lamenting that the age is ** literature mad/’ a phrase he employs to indicate a too general and too persistent reading of books which are not literature at ail. Of course, aft educator thus perplexed excites sympathy. But the fact that so many young persons have the reading habit nowadays is not of itself a bad sign, though of course, a large proportion of them choose books which appeal to the rudimentary mind. The educator’s work is never done. There is some encouragement for him, however, if he choose to take it in small quantities. The multiplication of cheap editions of literary classics goes on without abatement, and the publishers and booksellers report that there is an increasing demand for good books. Mr. Greenwood should console himself with the reflection that the mind of the multitude is slowly awakening.

MRS. CRAIGIE, (John Oliver Hobbes,) in an interview with a reporter of The New York Times, on her arrival in this country last week, made the astonishing statement that much of the present popu-
■ *	* '
larity of George Bernard Shaw is due to his frequent quotations of other authors in hi3 books. This is astonishing, because most of us, whether or not’ we like Shaw, regard him as the most strikingly individual figure in contemporary literature. Of course, he has absorbed a vast volume pf reading, largely the work of authors more or less unfamiliar to the majority of the readers of his books in this hour of his'great vogue, He reflects much of the opinions of those1 who ihave influenced him, and he sometimes quotes. But Shaw is no Thomas Peacock, no walking anthology of classical mythology* polite learning, and odd information. On the contrary he is so distinctly, so aggressively individual that we are justified in assuming that Mrs. Craigie was- just having a Uttle quiet, Shaw-like fun with him.
MRS. CRAIGIE commented on the swing of the pendulum In American fiction from romance to real-
#
ism. It is true that while a few of our younger writers are still devoting themselves to tales of adventure and " moving accidents by flood and field/’ the portrayal and, in a measure, the criticism of real life in the present seems to be the aim of most of our novelists. Like Mrs. Wharton’s ” House of Mirth,” Mr. Booth Tarking-ton's " Conquest of Canaan/6 which takes its place as the second American novel of the season, In importance, embodies a close study of a certain section of our social fabric. The crudities and humors of life in an Indiana town form Mr, Tarkington’s subject, which he has elevated by skillful treatment. Other new American novels and collections of stories such as Mrs. Burton Harrison’s, " The Carlyles,” (a chapter of history,) and Mr. Connolly’s tales of the deep sea, which with Mr. Tarkington’s book will be considered as representative examples of contemporary fiction in the Sunday edition of The New York Times tomorrow, treat of real life veraciously.
MISS ELISABETH LUTHER CARY’S study of " The Novels of Henry James ” (Putnam,) appears in an attractive volume, illustrated with a new portrait dfw^Mr. James and an etching of his home at Rye in England; and supplemented by a bibliography zealously compiled by Mr. Frederick A. King. Readers of The New York Times Book Review are familiar with the excellent quality of Miss Cary’s writing, and she has contributed more than one article on the work of Mr. James to these columns. Miss Cary now writes of the author of " Roderick Hudson ” and “ The Golden Bowl,” from the point of view of one who accepts him, without cavil, in his latest
(iievetoptnent as a commanding, figure 1 ia the worldof letters. But she reviews; all. his. work from .the ^beginning; traces, his development step by .step, and treats in separate chapters of the power of his Imagination and’the value pf his philosophy.

There will be a formidable “literature.'' of Henry Irving^. the actor who was knighted, the manager who turned the minds of cultivated Englishmen back to the theatre. Probably there will not be much quite as piffling and unsatisfactory as Mr. T. H. S. Escott’s ** Personal Reminiscence ” in the current Fortnightly Review. This deals chiefly with Irving as a diner-out, a lion in St. James's, and Mayfair; the Irving of dubiously smart rejoinders, and “ smart ” anec -dotes.

THE newly founded- Pennsylvania
•	History Club- recently held its first meeting, when Prof. Charles M. Andrews of Bryn Mawr read a paper on 14 Materials for Pennsylvania History in English Archives.” The new club is an adjunct of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, .and its active membership is restricted to writers " who have done work of recognized value in some^important aspect of Pennsylvania history.” Among Its charter members, besides Prof. Andrews, who is President of its Executive Council, are John Bach McMaster, Isaac Sharpless, Sydney George Fisher, Albert Cook Myers, Cheesman A. Herrick, and Marion D. Learned.
McGown’s Pass and Vicinity.
In a little monograph of forty-eight pages, entitled " McGown’s Pass and Vicinity/’ with seven half-tone illustrations and two maps. Edward Hagaman Hall, secretary of the American Scenic
and Historic Preservation Society, has packed away a remarkable amount of almost forgotten historic lore about the northern end of Central Park, New York. The original topography of the island in that section is described, and its relation to modern sites shown. The book is publish*. i by the above-mentioned society, whose offices are in the Tribune Building, Nassau Street New York.
The Better New York,
»»
The American Institute of Social Service has published a little paper handbook called " The Better New York,” a sort of reply to the so-called *■ Real New York ” which advertises itself so widely. It is a
guide to the resources and progress of the city along the lines of social improvement. It parallels, in some respects, the in format ion given in the annual Charities , Directory, but does not go into detail so I much as that does. The historical information, sometirfies out of date, sometimes ahead of time, is Interesting, and the book is worth its price many times
over.
Moorish Remains.
The John Lane Company is publishing Albert F. Calvert’s book on ** Moorish Remains in Spain,” devoted to the treasures of Cordova, Seville, and Toledo. The
illustrations comprise eighty color plates, 200 black-and-whites, and 200 diagrams! The author has aimed at showing in the Illustrations rather than in the text the value of the subject—" working, not without hope, but with-a vast consciousness of the fact,that neither by camera, nor brush, nor oy the pen can one reflect the erfects obtained by the Moorish masters of the Middle Ages.’*
