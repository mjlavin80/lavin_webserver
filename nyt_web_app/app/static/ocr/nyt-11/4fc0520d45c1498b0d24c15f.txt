Of the Making of Bookplates.
That interest in the use of bookplates Is growing appears from the notice of its existence sent out by The Triptych, an aggregation Qf talent devoted to the creation of bookplates and similar printed objects—books, for example. The existence of The Triptych, which is only _ one of many designers of bookplates, makes it all the more remarkable that Mr. Allen's twelve-year-old book on bookplates should have been put forth acain by its publishers untouched, with merely the date of its publication changed.
Of the ten illustrations of plates made by The Triptych shown in the pamphlet we can say little In praise. Most of them are influenced by William Nicholson's famous black-and-white cartoons—excellent in their place; yet their place, to our mind, is not as bookplates. Their use here serves to degrade the bookplate to a fad—which, according to our American tendency to overdo things, it will become^ only too speedily. Still, there are two or three pretty but rather pointless plates in the pamphlet, which show that given fadless patrons, The Triptych can turn; out good work. Just at present it seems somewhat given to.mutual admiration of its members. " We hope It. may «oon be too busy for such profitless amusement.
A Perpetual Calendar.
The Kev. Clarence E. Woodman, C. S. P., is known to Catholics as a most elo-_ <juent preacher, to many others he is known as a maker of sun dials; a mathematician of high repute. It is as a scientist that he has prepared and published a perpetual ecclesiastical calendar, a. pamphlet where may be found tables for* finding Easter by both old: and 'new!
! Styles from X D.	to -’A.. D. 5000; and
; further - tablesby^lwbfch£-EB^ter^may.b^
found -after the latter date is passed—or before then, if one chooses. Father Woodman’s notes contain curious Information of much interest—for example, the statement that, notwithstanding the ever-increasing difference between the Julian and the Gregorian calendar, Easter Old Style and Easter New Style have fallen together 129 times since 1582, and I will fall together 143 times more, until ; April 24, 26*J8, and thereafter can never l coincide!
