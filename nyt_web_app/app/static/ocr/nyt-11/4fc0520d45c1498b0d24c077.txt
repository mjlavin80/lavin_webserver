Sew York linics Saturday Review of Books:
OU 'w ill not think that I do not thoroughly appreciate The New Yoek Times Book Review if I tell you I was not satisfied/ with the notice of Prof.1 Monroe’s •' History of Education,” published last week. The reviewer has evidently not the slightest conception of tho subject with which the boot deals. Why is it not as legitimate to write the history ol educational thought and practicc as to write the history of any other branch of man’s endeavor, and why should one who devotes some S00 pages to the task be spoken of slightingly, and upbraided because he devotes none of his attention to the child who is to be taught? Why should he, when such is not his problem, any more than it is the problem of the writer of a history of the United States, or of a text book on physics?
No doubt the book seems large to one who is not interested in educational work, but we believe it is not usually expected that the masses should read with much avidity any professional work. The reviewer seems to think that this work Illustrates the present tendency to fads and frills, though how, he does not at all make clear. The patronizing way in which it is referred to throughout the notice is further evidence of the current habit of those who know nothing about educational aims and methods, of passing all sorts of smart criticisms upon the work of the educator.
As it happens this book is absolutely unique in its sphere, and is a splendid presentation of the facts of the development of educational thought- It is welcomed by teachers everywhere as placing at their disposal much information hitherto not at all easily obtainable. Why should it, then, be passed over by an unsigned review, when other histories are assigned to trustworthy critics who are willing to acknowledge their opinions?
