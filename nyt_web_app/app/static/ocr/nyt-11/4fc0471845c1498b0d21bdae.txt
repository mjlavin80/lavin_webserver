R. SAVAGE would hardly en-
■	roll himself among those ■who complain of the underpayment of writers, y£t it. easily may fee that he holds the record for scantily re.	:	*.. ■	warded literary effort, his
first	patron, his ‘father, having- given him
one. cent a page—*'nothing said as to size**—when he was seven years old for all that he would write in prose or verse. Then.as now, however, it was the “.work that is play ” to him to write, as he tells us in the modest preface to his present volume. Many of his poems are occasional, and the^ occasions inspiring them represent the diversity of his interests. The Unitarian aspects of his creed are faithfully portrayed in “ Moials and Religion," " Pan’s Revenge,” and ** Mary’s Dream." Tlie hymns lack the fervor in which the’ great hymns are rich, but great hymns, like great epics, are rare in any age, and Mr.- Savage has kept his product ln this field entirely free from the zeal without reverence that is so often an offense both to taste and piety in modern hymnology* The-memorial poems show catholicity of appreciation, and these | lines to Lowell fairly represent both the skill of their author and the generosity ! of his appreciation:	,
Dear Lowell, I had e’er a poet’s heart j And wandered fairyland with childish I feet
And eyes all wide with wonder; finding sweet
The hours when, from my boyish mates apart,
I watched to see “ the little people ” start From their leaf* coverts. 1 half understood
The talk the trees have in the shaded wood;
But how to speak, nor falter in my art?
Then heard I such sweet utterance of my thought And turned to find the music on thy tongue!
The first great poet that I learned to hear!
I thank thee for the sweet love thou hast taught,	•
The love that ever keeps the old earth young	.
And makes us know the gods forevei near.
The great story of the Christian world, fhe Morte d'Arthur, still furnishes themes for writers and artists. Burne-Jones returned to it after thirty years with renewed zest, and wrote with his characteristic mild impetuosity:	“	Nothing was
ever like Morte d'Arthur—I don't mean any one book or any one poem, something that can never be written, I mean, and can never go out of the heart.” The version by Mr. Trevelyan of the birth of Parslval is told in pleasant blank verse whose easy flow is uninterrupted by lines of exceptional beauty. To those unfamiliar with the tale it offers an agreeable rendering which. If it does not rise to any great heights, at least is free from the faults of much of the blank verse put forth at the present time.	~
It is not difficult in reading Mr. Robinses poems to understand their successful appeal to President Roosevelt. There is in them, as he has said, " a curious simplicity and good faith,” mingled with a strong feeling that sometimes struggles unsuccessfully to find the right rhythmical channels through which to flow. They are nearly always individual, and show little tendency to echo poets of a larger gift which too often is the hallmark of the minor poet. The mood is usually serious, and quite removed from the too sweet and pensive sadness of one who invokes grief as a becoming adjunct to his verse. The melancholy that is present is essentially that of sturdy middle age inevitably, connected with the re- | flective years, but not without the tonic suggestion of time lert and strength for action. The numerous poems of relig- , ious feeling are the product of a wholesome faith, and are free from conventionalities of wording. " The Dead Village ” is characteristic of its author’s mental attitude and mode of expression:
Here there is death. But even here, they say—
Here where the dull sun shitles this afternoon As desolate as ever the dead moon Did glimmer on dead Sardis—men were g^y;
And there little children here to play, With*. small soft hands that once did keep in tune The strings Uiat strctch from heaven, till too soon The change came; and the music passed away.
Now there is nothing but the ghosts of things,
No life, no love, no children, and no men;
And over the forgotten place there clings The strange and unrememberable light
:	An-'dreams. The music failed,'
i ;,and thcn	,	:	.	.
God 'frpwhed, and shut the village from His .sight, ■>	v
Mr. Cheney's name Is so oiten seen in tho magazines, that the statement that -the'.present volume contains “all the author’s. verse 'now before the public" in book forro comes as a surprise:	Al-
though the collection is snotqll, it touchcs ron most of what makes up. man's general experience. Faith, love, life, death,, and nature are'the subject divisions, anifr tl*£ outlook is that of the pure optimist who is accustomed to note the silver lining without. tho cloud. Mr. Cheney is qiilte justified * in claiming for himself—
I sing the humble happy things The seasons bring me on their round.
If he sings also -with tenderness of—the sleep ot them that are “ no longer with the years,” it is only to evoke the kindness of their .memory, -the hope cher-* islied for them, the pcsace of- t-heir deep slumber. Both the poignant anguish of bereavement, , and the ecstasy of love he leaves untouched. This little song ** At Parting" conveys the suggestions felt in many of his poems oC depths left unplumbed by Intention, and ' not through indifference of mood: -
With tears and kisses let me go.
-	Love not too deep To kiss and weep.
That love have many, many;
But one love, oh,
It doth not so!
Pale lips it has and tearless eyes; Broken, motionless It lies,
A flower amid death's mysteries,
A rose that dies.
With tears and kisses let me go;
Such love, have many, many.
That other love my heart would know,
Or know not any.
In M**- - Gallienne’s ** Odes from the Divan of Hafiz ’* we are not impressed by any effort toward restraint of feeling or expression, and, musical as the verse is,
' it seems touched not Infrequently by the blight of a very modern decadence. Too much scholarship should not of course be exacted of one who versifies -from the translation of others and frankly makes such changes as seem good to him, and a closer adherence to the original might very well have given us a reproduction less beautiful and perhaps in essence no truer. Still, it is only oncc or twice in the whole collection that a note so ex-I quislte is struck as in Ode 227:	_
This house hath been a fairy’s dwelling I place;
i As the immortals pure from head to feet
Was she who stayed with us a little space, Then, as was meet.
On her immortal journey went her ways.
; So wise was she—iyet nothing but a flower;
Only a child—yet all the world to me; Against the stars what love hath any i	power!
Or was It she	*
I Went softly in her own appointed hour?
The moon it was that called her, and
■	she went;
i	In	Shiraz I had	lived	to	live	with	her,
t	Not	knowing she	was on an errand	bent—
A	traveler
■	To sojourn for a night, then strike her.
,	tent.
How sweet it was on many a Summer's day	w
On the green margin of the stream to lie With her and the wild rose, and nothing say;
. Little knew I
That she was running like the stream ^	away.
That was the sweet of life when, pure
*	and wise,
In her dear neighborhood I drew my breath;
That was the truth of life—the rest is lies. Folly and death.
Since toward another land she turned her eyes.
Blame her not, heart, because she left thee so;
The heaven of beauty called her to be queen;
Back to her hidden people must she go. Behind the screen;
Nor when she will return doth Hafii know.
