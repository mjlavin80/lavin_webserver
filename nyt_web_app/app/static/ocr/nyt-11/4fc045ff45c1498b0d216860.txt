MAKING A DUCHESS
A Noteworthy New Novel by the Son of “ Miss Braddon.’**
B. MAXWELL, son of the famous romancer Ions' known as Miss Braddon, who wrote that extraordinary story of a fanatic in the grip of the eternal human called " The Ragged Messenger," has written another story at most as extraordinary and possibly even more Intense in its holding power,
“ Vivien ” (Appleton) is the title of the book, and it is the history of a nice girl from babyhood till the day ap* proaches when she should have babies of her own* The author's method with bis Vivien is somewhat that of George I Meredith with his Aniinva, but the sto* rles are no wise alike in incident or I outcome, and. the points of view are widely different. The resemblance to Meredith lies particularly in the courageous use which Is made of all the arms of memory, insight, and imagination in projecting upon the reader’s mind the entire humanness of the personages chosen for portraiture. We say chosen advisedly, for these personages are in essence real, not types or ideals or moral gointers or puppets or dream figures. To be sure, they have also their ideal sides—ideal sides<being as real and human as any other side. One must suppose that Mr. Maxwell’s lcnowledge of life in general and British high life in particular is not less than Mr. Meredith's own, and one must gTant him a marvelous faculty for assuming a woman’s point of view. Evidently he can think back to the dream life of his youth and catch the spirit of childhood—guess somehow the spirit of girlhood. As evidently he can enter into those whose lives he traces, grow up with them, feel with them, think with them, and speak with their voices. As evidently he holds to romance in the midst of the sordid things of life and feels powerfully the appeal of ancient tradition, rank, and seasoned and accustomed splendor. Marriage limited, i to be sure, is no article of his creed, 1 even though he were the last to cast the first stone—or any Btone—at Vhe erring. For the erring appear also.
However, as the story builds itself about the life of the girl Vivien, and as the girl Vivien represents about all that Is noblest, kindest, delightfulest, bravest, most innocent, and childlike in young, unspoiled womanhood, it may be that the author fits always his attitude to hers—that he invests all things with a glamour borrowed from her dreams. That sounds like the note of a story in brocade and tapestry. There is brocade and tapestry, but- there is much else. Vivien is born the daughter of a gentleman with agreeable manners and no morals. His time is spent chiefly at his excellent London club, ills wife fades away in shabby lodgings where Vivien is born and lives till, upon her mother's death, she is sent to a cheap school to be kept there as many jears as may be. This so as to be out of—perpa's way. Papa doesn’t even pay the schoolmistress—but Vivien knows nothing of that and grows up with her dreams and her reading of the late Mr. Dickons and the late Mr. Thackeray, and, (under the inspiration of a German governess,) Mr. Darwin and other solid persons also, into a preature at once strangely wise and adorably innocent. When the school fails her as a home—because the poor schoolmistress has fallen bankrupt—she will not be a burden to a harassed papa—poor papa, who is so lovely to talk to, but has no b money to spare for -a troublesome little girl—she will fight for her own hand and make her own living. It is the beginning of the invasion of trade by those lady tea shop and milliner shop keepers, now famous in musical comedy. Vivien is lucky enough to be cm-ployed (at a pound a week) by Mrs, Wardrop, who sells blouses in a most impressively ladylike manner, and has a most fashionable lot of patrons. So you learn exactly how the girls lived j at Mrs, Wardrop's. (how did Mr. Max- 1 well find It all out?) and hear a deal of 1 gossip about the fashionable patrons, i You meet the young Earl of Helensburgh riding gorgeously at the head of his company of Household Guards, you meet also Mr. Claude Stanford, who comes to the shop with his cousin, the beautiful and notorious Mrs. Arncliffe. .In these twTo you perceive at once hero , and^yillain—even Vivien see^/Cn one of ; thiem a dream Prince. .Vivien doesn’t*

Fi^om Mrs. Wardrop’s the scene shifts to the house of a very great lady indeed, a house in the country, a most wonderful old-fashioned feudal house and a most wonderful old-fashioped feudal lady—a “grand” old woman; Vivien is lady in waiting—companion is the vulgar word. This old woman, Lady Colwyn of Hawkridge (grandmother to the Right Hon. the Earl of Helensburgh) is as fine as any of Meredith’s grand dames—next to Vivien herself the triumph of tlitte piece; and the picture of domestic life at Hawk-i ridge, of a house party of the real great folks at Hawkridge, of Hawkridge and ] Hawkridge’s mistress, while the grandson Is at the front in South Africa, is marvelously effective.
There is another descent for Vivien ^ Into the market place, and this time she works in a real shop under sordid conditions pictured by the author in file manner of vivid detail which marks every part of the book dealing with these crueller phases of life. It is the shop girl’s life as one who was never intended for a shop girl has found it, and even so, it has both lights ; and shadows. You observe it is a book of contrasts and analysis—startling*'"' contrasts, illuminating analysis, sharp observation of the evil in life, sharper reminders in the darkest places of the good. And woven through it all a pure romance of pure girlhood. For the plot is an old, old one. It is enlarged and made modern, but it is in essence the story of the goose girl and the Prince —and in spite of the modern setting, the contemporary realism of the trials of the true gold of the goose girl, the spirit of the romance is the same as that of the fairy tale. That ought to satisfy young lovers—but it will also charm old cynics. The only trouble will . be for lazy folk—on account of the easy gait at which the author approaches Uie heart of the romance.
