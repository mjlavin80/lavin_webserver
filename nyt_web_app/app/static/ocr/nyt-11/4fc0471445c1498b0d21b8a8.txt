In his new book Mr. Thwrng Has told us some more about the Ked-Keggers, whom he' made very popular last year. The story is not quite as good as its predecessors. The characterization would j have been better had the author devoted i more time to a few persons and given less space to a number who have nothing to do with the tale in hand and so block the j stage by their uninteresting presence that the real actors are lost in the maze. The story deals mainly with the lumbermen of Red-Keg and vicinity, the blackmailing schemas of a country editor, who is Just a plain scoundrel, and how the latter’s publications stir up trouble for people with ** pasts." The heroine does not make an appearance until Page 104 is reached, and the particular man from Red-Keg of the title is elusive until a bit further on in the book, where one gets an inkling that it is Sam Hawkins.
