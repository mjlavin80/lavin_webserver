Ea llffttlr ; impression that In these ,c^r®less melodies, these jo-wS Wm	vial, whimsical lilting strains
™	we have the	very*;spirit of
.	. natural poetry which is with
us but for an hour and to-jnOrrow must be sought again in some distant prlml-I tivo race. The sufferings of “ clviliza-tion ** under Its cruelest aspects have not sufficed to still the music of the brown people who have taken their buffets and kept their joy of heart, mingling with it that strange, inborn philosophy which , they so often express in even their lightest songs.	Those stanzas	from the poem <
called “ Foolin' wid de Seasons ” in this new collection by Paul Laurence Dunbar show the undespairing slothful mood In which the negro mind so frequently meets fate:
Why won’t'folks gin up dey planning An* jes’ be-contqpt to 'know Dat._dey’s glttin’ all dat*s fu’ dem In de days dat come an’ go?
Why won’t folks quit movin’ forrard?
■ Ain’t hit bettah Jes’ to stan*
An' be satisfied wid llvln'	|
In de season dat's at han' ?

. Hit’s enough fu’ me to listen
*	W’en de birds is singin’ *roun\
’Dout a-gessln* whut’ll happen
W’en de snow is on de groun*.
In de Springtime an* de Summah I lays sorrer on de she'f;
! An* I knows ol’ Mistah Wlntah i Gwine to hustle fur hisse’f.
We been put liyeah fu' a pu’pose.
But de questun dat has riz An' made lots o* people diffah Is jes’ wliut dat pu’pose Is.
Now, accordin' to my reas’nln’,
Heah’s de p’int whaih I’s arriv’,

I N "Banjo Talks "by Anne Virginia:
. Culbertson, we get less of the»pfcllos-:	ophy and. more of the light-hearted,
irresponsible wildness that breaks out In song and dance on* the least pretext. ^ The version of the story of Kden is a most characteristic bit of negro ‘ interDretatloh of our accepted Scripture, while the following song for the cakewalk conveys all the rhythmic abandon of that singular pastime;
Sweetes’ 11*1 honey in all dis Ian’,
Come erlong yer an' gimme yo* han*,
Go lightly, gal, go lightly!
Cawn all shucked an’ de bam flo* clear,
1 Come erlong, come erlong, come erlong, my dear.
Go lightly, gal, go lightly*
Fiddles dey callin’ us high an’ fine, -M Time fer de darnsin’, come an’ jlne,
:	Go lightly, gal, go lightly!
; My pooty 11*1 honey, but you Is sweet!
An’ hit’s clap yo’ ban’s an' shake yo’ feet, Go lightly, gal, go lightly!
Hit’s cut yo’ capers all down de line.
Den mek yo* manners an’ tiptoe $lne,
Go lightly, gal, go lightly!
Oh, hit's whu’ll yo' pardners roun* and roun’,
Twel you hyst dey feet clean off de groun , Go lightly, gal. go lightly!	..
"* Both books are illustrated by photographs, some of them admirable in pose and expression, but not to be commended as pure ornament. The day may come when cheap half tones printed on slippery : paper will be considered beneath the dignity of book Illustration, but there is no I sign of it as yet.
