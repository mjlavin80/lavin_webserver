ORD EDMOND PITZMAJOR-' ICE lias done a very good piece of work in his life of j Lord Granville. In England 1 . hla book is already accepted
11	as a valuable contribution r -	to history, as -throwing light
1 on various dark places in British and ; European politics, as letting more light-upon certain spots not heretofore fully ; illumined. On this side of the Atlantic and the St- Lawrence the volumes cannot hope to be hailed as so valuable; there is
*	much in them, nevertheless, in the .way of \ anecdote that will prove entertaining, and
■	In capable hands they should prove a mine of conversational treasure, for there is in Hipim much decidedly Quotable.
■	Lord Granville, who began life as Granville George Loveson-Gowier, son of Lord Granville Levcson-Gower, was born with the traditional silver spoon in bts mouth,
; and his spoon was gold-lined. His father was made a peer shortly after his son's birth, the latter thereupon becoming the Honorable Granville Leveson-Gower; and a few years later was promoted in the peerage, so that the son, entering Oxford as an Honorable, graduated after six years’ residence as Lord Leveson, and six years later succeeded his father as the second Earl Granville. In later years he explained his position in society to a friend who congratulated him *»n not being shy, like most Englishmen:	*4 He
came of a shy family, he said, but he had one great advantage from his earliest youth, which might account for his having an undeserved reputation: he had nearly always been in an unquestioned position. This made .all the difference. If you went to an entertainment and felt that nobody could doubt your right to-be present there was little excuse for shyness.” Granville was indeed always in that enviable position; wherever he was, he had a right to be.
IN 1S40 Granville became Assistant Foreign Secretary; later, after an interval as an “ out," be accepted the place of Master of the Buckhounds, on the very worldly advice of a friend that h& had never known it to go against a man's political career to have something to give up. Not so many years later. Lord Edmond notes. Lord Stanley of Alderly told Granville that a certain person was “ the sort of a damned fool one made Master of the Buckhounds and the reader can believe that Granville enjoyed the joke, though the author of the book does not say so. When the “ Great Exhibition M of 1851 was In preparation, Granville was appointed Commissioner, much to John Bright’s disgust; he did not think that an ex-Master of Hounds was qualified for the place. Granville made a success of It, however —his French education and ability to speak and even to joke in French helped him; and Bright acknowledged his error. He and Lord Granville became good friends, and it was Lord and Lady Granville who chaperoned the great Quaker when, years later, he entered the Cabinet and went down to Windsor to dine with the Queen. Granville’s decidedly humorous account of the affair is given at length.
For two months In 1851-1852, Granville was Foreign Minister, succeeding Palmerston, whom Lord John Russell forced out because he bad tried to commit the Government to approve Louis Napoleon's coup d'etat, He was Lord President of the Council during the Aberdeen Ministry —the Crimean war Period—and Its successor; again under Lord Russell; and under Gladstone was twice Foreign Secretary, and once Colonial Secretary. He died in the Spring of 1891, In the seventy-sixth year of his age.
Always in politics, always in the thick of the fight, Granville Is not to be credited with having accomplished anything of great public Importance. He was a ** genial," in the best sense of the word; he had immense tact, and was the tie that bound together the warring elements of more than one Cabinet. His influence was centripetal. He might have been Prime Minister ln 1859, for the Queen sent for him when both Lord John Russell and Lord Palmerston refused to serve, but he. too, declined, and the other men at his intercession settled their differences and combined to form a Cabinet, Palmerston becoming Premier and Russell taking office under the man whom he had put out of place eight years earlier—Granville, who had taken the new Premier's place then, responsible for the new alliance, and taking office as Lord President! The proceeding is typical of Granville’s whole political life.
For many years Granville was the Queen’s confidant, and some of her letters

iperor. Nicholas are the cause of all - the present trouble by framing that wretched treaty of , 1852.”Almost too plain language. She described B1 smarck’s Schles-wlg^Holsteih policy as “a gross and unblushing violation .of every , pledge; and as' surance that' Prussia had given ”—quite, possibly a correct description, but hardly judicious tor a sovereign to say In even, a private letter. But Granville was a diplomat by: birth, though never more than-nominally in the service, and the Queen, as well as the many persons whom he brought and kept together, could trust fully to hJs knowledge of what to do and when to do it. - He was the professional mediator of the Liberal Party; he was called in by Lord John Russell to carry word to Lord Chancellor Westbiiry that bl3 resignation was wanted, because of. the scandal over ois son's appointment; he had to prevent Lord Russell from giving a Parliamentary dinner to the Opposition peers when Gladstone was giving • one to the Opposition leaders of the Commons—and every!-one knows that to prevent a quarrel over a dinner calls for diplomacy and tact as delicate as does the settlement of an international boundary question. Parliamentary dinners are very important matters in England.
FOR all these things Granville was equal. He “ jollied ” his quarreling friends until they made up; and through his fifty years of activity held a unique position in British politics. Bea-consfield—Disraeli, he was at the time-asked him to join his Cabinet in 1868 a very remarkable tribute to an opponent, and the two men were always the best of friends. Granville’s position accounts undoubtedly for his failure to distinguish himself positively in bis various offices; he seems to have made no enemies, to have been everybody's friend, including, however, his own; and a man without enemies is a man .without friends. In having no enemies, Granville had nothing ** to give up.”
It appears that it was the Prince Consort who suggested that the sovereign should have an Indian title; any title, such as the Great Mosul," Prince AIt>ert wrote to Granville, “ which would connect Itself with the ancient history of the country.” The suggestion was not accepted at the time; but twenty years later Disraeli, the benevolent assimilator of other persons’ ideas, had the Queen made Empress of India.
Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice has given an interesting picture of a very charming personality—of a man wholly fitted for his place as a smoother down*" The more complex civilization becomes, the greater need of the man with the ** glad hand.” Granville’s place was waiting for him at his appearance; he filled it admirably, and, so far at least as the Liberal Party is concerned, he has left no successor.
