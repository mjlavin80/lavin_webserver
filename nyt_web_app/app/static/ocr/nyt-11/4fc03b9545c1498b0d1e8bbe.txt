RTTICAL opinion, we are grieved to note, dbes not unanimously, award high praise to R ml yard Kipling's airship story In the McClure’s. Even some readers who have been aroused to enthusiasm by “ They ” and ** An
/Habitation Enforced," the subtleties of
* t
which obviously tended to deprive them of a large share of popular favor, find 4‘ The Night &^ail ” too full of “ jargon ” to suit their taste. Now, we have not liked all of Mr. Kipling's engineering stories, by any means, though we 'have measurably comprehended the merits others have found in them- But .this airship story is surely a wonderful work of the imagination. Its “ jargon '* of scientific terms, which have no present meaning, yet might all be translated into reasonably intelligible English, greatly heightens Its effect of reality. One must .surrender his mind'to the poet's spell to get the best, out of this story. The Chicago Tribune dismisses ’it, unfairly, as “a dozen tedious pages.” It urges Kipling to get away from the " whir ” of wheels axi*\ the smell of engines—that from jChl-cago, too. But Mr. Kipling will never get away from them for long. They belong to his age and are symbols of a great material progress he ever dreams of. The stories of Kim’s India and Mulvaney’s, the songs of Mandalay and Danny Deever have been written and are deathless. Their author’s powers are contracted by no pent-up Utica. He is making good use of his birthright. Three such varied, imaginative stories as 4* They," “ An habitation Enforced,*’ and " The Night Mail ’* would be enough to make their author famous, even if there had never been a " Man Who Was " or a “ Taking of Lungtungpen.”
T T seems a long way back now to 1 the days when " John Halifax, Gentleman," was a “ book of the hour ” and everybody was reading it. Dinah Maria Mulock wrote the pathetic, moving tale which seemed to strike a new note in fiction and established her fame in lSu7, seven years be^)re she married George Lillie Craik. She died eighteen years ago, and we doubt if “ John Halifax,” ** Mistress and Maid," and “ Agatha's Husband ” are much read nowadays. Memories of those books, and. their author, are awakened now by the announcement of the recent death of her husband. Mr* Craik, who was a grandson and namesake of the author of “ The Pursuit of Knowledge Under Difficulties ” and other once famous books, had been an active partner in the London house of Macmillan & Co. more than forty years. He was the valued friend and associate of many distinguished men of letters, and particularly noted as the friend and adviser of struggling authors. Late in life he had married a second time.

Andrew lang’S “ Red iBook of
Romance,” (Longmans, Green,) resplendent with showy '"binding, gilt^ top and colored pictures, is * not only a fine book for a holiday gift either for ■ * * _ a youngster oc, an old person with a young heart, but it contains a daring statement, an example of wisdom unafraid ' of the conventions, that will delight every real boy who gets hold of it. Says Mr. Lang, deliberately: “ Eyory boy should stop reading a book as soon as he finds that he does not like	How	few of us would ever
have read " Sand ford and Merton” if that pleasant rule had been in force in the days of our youth I And, by the way, how much we would have lost if we had not always with us the memory of Mr. Barlow as a source of comic suggestion! Well, 'to say the truth, Mr. Lang is a better guide for a boy in romance than in ethics. His “ Red Book of Romance ** deals with brave old legends and a few nursery horrors; also with some masterpieces of literature. The Werwolf, Gunnar of Iceland, Una and her lion, Don Quixote, the Cid, Huon and Oberon, Guy of Warwick, and many other notable figures of romance appear ih story and picture in its pages.
AFIR.ST book of poems by Wyndham Albery is announced in London. Mr. Albery is a son of James Albeiy, famous. as a writer,..of charm-.
TO add to the inevitable confusion of the Impressible critic and reviewer of books in this season of extraordinary activity among publishers, the Llppincotts have audaciously brought out a new edition of a good translation of one of Jules Verne’s most fascinating books, M In Search of the Castaways,*' which tells the story of the wreck of the brig Britannia and the amazing adventures of Capt. Grant. with his children and friends. The result, In at least one case, has been really pitiful. We do not doubt that many habitual reviewers and chronic literary critics have just cause for complaint. For If you pick up this tale, which is a very long one, it is almost impossible to lay it down again, assuming that you have a liking for splendid tales of adventure. The interest begins with the very first words of the first chapter, and is cleverly sustained until page 620. There are no dull passages in Verne. The new edition is well-printed and Is Illustrated pro£usely_with/-.the.excellesat ttld wood

A GOOD, book inspires reviewers. We hav^ been stjuck by the admirable quality of * many of’ the reviews1" of Mrs. Wharton’s novel, “ The House of Mirth,’* throughout the country. Of course, it is true"that, in the case of a book so far beyond the ordinary, curiosity to note the manner of its reception will naturally lead a
■ e
person interested In contemporaneous literature to refi3 the* reviewing col. umns of the dailies more carefully than usualv Probably the average of good judgment and felicitous expression has been greatly Improved in the book reviewing by the newspapers of this country with the growth of the habits of reading books and buying books. All the same it Is worth knowing that the reviewers who are praising Mrs. Wharton’s best book, the best of recent American novels; are praising it in a manner worthy of the subject, generally with true Insight and artistic appreciation.	f
MR: CURTIS HIDDEN PAGE, compiler of "The Chief American Poets,” (Houghton, Mifflin & Co.») takes pains to say, in his preface, that his book is “ in no sense an anthology,” and to gracefully comment Mr. Stedman's " American Anthology,” which, he declares, “ rtjust remain for many years without a rival.** Mr. Page’s selections are confined to the works of nine poets—Bry- | ant, Poe, Emerson, Longfellow, Whit- j tier. Holmes, Lowell, Whitman, and , Lanier, whose likenesses In miniature, with their signatures, are reproduced on a single page as frontispiece. Though planned principally for use in colleges " The <2hief American Poets” is a book to be heartily commended for small home libraries. The selections are ample, Bryant being represented by thirty-one poems, from M Thanatopsis ** to " The Flood of Tears,” and some of the others by many more. There are useful critical notes and brief biographical sketches, too.
