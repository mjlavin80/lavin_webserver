1 POLITICAL THEORIES*
A HISTORY OP POLtTICAJi THEORIES. From Luther to Monteafiuleu, By ■Wima.ro Archibald Dunning-, Ph. D., IjL*. X>„ Lfeber Professor of History and Political ' Philosophy in Columbia University. - Now York:	The	Macmillan Company. ’
THIS work is constructed along the j plan followed by the author in his earlier wohirae on the ** History of Political Theories, Ancient and -Mediae-* val." It is really a series of essays, <Je-scribing1 the systems and theoHes.of. the great European writers on politics; from Luther to Montesquieu. 'g
Prof. Dunning starts out by showing how the political teaching of the Reformers was a reaction against that of Machlavelll, and a harking back to theories essentially mediate val and scholastic.' During the last half of the sixteenth century* under the absolutism of Philip and Elizabeth, political theory languished in Spain and England:	But	it	flourished
in France and Scotland, where civil war was chronic. In France, the religious wars led to an outburst of anti-mon-archlc literature by Catholics as well as Protestants, and the Scottish Reformation contributed to political science George Buchanan's work . on ** The Sovereign Power Among the Scots/" Buchanan held that in Scotland the relations, between King and people were contrac-tional, and that the monarch was not entitled to* the submission of the people j under all circumstances. Dr. Dunning's I conclusion as to the effects of the anti-monarchic theories injected into the political philosophy at this time is that they | emphasized, conceptions—such as the contract theory of society—which continued as potent influences till well into the nineteenth century.
Jean Bodin marks an epoch In the hls-tory of politics, and the chapter devoted to him is very full. “ His real work, ad-1 mlrably accomplished, is to set the theory 1 of the State and the science of government once more where Aristotle had placed it, on a foundation of history and observation, and by the side of, not dependent from, the science of ethics and theology.”
Chapters VI.-VI11, are concerned with English political theory, and bring Its history down to Hobbes. In particular the political philosophy of the Puritan revo! lution claims attention. Thomas Hobbes, though writing in the midst of the revo; lution, was by nature a closet philosopher. He was the first Englishman, says Dr. Dunning, to present a system of political ‘ philosophy that can stand among the great
■	systems of history. He shows how and wh3r Hobbes was for a time neglected | In England, and how he at once assumed a pre-eminent position on the Continent.
Coming down to the period of the Eng-i lish Revolution, Dr. Dunning examines ‘he theories oC I*ocke. His theory of natural rights, of sovereignty, and of the : right o£ revolution played a, most im-i porlant pavt in ilie eightnct.ih century ond furnished inspiration for later French I philosophers.
i The volume closes with a consideration ! of the theories of Montesquieu, whose aim was to present a political system l which might at once justify and reform France. Montesquieu thought the English I Constitution tho onlv one constructed I with cspt*cial reference to political liberty,
1 and its excellence he atributed to the i separation of Government power into ! executive, legislative, and judicial, thus I for the first time introducing Into political science what has long since become a j commonplace.
