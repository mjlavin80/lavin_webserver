This great scholar’s wife writes as follows In her preface to the volume* of essays on " Life and Religion,** which Doubleday, Page & CoWare publishing:
Those who have read the " Life and Letters ** do not ne£d to be told that Maa? MUUer entertained from his earliest years —the firm conviction that all is-wisely ordered in thta life, '* all for our real good, though we do not' always” See It, ‘ and though we cannot venture to fathom, the wisdom guiding our steps.** To other readers the unswerving trust and faith shown In these extracts may be a revelation, for he rarely conversed on such subjects. Tet this trust and faith gave him strength through tho bitter struggles of tils.early life, taught him resignation during the years when .the dearest wish of his . heart seemed unattainable, supported him later when those whom he loved tenderly were taken-from-him, and upheld him in long and depressing illness. Zt is my earnest desfro that this little book may prove a help and comfort to those who endure like trials and that It may strengthen those whose path in life now stretches before them,' filled with sunshine, to meet the sorrows that inevitably await us all. ^	'	■
