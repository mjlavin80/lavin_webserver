rip HIS |s a. history of the Huguenot ef-| - "forts to' coloniee Florida. the *Span-tr ‘ ish' conquest ,by^ Pedro Menendez dc . Aviles, the" revenge of tile French under . Dominic jde-Gourguea, and the subsequent-history of Florida'till 1574,.	‘	'	:
■	The . first ’ Huguenot. expedition fitted' out by Coligny, the “ Raleigh of France/'. ended in disaster , and the abandonment of the colony planted in .what is now Beaufort^ County, South Carolina. This was 150*2-3. The second Huguehot^polony was established in 1564 on the St. John's River, where Fort Caroline was built. But the Spanish King- had never given up his claim to Florida, and in 1565 Philip IX. commissioned Menendez dc Aviles to conquer. and colonize it. The massacre of the French at Fort Caroline was the melancholy result. In view of the very dark colors in which Menendez’s character is usually drawn by historians, Mr. Low, ery*s remarks deserve quotation:
*	* * His letters show that in carrying through the_appalling massacre of the French Huguenots in Florida, he was i neither impelled by rage, nor violence, nor acting under the impulse of a blind fa! naticism, but was deliberately and con-i scientiously performing what he believed I to be his duty toward his King and his faith. And in this light we cannot with-* i hold from him the respect due a courageous and faithful soldier, while we shudder at the distorted logic which could calmly justify his crime.
The French Court took no steps to avenge the outrage, but Dominic do Gourgeus, who though probably a Catholic, hated the Spaniards, undertook with a small band to avenge his fellow-Frerich-men. This counter-attack, however, did I not wholly extirpate Spanish power- in Florida, though it weakened it seriously. Menendez restored his settlement, but for many years Florida was not an important part of Spain's colonial domain. _
