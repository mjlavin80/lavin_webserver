jllHE James HJ5£est Company Is publishing V The Evolu---tion	of	a Great t.iterature,1'
by Mr.	Newton Mann, who
modestly disclaims any right to be called original, saying that he wishes only to pre> sent to the general reader the main conclusions of advanced scholarship touching the composition of the various parts of the	Bible.	He	so	arranges these advanced	views as	to	enable the youngest
student to - associate the successive periods of Hebrew history with tlie"produc-tion of the books of the Old Testament, and to conncct the production of each gospel—the Acts, the Apocalypse, and the Epistles with some stage of Christian growth, so that his book will be intelligible even to those quite unread in the subject.
The same firm Is publishing a prettily bound gift book containing '* Eugene,’’ a civil war story related in blank verse by Mr. M. Dunton Sparrow. It is meant to contribute ** to the growing reunion in spirit of the North and the South.”
The Writer of a larger book animated by the ame Intention, Mr. John Reed, whose “ The Brothers’ War ” is just ready at Messrs. Little. Brown & Co.’s, is no novice In authorship, having ^already pr duced M The Conduct of Lawsuits,” and also “ The Old and New South," published in 1S7G, He is a Princeton man, and after being graduated in 1854 he studied law in the office of Alexander
H.	Stephens and T. R. R. Cobb. He served during the war in the Eighth Georgia, Bartow's Regiment, and was among the first Southern authors to make a terious endeavor to reveal the real South to the *sTorth.
One cannot help thinking that Mr. Edwin Mims's *' Sidney Lanier ” will also have value in bringing about the ’* reunion In spirit *' partly because tho warm affection with which the author treats his theme is as winning as it is novel, and partly because of the striking portraits showing the Confederate boy, ^.nd the thoughtful citizen of the Union. Then, too, the stories of Lanier’s friendship with Charlotte Cushman, and of his bitter disappointment in the matter of writing her life are passages full of melancholy interest. This volume Is published by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., and one of its companions is Mr. Irving Berdlne Richman's *' Rhode Island," which, so far from being peaceful, recalls many a quarrel between the Bay State Colony and the colony that rebelled alone tw< months before Congress declared the independence of ** those Colonies.”
“ In the Shoestring Country," a new book by Frederick Chamberlin, which the C. M. Clark Publishing Company of Boston is bringing out, promises to cause something of a sensation. The story is written around the present political situation in the so-called “ Black Belt ” of Alabama, and the author asserts that the story is founded on fact. Mr. Chamberlin says that every statement made in his novel regarding the election, day Incidents in the Eleventh Alabama District is based upon actual occurrences, the evidence of which has been filed at Washington. Mr. Chamberlin has also written another book, which the C. M. Clark Publishing Company is shortly to | bring out, entitled ” Around the World in Ninety Days.” It is a book of travels, ; with over 300 illustrations from photographs.	!

Miss Edna Dean Proctor’s *' Songs of America ” is more happily named than 1 most books, for it has poemg for Flag Day and Columbus Day, Indian legends and verses pleading for the Indian, a i poem for Mary Washington, and another for the parents of Lincoln; its spirit Is purely American, and it is written in pure English. In the appendix Miss Proctor hnfl placed some Interesting material regarding the Pueblo Indians, confirming certain matter in her poems liable to doubt, if unsupported.

Mr. William Burnet Wright, the author of “ Cities of Paul,” the remaining book in the Houghton Mifflin group, is a Congregationalist minister, but, between visions of the splendors and horrors of St. Paul’s world and exultation in the Saint’s religious and moral courage, his style and matter remind one of Buskin.

Next Wednesday will bring “ The Pardoner’s Wallet,” ten essays by Dr. Samuel M. Crothers, with two hitherto unpublished written like “ How to Know the Fallacies," less for the gentle reader than for the reader desirous of seeing something ungentle done to deserving sinners; “A Javelin of Fate/* by Mrs. Jeanie Gould Lincoln:	Mr. Sedgwick's
*4 Short History of Italy,” covering the period from tlie fall of the Western Empire to the present century; the IngersoII lecture, by Dr. Crothers, entitled “ The
tho first • g r eatc o medy; written: In amod- ■ 'em , .tbnguei; arid now, :Englished by Dr. Richartf Holbrook. L	~

The ** tree doctor," Mr. John Daycy, who for some third of a century has been
•	urging the double duty of reforestration
■	and blrd^preservation, has determined to
appeal to the children, and has prepared “ Davey’s Primer of Plants and Birds ” to be published in Boston by the W. B. Clarke Company. Its frontispiece is the author's portrait, and it is further H-lustrated-^by his photographs showing sick trees and curative methods, and by some twenty bird pictures, lent by the Department of Agriculture. Although nominally intended for children, the book will find some thousands of adults qualified to 'earn from it.
The children’s books continue to come in battalions, but the list of ‘Messrs. Little, Brown & Co. closes this week with Miss Jennie Hairs " Men of Old Greece,” and Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co.’s with Dr. Eva MarchJTappan's ” The Golden Goose,” Swedish fairy tales, illustrated by Swedish artists, neither stories nor pictures being “ phlebotomized,” if one may borrow a word from ** The Mystery of June 13."

Forty years have made little difference in the long story written for girls, and the
•	type established by Miss Phelps in ” Gypsy Breynton ” is still followed, but In little books, short stories in covers, the change has been very great. For Instance, take the pair published by Messrs. Dana Estes & Co., ” Mr. Penwiper's Fairy Godmother/’ by Miss Amy Woods, and “ The Old Monday Farm,” by Miss Louise R. Baker. In the former, a gay, adventurous little maid suddenly becomes a cripple and the shy, ^reserved man of whom she and her mates have made a
. bugaboo, comes to be her constant visitor because he blames himself for having quite innocently caused her m,is£ortunQ.
In trying to bear her trouble bravely, the child becomes the involuntary means of bringing him back to comradeship with his kind. In the latter book, two boys try farming, learn that it is not all play, and see what misfortunes may fall upon an honest man opposed to one willing to take
, advantage of tiie law.

The instructive book has improved also, developing from monosyllabic insipidity into liveliness based on the supposition
1 that even while it is so young that It listens to more books than it reads, the child understands something of its native language. Miss Mary Hazelton Wade’s ** Ten Big Indians,” published by the W. A. Wilde Company, is colloquial at times, but the language is natural and unaffected, and instead of illustrations well worn by service in other books, this has pictures after good pen-and-ink drawings by Sears Gallagher. " The Coming- of the White Men," by the same author, returns to the Harry and Lucy model, and M Uncle Sam ” tells fourteen stories to Joe and Lucy, brother and sister, showing how it happens that the people of various parts of the country are of different blood.

As for such books as the holiday edition of Mrs. Johnston’s *' Two Little Knights of Kentucky,” they have been possible only since the invention of printing in color. This volume has eight full-page pictures by Mr. Harold Matthews Britt, and Is bound in the same style as last year's holiday “ Little Colonel.”
Mr. Charles Reedy's “ The Cathedrals of Northern Spain,” which closes the Cathedral Series issued by Messrs. L. C. Page & Co., is uncommon in its photographs, representing types of ecclesiastical architecture unknown beyond the peninsula, never being exactly reproduced either in the Indies, on the Spanish Main, or in Mexico, and also in its text. This latter is an exuberant bit of writing, showing great fondness for an abstract Spain of the author's fancy and frank impatience with Spanish traits and the characteristic events of Spanish history. One forgives its perverseness for the sake of its liveliness.	•
Francis Miltoun’s *’ Rambles in Normandy ” is well suited in its title, for it represents several years of travel and residence, and its author and artist follow no beaten track, but roam wheresoever their motor car will carry them, the artist picturing only what she likes, and the author relating such passages of history or describing such scenes as strike him as picturesque, and so tho book is both gay and amusing. It is an open secret that the author is Mr. Mansfield, formerly of Mansfield & Wessels, and that the artist. Miss Blanche McManus, has long been his ! Wife.	STEPHENSON	BROWNE.
