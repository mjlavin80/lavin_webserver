Hilarity in I ndian Camps.
A'ein York Times Saturday Rcvicic of Hooks:
Your reviewer in commenting on Mr. Johnson’s new book, “ French Explorers,” does not believe the statement that there was great hilarity of a Winter’s night in tne Indian camps, and asks where Mr. Johnson “got this from’"/ May I say that it may be, had from numberless sources in the literature pertaining- to the subject. The Indian loves fun. He is a clam with strangers, but when you
are no longer a stranger you finfl he likes a joke as well as a white man. Mr. Johnson’s description is entirely accurate, and it can be verified abundantly, if indeed it needs more than the fact that it comes from so broad and careful a student as is Mr. Johnson. *
