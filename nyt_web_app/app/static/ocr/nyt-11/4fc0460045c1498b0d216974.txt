s™jgjgi5igpHE volume of ** Loiters of Henrik Ibsen,” translated by John Nilson Lnurvifc anti Mary Morison, which Fox, Duffield & Co. are issuing to-day, shows how the dramatist’s lame and influence have spread -throughout the world. As the editors, Halvdan Koht and Dr. Julius Ellas, write in their introduction, the epistles “ do not give a complete description of the process, but convoy it to us in characteristic fragments,” and they add:
The degree 111 which
The Letters Ibsen has impressed of	himself on tlie national
Hcnrilf Ibsen, consciousness as an artistic and intellectual power has varied very much in ihe different countries. But u poet of worldwide fame he has undoubtedly become at last—the Norwegian author whose struggle was at lirst such a hard one.
The letters extend over a period of more tlian half a century, and reveal the writer during the changing conditions of his life and his friendships, and contain much of both biographical and literary interest, that has never before been made public. Tlie editors say:
They were written without any thought whatever of publication, and there is, therefore, nothing of the literary character about them—now they are ponderous, clumsy, official communications, now spontaneous or even violent expressions of the feeling or tiie moment. But this very lack of literary finish endows them with the charm of real life, and makes them of inappreciable value as sources from which to derive knowledge of Ibsen. Wc have In thiise letters that unreserved expression of his personal feelings which has hitherto been, to a great extent, withheld from the public: we see him in his human weakness und greatness; we learn that his proverbial reserve is not in reality an essential element of his character, and a wonderful light is thrown upon tlie development of his theories of life and art, and upnn the germination and growth and aim of his works. Into some of his most private-feelings and most Intimate relations with others it is not permissible to allow the public any insight.
As will be seen, the volume contains not even one letter written to Ibsen, because none, it is pointed out, could be found. But tho introduction and the notes have been provided to help tho reader to a better understanding of the cTram;ilist’s ** frame of mind." ■

Speaking of Hen-3Iar(in Hurne'a ry VIII. in the Opinion of preface to his book
Iving Heury VIII. ‘ The Wives of
Henry VIII.," published by McClure, Phillips & Co., Martin Hume, author of " The Courtships of Queen filizabeth.*' “ The Love Affairs of Mary Queen of Scots,*’ &c., says what he thinks of this English ruler:
I regard Henry himself not as the far-seeing statesman he is so often depicted for us, sternly resolved from the first to free his country from the yoke of Rome, and pressing forward through a lifetime with his eyes firmly fixed upon the goal of England’s religions freedom, but rather as a weak, vain, boastful man, the plaything of his passions, which were artfully made use of by the parties to forward religious and political ends in the struggle of giants that ended in the Reformation. No influence that could be exercised ov^r the King was neglected by those who sought to lead him, and least of all that which appealed to his uxoriousness, and I hope to show in the text of this book how each of his wives in turn was but an Instrument of politicians, intended to sway the King on one side or the other. Regarded from this point of view the lives of these six unhappy Queens assume an importance in national history which cannot be accorded to them if they are considered in the usual light as the victims of a strong and lustful tyrant, each one standing apart in her turn simply the darling so^ce of his hours of dalliance.

The Lakes of Como, Richard Bocot Lugano, Lecco, Maggi-Descrlbes the ore, Orta, Iseo, and Lakes of Italy, others of Northern
Italy are described and painted in the latest volume in the color series bearing the imprint of the Macmillan Company and appearing with the title, " The Italian Lakes.” Richard Bagot, the author, is a well-known English writer who has lived in Italy for many years. His books, *' Donna Diana, ’ " Casting of Nets/* fie., it will be remembered. deal with Italian life and customs.
The large number of pictures are from the brush of Miss Ella Du Cane. Como and Lago Magglore have supplied her with the majority of subjects—Lago di Como, because it is the most important^ beauty of scenery of all the lakes of this part of Italy and the centre of the historical and artistic Interests of the Italian lake country. Besides taking up a number of plates, Lago di Como also takes up much of Mr. Bagot’s text. The illustration^^ it jnay be added, axe faithful to nature, and hence must be the most complete reproductions of water colors so far made for this series. Everywhere throughout the book the "bright softiiess" of Italian scenery is brought out by the artist
The hook opens with descriptiori&/of the Lake of Lugano and its Islands, &c. Apart from its population, writes Mr. Bagot, Nature M evidently intended Lu-gano*and its lake to.act as a kind of portal to that genuine 'Italy which is die-^closed to the senses as soon as the mountain ^pass Jbetween ;tne _ hasin.of, the LalfS
of Lugano and that of Como has been traversed.” Como is next considered. It , sometimes looks more like a " drop scene,” says the author, than the work j of Nature, *• Were it not for the irans- I parent blu« haze enveloping woodland, J water, and mountains, and blending the sharpness of their outlines into one harmonious whole, the general effect, especially at first sight, of * * * the view over the upper portions of the Larian Lake might be one of artificiality.” While Lago Maggiore is very beautiful, yet, says Mr. Bagot, ** it cannot be compared with Como—there can be no question that in historic interest the Larian Lake pos- j sesses every advantage over its rival." Lago d’Orta, although insignificant in size when compared with the just mentioned lakes, ** far surpasses tlie two others in
its wealth of color and picturesque ef- i fects.” The Lago d’Isco, which is de- j scribed last, is cuie of the least known of all the lakes in Northern Italy, even though it is “one of ihe most beautiful. In some of its characteristics it more resembles one of the fresh water lochs of the west coast of Scotland than any other lake south of tlie Alps, and yet at the same time the L:tgo d’lsoo has the Italian coloring and atmosphere and the Italian vegetation."

The Grand Duchy Round About of L u x c m b o u r g,
Lnxemlionrjr at which lias played the Fireside. such an important
part in the history of Europe, has now Almost been lost s’ght of. And it may be interesting to hear of the publication through E. F. Dutton & Co. of a study of this little State by the Rev. T. XL Passmore, author of '* Tho Sacred Vestments,” ** The Things Beyond the Tomb," &c., erftitled “ In Further Ardenne." The author’s idea in producing the volume, he writes, ** is to pay your fare for you, so to speak, and take you there, and present you to its beauties and interests and simple kindly folk, without troubling you lo move out >of your chair.”
The volume opens with a sketch of the history of the Grand Duchy, whose sovereign, ill the constitutional sense, is really a monarch. The history of Luxembourg, Mr. Passmore goes on to show, is interesting—” it is the lore of a land which, trodden down by the feet of the ! nations in succcssion and recording like an aneroid or a brain cull the impressions wrought by each shock in turn, has yet never for a moment lost its distinctive individuality.”' descriptions are given of interesting sights in the Luxembourg, anecdotes are related, stories about famous people are retold, &c. In his chapter on the ” Land and Folk To-day,” Jlr. Passmore writes about the currency:
In currency of commerce, of chronology, and of communication, Luxembourg is trine. Which is to say, the country has three coinages, three times, and three tongues, all in full but independent vigor and vogue, like the balls a juggler keeps up with both hands. The official coinage is French, and coins ol the Latin Union are current, but the popular money is German gold and silver with Luxembourg and Belgian nickel pennies, half pennies, and mites to a degree quite microscopic. So franc and mark and thaler jostle one another in your pocket, and you have to be doing quick little sums in your head whenever you ask for a glass of beer*
*	* * The official language is French. The poiite language is German, The real language is a skeon of most languages, worked or* a bone of Middle German.
