any lover of nature in the 1 • * % wild, to any admirer ot manliness and courage and hardihood, to any one, in short, who feels the good red blood pulsate through his veins, who craves action, the latest book of President Roosevelt. “ Outdoor Pastimes of an American Hunter.*' must be of interest. Dealing especially with hunting, but treating in passing topics; suggested by the pursuit of game through the wilderness,' there is much serious* import- in the work. It aims primarily to record, for the purpose of^ adding to our store of knowledge, the traits and habits of animal life, but it deals as well with questions of game preservation, the effects of game upon the economic life, and the benefits of , *
hunting and similar pastimes in the development of sturdy character in a nation. • President Roosevelt takes his sport seriously, as he does all other things In life, and of it says:
I am not disposed to undervalue manly outdoor sports, or to fail to appreciate the advantage to a nation, as well as to an individual, of such pastimes; but they must not be carried to excess. There is no need to exercise much patience with men who protest against field sports. If no deer or rabbits were Killed, no crops could be cultivated. If it is morally right to kill an animal to eat its body, then it is morally right to kill it to preserve its head. A good sportsman will not hesitate as to the relative value he puts on the two, and to get the one he will go a long time without eating the other. No nation facing the unhealthy softening* and relaxation of fibre which tend to accompany civilization can afford to neglect anything that will develop hardihood, resolution, scorn of discomfort and danger. But If sport Is made an end instead of a means, it-is better to avoid it altogether.
Later in the volume he says:
The qualities that make a good soldier are in a large part the qualities that make a good hunter. Most important ©£ all is the ability to shift for one’s self. Skill in the use of the rifle is another trait: quickness in seeing game another; ability to take advantage of cover yet another; while patience, endurance, keenness of observation, resolution, good nerves, and instant readiness in an emergency are all Indispensable to the good hunter. The chase of an animal should rank according as it calls for the exercise in a high degree of a large number of these qualities. *	*	* No training in the
barracks is as good as the 'training given by a hard hunting trip. It is an excellent thing for a man to be a good horseman and a good marksman, to be bold and hardy, and wonted to feats of strength and endurance, to be able to live in the open, and to feel a self-reliant readiness in any crisis. Big game hunting tends to produce and develop exactly these physical and moral traits. That it can be abused either in the way in which it is done, or the extent to which it is carried, does not alter tlie fact that it is in itself a sane and healthy recreation.
To those who make the study of wild life a serious and scientific business the work will doubtless be of importance in adding to the store of information already at hand. Of its accuracy there can be no question. Of its thoroughness, it may be said, it is as complete as the opportunities for observation afforded to the author permit. With its views and opinions we need not deal. To the reader who will approach the book /feither with a healthy interest in outdoor life or with an idle curiosity^to read what a President has written, the work should prove of interest. The first half, which is devoted to various kinds of big gq,me hunting, will furnish interesting narratives that occasionally thrill with the excitement that the chase itself has awakened in the hunter himself. Thus his description of his first experience at coursing the wolf is especially entertaining. He says:
As we began to go down hill I let the horse fairly race; for by Abernethy*s motions I could. tell that he was close to the wolf. In a couple of miles I was close enough to see what was going on. The coyote was obviously tired, and Abernethy, with the aid of his perfectly trained horse, was helping the i greyhound catch it. Twice he headed it, and this enabled me to gain rapidly.
I Just as it crossed the creek the grey-| hound made a rush, pinned it by the hind leg, and threw it. There was a scuffle, then a yell from the greyhound i as the wolf bit it. At the bite the hound let go and jumped back a few

, nethy; whohad ridden' hi? 'horse right: on them' as theyr struggled," leaped off and sprang on'top of the wolf. He held
*	the reins ^of his horse with one hand and ..thrust -the other, with a rapidity and precision even greater than the: rapidity of the wolf’s snap, Into the wolf's mouth, jamming his hand down crossr wise betweeen the jaws, seizings the lower jaw and bending it down so that the wolf could not bite hjm. .-He had a stout glove on his hand, but this would have availed nothing had he not ^seized the animal just as he did.'
"When he leaped on and captured this coyote it was entirely free, the dog having let go of it; and he was obliged • to hold the reins of His horse with one hand. I was not twenty yards distant at the time, and as I leaped off the horse, he was sitting placidly on the live wolf; his hand between the jaws, the greyhound standing beside him, and his horee standing by as placid as ho •was. Jt was as remarkable a feat of
the kind as I have ever seen.

Of cougar hunting with hounds he j says:	w*	\
In cougar hunting the success of the | hunter depends absolutely upon the hounds. As hounds that are not perfectly trained are worse than useless, this means that success depends absolutely upon the man who trains and hunts the hounds. As cougar are only plentiful where deer are infinitely more plentiful, the first requisite for a good j cougar hound is that it shall leave ' deer entirely alone. *	*	*	I had
long been anxious to make a regular hunt after cougar in a country where the beasts were plentiful and where we could follow them with a good pack of bounds. *	* * This kind of hunting
was totally different from that to which I-had been accustomed. In the first place, there is no need of always being on the alert for a shot, as it was the dogs that did the work. In the next place, instead of continually scanning the landscape, what we had to do was to look down so as t$ be sure not to pass over any tracks. *	*	*
We finally struck a cougar trail. The hounds had been hunting free. They were summoned by a blast of the horn, and away they went on the trail. * * *
It was a fine sight to see them as they rushed across the valley, the cliffs echoing with their chiming. *	*	*
They passed out of sight and sound, and we did not hear them again until we had toiled up the mountain opposite. * * * While we were still some distance off we could see the cougar in a low pinyon, moving about as the dogs tried to get up. It was the first time I had ever seen dogs with a cougar, and I was immensely interested. As we approached, the cougar jumped down, and after running a couple of hundred yards the dogs seized it. The worry was terrific. * * * The dogs had the upper hand when we arrived. They would certainly have killed it unassisted, but as it was doing some damage to the pack, and might at, any moment kill a dog, I ended the struggle by a knife thrust behind the shoulder. To shoot would have been quite as dangerous for the dogs as for the quarry.
With the more familiar deer hunts we need not coneern ourselves. All kinds of big game hunting found in America are treated. Then he devotes some space to books on game, and a 1 closing chapter on his home life that j will be especially attractive to many.
In the course of it he again refers to the importance of sport in the development I of character. He-there says:	•
Play is good for play’s sake, within moderate limits, especially if it is ath- ! letic play; and, again within moderate limits, it is good because a healthy body helps toward healthiness of mind. But if play serves only either of these ends, it does not deserve the serious consideration which rightly attaches to play which in itself fits a man to do things worth doing. In a free Government the average citizen should be able to do his duty in war as well as in peace; otherwise he falls short. Cavalrymen and infantrymen who do not need special technical knowledge are easily developed out of men who are already soldiers in the rough, that is, who, in addition to the essential qualities of manliness and character, the qualities of resolution. ' daring, and intelligence, which go to make up “ fighting edge,” also possess physical hardihood; who can live in the open, walk long distances, ride, shoot, and endure fatigue and exposure. The sports whi^h produce these traits serve a useful purpose.
The book should prove a valued addition to its class and should direct the
i	attention of a larger number to the best in outdoor sports than could a book by a less distinguished writer.
