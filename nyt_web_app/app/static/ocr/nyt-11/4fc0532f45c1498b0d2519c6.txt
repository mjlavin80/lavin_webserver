Engelbert Humperdinck's 11 Hansel und Gretel ** was produced in New York just ten years ago at Daly’s Theatre, in an English version. That was less than two years after its original production in Germany, but ever since the little opera has kept a tenacious hold upon life. It has not been heard in this coutitry since ■that ^season of 1895, however, till it was produced yesterday afternoon at the Metropolitan Opera House. There was a very 4arge audience there, and a performance of the work was given that in many respects was remarkably good.
When " Hansel und Gretel M was first heard here there were certain doubts About how it ought to be taken, how it should be explained—this gay little children’ s tale elaborated .musically with all the resources of the Wagnerian method and orchestra. Was it a 3est? Was the genial composer amusing himself with a tour de force that only the knowing could understand- and see through? There seemed to be no need of such questionings on the hearing of the opera yesterday aflfer ten years*.	*
“Hfinsel und Gretel,” indeed, presents itBelf to the knowing as an achievement of the higher talent and skill in much that pertains to,modern musicianship, but Jt did not seem ase if there could be anybody in the house to whom this fairy Btory did not appeal as something beautiful, something delightful and enjoyable, Without comment or elucidation.
“ Hansel und Gretel " isa sort of " Alice ih Wonderland ” in that its real point is for children of a larger growth. But this in no way invalidates its fresh naturalness and spontaneity. Its elaborate forms of expression are sincere and gen-nine; and because they are so they are a real expression of the fairy story.
The story is not buried under the narration of it, because of the extraordinary fckill and prescience with which his most varied and elaborate musical apparatus is employed by Mr. Humperdinck. He touched, as by an inspiration, a fresh spring of imagination and beauty in the *folk tales and folk music of Germany, and in his novel and original treatment of them.' *
It may be that hearts here in America
Will not be' so deeply* touched as those
of Germany* have been, where t-hese songs
and these tales are native and where they
are "bred in the bone. But, after all,
There is a kind ot beauty in them that is
not- measured by the limits of a national
frontier, and that it moved the audience
yesterday there coaid be no doubt. At
any rate it touched a chord that has
never vibrated to the representations of 7the passions, lusts, jealousies, revenge, and, murder of the operatic stage.
J^-The subjeet of ** Hansel und Gretel ** is .■Sitade only with some difficulty to stretch to the limits of a three-act opera. There ,are lengths in the first act and the last that even the flow of melody and the ex-' tremely skillful development of the orchestral fabric cannot conceal. The children are charming, and it is ungracious to find their doings in this act too long; perhaps it is less so to find the father and mother somewhat circ*jjnstanti.il in their account of their straitened circumstances. "
In the second act the composer p.nd tho librettist both reached the summit of .their Imagination in their evoc:iMoa of naive and beautiful pictures and the creation of a-truly poetical atmosphere.	,
Mr. Humperdinck has used certain fa- i miliar folk tunes; he has devised **thei3 of his own in their spirit. His more pretentious themes have charm, expressiveness, and fine feeling. His writing lor the orchestra is. subtle and full of the most delicate c'olor effects, brj.iancv, and warmth, yet -always delightfully tr&ns- J parent. In thematic treatment he com- I mands all the art and learning tUai t<ie I modern contrapuntist has learned from Wagner’s later methods.'
- And the composer, it must be said, is deeply indebted to Wagner, especially to the Wagner of “ Die Meistersing’er." There are many pages of the first act -whose relation to that score are too obvious to be overlooked. There is much of the “ Melstersinger ” color and feeling throughout the work, and there are suggestions from ** The Ring/* and even a Strain from. *' Tannhauser." But the disposal of such borrowing from such a source, in such a manner, is the work of a man of remarkable cleverness. Jt is not . given to all to bend the bow of Ulysses as he has.
The cast was extremely well fitted to .make all the i>eculiu.r charm of the ,work* count for tne utmost, and to bring out its most characteristic features. Miss 'Bella Alten achieved a veritable triumph as Gretei. She entered into the spirit of the part with exuberance and a delightful juvenile vivacity. Her action was arch and naive, her singing wholly charming, and never has she appeared to better advantage. - Miss Abarbanell, who took the boy's,part of Hansel, also had an evident sympathy with her task.
1 * It was heV first appearance on the stage of the Metropolitan, though she has been acting successfully in soubrette parts at thq Irving Place Theatre. Her voice has a pleasing quality, but it is not skillfully pro’duced, and there was yesterday a certain throatlness. Mme. Homer was a blood-curdling witch, of fearful and wonderful appearance, capable of any iniquity t’o.ward rash children; and she was willing to sacrifice something of the beauty of Sier voice to the dramatic exigencies of her character.	*
. Mr. Gorltz accentuated the peasant .rudeness of Peter, the good-for-nothing ^father, his drunken entrance, his bolster- ! ous proceedings at home, his rough voice i till they made the character unpleasant-! Jy.outof focus in the picture. So accomplished a dramatic singer as Mr. Goritz has no need to do this. Miss Weed did well the comparatively little she had to do as'the mother. The little parts of the Sandman and the Dewman, sung by Miss Mulford and Miss Glanville, need a little more presence on the stage and a little surer singing.
Mr. Hert2 had prepared a carefully .wrought performance of the score that brought out much of its delicate beauty and glowing sonority and presented some resounding climaxes. Some of his tempos seemed rather heavy-footed, as In the dances of the first act; but it was on the whole admirably played, and the opera was carried through in a way that caught much of its spirit.	.
There was liberal applause when the Singers were called before the curtain ^t' *the end of the second act. Mr. Humperdinck, who came from Europe to ! be present at thi-3 performance, appeared ! with them and acknowledged the plaudits j that were given his work and its (performers- Then came Mr. Conried, and finally Mr. Hertz.
f 'Tii th6 evening at the popular performance “ Tannhauser ” was given for the first time this season with the following cast:	.	*
j&iizabeth.............Mme. Jeanne Jomelli
Venus.  ...............Miss Olive Fremstad
jsId Hirt.Miss Mulford
tTannhauser ------\...............Mr. Jvnote
Wolfram........v.*. * ^....... 3£r. yan Bpoy
X*andgraf Hermann..................Mr. Blass
Conductor.......................Alfred Hertz
* The performance .gave some evidences of insufficient preparation, but in its main outlines -It was such a one as was given last season. Miss Olive Fremstad. who was J the Yenus, sang, with greater beauty and power of voice than' has been usual, even with her—a poignant and expressive* voice and full of the dramatic significance of what she sings, beautiful In-the lower.tones and more certain in. the higher ones; It seemed as if- Mr. .Knots were afflicted -with a desire/ to force' his ^Toice’fo . obtainsgreater -volume - of tone,
' “ '	'	- -■ 'V-V..'■ *«.' -	'
which it;, is not.-at all necessary for him to do. ■	‘	■	•’*	* r
He even pushed it beyond the pitch on more' than one occasion, and sacrificed something of its natural beauty and warmth in this way/ giving it- a certain glassy quality, that he has sometimes shown before; but which he ought not allow to gr.pw. Mr. Knote’s Tannhauser is In its action and dramatic outline a noble and touching Impersonation.
Mr. Van Rooy also shared in this tendency to give too much in voice, and this is a tendency ”hat. for some years has been increasing in his case—also a totally unnecessary one. A new member of the company made her first ^appearance in I Mme. Jeanne Jomelli, who took the part ! of Elisabeth. She has sung in this city in concert, and has had large experience j In opera abroad. This experience w^ls evi- 1 dent in her thorough routine^ in the. part arid her lack of apparent nervousness. Her voice is powerful-and well under her con- i trol, though a certain acid strain through it prevented It last evening from presenting itself as an organ of great beauty or smoothness. But .she is a singer apparently of a sort that may prove useful, if not of tji<e highest distinction.
YOUNG PEOPLE’S CONCERTS.
Symphonic Music with Explanations-^ . Miss Maud Powell as Soloist.
The series of symphony concerts for young people under the direction of Dr. Frank Damrosch was begun yesterday afternoon in Carnegie Hall. These concerts have been favored by many serious-minded music. lovers seeking for light, and have attracted the attention of many older as well as younger listeners. There 1 was a large audience yesterday, who heard Beethoven's second symphony, a movement from .Massenet's “ Scenes Al-saciennes ” called “Sous lee Tilleuls,” and Goldmark’s Sakuntala ” overture.
Miss Maud Powell, whose ripe and sincere art has been too seldom heard lately
in our concert rooms, played Beethoven’s 1 G major-romanza and some smaller pieces*1 Dr. Damrosch, as usual, explained the significant features of the orchestral .pieces, illustrating his. points with piecemeal repetitions of themes and passages.
Recital by Eric V. Goodwin.
Eric Valentine Goodwin gave his first recital in New York yesterday afternoon at the studio of Walter S. Young at Carnegie Hall. Mr. Goodwin is a basso who has sung with the. Musurgia Society and B.t other concerts.
