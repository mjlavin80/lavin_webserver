Father Damien-
Sew York Tijncs Saturday Review of Books:
In the Queries Department Oct. 23 you say: "Persons who had investigated the circumstances knew that Father Damien need not have contracted lepz-osy and considered Stevenson's attack on Hyde as simply a tour de force.” Will you kindly show me the same courtesy you showed M. B. W. and state In your columns who those persons were and where the authority for your statement is to be found? I am an ardent lover of the memory of this man who is so flippantly characterized an " offensive creature ” by your courteous correspondent, made so by Stevenson’s manly defense of one from whom he differed so radically in religious faith and by studying the details of Father Damien’s life from his earliest childhood to his glorious death—the life of “ a man,” to quote Stevenson In rebuttal of your dictum, “ with all the grime of mankind, but a saint and a hero all the more for that."
As to the statement that " the cult of the Leper Priest was largely among Protestants and non-Catholics," with its implied imputation that Father Damien’s martyrdom at Molokai did not win the loving admiration and support of those of his own faith, I prefer to believe that
Ln this case Homer nods.
