PHRASES FOR THE PEOPLE*
THE YOUNG MAN AND THE WOULD.
By Albert J. Beveridge. One volume. 1"V> viiL-404.- Svo. Clotti. New York:- I>. Appleton & Co. ?1.50.	.	■
SENATOR BEVERIDGE says almost nothing that has not been said before, but he says what he does say plainly, once and again—he hammers It in Like the late Mr. Roe’s novels, his book is made up of predigested matter.-The reader does not have to wonder what I anything means; it is all set out for him , in ideas of one syllable, if not in words of like length. Mr. Roe’s novels sold by the millions, more or less. There is no reason why Senator Beveridge, the boy Senator, should not profit by the example. .
-In Mr. Beveridge’s essay on “The Old Home,” we come across this:
It is the commonplaces, and these things alone, by which we live and move ‘and have our being. For example, sunlight is commonplace, and so is living. Who was it that spoke about the damna-blc iteration of the seasons?
That paragraph is typical of the whole hook of essays; It is all on good, safe, and sound commonplace ' ground. ‘ We walk along a brick-paved back street in Philadelphia, not' along Broadway. But Mr. Beveridge has walked along Broadway; he' has heard the chimes at midnight,, and once in a while he says so. -Witness that bold reference to the unknown man who, Pinaforellke, “said Damme! ”
Once In a While, though, Mr. Beveridge breaks away from the commonplace and says something that stands by itself. In his chapter on “ The Young Man and the Nation” he urges young men to join active political clubs and remarks: “ They are the powerhouses of our political system.” That is distinctly a happy thought and happy phrase. There are other happy turns of speech in the book, but not too many. Mr. Beveridge has remembered the advice given years ago to a young reporter by the publisher of a paper: “Be a solemn fool.” Not that It applies to him, but he knows that pedple like solemn fools, and he is telling young men how to succeed in ^the world and knows that the subject requires solemn treatment.
Mr. Beveridge is doing very well; he j gives advice on almost as many qubjects 1 as does the President—o_n going to college, on not going, on being a lawyer, on being a Speaker, on being a minister, on being a politician. He is younger than Mr.
Roosevelt,'however; when-he attains his years possibly he may have become an .^authority .on even more subjects.	*
