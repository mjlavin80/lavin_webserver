J. P. R.. Bangor, Me,—Can you tell anything of the authoress of “ The Household of Bouverie:	or.	the Elixir ot Gold,'* a ro-

A.	M. HESTON. Atlantic City, N. .T.—Doubtless the poem, " The Church and the World/’ to which •* L.

The first half or this poem appears in the " Library of Poetry and Song/’ edited by Will-fam Cullen Bryant, under the caption of “London Churches," but the other half Is not printed in the collection because it was suppressed by some or the churchmen of England before the publication of Bryant’s collection. Lord Houghton visited America in 1875. at which time he gave a copy of the entire poem to a friend who had once heard It read, but had tried Ln vain to find It In print. Tho suppressed verses criticised the English Church for the way In which it excluded the poor from
i the; churches,-,The- pgem;' especially the .last. half,-: gave gthat- offense to • thft dignitaries^ the Established Church.

i And fairs and shows ln the halls were held— The World and'his children wero-there;
-	Laughter, and. music and feasts were heard In the place that-was'meant for prayer.	r '
*	*. -* , * • • .
Then the Church sat down In her ease and
*	-said, ,	‘
I am rich and in goods Increased:
I have need of nothing and naught to do But to laugh and to dance and feast;
The sly-World heard her and laughed in his sleeve,,	,	■
And then mockingly said, aside;	,
The Church Is fallen, the beautiful Church,
And her shame is her boast and pride.	;

** The Mystery of June 13th.”
Melvin L. Severy recently wrote concerning the “ people" in his now book, which bears the imprint of Dodd, Mead & Co.:
Wishing to make my characters as real as possible I took several of them as well as many of the incidents from real life. Some of those things which by many would be considered the most unlikely in the book were in fact real occurrences. In the character of James Moreton the endeavor was made to foreshadow the demoralizing trend of latter-day financial methods and to sound as loud a note of warning as such a book could voice. The story first came to me, as all my stories come, in the form of a central idea. From this central point I then worked both ways, leading up to it from the beginning on the one hand and from it toward the denouement on the other. The major portion of the work was written at my Winter home in Arlington Heights, while the remainder of it was produced on the shores of Bear Camp Pond in Sandwich, N. H„ where my Summer place is located—the spot mentioned -by Whittier in one of his poems.
