After three years of constant growth tn London, The Connoisseur Magazine appears with a New York imprint, the November number being the first to intimate this semi-naturalization. The magazine is by no means international; It Is distinctly local to England in its character. But we Americans are les3 parochial than the British, and The Connoisseur will probably do as well as if it were made especially to meet the needs of our collectors. The November number deals with
miniatures by Cosway. English plate, the German Emperor’s plate, the development of the English piano, and other matters ! of similar Interest to collectors.
