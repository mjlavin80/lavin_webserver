Keio I'orfc Times Saturday Review of Books:
Miss Marguerite Merington, 'who some years ago rendered the world her debtor by writing a little ** Cranford piay" which revived interest in that classic all up and down the land, has just brought out In a fuller form a second attempt at producing the spirit of " Cranford ’* on the amateur stage. She has shown herself the continuity which proves the proverb " Let well enough alone." Never was a jrood work followed by a more disastrous downfall* One can have for the second attempt only unstinted words of condemnation.
Not only has she lost her grip upon the characters, allowing poor, sweet Miss Mattje to talk occasionally the Johnsonese of Miss Deborah, she has lot slide the two fundamentals on which the book is built. The ladies of “ Cranford" are never consciously funny. The delicious comedy consists in the very obliviousness of every one save the narrator to the comedy; they are always ladies in the loveliest " lavender and old lace ” senso of the word. Now, in this new edition all Mary Smith's little asides are stuck per: force into the mouths of this superbly ; simple aristocracy. Mrs. Fitz-Adam—of all persons—makes jokes at the expense of her size, Miss Betty has a sly hit, or an impossible stupidity, at Carlo. They all indulge in inanities. For Instance, Mrs. Jamieson, who was not a fool, declares, " Carlo, Mulliner, and myself are only just beginning to recover from the shock of the family m§salliance **; a remark offset by Miss Mattie’s Question whether the peerage indulges in jam. Miss Mattie was not a complete idiot, either. This is not comedy; it is farce.
But much worse is the utter lack of “ gentility," Cranford’s most cherished possession. My lady, who in the original talks perfect'Knglish with a Scotch ac^ cent, is a woman who knows her world and has had a good though limited experience of social life> opens her mouth with the brogue of a stable boy, “ I'm a* for the lads myself/' “ Bang goes sax-pence,” while she rushes into the arms of Mrs. Fitz-Adam with a shriek o£ rapture right in an open shop. Mrs. Jamieson becomes the Iow-eomedy villain, buying only a quarter of a pound of tea, discuss-, i ing her intimate family affairs before all the world, and screaming billingsgate at her quondam sister-in-law. Can one imagine tho bovine and imperturbable aristocrat of the original arousing the spirit of billingsgate from the depths of her stolid inertia? The Muses forbid!
That is the whole ^condemnation of the ,
