1LLIAN WHITING’S aim in her new book, “ The Florence of Landor,” ♦which Little, Brown & Co. are bringing out, ia “ to suggest the living drama that was set in the scenic enchantment” of Florence during the period of Walter Savage Landor’s life in that “ flower of all cities and city of all flowers,” from 1821 to 1864. During this time Florence was visited by
some of the most brilliant The Florence	people of the	nineteenth
of Walter	century, who	also went
Savoie	to see the	“ majestic
Landor.	poet." They included the
Brownings and Trollopes, (who stayed,) Emerson, Frances Power Cobbe, Mrs. Stowe, Theodore Parker, 1 Margaret Fuller, Mr. and Mrs. William Wetmore Story, Seymour Kirkup, who j discovered Giotto’s faded fresco of Dante ! in the chapel of the Bargello; Frederick Tennyson, the Hawthornes, &c. In her opening chapter, from which comes the title of the book, the author writes:
Entering Florence did Landor overtake that psychological moment that, somewhere and sometime, lies in wait for every one? ♦ * * However unconsciously, Landor was opening the most richly illuminated chapter of his life. * * * Down the long vistas awaited beautiful figures —the forms of poet, painter, and thinker, as yet undiscerned in the distance; signals flashed to him unrecognized by his vision; subtle vibrations thrilled the air that had still not aroused his answering perception. * * * The tapestries of life woven out of threads invisible to the eye after designs which have not prefigured themselves are made as notelessly as are those of the paradise of which the poet | dreams. Into that wonderful Florence, j still vital with the color, the romance, J the tragedy, the passionate exaltation j and the passionate despair of the fifteenth century was Landor entering. All this was a part of his unconscious Inheritance.
In the chapter on '* The Dream of Rose Aylmer” Miss Whiting tells the full story 1 of Landor’s youthful romance, which “ colored and pervaded his entire life.” The volume has been supplied with fifteen illustrations, the frontispiece being a reproduction of Charles Caryll Coleman’s oil portrait of Landor, which Miss Whiting lias in her possession.

The Canadian Poems of	poet, Wilfred
Wilfred Campbell. Campbell, who
will be remembered by his contributions of verse to The Atlantic Monthly, Scribner’s, Harper’s, and other periodicals, has written an Introduction to his volume of collected lyric poems, which the Fleming H. Revell Company has in active preparation, and a special edition of which, as was announced last week, has been ordered by Andrew Catrjpgie. Mr. Campbell speaks of the meaning of poetry, the effect of . poetry on mankind, the writing of verse, &c. He says.
After all, the real root of all poetry, from Shakespeare to the latest singer, is in the human heart. The mind is cold and critical. It plans and plots. It examines and sifts. Man with the mind alone were but a mean creature. * * * It is man the hoper, man the dreamer, the eternal child of delight and despair, whose ideals and desires are ever a lifetime ahead of his greatest accomplishments, who Is the hero of nature and the darling of the ages. Because of this true poetry will always be to him a language, speaking to him from the highest levels of his bialng and a sort of translation from a more divine tongue emanating from the mystery and will of God. Poetry may have many messages; but above all stands the eternal appeal from -life and mature. AH descriptions of water and land, sky and earth, Summer, and Winter not necessarily poetry is that dealing with the human soul. The highest class, of poetry, that of Shakespeare, that of the Old Testament, of Goethe, is
that dealing with the eternal tragedy of life in the universe,

What is believed to , Pope Gregory’s be the first detailed 1 Lil'e and Times, study of the life and |
times of Gregory the Great, entitled ** Gregory the Great: His Place in History and Thought," by F. Homes Dudden, B.D., is being issued by Longmans, Green & Co. in two volumes.
It is, the author explains, an attempt to supply the want of a work dealing, as this does, with the history of the saint, with some account of the political, social, and religious characteristics of the age, and with Gregory’s theology—the last being the first attempt that has been made in English to set forth systematically the dogmatic utterances of the last of the Latin Doctors. The work is intended not only as a biography of Gregory, but also, in some degree, as a work of reference on his age. The author has provided a very full index, an index of the life, works, and doctrines of this Pope, and a table of leading dates. Mr. Dudden says of Pope Gregory:
Gregory the Great is certainly one of the most notable figures in ecclesiastical his-tpry. He has exercised in many respects a momentous influence on the doctrine, the organization, and the discipline of the Catholi.c Church.* * * * Gregory was by far the most important personage of his time. He stood in the very centrc of his world, and overshadowed it. He took an interest and claimed a share in all its chief transactions; he was in relation, more or less intimate, with all its leading characters. * * * * Finally, to Gregory the students of English history are more especially bound to devote their attention, since it is he who was the means of introducing Christianity among the English, and of renewing the broken communications between Britain and, the Roman world. * * « * His pontificate is important in the history of the Papacy. * * * * because he gave encrgetic practical expression to the ideas already existing, because he labored for the consolidation of the power that was conceded, because he imparted a real impulse to a rar idly developing system, and because he had no successor of note until the time of Gregory the Seventh.
James O u t r a m Mountains of makes no attempt at Western Canada, a scientific treatment of any of the geological, zoological, or botanical features met with in the Canadian Rockies in his book, “ In the Heart of the Canadian Rockies,” which is appearing with the imprint of the Macmillan Company. He deals with these characteristics, he says, “ merely en passant as they strike a very ordinary mortal, with less than an elementary acquaintance with these sciences.” He has written the book from the point of view of an enthusiast— " first, as a lover of Nature and her Infinite Creator who has had the privilege, during a long period of compulsory abandonment of all his wonted mental occupations, to spend a part of three Summers in the most attractive region It has been his lot to visit; and, secondly, as a mountaineer, to whom, as to ‘ Childe Harold/ * high mountains are a feeling.’ ”
Interwoven with the accounts of Mr. Outram’s experiences are the narratives of others’ adventures in following the trail from Mount Asslnlboine to Mount Columbia. Besides these, the author also presents some account of .all the more notable *‘ first ascents/’ together with a description of the chief points of interest and beauty massed in the mountain fastnesses.
E. P. Dutton & Co.
Napoleon on are bringing out heTe, English History. in conjunction with
J. M. Dent & Co. of London, the volume containing “ Napoleon’s Notes on English History,” made during the last months of 17S8, on the very eve of the French Revolution, and refreshed from the findings of later research by the late Henry Foljambe Hall.
The first three parts in the book are by Mr. Hall. He deals at length with Napoleon’s rGle as an eighteenth century student of history; considering the very poor material at his disposal, writes the author, Napoleon’s almost invariably right judgment seems marvelous, and his verdicts, generally the very opposite of those of his author, who kept to the orthodox ruts of eighteenth century opinion, ara» those of a hundred years later.” Then he discusses the “ Note Books,” and provides lengthy notes on Napoleon’s probable authorities—Barrow, Rapin, and Carte, with references also to Hume, Macaulay, and others. *■
Besides presenting Napoleon’s notes, Mr. Hall has endeavored to supplement them in such a way that they may give a bird’s-eye ^view of every reign, a view “ philosophical enough for scholars and popular enough for schoolboys.”
The three illustrations in tho volume comprise a portrait of Rapln, a fac simile, of a page of the original manuscript of the notebooks, and a view of Auxonne,
, . where the books were compiled. • /	; _
