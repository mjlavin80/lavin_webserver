RIjBAIYAT OF SOLOMON AND OTHER
• By Amanda T. Jones. New
Tork: Alden Brothers. $1.25.	.
THE wisdom of Solomon has much in common with that of the tent-maker of Persia, and Miss Jones very successfully renders his thought in the quatrains now permanently connected with Omar's name. The mixture of pessimism and despairing hope, when there is^ no further room for anything but hope, is as strong in Solomon as in Omar* There is also, however, the more modern note of the religious agnostic, who would contend that, because we cannot know the full effect of evil, we must strive the more mightily for- the good, Perhaps the quatrains grouped under the title " Joy in Life'’ may be taken as fairly indicative of the spirit of the work:
I.
Tet go" thy way and eat thy bread with joy.
Tea, drink thy wine with merriment; employ
Thine hands in service, at thy Lord's betiest.
God will accept thy works nor thee destroy.
.	n.
White as the snows of Hermon be thy vest;
Let not thy head lack ointment of the best.
Live joyfully with her, thy chosen wife—
Thy labor shall be sweet and sweet thy rest.
III.	.
Better than sword or sacrificial knife, Thy tools of labor—neither stirring strife,
Nor causing grief, ^nor giving babes affright.
War not and be thy fields with plenty rife.
IV.
And since thou knowest not when death shall smite,
Do what thou hast to do with all thy might:
For in the grave is neither hope nor life,
Nor work, nor understanding, nor delight.
Miss Jones does not ^confine herself to translating the thoughts of another, Solomon though he be, and her work is imbued with an individual spirit of healthy faith. Many 'of her religious poems are written £n beautiful and difficult meters that are as far removed from the commonplace as from the " common meter ” beloved of the indolent writer depending on the fervor
i	of his feeling alone. The poem " Abigail Becker ” rings with the true ballad1 music and has the swift rush of verse rightly associated with the ballad. The variety of achievement in this modest volume is in pleasing contrast to that offered* in most collections of its size.
