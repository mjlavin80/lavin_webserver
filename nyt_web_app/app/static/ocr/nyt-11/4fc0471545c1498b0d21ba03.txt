COL. HIG.G I JSTS OINT.
OL. THOMAS WENTWORTH HIGGINSON. in his 41 Part of a Manrs Life,’* (Houghton-Mifflin,) has jotted down, clearly without any well-defined autobiographical plan, some random reminiscences that cover a large part of his long and actiye life. He has seen much and thought much and done much, and he has the way, of making all that he writes seem Interesting;. Yet it must be confessed that a good deal of his reminiscence and anecdote is here spread out pretty thin. They relate to the chief interests that have engaged him and the people he has met in his long career, especially the literary people.
He begins with the Transcendental period, upon which perhaps he throws no new light, but about which he talks entertainingly, tracing its origin to Burns, Coleridge, and Wordsworth, later Carlyle and the philosophers of the early nineteenth century. His stories about Brook Farm are not at first hand. He considers tlie effect of transcendentalism on a minority of its adherents to have been disastrous, developing in them wayward temperaments and im'possible dispositions. He is led on to sp<?5ik of children in a gentle and reminiscent manner, discussing their imagination and fantastic figments. . He considers the relations of I “ English, and American Cousins," draw- J ing first the conclusion of the greater sluggishness of English minds, which some have remarked before, and quoting a story of Prof. Tyndall. When lecturing in this country he s&id that, whereas I ln his London experiments' he had to repeat his explanations three times—once to make his* Hearers' comprehend what he was abotit- to' do,* then' to show what he .was- doing,■‘then to .explain what he had done—ho could after his, first lecture in America -<?mit ,his final explanation, and latterly, .t^-iwi'ldje one as well, .

THERE ar$ some interesting reminiscences of the early days of the lyceum system, when Col. Higginson was a traveling lecturer himself. There w£re -audiences in those days that could not', be duplicated now. Being unavoidably, delayed in attending a lecture of Charles'Sumner’s in Worcester one evening, Col. Higginson got there at 10:15, just In time- to hear Sumner say, in Wjt stately and ponderous way: ** I have now refuted, as I think, the twelfth" argument brought against the new Constitution. I pass to a- thirteenth object!on.’* And the remarkable part of the story is that this last offer was followed by a round oi^ applause. .

T T is the questions, past and present,
| relating to the negroes, that Col. Higginson speaks with the most warmth. He adopts Gen. Saxton’s characterization of them as " intensely human,*’ and refuses to see any other problem than those explicable by this view. The real negro Is just like the white, and is to be treated-in the same way. No charge is more unfounded than that the negro was best understood by his former masters. He brings many arguments and experiences to fortify- this position, many of them connected with his command of a, negro regiment in
the civil war. An amusing bundle of letters he has received in his quality of literary man, a chapter on ’* Books Unread,” a discussion of “ Butterflies in Poetry,” some pleasant talk about ** Wordsworthshire,” partly literary, partly descriptive of things seen in the lake country, and a reminiscent and critical roll call of some of the most prominent and* best-beloved names at the close 6f the Victorian epoch in literature, form a number of pleasing chapters. He gives a glimpse of Una Hawthorne, the elder daughter of the novelist, quoting the sub^ stance of many letters, and revealing a strikipg personality and a rare type of character. ~	'
One of the most interesting features of the book is the abundant illustration with \ portraits, caricatures, and many facsimiles of letters written by distinguished literary men to Col. Higginson.	I
