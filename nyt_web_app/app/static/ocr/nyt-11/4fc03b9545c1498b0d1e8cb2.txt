I»^viiig:’s Suppressed Plays.
AT«c York Times Saturday Review of Books:
In your editorial on the prospective fiood^ of Henry Irvins' literature, you mention Mr. Clement Shorter’s statement th:it Irvinjj was compelled to give up t-he production of two plays, W. G. 'Wills's " Robert Emmet/’ and a play on Mohammed, both at the request of the Government. I remember quite well Irvine’s announcement of the former, made in a speech before the curtain on the last night of the season, I should say in the Sum-mur of ISSO, or possibly 3SS1. But in the same speech he spoke of another play which he hoped to produce soon—one based on the after life of Shylock. I never knew before why Wills’s “ Emmet " never saw the lijjht, but even at this late day I should like to know more of the Shylock play. Did you ever hear of it?	R.	G.	B.
