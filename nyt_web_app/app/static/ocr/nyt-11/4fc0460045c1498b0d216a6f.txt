A QUEEN OF TEARS,
Martin Haile’s New Life of Unfortunate Alary of Modena.'*'
R. HAII-E has made an inter-. estinE book on the life of a young woman of little importance, Mary of Modena, Princess of Este, second wife -* of James IT. of England. As is apt to be the case, the loss important the subject the greater the Wealth of information about it that is obtainable. Sucli Is the case with Mary of Modena. Mr. Haile says that tho diffivulty of his work has been in compressing its results within the limits of a singlo volume.
In 1073 James, Duke of York, had been a widower for two years, and was looking for anotiu-r wife, " beginning to take notice,” as the ribald say. He was forty years old, and next heir to tho British Crown, but had no son. He had no ej-porial choice in the way of a wife, wanted nicrfly a good-looking woman; but el^von Princesses were offered to him, of whom his counselors eliminated five, leaving Claudia Felicitas of Inns-pruck, Mary Ann of Wiirteinberg, Mao* Beatrice of Modena, Eleanore Magdalen of Ncuburg, tho Duchess of Guise, and Mile, de Retz. The Emperor of Germany was waiting for his wife to die that he might marry the first named, who was famed for her beauty, so he opposed James's marriage to her. and successfully, The Duke's Inspectors reported favorably on Mary of Modena, but the latter wanted to enter a convent. There was delay, vacillation; finally the Pope wrote to the Princess, ** the only instance," says Mr. Halle, " we believe, of a Sovereign Pontiff directly addressing a Princess of 15 years of age.” He advised her to give up the idea of a convent and marry James; the advice was practically a command, and tho little Princess obediently yielded, and was married to tho Duke of York by proxy on Sept. 30, 1G73, The English people did not approve the match. James was suspected of being a “ Papist,” and the people wanted no more Catholics over them. But matters were quiet on the whole, though there was no popular rejoicing at the birth of the Duchess’s son, the Dulie of Cambridge.
This child was visited by his half-sister, the Princess Anne, later Queen Anne, who had just recovered from smallpox, and promptly died of the same disease. The Duchess played a purely domestic part .during tho remainder of the reign of Charles 1L She attended her husband to Scotland, when he had to leave London in 1GS0, and held Court with him there, where her first daughter died. She was in Edinburgh for eighteen months. On her return the Duchess was well received by the people, having lived down the distrust of her as a foreigner and a Catholic which greeted her nine years earlier. At the coronation the new Queen paid the debts of all prisoners in jail for sums loss than £5, thus releasing eighty from Newgate and many hundreds throughout the kingdoms.
On June HO, 1GS8, the Queen gave birth to^n son, James, Prince of Wales, the Old Pretender. The popular belief was that he was not her son, but a *' changeling — to use the old name of the fairy stories. Within a few weeks the Prince of Orange had landed, and on Dec. 4 the Queen fled with her baby, reaching Calais on the
11	tli, In France she was practically a prisoner of Louis XIV.
The Queen was only 30 when she fled from England, and she lived to be CO. The second thirty years of her life were spent in exile, a pensioner on a foreign King, perpetually torn by hopes and fears for her husband's restoration, then for her son’s. She might have been Queen of * Poland had her husband willed; but she was glad that he declined the offer. James 1L died on Sept. 1C, 1701, and for the next five years Mary of Modena was titularly Regent of Great Britain. Sorrow was indeed her portion. In 17,12 her only daughter died, the Princess Louise Marie; In 1715 her son made a gallant but fruitless effort to regain his ancestral kingdom; she saw the sun of the Stuarts setting in gloom, and looked forward .to her own death as the only happiness possible. No; one other she hoped for* but ln vaiii, Mr. Haile touches on her hope and attempt to obtain tlie beatification and canonization of her husband- Miracles aTe recorded that were performed by hi3 intercession; the Cardinal Gualtlero said that the procedure was long, and miracles were of weight in it only at the end. So she had to give up that hope." On May 7, 1718, she died of congestion of-the lungs, very suddenly; and two days later, for the first time clad in the black habit of the nuns of'her^ favorite Order of the Visitation,* her body was carried to the convent of Chaillot, near St Germain; She Irad been happier had she been allowed to enter the convent at Modena thirty years ear-Her; it was her iil-fortune to be born a*
‘Princess, and to be cast into the sea of' British politics. She was In every way a
