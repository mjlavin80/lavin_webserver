Ed^ar Allnn Poe-
TiCio York Times Saturday Review of Booh3:
The lines on Edsar Allan Poe by Fatlici John B. ^Tabb Nov. 22 recall to my mind a conversation I had just thirty years ago with the late Charles F. Briggs, at one time editorially associated 'with Poe on The Broadway Journal, always a just and capable critic, and celebrated by Lowoll in his " Fable for Critics.”
Mr. Briggs had good cause for hi "tor feelings toward Poe, not necessary to detail here. I personally know that Poe was nt fault. This allusion is for the purpose of pointing a moral.
I asked Mr. Briggs for his estimate of Poo as a litterateur. His words of high praise, clothed In striking poetic metaphor, are well remembered: “He was a genius, an original genius. As a writer he was like the opal—all the more beautiful, full, and full of the play of color by reason of refractcd light from interna! strains and fractures; they directed and controlled his mind In chosen fields with an unapproachable power. His fame will grow, ana endure/'
Time has reversed much of the crass criticism and gross exaggeration in Griswold’s " Xjife ’’ of the poet. Lowell's ironical notice of Griswold, in the " Fable for Critics r*—of his wearing borrowed plumage—warrants his dismissal as one who sought to feather his nest with the rare plumage torn from one of America’s greatest singers.
And yet, at this late day, prejudice is still too strong with many for a just judgment of Poe’s high achievements in literature. His depredators might well ponder on some new definition of “ genius " and '* fame '* to suit their views in this special case, and also compare their narrow estimate with the magnanimity and critical justice of Charles F, Briggs.
When a monument was erected to Burns by his countrymen, his mother bitterly said: “ Robbie asked for bread when he was alive; now that lie is dead they give him a stone." Even this belated substitute is denied the shade of the halfstarved, rare, and unfortunate Poe. ** Fame is but a slow decay ”; but the English language will be a dead one before the fame of *4 the Prince of American litterateurs,*’ as Victor Hugo styled our poet, will die.
