,OR years the most popular book in Amcrica has been Mrs. Susannah Eowson’s story, *• Charlotte Temple: A Tale of Truth.” Of this book Mr. F. W. 'Halsey, its first editor, says:
As* a survival among books of its cmtion it is probably matched in this country only by Franklin s Auto^og-raphy,” if, indeed, that book has matched It. Among novels it has had no rival in its own day—not even ** Evelina, or T he Children of the Abbey.” None of Scott s ncvfls, which came a *^neration later, could have had so wide a reading here Nor until *’ Uncle Tom*s Cabin ” appeared did an American work of fiction dispute its pm-eminence in point of circiuation. Yet this book is not known to the educated public: it is read almost wholly by th* plainest of the plain people. To these. “ Charlotte Temple " is a masterpiece, appearing in a hundred editions, always to bo had; to the higher class of readers the book is known only by name; it is nor sold at bookstores, but at stationery sbcps and news stands. Mr. Halsey writes: “ During the period covered Iby his work on the bibtiography of the book] many well-read men and women were asked if thev had ever read Charlotte Tempi'*.** Nearly all knew about the tombstone in Trinity Churchyard, and in general h.id some notion of Charlotte s story, but that was all. On a Sixth Avenue surface car, and on a railroad train bound for Chicago during the same period were observed two young women reading paper editions with close attention. Again and again have small dealers assured me

selling that book,” said one on the east side. " And it's a shame there has never been a decent edition of it.”
The new edition of this famous book will be a " decent ” one. Mr, Halsey has restored the text of the first edition, correcting upward of 1,200 errors appear.ng in the usual versions; lie has prefixed a long and interesting editorial note on the characters of the book, substantiating Mrs. Rowson’s assertion that her story* was “ A Tale of Truth,” and he has compiled a bibliography of 104 editions of the novel appearing since 1790,
What is the book that has such a hold on the “ plain people ” of America? It is a perfectly simple story of the elopement of Charlotte Temple, an English schoolgirl, with an officer, of their arrival in this city, of their happy life together until the man is attracted by the prospect of a wealthy marriage, of the appearance of an I ago who makes the man believe that Charlotte is unfaithful to him, of her poverty, her illness, and her death—a story only too common, and in this case made attractive to the reader^only by a sentiment of the most elementary sort. There is no plot to the story; it is told baldly; only its sentiment is other than commonplace, and that is antiquated. The book retains its popularity for two reasons: First, because of Its style—straightforward, wholly intelligible, adorned merely with the simplest sentiment, such as one finds at the cheap theatres ^and in the cheap books; and. secondly, because all its characters lived in this city and its heroine’s grave is still a place of sentimental pilgrimage. The book Is popu- ! Iar because of the grave, the grave is i popular because of the book—a viciousjy circular reasoning, perhaps, hut true In 1 this case.	I
This Is the best seller, not merely one of six, but the only best and the origi-nal—it has lasted for over a century, and, as Mr. Halsey shows, is as popular now as it ever was, prob- i ably more so, really, for there are* more readers now than there were a hun- , dred years ago. It is a good sign that the book is so popular, a sign that away from the crowd that likes problem plays and plays about which there can be no ques-tlon at all, there 1s another crowd that likes Mrs. Rowson’s moral tale, written to be of " service to some who are so unfortunate as to have neither friends to advise nor understanding to direct them through the various and unexpected evils t&at attend a young and unprotected woman in her fi^st entrance into life.**
Mr. Halsey* s introduction is extremely interesting; a bit of bibliographical work of high-order, adding1 enormously to the literary value of the volume. .The story became popular in this country as soon as it was published. There were two editions ln 1TO4; in 1801 an edition appeared In Hartford, and thereafter other editions appeared at such unusual places as Harrisburg, Alexandria, Ya.; Hudson, Windsor, Vt.; Brattleboro, Vt.; Concord, N. II.; Brookfield, Mass. In 1835 the story was translated into German; in 1841 it was. published in Ithaca, N. Y. Three of the 104 editions noted by Mr. Halsey are Eng.. lish, and one of them was published at Wallop, in Hampshire—surely a curious
