An Admirer, of '.the English Poet on His Published Works. ~
JVcw York Times Saturday Rcvteto of Boote:
OUR recent article on WJlliam Watson’s poetry, signed ** M. sS., Tvhile ft is mainly just in its generalizations, does not, it seems to me, indicate with sufficient detail 1 the superior- qualities of its subjects j verse; for, although there is unevenness in the positively poetical grade of Watson's work, I think it but just to say that he has many times maintained himself on the level of the last three stanzas of " The Father of the i Forest.'’ I have to differ from your con-i trlbutor -when he says*. " It -were too
much to require of any poet that he should maintain himself upon that level," for it is not so high but that it has been attained repeatedly by certain of our Americans—'Emerson, Tlmrod, Whit-'man, Lowell, and others, uneven as th-?se poets were—and it is only the fulfillment of the promise that any true poet makes.
“ M. S.” is certainly correct in his judgment that Watson is not “ popular/* and his reason for that fact is, to my mind, a sound one; but I wculd have citations, presented of lines, which, if more arid more widely quoted, would make this ppet popular with all cultivated lovers of poetry.	-
In the .publication to which ** M. S.” refers—** Tho Poems of WilJfam Watson," published by the John Lane Company—I find a sonnet, ** Estrangement,*' to which I would direct attention as a perfect expression of the mood which i the poet would represent, and an almost faultless piece of.verse, one of the noble and lovely sentimental utterances of our time. Indeed, I know of no sonnet since Drayton’s famous one which reaches the ! height attained by that as this does: ESTRANGEMENT.
So. without overt breach, we fall apart, Tacitly sunder—neither you nor I Conscious of one intelligible Why,
And both, from severance, winning equal smart.
So, with resigned and acquiescent heart, Whene’er your name on some chance lip may be,
T seem to see an alien shade pass by,
A spirit wherein I have no lot or part. Thus may a captive in some fortress grim,	.
From casual speech betwixt his warders, learn
That June on her triumphal progress goes Through arched and bannered woodlands; while for him ’
She is a legend empty of concern.
And idle is the rumor of the rose.
I have always wondered why Watson uses '* spirit/' a two-syllabled word, in the eighth line of this sonnet, where a one-syllabled word is needed; but aside from this flaw I cannot perceive a fault In the t>roduction, Other sonnets which 1 would cite as of a lofty order are “ Night and a Star,” ** The Frontier,” and “ Nfght on Carbar Edge," which should be reproduced in any*extended notice of the poet's work. In the lyrical form, consider Watson’s
SONG.
O, like a Queen's her happy tread.
And like a Queen’s her golden head!
But oh, at last, when all is said,
Her woman's heart for me!
TVe wandered where the river gleamed 'Neath oaks that mused and pines that dreamed.
A wild thing of tho woods she seemed,
So proud, and pu*e, and free!	1
j
Alt heaven drew nigh to hear her sing, When from her lips her soul took wing; The oaka forgrot their pondering1,
The pines	their reverie.	I
And, O,' her happy, queenly	tread,	'
And, O, her aueenly golden	head!	{
But, O, her heart, when all	is said,
*	Her woman’s heart for	me.	I
I	would like	to quots every line	of
" Vita Nuova ”	and such short songs	as
" The Lute Player,” “ Leave-taking," and that which begins:
Well he slumbers, greatly slain”; tout ttiere is no space for so considerable a representation of Watson’s great power in several forms. He has vision, delicacy, wealth of apt illustration, dignity, and artistic elevation of style, and by reason of hundreds of lines which he has written is entitled to the prajse of the ablest critics. Pure originality is rare, but he stands well with his contemporaries in this respect, not omitting- Swinburne.	E.	K.	(1
