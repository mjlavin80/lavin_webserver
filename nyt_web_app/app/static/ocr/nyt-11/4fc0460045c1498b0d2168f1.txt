T tiE CONSUMERS.
FATE OP THE MIDDLE CLASSES*.

THE fate of the middle classes, accord* ing to Mr. Cooper, whom he calls the "consumers/' Is to be ground between the* upper and the nether millstone. Each class has Its critical period, and ** that time has arrived for the mludle classes.” The chief evil of modern industry he conceives to be overproduction. He believes the trust to be the next step In industrial evolution, &nd that .its function is to be the federation of industry and the eventual establishment of an industrial clearing’ house, which will approximately adjust* production to consumption and save the world Immense loss and suffering;	'
He points out the effects ot overproduction in the com and cotton crops, and the secondary effects of instability of 'credit resources in Wall Street. He advances some convincing arguments to show that great economies in production must be accomplished if the rate of increase of population in this country continues. He examines the many futile attempts that have been made to regulate production, as by the Southern planters, and the cruder methods that are kept in force by natural conditions. 44 Some people,” he says, 44 think there (s no health In the body politic unless the producers break their necks trying to outdo each other.” When the market is glutted and goods are sold for a song, the public profits by tha producer’s loss; but it- reacts upon all. The effort should not be to regulate prices, but i*roAuction—to control the disease rather than the symptom. What Mr. Cooper calls the 41 misfit of industry ** he would have controlled—the system under which too much of one thing and not enough of another are produced. This, he thinks, would be best effected by an organization of trusts; for in the multiplicity of competing establishments no one knows just what the other Is doing. He quotes numerous examples from- recent Industrial history to enforce his contentions.
But difficulties will arise. The producer with sole power to fix the price of his product will sooner or later abuse it. Combinations of labor and capital are the next thing to be feared. They have not yet become numerous, but there is every indication to the watchful eye of Mr. Cooper that they will. Then they can fix a price which the consumer must pay —a price that will yield a living wage and a fair return to capital. Having done this, they become masters of the situation, and all they have to do Is to raise profits and wages at the consumers* ex-•ptnse*. * Thus he^is, as Mr. Cooper said in the beginning, ground beneath the upper and the nether millstone. Then should come the organization of the consumer, who occupies the strongest position since he has some choice as to the articles he can consume, and can call new sources of supply into existence. After that, the final segregation, will come, integration.
The power of the trusts will thus be controlled, but the waste of present methods will be eliminated.
It is an attractive argument. It omits, perhaps, certain essential facts that might make the result seem less assured than it does here, but force Is not lacking in much of what Mr. Cooper advances.
