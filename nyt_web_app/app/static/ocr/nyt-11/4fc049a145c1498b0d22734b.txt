the ■works of the subjects* These works, as it has been pointed, out, have in common neo-pagan form and inspiration, but in artistic characteristics represent individual genius stimulated by great monetary prizes and the acclaim of luxurious princes and their courts. In Venice alone does Renaissance architecture represent the thought and culture of a people.
HN an admirable volume of | splendid inspiration and profound technical execution, published fifteen years ago, Prof. Charles Herbert Moore of Harvard University • set forth that all pointed - architecture was not Gothic, that the architecture of Mediaeval France alone had exclusive claim to the *term, and that the principle of Gothic was not the pointed arch, the fretted vault, the spreading column, but the balance of thrusts. The last two of these principles were not, at the time, generally accepted by scholars; they have since gained almost universal belief. And now fn " The Character of Renaissance Architecture" we have the same creative and scholarly qualities of artist and investigator which characterized “ I>evelopment and Character of Gothic Architecture." But where the latter was synthetical the former is analytical almost to the verge of icono-cla&m.
It has long been the custom of writers to label *' Renaissance ” the artistic building development of Europe succeeding the Sixteenth century—when a return to classic models was mingled with a contemporaneous spirit of art for art’s sake —and to define the structures thus labeled as the general expression of national character. ° Renaissance ** has come to be regarded as a fashion as capable of exposition as Greek or Byzantine. Such, however, according to Prof. Moore, Is not the truth, "Renaissance,'' as he would have us study It, has neither national character nor the constructive principles of school or system. It is the varied ex- j pression of Individual artists, uninspired, yet not uninfluenced by religious zeal, who, treating In a merely practical manner transplanted Greek forms, sought to revivify them by modifications and additions, the composite results of which should appeal to an age which was rapidly freeing itself from all that pertained to a spectacular Mother Church and its ingrown literal and dogmatic attributes. Such individual expression possessed, of course, freedom and imagination, but It sadly lacked technical, knowledge, and, in many cases, a worthy motive.
It Is obviously absurd, therefore, to at tempt to compare as a class the archU tectural- monuments of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries with those of the Middle Ages. The Humanist movement bred a Neo-pagan influence, which was unuble to adhere to moral principles when once the motive power of the Church had been shaken off; it wallowed in luxury and extravagance—materialistic and artistic. Naturally, such an Influence touching men who were ready to mistake illusive pleasures of self-indulgence for the true joys of life, was incapable of inspiring either school or consistent system of architecture. Such egotistical Individualism forms a strange contrast with that of the Middle Ages, for, as Prof. Moore rightly says;
The individuality of the Middle Ages was obedient to the demands of corporate and co-operative life, while that of the Renaissance - was independent and capricious. Conditions favorably to Individual developmeat had arisen early In the Middle Ages m connection with organized monastic life- The' cultivation of literature, philosophy, and the fine arts Jn the monasteries had given considerable range to the exarcUe of individual powers, though in limited directions, and the rise of the great communal organizations tend-still further to stimulate an admirable individual development. * * * In so far as the development ot the individual m the period of the Renaissance differed from that of the Middle Ages, it did so mainly in favoring individual caprice at the ^expense ot harmonious collective effort^ .	-	t	.
