THOSE who have read the stories by Anne Warner (Mrs. Charles Ellis French) about Susan Clegg and her friend Mrs. Lathrop, or that clever little international comedy of “ A Woman's Will,” will eagerly open the pages of “ The Rejuvenation of Aunt Mary ’* (Little, Brown & Co.) There is plenty of dialogue in this story and the plot is lively. enough to hold the most frivolous spirited. Jack Denham was really very naughty—but like most naughty young men, was exceedingly attractive.
He not only kept his contemporaries under the spell of his good humor, but also his Aunt Mary, a seasoned spinster of 70, who used plain speech and an ear trumpet. It was after Aunt Mary had changed her will and left Jack unprovided for that he, with the help of a bewitching young widow, managed to cajole j her back into good humor. It was simply done—after one thought it out. Aunt Mary was induced to come to the city by reports of Jack’s decline In health and spirits. After her arrival, Jack and three confederates (aided and abetted by the bewitching widow) feted the poor old ! lady so that ever after the charms of I country life fell flat and she yearned for the pitfalls of the great city.
The book is, as was said before, full of bright dialogue, and that Jack and Mrs. Rosscott were “ wise as the serpent " is clearly proved by the result, for things turn out more than happy—they atfe ecstatic.
