A School of Fiction

After one of the latest attempts to arouse interest in fiction writing- as a branch of tuition, some little ridicule was showered upon those who wore supposed to be desirous of being made over into author?. Certain writers of reputation who confessed to working intuitively, vigorously pooh ted the idea of “ making an artist ” out of the raw material among us, of teaching- the would-be author how thu thing is to be done; but the truth is that the idoa actually in contemplation was largely to teach the aspirant how he was not to do it.
The art of how not to do it is a very desirable hranch of study; its advantages to the tyro are obvious, and even accredited authors might sometimes do well to take heed to it. If the happily accomplished writer of short stories, for instance, could sometimes be privately restrained from less happy elongated attempts, and if beginners could find their bearings through the channels of regular teaching, instead of through premature efforts for publicity, both the public and the profession would feel a relief. The works of standard writers themselves might occasionally have yielded a double pleasure if some of the more ponderous meandcrings of old had been guided a little by restraining hands along the lines of how not to do itTlf the incipient movement (supposing it to take effect) were to result in the founding of a school of fiction—a school of fiction proper, that is to say—perhaps the effect might be the portentous one of swelling the already overprofuse production or fiction—and who would not protest against such a contingency?—but a school of literature in all its departments would be another matter. An enterprise of the latter description would embrace a wide field of mental exercise, and fiction itself would be but one corner within it—a corner from which some approaching steps might perhaps be duly averted.
The would-be writers are writing already; they are not (usually) waiting for ideas to be given them, and blunders and all, they will go on their way; what they want is not to be taught how to write, but how they are not to do it. L. R. R.
