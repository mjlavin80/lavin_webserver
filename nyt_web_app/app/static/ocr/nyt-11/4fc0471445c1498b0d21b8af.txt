Senator Albert J. Beveridge's latest book, according to Its publishers, D. Appleton & Co., Is having a very large sale, especially in Indiana, the author’s native State. He is receiving numerous appreciative letters, many of which axe from women, which speaks well for
the emancipation ‘ of the weaker sex. Among the recent letters was one from Edwin H. Hughes, President of De Pauw University, from which Senator Beveridge was graduated at the age of 23, just a score of years ago. The writer states that he has read the book " with much interest," and declares that It “ cannot fail ” to make any young man who reads it " stronger and better."
