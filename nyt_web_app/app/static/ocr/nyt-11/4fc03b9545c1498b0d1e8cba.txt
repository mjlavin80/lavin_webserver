This is only one specimen of the kind of men who formed the French branch of the Order of the Cincinnati; not all of them, however, had such varied careers.
The Revolution of 1792 dispersed the French branch of the order, and not until 1887 was any attempt made to revive it. In that year the General So* ciety authorized its reorganization; but it appears not yet to have taken place.
The book is not of first importance, but it is of great interest. It is unfortunately “ sloppy ” with titles—Major General the Honorable Alexander Hamilton, for example; a French nobleman is seldom mentioned except as M. le Marechal This, M. Ie Comte That; and many of the titles are wholly improper.

A BOOK of considerable interest is that just published by the Rhode Island State Society of the Cincinnati on the French branch of the order. The Cincinnati^ was founded at Newburg on MaylO, 1783; on Dec. 23 of the same year the French King, Louis XVI., gave permission to his officers entitled to join it to become members, and on Jan. 7, 1784, the first meeting of the French Society was held at the residence of the Comte de Ro-chambeau. The members present subscribed 60,000 livres to the Treasury of the General Society, and' paid it, too, and on Jan. 16, at the same place, met to assume the insignia of the order.
There were 244 M original members ’■ of the society, not all of whom were charter members r the compilers of ^he book do not distinguish between the officers who met to organize the branch ; in France and those who entered the society afterward in their own right as i former soldiers in America. With the name of each member is-gi'ven a r£sumC of his service; a record which implies i an immense amount of labor, and is of distinct value* historically. The mem-i bers were not all Frenchmen, despite the suggestion that they were, for in France, as well as here, foreigners served for the love of fighting. So we have as a member of the French Society Gen. Edward Stack, an Irishman, from his name. He was in 1777 Second Lieutenant In the Regiment of Walsh, in the Irish Brigade of the French Army; he served as Captain of Marines on the Bon Homme Richard, and remained in our service until the end of the war, when he returned to his former French regiment, becoming Captain in 1788, and Lieutenant Colonel of Dillon's regiment in 1791. He tvas an emigrfi with the Count of Artois, later Charles X., and when, the Bourbon Princes turned their troops over to England because they could no Ion get maintain them, Col. Stack was transferred to the Irish Brigade of the British Army. In 1803 he paid a visit to France, and was detained by Bonaparte when war began again, being held in France until 1814. He had been promoted, meantime, and died finally at Calais in December, 1833/ at the age
