. An Interesting Point of Court Usage • Suggested by a Recent Novel.
Veto York. Times Saturday Review of Books:
RH3VPS some of your readers will be. interested In a little point of courtly usage, a homely term 'which ranks, at least to us Americans, surprisingly high; and one, too, which 1 have never seen expressly commented upon in public. The impulse to write it down comes from having just read, with sheer delight, Mr. Eugene Lyle's fine romance, “ The Missourian.” Perhaps the story and its scene have more than usual interest to one who was born not very tar from the Mexican border at a time .when the memory of Maximilian’s ill-fated life waa very fresh to friends who had followed the Shelby brigade into Mexico, and who told their tales to the child who played with silver dollars bearing the Emperor’s head. Be that as it may, I know that Mr. Lyle has achieved excellence* in the atmosphere in which he has enveloped his stirring narrative, fer in his pages Mexico lives, glows in all her native beauty.
It is therefore with no little desire to cry out over a mistake, but rather to call attention to the exalted position of a homely word, that I write of a small error into which Mr. Lyle has fallen. In fact, one is almost proud of the ignorance which nearly all of our American writers show when they tell of the serious nothings of court procedure and custom. It seems quite natural to Americans abroad that writers at home should, as Mr. Lyle often does, become entangled in the various legendary attributes of royalty and debase great Majesties into mere highnesses, and evtn degrades an Imperial Archduchess into a petty Serene Highness. But where he takes a page to tell of how English-speaking Carlotta, herself well acquainted with the Court of England, was disposed to resent the Missourian’s use to her of the homely " Ma’am,” he calls to my mind the amusement I felt when I first knew that this alone of all titles is precisely the correct one to use when addressing royalty, and particularly a sovereign, in English. Snobbery often bestows the prefix on lesser Princesses, but it is absolutely necessary only to the Queen. Just as the highborn Englishman says ’* Sir." to no one but the Prince of Wales, so only does he say " Yes, Ma’am,” and No, Ma’am,” only to the Queen. From time immemorial this has been the proper designation of English Queens, and in sing it when addressing Carlotta in English Mr. Lyle’s hero was, even unconsciously, showing himself as native-born a courLier as he was a gentleman.
