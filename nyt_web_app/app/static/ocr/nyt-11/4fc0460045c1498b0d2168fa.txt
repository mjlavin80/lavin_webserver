FREDERIC COUDERT.
A Collection of the Speeches and Addresses of a Famous Lawyer.*
£E editor of Mr. Coudert’s addresses, who Is only slightly concealed behind the inf-tials "P. F.»” has done his work ably. Mr. Coudert’s life , was so varied in its. activ- I itles that we think more of a biography might have been afforded than is vouchsafed to the readers of the book; but the editor doubtless had his reasons for making the volume practically a collection of Mr. Coudert’s addresses, and a collection only. He might, however, with perfect propriety have given the ^ate of Mr. Coudert’s death, which we find— not from this book-occurred on Dec. 20, 1003. But in selecting from among his subject’s addresses those for use In this book " P. £Y' has been wholly successful, and has made a volume of much interest.
Mr. Coudert was bom In this city in 1832, of French Catholic parentage. He was graduated from Columbia College in 1850, when only 18, and in 1853, when of age, was admitted to the bar. He soon took a o-nmTTianfling place there, becoming in time President of tho Bar Association of th\<i city, the highest honor that the bar can confer upon its members. He won distinction at the civil and criminal, the admiralty, and the patent bars, in handling commercial cases, and as a publicist dealing with cases involving international law—that law which is not law. He declined a seat on the bench of the Supreme Court of the United, States, on that of the State Supreme Court, and the mission to Hussia; in fact, the only public office he held was a membership on the Board of Education. He served, however, on the Venezuela Boundary Commission, and was engaged as counsel in many cases of more than National importance. He died when nearly 72 years old.
Born and bred a Catholic, Mr. Coudert spent time and means in the Church's service, and five of the addresses included in this volume were made before the Catholic League so long ago as 1873. These, perhaps, are the most interesting in the volume, as showing his lightness and delicacy of touch, his surenesa of statement, and his keen sense of humor. That on M Morals and Manners ” is especially

.good, showing wide reading, delicacy of handling, and a right conception of the point he wished to make, which he reached with unerring accuracy. His addresses before more mixed audiences were no less happy than those before his fel-low-Cathollcs, as any one who has heard him speak at political meetings will remember.
Four addresses on international law and arbitration are given in this volume, of which perhaps the most valuable was on the “Rights ot Ships/* delivered at the Naval War College in Newport just ten years ago. This was addressed to an audience of men who might be called practitioners at tho bar of international law; . naval officers constantly required to apply to actual cases the Incomplete rules of that law, on whose correct application thereof the issue of war or peace often depended. The lecture discussed the once famous Barrundia case, reviewing the precedents and summing up in favor of the position taken by Secretary Blaine, though admitting that the weight of authority in this country was against that. Mr, Coudert’s closing remark is interesting, even if really a piece of special pleading:	** Is It claiming too much to de-
mand that the- flag at our masthead should, even in a foreign port, symbolize something of our origin, traditions, and practices? Or should it be no more nor less than an ornamental device which loses its meaning as soon as It floats in the slip of a foreign wharf 7 ” Decidedly a pretty question to put to a body of naval officers, who were interested professionally in upholding the' Importance of our flag, and at the time Mr. Coudert asked It were almost unanimous against Mr. Blaine's interpretation of the law, and his treatment of a distinguished brother officer.
Interesting now as when first published is a letter printed nearly sixteen years ago In The New York Times on “ Young Men In Politics.” Mr. Coudert spoke as one having authority, for he was a politician of the highest class, and had been so from Ms young_jnanhood. In a charmingly written letter, Mr, Coudert advised that one should not. undertake the care of others until he was able to care for 1 himself—" first let him be his own. mas- 1 ter, then let him serve the public." Once ! able to work his way through life by his own unaided exertions, he should enter politics, in so far as taking a share in public life is concerned—by insisting upon decent political methods, upon reputable candidates, upon wise legislation. '* To this extent all men may be politicians and good citizens; to this extent all,
j rich and poor, should be vigilant custodians of the public weal." j A chapter that cannot be overlooked is Mr. Coudert’s open letter to Alexandre Dumas fils, replying to the latter’s advocacy of the Naquet law of divorce, at the time before the French Chambers. This iaw granted divorce on the bare disagreement of a couple; Coudert’s reply i was witty and a very able defense of the I Catholic doctrine of marriage, the attack on whicn in France was the first step toward the position of hostility to religion now held by the republic.
