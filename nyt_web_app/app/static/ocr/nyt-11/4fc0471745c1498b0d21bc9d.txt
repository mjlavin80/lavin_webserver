VICTORIA'S REIGN
The Concluding Volumes to Justin McCarthy's “ History of Our Own Times.”*
:ESE two volumes conclude the " Ilistorj' of Our Own Times,” begun by Air. McCarthy some twenty-five years ago. The five volumes taken together cover the entire reign of Queen Victoria. It seems rather strange that tho author devotes so much space to so short a period as that from ISltT to the Queen’s dfath. No reason for the disproportionate emphasis laid upon these last few yiT.rs is given. It is true, however, that this last installment of the history includes a general retrospect of the whole reign.
Mr. McCarthy's object is to tell what lias been going on of importance within the empire. He has, of course, experienced the difficulties which confront all 1 who would write tlie history of contemporaneous ewnts. The author is too near the occurrences he is describing to see , them in their proper perspective. He is a vtry remarkable man who can see how the events of yesterday are woven into the warp and woof of history. Mr. McCarthy would be the last to claim this sort of ability for himself. Even in deal- | ing with the early reign of Victoria, a I period remote enough to be a proper subject for historical inquiry, Mr. McCarthy , never posed as a profound Constitutional historian. If, in addition to deriving ’ pleasure from his own writing, he sue- j ceeded in giving the reader a clear ac- i count of important events, movements, and personages, his purpose was served. In these last two volumes he has written a series of interesting historical articles or essays concerned with the leading tcpicj of the period he treats of. He tells a story in a simple, intelligible way. He L3 never dry, tedious, discursive, labored, or involved. He is too thorough a Celt to be anything of the kind. It is not adverse criticism to say that he has not written a weighty history.
Cartliy’s admirable fairness could be given.
IT is almost impossible to summarize this work, because, as has been said, it is rather a series of essays than a continuous history. All of the important events of the period come in for consideration.
The greatest of these for the Empire^ at large was the Boer war. In general, the British public knows little about the beginning of a war on the distant frontier of the empire. But in this case its attention had been long fixed on South Africa. From the outset it was a thoroughly popular war Mr. McCarthy comments upon the fury which sprang up in England against the Boers, and observes that the Boers, after all, were but doing what Englishmen would admire under ordinary circumstances. While recognizing that England, having begun the war, must carry it through to a successful conclusion, Mr. McCarthy credits the Boers with courage and heroism.
The interest and value of these vol-i umes rests upon the fact that they are the work of a man who knows intimately what he is writing about. It is the same sort of value that attaches to Bishop Burnett’s " History of Ilis Own Times." No one would go to Burnett for the final word about Qxieen Anne’s reign, any more than one a hundred years hence would consult McCarthy for a final estimate of the constitutional significance of Queen Victoria's reign. But both works are valuable as contemporaneous accounts by intelligent observers.
TWO very desirable qualities ln a writer Mr. McCarthy undoubtedly possesses—modesty and impartiality. His own political career has been so long and well known that he might frequently have referred to it without appearing to “ lug himself in." His relations with Mr. Charles Stewart Parnell, about whom he has a good deal to say,, would have afforded such an opportunity. His position in the Irish Nationalist Party might seem to demand some attention, but he never so much as alludes to himself.
In spite of his long participation in public life, Mr. McCarthy seems to have no political grudge to pay off. No one can doubt that he must have formed strong and decided opinions about many of the public men with whom he came in contact and whose political activities he has to relate. Yet no political leader Is treated with disparagement. Even Chamberlain, with whose policy those who read between the lines can see he does not sympathize, is never referred to in a slighting manner. The severest censure he has to pass upon the Government for rushing into the Boer war is this: “ No possi- : ble explanation can be found for the easygoing and careless way in which the preparations were made for carrying on this : new Dutch war other than the assump- , tion that the English statesmen in office undervalued their enemy and believed j they could take their own time and their own way for bringing him to submission.” This can hardly be called a violent ex parte denunciation.	!
Mr. McCarthy has occasion to mention j the suspicions which had pointed to an understanding between the Colonial Office and Dr. Jameson relative to the latter^, famous raid. While admitting that the suspicions were not unnatural, he says:	’* We are quite willing to believe
that Mr. Chamberlain’s statements disclosed the full truth." In the election of 1900 he admires equally the course pursued by Lord Salisbury and that followed by Mr. Herbert Gladstone of the Opposl-tion. Mr. Gladstone expected defeat and admitted frankly that his party could not then form a stable government. Lord Salisbury, on the other side, while expecting a victory for the Conservatives, bad made an appeal which indicated that he was something far superior to a mere party leader. “ Neither appeal,” says Mr, McCarthy, “ was of a very encouraging nature, and each was thoroughly outspoken in its description of the difficulties and dangers which must be in the way. The explanation of this curious resemblance is, no doubt, to be found in the fact that neither Lord Salisbury nor Mr. Herbert Gladstone regarded the coming struggle from the point of view of the political partisan or of the electioneering agent.” Many more examples of Mr. Me-
