OU remember Mr. Kipling's not altogether soothing characterization ofv £th£‘ American in " Tlie Seven Seas/' “ Uncouth, disrep-,	.	k	utable, vast/', ChaTles,
Tenney- Jackson ...in. Infs story ^called-:‘f Lioser's Luck,” .(Henry. Holt & Qo,,\ has taken Mr- Kipling’s illogical iind elate Yankee Tor his hero. With concrete ends in view Mr. Jackson - hq.s tamed and bottled Mr. Kipling’s poeti-<^.lly vague “ spirit ” into a young Western millionaire,. a restless, reckless wanderer on land and sea, and the owner of a swift sailing yacht.. This young man (in the words of an incidental ex-stable boy) he sends out to be '* meal ticket to a foolish little empire ” down in an evil and miasmat-!c region of Central America. Whero the ‘^meal ticket” is, there must the lady be also. Any stable boy can tell you that. The lady in this case combines in one person (a darkreyed and slender one) the charms of up-to-date girlhood, the baleful splendors of the» heroine-adventuress of romance, and the immemorial inconsequences of the true woman. ,
The story Is riotously one of adventure, of ptals. perfidy, carnage, love, a.nd~loyaHy unto death, bitf =is the girl, so in the tale, there is in the midst of the barbarous trappings the -spirit of the twentieth century. Dolores Delgado y Montezuma is (obviously, and“ after all her dreams of Frincesahood) a spoiled young person of our time—playing her part with that tragic earnestness and sublime disregard for reasonable consequences (especially to others) which marks the modern .ypung woman with eager ethical ideals. And the others—the men— these are merely playing to please Dolores—at first much, as one plays with children who show by pitifully trembling lips that they are going to be hurt and cry if one doesn’t—in the end swept by the momentum of the game into a fever of enthusiasm which makes it seem the right, proper, and glorious and manly and heavenly thing to fight and bleed and die for what one knew j in the beginning was a schoolgirl's silly dream.	!
In a day when all the intrinsically soul-inspiring things have to be done reasonably, sanely, slowly, diplomat!-cally, with infinite committee work, if you want a simple idea to fight for and die for in a perfectly primitive manner, you must create the conditions artificially.
So Mr. Jackson has done—and got thereby a romance—without sacrificing either the contemporaneousness of hu. actors or insuUing the “ cynic devil " (to go back to Mr. Kipling) in the blood of his readers. To be sure, it is romance—not in any sort a human documentary report. The extreme up-to-dateness of some of the language, too, (to mention nothing else.) proves plainly enough that the book is not planned as a literary monument. It is, in short, strictly contemporary fiction of the temporary order. But it sweeps you along and provides thrills of several distinct kinds.
The story (to descend to a few par~ ticulars) lays hold of the unwary reader on the waterside at San Fran* cisco. Mr. Alonzo SteveuSDn's luxurious yacht Itata is in port with a queer crew. Mr. Stevenson supposes that the vessel is being outfitted to take him and a party of friends to Tahiti. The fact is that Miss Dolores Delgado has - secretly corrupted the crew and stolen the yacht and stocked it with arms. She seizes a moment when Stevenson and three friends of his (one of them the ex-stable boy) are aboard, to up anchor and set saiL The very existence of Miss Dolores is unknown to Mr. Stevenson till he finds her in his cabin—with armed men on guard and a graceful young Frenchman sitting opposite smoking a cigarette. It is a dramatic scene—and Mr. Stevenson’s language to the li*dy is at first exceedingly harsh. This scene and many others following are described (with whimsical asldns) by Prof. Eldred,. an expert in metallurgy, who is one of the kidnapped friends of the owner. The second is Lieut. Lamont of the United States Navy. The third, called " Danny/’ has already been mentioned. The graceful French young man is, it appears, also

in Central America you find yourself in tho midst of one of-the revolutions indigenous to the region. It is desired-to overthrow- th£ Governments' There is mixed soldiery, a political General, a German enthusiast; and>' an ^Irishman who knows how to fight; guns. Also the guiis. It is Dolores’s revolution, her army. Mr., Stevenspn' becomes Captain of the Foreign Legion, even the scoffing young Frenchman (who hag coffee, plantations in the land and. much riches) is.drawn into the fantastic business. He .wilt not be beaten by. Mr. -Stewnson, and Mr, Stevenson has declared that if Dolores w:arits a revolution—ari empire-^tv long as men' can be got at 20 cents a day each, she shall have ' it. Why not? says’ Mi-. Stevenson.	“ I’ll grubstake the out-

I crashing-about their ears. ‘Nor are treasons arid stratagems omitted.
For^ the end of the story,, it is no part of' this reviewer’s plan to foreshadow it. Mr. Jackson has written an-unusually readable tale. He is to .be permitted, so far as may be, to impart it to his readers in his own way.
