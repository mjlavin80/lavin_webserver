One understands very well how Hetty March, whose four years at college had estranged her from her sailor sweetheart, Tom Med-bury, and implanted an ambition to be a foreign missionary, got back to her old perspective and her old Ideals of manliness in that night of the storm when all. her hope of life was pinned to the two men battling against the sea. on the 'deck above her. , The minister became a negligible quantity in Hetty’s reckonings from that moment, though he is by no means the spineless rival that Mr. Took-er might have drawn had he been as unjustly Inclined as are some sea writers of whom we have known.

UNDER . Rocking Skies/’ by Mr. L. Prank Tooker, adds another to the list of good sea tales, and its author bears very well comparison with the half dozen or more specialists in that line who at present 'stand high In the popular esteem. Mr. Tooker has already^ published some brilliant short stories and a little volume of verses that are a de-tfgrht to all lovers of the sea, so that one is hardly surprised to find no signs of the norice either in the matter or manner Of his first novel- Poet, sailor^ man* and born storyteller are written large on every page of "Under Rocking Skies/’ and the result is a picture of the sea and of life aboard an old-fashioned sailing vessel that charms by its simplicity and absorbs by its vividness and reality.
The scene of Mr. Tooker's romance is on the Henrietta G. March* which is bound from ‘New England for Santa Cruz* but stops off the Captain’s home port on Long Island to take on his wife and daughter and the village minister as passengers, and. very much against the_ Captain's will, Tom. Medbury as mate. The plot is neither new nor startling, a9 sea-story plots go, since it involves only the very obvious falling in love, of the Captain's daughter and the mate/with the minister as a mild incentive to jealousy, but it is aU the greater proof of the author’s- cleverness that* out of the simple situations and the simple characters he has woven a tale that holds one’s excited attention from the first page to last, and leaves one with an inspiring conviction of the capacity for heroism in even seemingly - ordinary men. Capt-March is. only the master of a little brig, of 500 tons burden, but the stoical courage • and. daring with which, he takes his leaking vessel. through _a : hurricane—not to a: nearer port^ trat to Santa Cruz;:; for. .whl& pa	a	trua	pict-
