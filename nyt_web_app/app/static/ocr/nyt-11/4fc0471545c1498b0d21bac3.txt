ALTHOUGH Elizabeth is at her beat • when she is simply Elizabeth? 'tell; Ing- in her own Inimitable way of the wonderful garden and the fascinating babies, and.*.* the man of wrath ” and the “ adventures In RUgeri,” she knows how to write a sparkling story, charged with much of her oNv’tr'charmirig personality.
Her “ Priscilla ” Is a bewitching Princess of one of those mysterious little German Stages that nobody ever hears of until they bob up to furnish spouses for royalty and heroines of romance—and what would romance or royalty do without them, the real and the fictitious? Aided and accompanied by the good old ducal librarian, Priscilla, feeling her "soul starvedin the dull little court, runs away and lives for two miserable weeks tha life of a nobody-in-particular. Just what Jiappefled, what mischief she did,.and how it all ended, the author tell3 with her own arch humor. As we know, she has small patience with “making-believe," and she pricks pretty effectually the cult and the cant of *• the simple life,’' its natural collapse being “ a by-product '* of the vivacious tale.
Of course, it Is a sort of extravaganza, but it contains some very natural characters. Indeed, the author has something of Frank Stockton’s art of mailing the Impossible “ convincing ’’ while she tells \1Lr '
The book is temptingly quotable; we cannot resist giving tha character of the old vicar, a lovely illustration of Stevenson’s Christmas sermon:
The vicar was a pious and patient old
•	Pructtced in forgiveness. In over-
looking, in trying again. Always slow to anger, as the years drew him more and more apart Into the shadows of old age, and he watched from their clear coolness with an ever larger comprehension the younger generations striving together in the heat, he grew at last unable to be angered at all. The Scriptural injunction
not *1° . , t*ie sun £° down upon youf‘ wrath had no uses for him, for he possessed no wrath for the sun to go down upon. He ha-1 that lovable nature that sees the best in everything first, and then prefers to look no further. He took for granted that people were at bottom good and noble, and the assumption went
*	t^ard making them so.
, v n° shall measure the Influence of one kind and blameless life? • • • There is a great virtue in sweeping out one s own house and trimming Its lamps i before starting on the house and lamps or a neighbor; and since new dust settles every day, and lajnps, I believe, need constant trimming, f know not when the truly tidy soul will have attained so perfect a spotlessness as to justify its issuing forth to attack the private dust
^e0£l0- And if 11 *ver did, io, it; would find tho necessity no longer there, its orignt untfringnoss would unconsciously have done its work, and every dimmer soul witain sight of that checr-ful shining been Strengthened and Inspired to go and do likewise.
Many little deft pats the author gives j after her own fashion. There is her hom-j Uy on running away; her remark that-“•Robin prided himself on being ready to j believe anything at a moment’s" notice, especially if it was the worst, and he I called it having an open mind; "Tier opin-! ion of saintly wives, identical with Mrs. Deland’s; Priscilla’s awakening to the life she had chosen; the looking'after three meals-every day; the *■ multitude of other dreary things to think of and order*’— linen to be washed and mended for example,	'
Was the simple life a sordid life as well? . IJld it only look simple from outside and far away? And was it close, mere drudging.? A fear came over her that her soul, her precious soul, for whose sake she had dared everything, instead of being able to spread its wings in the light or a glorious clear life, was going to bo choked out of existence by weeds just as completely as at Kunitz.	'
The author does not have “ morals,” but she does have conclusions, and " The Princess Priscilla's Fortnight ” is well worth reading, not only for the genuine enjoyment it will give, but for its sensible and logical “conclusion of the whole matter.”
