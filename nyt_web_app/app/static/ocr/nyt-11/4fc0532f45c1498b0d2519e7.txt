FAMOUS BATTLES.
A Further Volume of Mr. Charles Welsh's Interesting: Compilations.*
t. WELSH'S anthology of the battles of the past century is completed with the present volume—a volume which covers the salient points of the wars of the last quarter of the hundred-year period just closed—that Is, the years between 1S75 and 1900. The first chapter describes the tragedy of the Custer massacre in the West, the last relates the capture of Gen. Cronje in South Africa. Naturally, the aim has been to select from the heap of warlike encounters those which offer picturesque values rather than those which have been politically decisive, and,
| as the transcript of the title page below , indicates, the descriptions are, as far as ; may be, those of war correspondents who have been eye witnesses of the scenes | described. It is not possible to name the collection one of absorbing interest or to praise always either the fairness or the dramatic quality of the battlepleces, but the book has considerable interest and some value. For one thing, it serves to indicate how much fighting there was (after all) In a period commonly considered at large as one of peace.
By the way, it is curious to observe that the end and the beginning of this fighting—the Custer massacre and the capture of Cronje—have both’ been turned Into shows for the public. You yourself may , have seen as the recreation of an afternoon that death of Custer and his troopers which no white man really did see and live to tell the tale, and you may have seen, too, the mimic humiliation' of the Boer. It is the way of the da.y. We shall not here, therefore, quote from the stories of these two affairs which Mr. Welsh provides.
To pass on; at a moment when the Russian soldier is abased it is interesting to read Major Arthur Griffiths’s account of the storming of Kars by these very Russians in the Russo-Turkish war of 1877, and at a time when certain naked Africans have made it so very unpleasant .for the perfected military machine of the German Kaiser in the Dark Continent it is not unedifying to read, how in 18T8 a handful of British troops fought off the Zulus at Rorke's Drift In Natal. The Queen’s troops were defending a house and. stone kraal.
So close were the combatants that the Zulus seized the English bayonets and in two instances even succeeded In wrenching them from the rifles, thoiUgh in each case the breech-loader took a stern vengeance. The muzzles of the opposing firearms were almost touching each other and the discharge of a musket blew the broad ,4 dbpper,T hat from the head of Corp. ScWess of the Natal native contingent. This man, (a Swiss by birth,) who had been a patient in hospital, leaped on the parapet and bayoneted the man who fired, regained his place, and shot another; then repeating his former exploit, again leaped on the top of the mealie bags and bayoneted a third-	'
The fourth chapter in the series is occupied with that very interesting and striking campaign Into Afghanistan (1880) to which the present Earl Roberts owes his appendical title " of Kandahar.*’ " BobsM was Sir Frederick Roberta in those days and marched from Kabul to Kandahar to punish Ayoub Khan, a potentate Who had just inflicted a most bloody and humiliating defeat upon a body of British troops under Brig. Gen. Burrows at Maiwand. The account of this campaign used In the book is that of Archibald Forbes, whose story of the Boer war of 1881 (with Majuba Hill) occupies the next chapter. After that comes Max Pemberton's description of the bombardment of Alexandria by the British Mediterranean* fleet, under Admiral Sir Beauchamp Seymour, in 1882, which naturally leads to the next famous encounter with Arabi Pasha at Tel-el-Kebir, and the exile of the disturber to Ceylon. Charles Lowe describes that campaign.	.	.
The same writer it is who tells next the story of Gen. Charles Gordon and Khartoum. After .that Is a leap to the Chfno-Japanese war of 1S&4, with the stories of the battle of Ping Yang and the first-takr-Ing of Port Arthur, since grown thrice famous by another taking. A. HilUard Atterldge, who accounts? for these Japanese victories, tells also the story of the Graeco-Turkish war of 1F97, and presently describes the campaign of Kitchener fin ISOS) against the Mahdi in the Soudan. Not only- so, “but he deals with our own recent unpleasantness with S^ain arid tells-AS' graphically as possible how ^Admiral Dewey steamed Into Mahila- Bay,: and how the then Col.
