! Very large ants, magpies In every meadow, and coffee cups without bandies but of great girth are some of the objects » that soon become familiar to strangers who wander .in that part of Prance which was at one time as much part of England as any of the counties of this island-
*	* * If one were to change the dark blue smock and the peculiar peaked hat of the country ,'olk of Normandy for the less distinctive clothes of the English peasant, in a very large number of cases the Frenchmen would pass as English.

Improvements in sanitation have brought about most welcome changes. * • ' * The small washing basin and jug that apologetically appear upon the bedroom washstand have still an almost universal sway, and are not suffix ciently odd to excuse themselves on the score of picturesqueness.

This sums up the first chapter of Gordon Home’s volume on “ Normandy; The Scenery and Romance o£ Its Ancient Towns,” illustrated by the author and published by E. P. Dutton & Co. Besides this, as the title indicates, descriptions and colored and pen-and-ink sketches are given of other Norman towns and their "Inhabitants and other interesting sights In each. And the volume closes with “ Some Notes on the History of Normandy.” The book has not been written to take the place of a guide; it Is an attempt to convey a " clear impression" of Normandy to the future, visitor. .
