WILLIAM WATSON.
Some Considerations Suggested by the Collective Udition ©1 the Songs of Xhz English Poet.
ARLYLE observed somewhere, probably In the ** Lectures On Heroes.” that the reading’ of current veree was to an '* earnest M reader about the most dismal job of work that such a reader could be called upon to perform, or words to that effect. It is quite true. Our impressions of what Is great, or even negotiable poetry, in our own language, which is the only language in which anybody can decently pretend to judge of poetry, are very early fixed. They are in fact our poetical standards. The men who can really, aftet—the impressionable age, readjust their standards so as to admit something essentially new in kind and not merely in degree* are so comparatively few as to be positively negligible. ! Those poetical ideals which a man had at thirty he retains at seventy, possibly to the wonder and ridicule of his juniors. There have been signal I examples, in ' the history of English poetry,^ of the upsetting of the standards of the seniors. From which examples every new aspiring junior draws the conclusion that whatever the seniors dls- ; like is on that account entitled to a presumption In its favor. Non sequitur. "What does follow is that the senior is within his rights in being disinclined to investigate new verse, and put upon the discovery of the possible needle In the certain haystack.

THESE remarks may tend to explain what the bilious philosopher meant. But they are hardly ;
■	applicable to the case of. such an aspirant for poetical recognition as Mr. 'William .Watson. Mr. ! Watson has been knocking at our intellectual doora, , so to say, for a matter of twenty years. 'He. has pro- ‘ duced in the minds of the lovers, of English poetry > a belief, in that space of time, that he is somebody. , And he now puts forward his poetical claims: in a portable package of two volumes, published here by the John Lane Company.	|

rUCHING the: effect of tHe collection upon the mind already hardened and^shut up to Its own standards of-poetry, the present rejrlewer may be pardoned a reminiscence. - In the Summer of 190ft being in London, and having the pleasure of a' communion of days with a dear old friend, an involuntary exile there, he mentioned to this, friend the considerations of the first preceding, paragraph, and. *by way of specification; mentioned -that he himself, "though frequently requested so to do,” by persons whose poetical perceptions he valued, hail not yet, considering the shortness of life and the value of time, seen his way to arrive at a conclusion respecting the poetical value of Mr. Watson’s, work. His friend, opener-minded than himself, though a decade older, responded that this was a mistake, and enthusiastically quoted the conclusion of ** The Father of the Forest.’* After that, there was nothing for the skeptic to do but to buy the poems of Watson, which he did the next day, and reading them on the steamer coming home, declared. In his haste, that all there really was in them of. poetical power and poetical originality was the quotation he had heard recited. He has modified this ' rash impression since. But a renewed citation will. at least suffice to prove that the author of that epilogue Is not negligible as an English poet:
With oceans heedless round her feet,
And- the indifferent heavens above,
Earth shall her ancient tale repeat Of wars and tears and. death and love;
And, wise from all the foolish Past,
Shall peradventure hail at last -
The advent of that mom divine .
When nations may as forests grow,
Wherein the oak hates not the pine.
Nor beeches wish the cedars woe,
But all, in their unlikeness blend Confederate to one golden end—
Beauty: the Vision whereunto,
In joy, with pan tings, from afar.
Through sound and odors, form and hue,
And mind and clay, and worm and star—
Now touching goal, now backward hurled—
Toils the Indomitable world.

THERE can,, one would say,. be no reasonable question about the quality of this extract. As*. Johnson said about Gray's - '* Elegy," . “ Had he; often written thus/It would.be vain‘to blameand
declines from it. But just why it does not all " take us where .we live,” as the highest poetry within our_
! several comprehensions does, is not so clear. We have always here thought, always a poetical diction, refined from the .grosser uses of prose. It-is distinctly on a loftier plane than that of prose that the poet habitually moves, " with his garland and singing robes about him." Why, we keep asking ourselves, why does he not 4* take us ” more? Why is he not, after all these’ years, a more " popular poet ” ?

WILLIAM MORRIS told his friend Swinburne that he was “ too literary.” It was an acute remark. Some explanation was evidently needed, in Swinburne’s case, how the foremost versifier of his time, with a mastery of. poetical technique which was the envy and despair of his contemporaries, should yet not have succeeded in getting so much as a line into currency, should not, after forty years, have made his way into the dictionaries of quotations, not have made a single phrase of his familiar In men’s mouths as household words. The same fate has befallen Watson, after a career of half the length. And the explanation is the same. He, too, is “ too literary.” Not, Indeed, in the same way. I Rather by reason of his choice of subject than his j method of treatment. For the best and most of his ] work Is distinctly criticism in verse—criticism liter- i ary and criticism political. His literary criticism, at least, is first-rate. And the point of view of it is by no means commonplace. 4 It requires courage to praise, at the beginning of the twentieth century, Sam Johnson's couplets as poetry:—
. \ _
In sad, stern verse the rugged Scholar-sage Bemoaned his toil unvalued,, youth, uncheered,
His members -wore the vesture of the age,
But *neath It beating the great heart was heard.
And not less to the .point .and away from the common point of view is what he-has to	about
Matthew Arnold *' In L'aleham Churchyard
"Tis fittest thus—for though with skill He sang of beck and tarn and ghyll.
The deep authentic mountaln-thriU .
Ne’er shook his page!	~
Somewhat *of worldring" mingled still
-	With bard and sage. .	.

BUT the best criticism in verse does.not make the poet of a people. All- this pamphleteering sonneteering, were it ever so well or better'd one, and though It took the popular instead of the unpopular point of View, is largely " aliunde ” when the question is.of.pure poetry. These two volumes are not ex-travagantm bulk. But it seems that the pure poet-. leal residuum of them can all be compressed within the limits of the anthologies of the next generation, that they will all be manageable by the-future Pal* grave. It may be a pity that the residuum is not greater. But what there is of it, it seems, may defy the storms of several generations to efface. M. S.
