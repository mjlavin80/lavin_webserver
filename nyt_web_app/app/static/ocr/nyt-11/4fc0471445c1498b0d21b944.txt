The following extract from tho prefa.ce to *' The Gospel of Life.” bearing the imprint ot McClure, Phillips &. Co., indl-cates Charles Wagner's idea expressed in the six sermons comprising the hook:
If public worship, if preaching has any aim, it is to blend into one all prayer and toil. It is to help us to love by casting light upon our way, by interpreting our experiences, by teaching us to unravel the divine woof in the rude stuff of the way of the world. For this it is enough to -hring together these two things, the Gos-1 pel and life. Life would be very obscure Without the Gospel; and how the Gospel grows—in strength and stature in contact with'Iife.
