RS. FRANCIS ALEXANDER, the translator of the legends included in " n Ltbro d’Oro," to be publtshed to-morrow by Messrs. Little, Brown & Co., is 92 years; of age, seven ~ years the senior of Miss Florence Nightingale, and much older than any other American of letters. It is twenty-three years since the late Mr. Henry Roderick Newman, an American artist, working for St. George’s Guild, brought Mr. Ruskin to the home which Mrs. Alexander and her daughter* had made for themselves in Italy, and showed him an artist and writer after his own heart, and a household in which his own ideals were the rule of life. The daughter. Miss Francesca Alexander, he introduced to the world as the author of ** The Story of Ida," “ Christ’s Folk in the Apennines,*’ and “ Roadside Songs of Tuscany," republished in this country as " Tuscan Songs.” Since his death she has published a volume of versified Italian legends under the title, “ The Hidden Servants,” but only those privileged to know their home at Bassano have guessed at the occupation of her mother’s leisure, the translation and engrossing of the four Italian collections included in this volume, even their quaintly verbose title pages, being rendered into English. Mother and daughter were on very friendly terms With Mr. T. P. Rossetti, the cousin of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, leader of the Italian Protestant ** Brethren*”	*
The book makes a thick volume of nearly 500 crown 8vo. pages, printed in antique type, with the arms of Innocent XL (Benedetto Odescaichi, I676-S9,) on the cover. Doubtless a future of illustrated editions awaits it, for its stories would tempt any artist, but the text will suffice for those who know real stories.

Mrs. Maud Howe Elliott’s ” Two in Italy ” is in its second edition, and her " Roma Beata *’ in its sixth, and " Wilderness Babies ** of Miss Julia Schwarz Ytas had its second printing. Mr. E. Phillips Oppenheim’s “The Master Mummer " is in its sixth edition, and in January his " A Maker of History ” will appear. Saturday of next week will bring Mr. George Wharton James’s " In and Out of the Old Missions of California.” The preparation of the 150 illustrations of this volume has delayed its appearance, which was expected earlier in the season.

From London comes the news that Mrs. Kate Douglas Wiggin's " Rose o’ the River ” ranks third among the “ sellers/’ and in the United States it ranks first, which, inasmuch as critics have agreed that it is not so good as the " Penelope " books, is somewhat surprising, although agreeable-to the publishers. Equally surprising, remembering the fate of the piophot in hfs own country, is the news that California in general and Los Angeles in particular highly approve of Mrs. Margaret Collier Graham's T>oOK of California stories, " The Witch’s Daughter."
Life, Love, and Death are the three divisions made by Mr. George Cabot Lodge in his little volume of sonnets, “ The Great Adventure,’* issued by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co, The seriousness of the little book makes it a quaint contrast to its companion, “ The Selections' from Saxe,” in which some sixteen poems are printed, with rubricated initials and a portrait frontispiece.

Among the poetry which Mr. Richard G. Badger has in preparation is “ The Exodus, an Epic on Liberty,” by Mr. Francis E. Roche; " First Fruits," by Mr. Robert B. Grant; ** The Marsh,” by Mr. Bayard Boyesen; "The Visionary,” by Miss Christine S. Swayne, and " The Peace Conference,’* by Mr. C. V. White. He also announces a novel by Mr, Olin L. Lyman, called " Micky.” It is a tale of journalism and politics.

In the coming book, “ George Bernard Shaw: His Plays." to be published by Messrs. John N. Luce & Co., the author throws some light on that life concern- ! ing which Mr. Shaw is so silent in “ Who’s Who? " It seems that his pater- ' nal grandfather was high sheriff of the county, which justifies the suspicion that he was a Conservative; his father possessed a good income, and his maternal grandfather, a fox-hunting squire, an estate which the writer of plays inherited seven years ago. His readers know .that he does not inherit this ancestor’s proclivl-ties, and he has definitely said that his amusements are ** anything but sport." , Herein he does not agree with the present head of his family, Major Sir Fred- • erick William Shaw of Bushey Park, who hunts, fishes, shoots, fought in South Africa, and has the D. S. O.
Mr, Bliss Carman’s coming volume, "The Poetry of Life," is now nearly ready at Messrs. L. C. Page & Co.'s. Besides the title essay, it will contain '* The Purpose of Poetry,” “How to Judge Poetry," " The^ Poet in the Commonwealth," "The Poet of Modem Xlfe," “ The Poetry of To-Morrow," " Longfellow," The Reward of Poetry," and a delightful letter addressed to Muse. Em-epson; Swinburne, and Mr. James Whitcomb Ritey will be severally considered in three papers, and what three could afford a wider range of matter and manner? M The Masters of the World," and “ The Permanence of Poetry ” will be among the other subjects.

The fiction of the week is chiefly juvenile, but Mr. Frank Waller Allen’s ** Back to Arcady,” published by Messrs. Herbert
B.	Turner & Co., is meant for readers not only adult but sufficiently mature to enjoy little whimsicalities of style, the affectations of the old beau, who is the narrator. He is In love with the past, and It requires a little self-adjustment to come into sympathy with him, but the pity of his woeful love history will conquer most readers, as it conquers the young lovers of the story. The volume has a prettily frivolous cover. Is illustrated by pen-and-ink drawings by Mr. T. B. Hazelton, and has decorative borders in apple-grqen for its cut pages.
One does not expect much from a book with Its cover shaped and colored to represent an automobile, but “ Automobllia,” by Mr. Charles Welsh, would surpass very fair expectation. Its pictured cushions are of a fine shade of crimson, and the oblong of type on each page Is set in an ingenious border showing a land of model roads. It contains a solidly sensible paper on buying a car, a good history of the car's evolution, quotations from such authorities as Col. Pope and Mr. Williamson, a " Glossary for Innocents," funny enough for the foolish dictionary, and a catechism of equal value; a collection of jokes, a few bits of serious verse, and some good parodies, signed with Mr. Welsh’s initials, and without its eccentric cover it would be sure of success.

" Love’s Garland,” also edited by Mr. Welsh, has a rose wreath for its cover with two cupids holding a girl's picture in the flowery frame and rose wreaths printed In Indian red on each page. Its editor’s original intention was to make a collection of ring and bracelet posies, to be bound in the ordinary way, but In adapting his material to this book he added short, complete poems, choosing those not found in many anthologies.

For Unitarian use Miss Fanny Louise Weaver has prepared a small “ Martineau Tear Book,” taking brief extracts from “ Endeavors After the Christian Life ” and " Hours of Thought on Sacred Things," and interspersing them with some of the briefer petitions from the volume of “ Home Prayers." A half-tone portrait of Dr. Martineau is the frontispiece, and the binding is of pale sage color with an ornamental label printed In carmine. It is published by Messrs. James H. West & Co.

“ Tommy Joyce and Tommy Joy," by Miss Harriet Cheever, presents Masters Sanford and Merton in twentieth century guise with no Mr. Barlow to bo too instructive. Tommy Joy is poor, ambitious, and sweet tempered; Tommy Joyce is almost spoiled by indulgence and runs away to sea to escape being reformed in a military school, but between Tommy Joyce' and a heavy handed mate he is i reformed indeed.

Messrs. Dana Estes & Co. publish this book and also Miss Evelyn Raymond’s " The Brass-Bound Box,” a story in I which a young girl endures such misfortunes as would be serious if she were twenty;-four instead of fourteen, and emerges from them triumphant because she has made others happy.

Mr. Egerton R. Young’s “ Hector, My Dog, an Autobiography," does not pretend to glorify the Arctic sledge dog, and mentions his faults and foibles, but it very ingeniously pleads for kindness. This book is the largest on the list of Messrs. W. A. Wilde & Co. this season, and • is intended for readers of all ages.
