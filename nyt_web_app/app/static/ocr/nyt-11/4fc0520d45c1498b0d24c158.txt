THE somewhat celebrated Committee of Fifty for the invest!gation of the liquor problem was organized ln 1893, and has since that time through its subcommittees published no less than five volumes embodying the results of its laI bors. Or these volumes two of consider-| able size considered the physiological as-i pects, one was occupied with legislative j assets, one with economic aspects, and one with " substitutes for the saloon/* The present work Is a summary of evidence, conclusions, and indications gathered from all five of the volumes mentioned, and constitutes, as might be expected from the character of the Investigating parties, about as sane a statement of the real conditions of the liquor problem as can be obtained within small compass. Dr. Billings sums up the physiological aspects with perfect fairness and temperance, showing lh what the food value of alcohol consists at the same time that he .points out. its possible poisonous effects—taking particular pains, In fact, to state that while alcohol is not on the whole an advisable or essential diet for healthy people, neither is one glass Of wine the gate of perdition. President Eliot of Harvard sums up tho information gathered by his sub-committee as to the effects of various legislation—prohi-bition In Maine, local option in Massachusetts, high license in Pennsylvania, the dispensary in South Carolina, and so on. He admits that none of these methods has been wholly to the public advantage. Henry W. Farnham sums up the Information gathered as to the economic effects of Indulgence ln alcoholic stlmu-Iantsr'but devotes most of his space to urging the accuracy and practical value of that information. Jacob L*. Greene has written of the ethical aspects and Raymond Calkins of '* Substitutes for the Saloon.*’ ""The value of the book seems to be chiefly in—the papers contributed by Dr. BiHings and President Eliot.
