AViO Tori; 2tim« Saturday Review of Boolis:
Can It be possible that your correspondent, M. L. Livingston, whose letter appears in The: New York Times book Review, Nov. 4, baa tailed to recognize the biblical quotation happily masquerading as book title for Mrs. Wharton’s wonderful " House of Mirth " ? Having acquainted himself wtth or rather refreshed his memory by rereading it, it wouid be Interesting to fenow whether or not hi3 point of view would remain unaltered. My belief is that tho book would appear In an entirely new Ught-and thus reviewed his wish to criticise would be nulled by his more thorough enjoyment of such word painting as makes her literary mastery supreme. It is pleasanter to feel that it was Mrs. Wharton’s exceptional Insight and power of analysis which made possible her unapproachable portrayal of a character so complete as that of Lily Bart, as yet unsurpassed In contemporary literature rather than her mere use of her knowledge as an insider, and it is doubtful if so remarkable a book would have been given us had the ability requisite been merely ** tho blunted sense that familiarity breeds."
