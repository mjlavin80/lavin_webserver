SHE history of Italy, like tho
•	history, of /the other- countries of Europe, begins-'vvlth ' the barbarian invasions which
■	overtttrew the Roman -Empire. Mr. Sedgwick hgs '	'	'	chosen the year 47G, in' which
the last of tho Western ^Emperors was "deposed, as the starting • point ■ for his narrative. The Roman Empire did not fall in this year. It continued to exist; its Emperor - continued to reside at. Constantinople. But there ceased to be any Emperor in Italy.
The Ostrogoth, Theodoric, the* greatest of the barbarian rulers of 'Italy, while acting 'In practicc like an Independent sovereign, in theory recognized the overlordship of the Emperor at Constantinople. His efforts to erect a strong kingdom in the peninsula failed. The Emperor disliked his power, the subject Latins were restless under his rule, and the Papacy was hostile to him. .
The next Teutonic swarm to swoop down upon Italy were the Lombards, withs whont*as with the Ostrogoths the Papacy was In constant conflict. The'" antipathy between the two led to the alliance of the latter with the Franks, an event justly considered one of the greatest in the whole history of Europe. The alliance between Pope Zacharias and the orthodox Carolinglan Frank, Pippin, was consummated when in the year SOO Pope Leo crowned Charlemagne Emperor, thus reviving the empire In the West. The disintegration of Charlemagne's empire was a time of degradation and misery for Italy, during which the imperial title became the object of petty factional strife.
In 9G2 came Otto the Great, tlTe Saxon ruler of Germany, to re-establish the empire, to be known henceforth as the Holy Roman Empire, and to include Italy and Germany. Mr. Sedgwick comments upon the nature of this union and observes that the empire was German, the Papacy Italian, and by their very natures they were antagonistic.” He takes the year 1250, the death of Frederick II., as really marking the end of this mediaeval empire, though the Holy Roman Empire continued to exist nominally till Napoleon brought it ter an end in 1803. About the middle of the thirteenth century Italy becomes a number of independent States.

THE mediaeval Papacy, too, was tottering. The dark days of the Baby-Ionish captivity at Avignon, when me Pope became tho creature of the King of France, were followed by the Great Schism which kept the Church, asunder for forty years. Among the evils endure^ by Italy during this mournful fourteenth century Hr. Sedgwick enumerates the plague, swarms of mercenary soldiers, which infested the land, and the despots4 who established themselves in the Italian
-	cities.	*
On the Renaissance Mr. Sedgwick Is , brief. Following this he describes the clnquecento, the sixteenth century, as one in which " honesty, Independence, genuineness fade away and in their stead we find cleverness and effort.’-' The two centuries from 15S0 to the French Revolution he describes under the caption, " The Age of Stagnation.” (
He shows what the'state of the peninsula was when the French Revolution In the person of Napoleon burst upon It. Revolutionary ideas spread like wildfire.
11	Napoleon had given the coup de gr&ce to the old regime.” The reconstruction of Europe in 1815 saw Austria intrenched as the dominant power In Italy. Despotism seemed triumphant; and “ Popes, Princes, and privileged persons In g n-eral made a gallant attempt to pretend that the French Revolution and the Napoleonic upheaval had never taken place.” Secret societies, however, plotted for freedom. The outbreaks of 1820-21 were followed by years of what Mr. Sedgwick callsvperturbed inactivity. The revolutionary movements of 1S4S spread throughout the peninsula and marked the appearance in great public life of Cavour. Hopes for the Italian cause seemed at an end when the Piedmontese army was beaten by ‘Austria at Novara.
**•
THE old tyranny continued. In Piedmont alone there was hope. Victor Emmanuel knew that if tho house of Savoy was to lead in the movement for Italian independence It must win the confidence of liberals. Cavour was called to the head of the Government, and for ten years remained the chief figure in Italian history. The war with Austria in 1950 Is the beginning of Italian unification. .The succeeding steps In this process and the subsequent history are briefly treated.
