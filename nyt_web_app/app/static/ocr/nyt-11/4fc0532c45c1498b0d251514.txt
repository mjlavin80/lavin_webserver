IT is not tuo much to say that this book is splendid: it might not be too much to say that it is great. It is by a new author who some time ago appeared* in The Century Magazine. Ho thf-n had a number of stories with the wintry Northwest for a stage setting, a number of real, if rough, characters for Ins actors, and himself as stage manager with a talent for doing the right thing with convincing results.
Some of these stories uow appear under the title of “ Jules of the Great Heart.” Jules Verbeaux is a Krench-Canadian trapper, abhorred and considered an outlaw by 'the ‘Hudson Bay Company because of a quaint notion the hunter has that God never gave that company a monopoly over the wilderness—the marten, beaver, lynx, sable, and all the traps therein.
The character of this Robin Hood of the great Northwest is finely drawn. He is a big rough diamond, with no very keen sense of honor in the matter of helping himself, but come beautifully primitive ideas of human brotherhood, and a thorough grasp of that Golden Rule of which he probably never heard. The way he spares his enemies is naturally human, inasmuch as, unlike your demi-god hero* he does not let them

unscathed. Talcing their dogs, sledges, and rifles and making them walk forty or fifty miles through the snow to the nearest post was much more appeaims to Jules, as it should - be to twentieth century folk, who recoil from bloodshed jus’t a little less than' they do from the noble hysteria of a righteous and Godfearing hero.
Aside from the delight one experiences tn making the acquaintance of the big-hearted Jules, his creator has given some ^ telling descriptions of the great North-| west in its Winter fury. The scene where | Jules sits over a fire in his hut, with I a sick enemy being nursed in a corncr,
! is rendered powerful by the description I of the blizzard outside. The little sables creep through a hole in the logs for warmth, and a big moose, driven \iy the wolves and the storm, crouches in the lee of the hut for shelter.
Here, too, is that spice of danger which we say we left behind in our boyhood, but know in our hearts that we love os much in manhood. The constant war between the Hudson Bay Company and the smaller trading concerns, and the savage battles which took-place between the employes, are depicted with vim and terseness.
