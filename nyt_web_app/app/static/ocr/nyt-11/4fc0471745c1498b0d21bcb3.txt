O	attempt a new Life of Lowell at Just I this time cannot	have been the easiest	I
of undertakings.	We know both too	I
much ana too little about him. HJs fig- 1 ure lies for the moment in that broad ■ noon df approbation which so often turns out in the end to have been but a dawn of appreciation. We are aware of a physique and its apparel, and fancy we are beholding a man. The neighbors are still talking about him, and our opinion of his work is insensibly colored by the fact of his fondness for stray kittens, or red neckties. But perhaps the younger generation which admiringly badgered the great	man	for his autograph,	and made pilgrimaces
to his	freshly covered grave,	has its own qualifica-
tions for j&dging him. Mr. Greenslef' would not assert that he speaks for posterity; but he is undeniably posterior, and seems without breach of decorum to have uttered fundamental truths about Lowell which could hardly have been phrased by contemporaries, Mr. Scudder's " Life," with all its fullness and all its dignity, was not quite free from the touch of random reminiscence, of studied amenity, which (Froude to the contrary) we have learned to look for in the biography of the survivor. The bulk of material at his command was presented with an amplitude , not always consistent with lucidity or compactness.
Mr. Greenslet-has reduced it to order; and his chosen scale has warned him to exclude what was impertinent or adventitious. A little difference of emphasis 1 here and there may suggest itself as possible; but in substance the narrative is exactly what it should be.
Of the biographer's manner a word may be said.
Mr. Greenslet is a writer of experience, and quite as obviously of experiences. His pen is tipped with erudition, he is learned in quaint half-forgotten authors, he is precious of certain fragile modern reputations.
He writes from a firm critical theory, and knows how to back his own opinions. Yet his speech lacks something of firmness and consistency. . A man, let us admit, may have an attitude toward his own style; but he can hardly have several attitudes. Mr. Greenslet's experience as a critic of contemporary letters has done much to simplify his manner. Whether reviewing is an affair of journalism or not, it is evidently not done for posterity. An audience fit though few . would be little to the purpose. For a reviewer the , luxuries of expression are n<ft; he cannot go delicately about his task, but must march straight to the point. He must, it may be, waive something of self-	.
expression in order to express anything. Certainly he must eschew literary graces. And all this applies to biography which is not aimed at a special class.
Mr. Greenslet wishes to be understood, and writes I: simply enough in the main; but Fa ter *• saw him 1 first/’ and now and then his eyes will turn from the	J
dusty road to those green pastures in which the	*
stylists daintily nibble their asphodels and thistles. He -chooses to send us to the dictionary rather than to de- . prive his own initiated palate of some subtle flavor of • meaning. He congratulates us that “ seldom does	;

Mr. Greenslet hag made a pretty clean-cut division I between the narrative and the critical portions of his work. The facts of Lowell's life are so skillfully *pre-I sen ted as to give their record a critical value; but the'* .

So acute a commentator as Mr. James has said that Lowell “ had no experimental sympathies, * and no part of him was traitor to the rest "; and so sensitive (Mr. Greenslet uses the word of him) a critic as Mr. Howells asserts that 44 his nature * * * was not always serene or pellucid; it was sometimes rolled by the currents that counter and cross in all of us." Mr. Howells^ seems to be nearer the truth, in a vague way, but Mr. Greenslet has done more than approach it, if we can Judge of the matter. He says in what may prove to be the most memorable paragraph in a book worth remembering:	*

TTTR final chapters, which deal with Lowell as poet and prose writer, are equally satisfying. Hitherto his limitations as a poet haye been rather timidly touched upon by critics, at least by American critics. The common-scbool attitude toward the Cambridge mid-century magnates has been not without its influence upon a generation which in religion prefers criticism to worship, and in literature prefers worship to criticism. Let us, moreover, be patriotic; If we have no true deities of genius, let us build unto ourselves idols bearing a family likeness to Uncle Sam, How many of us have left our grammar school—yes, and our high school—with the general notion that Bryant was about the same as Milton, aricC Longfellow as Shakespeare? Altogether," it is a little hard to believe with Mr. Greenslet that we are already in a position to regard Lowell “ in the cool, unde-ceptive light of ' ce lendemaln sfivfire '— that dispassionate to-morrow in which whatever a man's work has of caducity or of vitality is seen for what it is.” Yet I do not see how any more reasonable estimate can be made ajt this time than Mr. Greenslet here presents.
Lowell was not a finished literary artist either in prose or In verse. The value of his poetry as a whole, therefore, is rather relative than absolute. He did not despise the labor of the file, but he was confessedly awkward at it, and poetic feeling instigates, often er than inspires, his rapid utterances. Mr. Greenslet chooses some fifty titles as representing “ a part of Lowell's poetry vastly greater than the whole," and proceeds to contrast them as to mood and quality with the rest of Lowell's verse. This poetry at its best is remarkable for ts sincerity of mood, its Intellectuality, and its ideality; and. as to Etyle, for “ a pitny and noble grandiloquence." Lowell’s pronounced successes are In occasional or, as Mr. Greenslet calls it, ^applied" poetry; whether it takes the reflective or panegyrical or satirical form.
MR. GREENSLET further considers that LowelVs critical prose is likely to survive his poetry, though here, too, his lack of craftsmanship may prove fgtai to permanence. Moreover, says the biographer, his “ critical method was never that of insidious urbane circumval-latlon, which since Sainte-Beuve has been Increasingly the ideal of critical procedure. With Lowell, criticism is rather a matter of adventurous sallies and spectacular swordplay." What bearing this fact will have upon the survival of Lowell’s prose remains to be seen. We have our own fashions in criticism; but clrcumvalla tion is, after all, less amusing than swordplay, and deadly as the creeping process may be. It will hardly supersede the thrust in the open. Mr. Greenslet’s conclusion is strong. Lowell, he intimates, wrote no book which is sure to live among the world’s best, though “ ha
