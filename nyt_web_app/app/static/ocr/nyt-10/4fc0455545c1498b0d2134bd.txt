Miss G. E. Mitton, author of “ The Children's Book of London,” “ A Bachelor Girl in London,*' " Normandy,” &c., opens her book on ** Jane Austen and Her England,” which is down for publication the first week of November by G. P. Putnam’s Sons, as follows:
Of Jane Austen’s life there is little to tell, and that little has been told more than once by writers whose relationship to her made them competent to do so. It Is impossible to make even microscopic additions to the sum total of the facts already known of that simple biography, and if by chance a few more original letters were discovered they could hardly alter the case, for in truth of her It may be said, ** Story there is none to tell, Sir.
To the very pertinent question which , naturally follows, reply may thus be given. Jane Austen stands absolutely alone, unapproached, in a quality in which women are usually supposed to be deficient, a humorous and brilliant insight ! into the foibles of human nature, and a strong sense of the ludicrous.
The object of the book is to show Jane Austen among the scenes in which she moved, to sketch the men and women to whom she was accustomed, the habits and manners of her class, and the England with which she was familiar. The first chapter is a survey of the England Into which she was born. It is followed by descriptions of her childhood, the position of the clcrgy during her days, her homo life at Steventon, her novels, the letters and post of the times, society and love-making:, visiting and traveling of ihe period, contemporary writers, the navy, Jane Austen at Bath, the dress and fashions at this resort, Southampton, ChaW-ton, London,	closing, as may be
expected, with her “ Last Days*”
