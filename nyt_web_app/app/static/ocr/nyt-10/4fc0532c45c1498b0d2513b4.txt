Lafcadio Hearn’s “ The Romance of the ’ Milky Way ” contains his criticism of Herbert Spencer's “The Ultimate Question,” a paper in which he gives his own views on the topic meditated by Spencer. The title essay compares the Japanese mythology of the heavens and the astron-
■	omer’s view, and the remaining papers touch upon poetry, goblin lore, and other
. matters of which Mr. Hearn had an f inexhaustible store of knowledge. His cn-; lightening “Letter from Japan.” originally published in The Atlantic, is reprinted in this book,
. Mr. Richard G. Badger has in press a volume of poetry by Miss Blanche Shoemaker, entitled " The Song of Youth,” and having the aulhor's portrait by Mr. Hellen for it** frontispif-ce. ” Cherokee Rose,” by Miss Zitclla Corke; ** Myrtle and Myrrh,” by Ameen Rlhani; “ Ac-taoon's Defenco,” by Misg Alice Wilson, and ” Songs by the Ledges,” by Miss Ellen Brainard Peck are also nearly ready.

. "Four Days of God,” by Mrs.. Harriet Prescott Spofford, describes a typical day in each season with that wealth of epithet peculiar to the author among American writers, and with rare minuteness of observation The volume has page decora- ,
tiuns by Miss Anna C. Tomlinson, and* as they are printed in four, colors and no design is repeated, the book artistically
interesting. "	-	.	/	.
Two or three controversial novels about mediums and their professions have re-
cently appeared, but Mr. Francis Newton Thorpe's ** The Divining Rod/' to be published by Messrs. Little, Brown. &. Co., differs from them in describing a family of Spiritualists, without expressing any opinion as to their belief. For the rest the book tells of an oil king and his clumsy efforts to spend his wealth, of his fight* with his organized rivals, and of his beautiful daughter and her lovers.

By an uncommonly happy <£ *nce the two volumes of Capt, Mahan's *' Sea Power in Its Relations to the War of 1S12 M will appear Saturday of next week, the centenary of Trafalgar, on which date he is to lecture in Boston. Its appearance in magazine form has made it familiar to those interested in its subject, and certain maps and plans added to the original illustrations will give it greater value.
*•*
To-morrow will bring Mr. Cbarlea Ferris Gettemy's ’‘The True Story of Paul Revere,” Miss Annie Faysoh Call s A Man of the World/* and Miss Anna Chapin Ray's "Sidney: Her Summer on tbe St. Lawrence,” the first of a new series, for there are to be no more ** Teddy ” books.
*#*
Miss M. Allette Ayer's "The Joys of Friendship,” the companion volume of her “ Daily Cheer Tear Book,” is arranged by subjects. ‘‘ The Love of Friendship,” “ Companionship," •* Sympathy/*
“ Influence/ ” Immortality of Friendship,” and lastly “ The Divine Friendship.” A few of the quotations are from the work of great writers, and many are anonymous, but, on the other hand, very few are hackneyed, and one may open the book almost anywhere with the assurance of finding something unfamiliar. The book has an appropriate dress of white cloth decorated with a heart outlined In forget-me-m>ts, and it bears the imprint of Messrs. Lee & Shepard,
Two Stratemeyer books will come to the boys from the same house to-morrow, j ” The Fort in the Wilderness,” in the j Colonial Series, and ” Dave Porter of Oak Hall ” in the Dave Porter series. The former continues the story of Pontiac describing the siege of Detroit and the j attack on Fort Pitt, and ending with the battle of Bushy Run. The hero of the latter book is a poorhouse boy, who, having earned an education by an act of bravery, goes to an academy frequented by the sons of wealthy men, shines in the classroom, and attains to great glory as a baseball player. His only fault Vs bis abject cowardice in regard to the future tenro. He never says " shall ” for “ will/* or will ” for ” shall/' for he dares not trust himself with either, but makes sentences like “ I hope he doesn’t die with the secret,” ” I trust I don’t have any trouble.”

rn Mrs. Johnston’s •« The Little Colonel’s Christmas Vacation ” one sees a school in which pcacocks on the terraces, towers, a stained glass staircase window, and a stately, white-haired Principal combine to produce such an air of romance that ordinary pranks seem out of place, and bis^n spirits of the pupils find their outlet in rivalry in well-doing. It is not easy to believe In quite so much virtue, but its chronicle is attractive, and Mrs. Johnston has the knack of suggesting helps to goodness and of showing the bitterness of little sins, thus keeping the values of her picture of. life fairly correct in spite
of its roseate* atmosphere... Tbb ' book - Is prettily - Illustrated by Miss Et held red 23. • Harry and . has a - tasteful -illuminated -cover. It Js published by Messrs. I*. C. Page & Co. ■
