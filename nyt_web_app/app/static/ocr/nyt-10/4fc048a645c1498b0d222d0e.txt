A HERO IN DISGUISE
THE SCARLET PIMPKKNEL. By BaJf-cmess Orciy. l2mo, Illustrated. New York: G. P. Putnam' s Sons. 51.50.
T' HIS is a thrilling story of the days of the French Revolution. It was first |	written	as a play, and one can Im-
agine it being better for acting purposes than for reading. The Scarlet Pimpernel " was the name chosen to conceal the identity of a daring Englishman—the head i of a brave band whose object was to aid 1 members of the French nobility to escape | the jaws of the guillotine. From the very first, of course, the reader recognizes the hero, although the author does not openly declare him until many pages later. Who, though, could mistake that mask of quiet Indolence, of almost stupid indifference, i of superhuman courage? Sir Percy Blake-ney goes to meet danger, perhaps death, i as another man would run lightly down ; to breakfast. He laughs in the faces of his enemies and. fastidiously removes Imaginary specks of dust from his ruffles before giving the saving of his life even a thought He Is apparently indifferent to I the fact that he has the handsomest and I most courted wife in England, and she. thinking him the dunce he appears to be, diverts the affections that should have been his to Armand. her brother.
But when she discovers the hidden real self of Sir Percy, wh^n by accident she finds that he has started on a perilous Journey to save Armand for her—a jour-' ney which means certain death for him-Sel^-when he does this without even tell-ihg her of his intentions and leaves her to discover it all quite by accident, she clinches her tiny hands','-looks more pathetically childlike “than ever and starts Out to -warn and gave, him/'■ *
