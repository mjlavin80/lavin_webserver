This is the title of a book by John Gilmer Speed, the well-known breeder and trainer whose assistance has often been sought by the United States Government in developing- special types of horses for the Philippines and the army. It treats of the buying of a horse, the stable and its management. “Training vs. Breaking,” riding and driving, and includes an historical account of the breeds characteristic of this country and what has been done toward their development. Space Is also given to the romance and sentiment connected with the animal, while Mr. Speed gives accounts of the careers of great racers. He writes in his introduction:
Most of the previous books have been devoted to special kinds or types of horses, without any effort to cover a very broad field. Some others have been frankly partisan, with the avowed purpose of proving that this type or that was the only one that was worth serious consideration. All these are interesting, but valuable chiefly to the student Intent on 1 going into the subject of horse breeding and norse training in all its branches. To do this an ordinary reader would have to study half a hundred books with the danger of becoming confused In the multi- , plicity of theories and conflicting statements, and with the final result of knowing as little in the end as in the beginning. In this modest little volume I have endeavored chiefly to show how the horses in America have been developed and have come to be what they are today.
Every breed of horse is considered In the i book—Kentucky and Denmark saddle j horses, Clay Arabians, Morgans, mules, j thoroughbred, &c. McClure. Phillips & I Co. will publish “ The Horse Jn America " this month.	-
