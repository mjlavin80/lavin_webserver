A monograph on “ Sir Joshua Reynolds, First President of the Royal Academy,” by Sir Walter Armstrong1, is about to be issued by Charles Scribner's Sons, In conjunction with William Heinemann in London. The author, in his brief note, -which follows, describes his attitude toward the painter:
The aim of this book is to give a concise account of Sir Joshua’s career, as recorded in his numerous biographies and in the series of his work, and to express opinions on his art and writings. If my estimate of his character is found to differ in essential points from that usually accepted, I can only say that it has been formed after a very careful weighing of the evidence. It is my conviction that from the first It has been the custom to regard Reynolds through an atmosphere of idealization created by enthusiasm for his art. If this monograph possesses any originality. It is that I have endeavored to paint the great artist as a consistent human being, even although the result may be to set him on a plane somewhat different from that chosen by some previous writers.
In one of the additional chapters following the story of Reynolds’s career—on his character, his art, and his writings—Sir Walter Armstrong writes:
He appears to me the supreme, if not the only, modern instance of a painter reaching greatness along a path every step of which was trodden deliberately, with a full consciousness of why it wes-taken and whither it was leading, and with the power unimpaired to turn back or to change the goal at any moment. Superficially, the art of Sir Joshua resembled that of Raphael as little as it well could; mentally; the processes of the two men were curiously alike. Both possessed taste to such a degree that It became genius, and both were endowed, for the service* of their taster~wlth a mental industry which is rare.
The volume is profusely illustrated with photogravure and half-tone reproductions of some of the best known of Reynolds's pictures.
