An American Business Alan's Record of His Observations on a Business Trip-*
ERE are recorded the experiences and impressions cf an American business man on a trip through Panama, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Argentina, and Brazil. The trip ■was a business trip, and itr; writer is exercised over the strange ncgligence of American business men In securing the South American market for an inevitable future need, if not a present ^ne But the record is almost wholly of a traveler's experiences, observations, Joys, *n.i tribulations, and not at all of business ,-ondltions and requirements. It is thus an addition to the numerous books of South Amc-rican travel; but its descriptions of a country when* conditions have changed rapidly have some value because of their freshness and of the writer’s candid expression of an alert business man’s ideas. How much more valuable the book would have been iC he had written more about fcis business experience.
Colon and Panama were his first stopping places, crying aloud for sanitary improvement; . he saw the beginnings 1 which the French made on the canal and an enormous amount of their abandoned machinery and implements perishing in rust and decay. Business in Panama is dull, but the merchants hope for revival when the American canal work begins, even though such a '* shower Of gold ” as came from the French is not expected*
Only at one place on his whole journey did this traveler suffer positive discomfort—at a little road house on the stage i coach line over the Andes in the gap be; tween the two railways. The Argentine road runs through “ the most wonderful railroad country in the world,'* mile after mile, without turn or curve, with- only a bit of grading here and a little filling there. At Buenos Aires a feeling of “ admiration and enchantment ’’ took possession of him that has never left him; a city growing with the mushroom expansion of a Chicago, though it was founded as long ago as J5&5. Concerning the city he is moved to remark:
Best foot forward and appearances above all things is the motto of South America. It isn’t a half bad motto when united to the push and progressiveness that I found everywhere in Buenos Aires.
Political considerations, however, are less pleasing:
No matter what a man’s standing may have been before election to office, once he is in it is taken for granted that he is there to make what he can cut of it.
*	* * Public sentiment seems to be, the higher the office the bigger the chance for graft.
In Montevideo he landed in the- midst of a revolution, and after due warning by the authorities was allowed to go about the town, expecting exciting adventures. Nothing of the sort:
The streets wer*1 quiet, unnaturally quiet, and at every corner or two there was a group of soldiers doing police duty. The city was, of course, under martial law, and the same air of arrested activity pervaded everything. * * *	\ heard of
little bloodshed, hut there was talk of much slaughter of live stock on the part of the contending factions.
Only In the last chapter does Mr.Wiborg expatiate upon the business aspects of his trip. He finds It astonishing, as have j ninny others, to our complacent American s^nse of business supremacy, to see how ! the nations of Kurope have outdistanced us in trade on this hemisphere. No doubt if our interest had been keener, Wavs and means would have been found for enlarging trade. TJnes of transportation, he thinks, need to be increased; hotter systems of banking and collection must he devised. Capable salesmen with knowledge of Spanish and Portuguese are needed. And lie puts most stress of all on adopting South American business methods, care in filling orders, in packing goods as the South Americans wish. The prevailing feeling there is that wc rat*.* very little for South America or South American trade; that Kurope cares much, and has shown that she cares. South America. Mr. Wiborg wry truly siiys. is not a negligible quantity, and now is the time for realizing it.
