Bucchylides has, of course, no pretension to be poet of the same order as Pindar; it might rather be said that part of the interest which he possesses for us arises from the marked difference of poetical rank. In reading his odes, so elegant, so transparently clear, so pleasing in their graceful flow of narrative, often so bright in their descriptive touches, and at mo-| ments so pathetic, we feel that this is a singer who, moving1 in a lower sphere than Pindar, must also have been more immediately intelligible to the common Hellenic ' sense. The great Theban master makes no concealment of a haughty conscious-i ness that his inmost appeal is to the few. This Ionian, if once he likens himself to an eagle *	*	* is truer to his
own spirit when he describes himself as : “ the nightingale of Ceos.”
At the outset' of his preface Prof. Sir Richard C. Jebb speaks thus of Bacchy-j lidos, whose poems and fragments on the papyrus In the British Museum were | brought from Egypt in 189C, and are now j considered by him In the volume published by the Macmillan Company. He , has written a long introduction, provided notes, and madSLthe English prose trans-latlons of the Greek originals. In compiling the volume, Prof. Jebb writes in his preface:
I have endeavored to combine criticism and interpretation with a treatment of the poems as literature, and thus to contribute, though it be onlv a little, toward obtaining for them that place In our Greek studies which they appear well fitted to hold.' For such a purpose It was not enough to explain and Illustrate the odes themselves; It was necessary also to aim at conserving some Idea of the surroundings amidst which the poet Worked, of his relation to contemporaries, and of his place in the historical development of the Greek lyric.
Three autotype plates in the book present fae similes of parts of the papyrus < In consideration.
