R. LITTLE has been identified with the Far East since early manhood. He has been known to geographers since 188S, when he published the most detailed and best description of the Yangtse gorges
that has been written. He took the first
t
steamboat up through those rapids in 1S98. His business career began in China forty-six years ago, and he has lived there ever since. This year we hear of him in Western China, where he is engaged in the interests of mining development and steam navigation. He was undoubtedly selected to write this volume in The Regions of the World Series because few men have traveled so extensively as he in the Far East and know it so well. His book was written in the various countries he describes, and while it is primarily geographical, it is saturated from beginning to end with the practical aspects of those countries. How will their natural conditions and resources and the qualities and characteristics of their inhabitants tend to help or hinder their development or the enlargement of their relations with the rest of the world?
This is a very live question to-day, for the Far East has become the focus of world-wide Interest. It is too early to answer the question in detail, and naturally Mr. Little does not attempt the task. It is the mission of his book to place before us a clear and succinct account of the human factors and of the physical environment that has helped to shape the character and destiny. The Far East is worthy of the scientific study which savants have given to India and Southern Europe, and more exhaustive description will follow the collection of adequate data. Such thorough treatment of these countries will come some day; and we know of no better introduction to it than the volume now before us.
Those who know of the great enterprises now going forward, especially In China, may best appreciate the timeliness of this book, for It is undoubtedly the best summary yet brought within the compass of a single volume of our knowledge of the five countries of Southeastern Asia—the Chinese Empire, Indo-1 China, Korea, Siam, and Japan. Everybody has heard of the well-advertised projects, such as the j railroad that the Belgians have completed from Peking to Hankow on the Yangtse, the extension of the ; railroad from Hankow to Canton, for which Ameri-1 cans hold the concession, and the railroad that the Germans have built across Shantung, the most popu-’ lous province of the empire. Less, however, Is generally known of other schemes for further development and of very important work now under way. The attitude of the Chinese toward railroads has changed, and native officials even talk of China taking to herself a large share of railroad extension. France is likely to be the first to reach the " countless number of fertile valleys ” on the great limestone plateau of Yunnan, for its railroad from Hanoi to the capital of Yunnan is already under way, and its builders expect to open it to traffic In 1908. The British are trying to make up their minds which is the best of several routes suggested by surveyors and travelers for the railroad between Yunnan and Burma; and a joint British and French syndicate has secured large mining concessions in the El Dorado of Yunnan.
But these are schemes for the development of a far inland province on the border of Tibet. Activity is greater in districts more accessible and nearer the sea. The British have practically ascertained the extent and quality of the vast coal resources in the basins of the Yangtse and Hoang Rivers; and they are giving close attention to the question of trade penetration into all the best parts of China, and especially into the marvelously rich western province of Szechuan. Several parties of their explorers have been sent to the north and west and southwest of Peking to study the condition of the people, their products, and the best routes for railroads to the west. They are ransacking the mountains of Honan and Hupeh for the pass, still elusive, by which they ' may circumvent the Yangtse gorges and build an easy rail route to the rich, red plain of Szechuan. Everywhere, they say, the educated class is eagerly reading Western books of science that are being

turned into Chinese and primed by tho thousands at Shanghai; and the maps of these official explorers, printed chiefly by the geographical societies ot Great Britain, reveal hundreds of place names that never were seen before.
This eager quest for information is at its height just as this helpful book appears with an orderly and thorough account. of the geography of these five countries and of the control exercised by their environment in the distribution of plants and animals, in shaping the activities of the human population. Two-thirds of the space is given to the Chinese Empire because it by far the larger part of the area and most ot the population. China is treated first in its broadest geographical aspects. Seven chapters are then given to the more detailed discussion of China proper, the provinces of the northern basin, or Hoang River, the middle basin or Yangtse River, the intermediate provinces, and the southern basin or West River bcltig considered in turn. Three of these chapters are given to Central China, watered by the Yangtse system, the most populous and important part of the empire. Pour chapters follow on the dependencies, Manchuria, Mongolia, Turkestan, and Tibet, and in the four last chapters, In-do-China, Korea, the buffer kingdom, Siam, and the island empire Japan receive succinct but very significant and suggestive treatment. A full index ends the volume.
It would be easy to make such a book ▼ery dull reading. A mere enumeration of boundaries, rivers, chief towns* and ports kills interest in the library as well as in the grammar school. But this is not modem geography. The subject Is vivified to-day by keeping in view the intimate relation between geography and the history and activities of mankind. Mr. Little has been trained in the modern school, and we may show, by a few illustrations, his way of kindling his pages with Interest as well as of filling them with information.
APART of the low plain of the Chihli Province is turned in the rainy season into extensive marshes and swamps, a fact the Talping rebels overlooked when they marched on Peking In 1856. Their army of 300,000 men, constantly harassed by the brave militia from the north, could not extricate itself from this maze of marshes and streams and so perished miserably, the last tragedy in a long series that had cost several millions of lives. Mongolia is one of the poorest countries in the world, not because its soil Is poor, but for the reason that the mountains, which wall it in, wring dry the rain-bearing winds from the ocean so that these lofty highlands are parched in Summer, and their great elevation makes them bitterly cold in Winter. Agriculture can be attempted only In a few favored spots, and the Mongols are confined to the pastoral life and are nomads by necessity.
The sediments -from the great rivers have shallowed the Yellow Sea until it is dangerous for shipping to approach most parts of its coasts; the result is that the sea life has developed only to a very small extent among the people of northeast China.
In the mountainous Province of Hunan, the ranges isolate many districts from one another so that the inhabitants axe segregated into small communities with myriads of local dialects, in striking contrast with the countries nortn of the Yangtse, where the Mandarin dialect is every where understood, though It is almost wholly useless for travel in the south. Slightly differing climatic conditions give distinct flavors to the tea grown hi each of six neighboring valleys. Deep-cut defiles, with the ranges that separate them, proved an impassable barrier to free intercourse between the people of Burmah and China, and thus kept the two races quite distinct in character, the Chinese being finally content to leave Burma afi a buffer state between their own territory and the more objectionable foreigners beyond.
Mr. Little is doubtless correct in saying that the varying scales on which the maps in our atlases are drawn give utterly erroneous ideas as to the size of countries in the Far East, The reason is because Western countries are drawn on a much larger scale than those of Eastern Asia, and popular notions of comparative area are too often based upon the relative size of countries aa they appear on the maps without reference to the scale. The fact is that the Chinese Empire is one and one-half times as large as the United States, excluding Alaska, and Prance might be put In the one Chinese Province of Szechuan, while Great Britain and Ireland would not jostle one another in the Island of Borneo.
THE author brings clearly into view the distinctive characteristics of each of the provinces, and his pages art full of the intimate knowledge of China and Its people that could be acquired only by long residence theru He has the highest respect fop- the intellectual strength of the ChJ-nese ana their steadfast tenacity in following their own ideals. He says we know them weii enough now to realize the folly
of Ignoring their susceptibilities, and he . agrees with Mr. Weale, who wrote a while ago that the experience of Englishmen iri China for two centuries has proved conclusively that '* not only must the, Chinese be considered in all commercial ‘ and economical matters, but their wishes and inclinations In the end carry aU before : them and win the day.”
He has great faith in the future of the ! empire when brawn and muscle are supplemented, as they are certain to be, by the machinery required to carry on great enterprises. The Russians, he says, chase wisely when they bunt their chief city In Manchuria at Harbin, for it Is the natural centre of the province, is in the midst of a magnificent wheat country* and Its steam flour miiig at the beginning of the war were turning out about
1,000,000 pounds of flour a day.
The author throws considerable new light upon many'aspects of China with j which we are more or I*™ familiar; hlq description, for example, of the remark* able Chengtu plateau and its wonderful , irrigation works Is the best and fullest that has been written.	;
; This plateau Is an area of level land, but sloping a little to the south, about i i 2,800 square miles in extent, once a desert of boulders but now probably the most highly productive and densely populated j farming region in the world. It is In the heart of Szechuan. It was reclaimed by | the genius of an official who lived two centuries before the Christian era. He ! dug a wide ditch through the plain, j Then by means of boulders Incased In bamboo wickerwork he built a wall In i the Min River, which stands to this day, and diverts most of the river waters into j the ditch, which in turn was subdivided, and the subdivisions were divided again I and again, till the whole area was cov- 1 ered with a network of water channels. For centures these ditches were kept in repair, but nothing was done to improve them till modern times. The land is twice as productive as any ordinary Irrigated land, and is the costliest farmland in China, much of it being worth $350 an acre.
THE roads through the great river valleys and between the mountain ranges, which have kept China in constant touch with her vast dependencies in the west and north, are the same thoroughfares on which the Mongolian and Tartar invaders traveled when they made their conquests of the Chinese. They overspread North China only to be gradually absorbed in the people whose land they had invaded. The old Chinese physical type is as persistent as Chinese usages and philosophy. It predominates in the mixed offspring of Europeans and Chinese to-day. The mountains of the south kept the Invaders from overrunning that part of China, and thus It happens that the natives of South China are of purer Chinese type and the so-called Cantonese dialect is undoubtedly a survival of the ancient language of the country.
China is the mother or stepmother of all these races on the mainland of southeast Asia. If not directly allied to them In blood, her civilization is the basis of their social fabric. The Tonkinese are the immediate descendants of Chinese immigrants from Kwangsi and Kwangtung. but owing to intermarriage with the aboriginal Shans and immigrant Malays, they lack the persistent energy of the Chinese, whose customs and methods they have, however, religiously followed. Siam Is the most western co'intry' whose Institutions are rooted in Chinese civilization, and today the Siamese are content, like the people of other Asian lands to which the Chinese have emigrated In large numbers, to let the Chinese do all the hard work of the cities and even supplant them In the agricultural development of the country. The Koreans derived their civilization from China from the seventh to the twelfth century, when the great empire was at the zenith of its culture; but they have lagged behind in the race, for their rich valleys, seldom fertilized and never
Irrigated, provide all the necessities of life without arduous toll, and this fact, emphasized by a climate without extremes, seems to have made the people so easygoing and apathetic that aU ambition and desire for progress have died out among them.

MR. LITTLE indorses the interesting iheory of some ethnologists that theie Is an influential Btraln of Polynesian blood in the Japanese. Their forefathers are supposed to have migrated many ages ago from inland Asia, somewhere near the Altai Mountains, and Kiushiu, the most southern of the large islands, seems to have been the part of old Japan earliest settled from the mainland of Asia- But many of their customs, the style of their dwellings, their national dances, and the freedom of intercourse betweon the sexes presup^ poses, in Mr. Little’s opinion, an Infusion of outside, probably Polynesian as well as Malayan, blood.
We have here a book that is intended, not merely for British consumption for it has no infusion of politics, nor the Insistence upon liritish needs and interests that has been conspicuous in some of Mr Little’s writings. It is an admirable summary of the geography and peoples of the Far East, interesting to read^ valuable for reference, and with an abundance of excellent maps that will well repay study.
