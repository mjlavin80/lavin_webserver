EDENJNDIA (Dillingham) is a word of obvious derivation, and serves as the title of a book about an undiscovered Arcadia. The author .fs J. P. Armour,, and his imagination, if bold, is rather heavy and lumbering in its gait. The story is one of a young man, who, after being Jilted by a- heartless fiancfie because he was ho longer rich, went to sleep in a balloon which a breeze-loving relative kept tethered on liis front lawn. The ropes broke and a tempest- bore the sleeper far over seas to a place unknown to geographers and imperialists—a place called Edenlndia. Th£re the young man was found In the King’s garden, became an officer of State, and met the King's daughter. Thus the author has an opportunity to enlarge upon the imaginary institutions and customs of his imaginary
country, and to tell how on the strength of the book of lyrics in his -pocket the hero won In Edenlndia the name of a wonderful poet. There are further adventures in the airship, and a triumphant return to America with a royal wife and .a ducal title.
