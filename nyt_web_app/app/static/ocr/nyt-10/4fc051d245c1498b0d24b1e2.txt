T-HE study of how to teach—pedagogy, is the technical word used to-day— j	is very serious. One who aims to
become a ** teacher of youth " ought to be “ called/' and speedily to get over any youthful frivolity. It is owing to the intense seriousness of modern teachers that we have so many fads and funny things in education—the suggestion that public school children be taught photography, the giving of ** nature lessons/' and the insistence that modeling in clay is of more value to the child of the slums than the three Rs. The modern teacher is ! somewhat like the pupil of Socrates—as described by Aristophanes.
Mr, Paul Monroe of the Teachers College has put forth a very solid book on | the history of education. He begins with I the barbarian. “ Primitive peoples, how-I ever diverse they may be in many respects, possess one tundamental bond of similarity. It Is that interpretation o£
: their environment which we call animIsm* Back of every material existence or phenomenal reality a. savage posits an immaterial power, a spiritual entity, a
*	double * which controls the material object, explains its being and Its resistance to the will of man, and makes it an abode of a consciousness no different In kind from the consciousness which he himself possesses." The nature of education among primitive man, according to Mr. . Monroe, was determined by this " dominant social characteristic.” Mr. Thompson Seion, we think, holds that it was determined by the need of eating and keeping warm.
But we will follow Mr. Monroe. The, education of primitive man consisted then in the training necessary to get his food and clothing, and in the procedure necessary to placate the doubles that preside over material things. The training of civilize r>.n_n is at the basis the same as tha* of his predecessor. The next step Is the development of the priesthood; ** the training of the multitude yet consists in indicating the * What to do * and the * How to do it/ while in that of the priesthood itself is added the
*	Why it should be done/ This inquiry
into the meaning of these ceremonials and the attempt at a further interpretation of doctrines beyond that given to the multitude, gives rise to the first real processes of Instruction and the fir3t rco* educational institution.”	.
Having successfully founded that, Mr. Monroe leads us on soberly to China and Greece and Rome. In China education j was recapitulation—as it is now in Mo: hammcdan countries; in Greece it was ** a i progressive adjustment”; in Rome it was : practical training. Then we get down to i our era, and look at education during the Middle Ages, when Mr. Monroe describes it as a- discipline; under the Renaissance came "Humanistic Education”; under the Reformation the religious conception of education was debated; and so. past realtistic education, Mr. Monroe brings us 1 down to consider the psychological, the j scientific, and the sociological tendencies | of education, and the present “ eclectic tendency/'
Mr. Monroe Is modest. In spite of the fact that his book contains nearly S00 pages, he describes it in title and prcfaco as merely a ** textbook in the history of education." For the average student of pedagogy, however, we think it will suffice; for the outsider—and persons not devoted to the exploitation of the art of teaching are surely “ rank outsiders ”
nowadays—it may even be too full. It has been prepared with full loyalty to the pedagogic idea, which in its present development is apparently expressed by the words "Study what you. teach, never mind whom you teach/*
