In coming to the study of Japanese art we must remember that we are entering a ptrange world, where life and language, and even modes of thought, run on other lines than ours. When Japan, only fifty years ago, was thrown open to the Western nations. In our ignorance and folly wo were at first inclined to treat the Japanese as a barbaric people. But never was there a greater misiakc. For the truth is that their civilization is not only older than ours, but in some respects has advanced much further thnn we have ever attained. In an aesthetic sense, the people of Japan are cultured to a degree far beyond our Western standards; their arts are full of the beauties which are too subtle, too refined, for our comprchcn-eion.
—With this paragraph Stewart Dick opens his study of the ** Arts and Crafts of Old Japan,’* which A. C. McClure & Co.
; of Chicago are publishing In The World of Art Series. Mr. Dick believes—in fact he makes the statement—that contact with Western ideas and Western methods *' seemed to give the deathblow to
Japanese art." The new work, in metal, in carving, and in lacquer, he says, is vastly inferior to the old, and aniline dyes have taken the place of the “ soft harmonies " of the color prints.
The book treats of Japanese painting, color painting, sculpture, and carving, metal work, keramics, lacquer, and landscape gardening and the arrangement of flowers. Illustrations of specimens of nil these arts and crafts have been provided.
