THE HUMORISTS.
New Comic Books by Am-ericaii Writers—A Collection of Pictures by John Leech.
IIK flood of books fresh from tho presses includes many of humorous jnirpose to wliH*h we can give only a passing gUmcr. One of the :n*knowl-odged American humorists of the prt*s*.-nt hour is Judge Henry A. Shute, a Massachusetts jurist who devoted many useful years to the grave pursuits of the law before his innate sense of fun took possession of him.
** The Diary of a Real Roy ’’ made such a prodigious lilt that sequels were inevitable. Judge Shute, we believe, clings to the fable that Plupy of Exeter, New Hampshire, was a real boy. his very self, in fact, and that the droll diary was discovered in the miscellaneous accumulations of a garret, even as Chatterton discovered the wonderful writings of an imaginary monk among ihe neglected archives of his native Bristol. Plupy Is certainly a buoyant, vital personality, and he wears well.
He makes his reappearance now in a small volume entitled “ Letters to Beany and the Love Letters of Plupy Shute/’ (Boston, the Everett Press.) The letters axe of the same extraordinary literary and orthographical quality as the diary and relate to the same sort of boyish jovs and sorrows. ,J Fites ” and “ frute cake ” and ** goin* in swiming" are the burden of many of them, when the theme is not small boys’ love. As a correspondent. Plupy mingles school-taught formality with the freedom of exuberant childhood. " Tours very respectively ” he
•	signs his letters sometimes, even when the missive deals exclusively with a fite" he had stimulated between two brothers sick with the ** chicking pocks, , the cause being a dispute as to which had the most “ speckles."

A LESS grotesque but equally inspiriting account of the joys and miseries, the diversions and penalties of a small boy’s existence in an American country town may be found in “ "When Tou Were a Boy,’’ by Edwin L. Sabin, which is graphically and sympathetically illustrated by Frederic Dorr Steele. The various chapters in this have already appeared in The Century Magazine and, other periodicals. Mr. Sabin’s memories of boyhood are vivid and delightful, and ,always wholesome, and his humor is occasionally heightened by contrast with a touch of genuine pathos. He writes of the match ball game, the pet dog, the influence of the circus, of fishing and swimming, of running away from home for freedom and revenge, and returning quickly before the folks have missed you. The children's party, the Sunday school picnic, and bob-sled coasting down Middleton’s Hill in Winter are among his subjects. His boys are quite as “ real ’* as Judge Shute’s and a trifle less coarse. The reflections of a man of mature years run between the lines.
M Peck's Bad Boy ” has become a Western American classic. Of humble and ob-scure*origin, he has survived many a fictitious juvenile hero, more artistically conceived, and introduced to the world tinder more distinguished auspices. He does not grow old, he does not develop Intellectually. He is still an imp of mischief. “ Peck’s Bad Boy and His Pa,*’
*' Peck’s Uncle Ike,” ** How Peck Put Down the Rebellion," and the many other Peck books, are now succeeded by ** Peck’s Bad Boy Abroad,” which is copiously and vigorously illustrated, (Chicago: Thompson & Thomas.) The Bad Boy and his “ Dad ” are now travelers, having said au revoir to the grocery-mar.. They visit Mount Vernon and the Waldorf-Astoria, cross the Atlantic, en-4 counter King Edward see things in Paris, climb glaciers, " do *’ Venice and Naples, hobnob with Sultan and Czar.

CHILDHOOD and youth, it will be seen, are getting a large share of humorous attention this season. Infancy Is the theme of Fanny Y. Cory, one of the drollest and cleverest of our humorous artists, who provides the pictures for ” Pleasant Tragedies of Childhood*’* which also contains verses by Burges Johnson,' (Harper.) This* is an exceedingly attractive picture book, all the illustrations being full-page plates, handsomely executed. vThey view the perplexities of motherhood (and fatherhood) from a sage infantile standpoint, and reveal an intimate knowledge of nursery politics.	-
** Motor Goose Rhymes for Motor Ganders ** is a little book of nonsense "verse qngraved on the same pages with grotesque pictures. . It may be ‘said of the artist, . as Josh Billings once said - of Chaucer, that his heart is in the right
place, but he cannot spel." Herman Lee Meader is the name of the author of tho jingles, some of which are as poor as the author modestly surmises they may be. “ Pal.** whoever he is. did the picture work. The Grafton Press publishes the book, anti here is a sample of the best it contains:
Lit Lie Jaclr Horner Would dash ’round a corner.
And never would slow up a bit^,
He’d not even warn	.
With a toot of his horn The rabble and dogs that he hit.
“ Uncle Bub; His Reflections," by Laura Fitzhugh Preston, is another Grafton Press book. It is made up of contributions to newspapers and periodicals, and is written -in approved darky dialect. I ncle Boh is both sage and humorist, witii a strong religious tendency.
“ Tales of the Road," by Charles N. Orewdson (Chicago, Thompson & Thomas) is a collection of commercial travelers*
3*arns. full of the modern -h uni or of barter and sale, and something more, for they involve a sort of philosophy of salesmanship. The book is well illustrated.

ANEW collection of the drawings of the inimitable John Leech appears in a neat oblong volume entitled ** Pictures of Life and Character." (Putnam.) There is an explanatory preface, treating of Leech’k merit as an artist, and the influence he exerted through his famous 'association with Punch. Some of the pictures are of Leech's very best, and, of course, each carries its little legend and tells its own story. The humors of sporting life, the appetite of British schoolboys, the foibles of womankind, the terrors of the Channel crossing, th£, perils of horseback riding, the joys of domesticity, are among the subjects so happily treated by this student of humanity from the comic point of view. Here are many drawings long since famous, including that of the infant who discovers that the world is hollow and her doll stuffed w'ith sawdust, and that of the small Briton, who will “ arise as one man ’* in case of a French invasion. Briggs, the amateur sportsman, reappears in all his original glory. Not only are the best of Leech’s Punch pictures reproduced, but there are some of his capital
Handley Cross ’’ illustrations, too, and a few from other books.
