IN the preface to the first volume of his history of the sixth century A. D.,
** The Age of Justinian and Theodora,*' which the Macmillan Company publishes here, William Gordon Holmes sets forth his reason for its publication:
Although the ;igo of Justinian is tlit: most interesting and important in the whole series of the Byzantine annals, no comprehensive work has hitherto been devoted to the subject. The valuable and erudite *' Vita Justiniani " of Ludewig Is j more of a law book than of a biography,
! and less of a circumstantial history than I of either. The somewhat strange medley published by Isambert under the title ** Vie de Justinien ” is scarcely a complete chronology of the events, and might be called a manual of the sources rather than a history -of the times. Excellent accounts, however, of Justinian rire to be i^ound In some general histories of the ^Byzantine Empire as well as in several biographical dictionaries * *	* but any
student of the period would decide that it deserves to be treated at much greater length than has been devoted to it in any'' of these books. In the present work, the design has been to place before the reader not only a record of events, but a presentment of the people among whom and of the stage upon which those events occurred. I have also attempted .to correlate the aspects of the ancient* and the modern world in relation to science and progress.
In subsequent volumes the author will treat of the Persian wars, Carthage under the Homans, the building of St. Sophia, Home In the sixth century, the religion of the period, Roman law, literature and art, Justinian's last days, &c. Pull notes have been Inserted at the bottom of the pages.
