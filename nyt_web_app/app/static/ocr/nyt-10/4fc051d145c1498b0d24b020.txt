Perfect Rhymes.
, A’ctp York Times Saturday Review of Books:
While poetical license is understood to ; cover a multitude of irregularities in rhyme most of the Illustrations quoted in I H. L/s letter are so glaring as to* be Inexcusable. Still perhaps it may not be ! well to draw the line so very close, as in | sonic of the instances quoted. I cannot I imagine the '* delicate ear ’* forbidding the rhyming of ** storm ’* with " warm," “ fruits *’ with “ roots/’ “ eclipse ” with ** lips," and *' morns ” with “ warns.” These in my judgment are rhymes as perfect as we can make them.
