P ROF. ARCHIBALD MOW IS BOUTON of the New York L’ni varsity has prepared a volume of “ The Lincoln j j anti .Douglas Debates," together with 1 I Lincoln’s address at Cooper Institute, i j which Henry Holt & Co. will issue im- I mediately. Prof. Bouton has made the | ! selections for the sake of their “ indls-1 putable value ’* both as historical tlocu-j ments and as masterpieces of the art of J debate. " As a teacher of argumenta-| tion.'* he says, " he has felt the lack of available material illustrative of the thrust and parry of actual debate, and designs this volume to supply what is almost a total lack among edited specf-mens of argument."
Three speeches of the seven debates of
the campaign are printed entire—those
made at Freeport, Oalesburg. and AUon.
Their subject matter includes the essential issues of the campaign. The debate at Ottawa, bhe first of the series and one of those most familiar, has been omitted from the volume, because the editor believes it to be “ the least definite in its presentation of the essential issues.” The debates are prefaced by J Lincoln’s speech of June Hi, lHTpts, at Springfield. 111., with which he opened the campaign. and supplemented by the Cooper Institute address of February, two years later, " as Lincoln's ultimate and perfected statement of the anti-slavery argument.”
