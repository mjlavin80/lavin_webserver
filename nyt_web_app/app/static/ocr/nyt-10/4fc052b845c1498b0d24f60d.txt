TH'R volume before us. “ Wireless 1 Telegraphy: its History and Practice,” (McGraw Publishing Company,) aims to be—and seems to succeed In being—a practical treatise on wireless telegraphy so written as to be of use both to the expert in scientific matters and to the tyro who hns everything1 to learn. For the benefit of the latter the author, Mr* FredeHck Collins, has begun with a general explanation of the theory of etheric waves—an explanation which proceeds historically and considers the various scientific discoveries in this field as they occurred. Upon this foundation he builds, explains the nature of waves in general, of light waves, of electrical vibrations, and apparatus foi* producing them. He discusses electric discharges, the action of ultra violet rays, djrect anif” alternating current effects. Thus to electric oscillations and oscillators from that of Hertz to that or Marconi, Mr. Collins explains electrical “ capacity,” “ inductance,’* " resistance," describes the structure and effects of Induction colls and various types of ** intcrruptor."
He explains the workings of a variety of oscillating current generators and then passes to electric wave detectors—the best known to the public being the Marconi " coherer/’ so much talked of when wireless telegraphy began to be a practical thing. So much accomplished, you are ready to study Intelligently commercial wireless telegraphic apparatus In detail— transmitters, receptors, and all the elaborate machinery for transforming at one end powerful machine-made throbs into etheric vibrations, and, at the other, for transforming humanly indetectible etheric vibrations into audible mechanical clicks or substitutes therefor. This part, of course, includes descriptions of wireless stations on shore and on shipboard, and the various'methods of " syntonlzation V or " tuning ” together of the sending and receiving instrument. In addition there Is a chapter on wireless telephony.
