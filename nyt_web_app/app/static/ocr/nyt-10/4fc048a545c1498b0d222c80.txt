ROMANCE OF THE FRENCH ABBEYS.
By Ellzrubet±i W. Champney. Illustrated. 8vo. I*p. xxi-407. New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons. 53.	_
MRS. CHAMPNEY has added more to the abundant stores of romance she has found in the feudal and Renaissance periods. Around the abbeys in out-of-the-way nooks France there is an infinite deal upon which history has been engagingly embroidered. Tbe abbeys are falling Into ruin, or have been turned to secular uses; some have been razed. Only a few are preserved by Government or private care. He who would see the iuins of the abbeys, as Mrs. Champney warns us, must act quickly. Stories and legends hang about them plentifully, for the monasteries -were the centre of life* and culture in mediaeval times, and the author has had an abundance to choose from.
She tells fourteen stories, sometimes in her own words, sometimes in those of ancient chroniclers. Some are tragic, some are humorous, but all are picturesque and are told with ingenuity and with a certain fidelity to the atmotrphere and spirit of the times to which they relate. At the end there is a chapter, *' Abbey Pilgrimages," that conveys information for would-be pilgrims, either for the joy of wandering fn pleasant places or with the intention of serious research, where the typical and accessible French abbeys are to be found. There is an itinerary and a list of places, and also more legends. There is, finally, a list of authorities referred to. One of the most interesting features of the book is the great abundance of the excellent illustrations, mostly half-tone reproductions of photographs of abbeys, churches, and chateaus, ruined and whole, and of various specially significant architectural features. There are also many excellent photogravure reproductions of paintings that bear upon the legends and stories related. The architectural pictures give an attractive affirmation to the author's eloquent words about the beauty and charm of the build-lugs she mentions.	.
