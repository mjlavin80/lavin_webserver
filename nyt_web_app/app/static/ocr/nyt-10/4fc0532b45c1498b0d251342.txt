Do Not Be Misled by a Novel When You Went to Poison a Dog.
| New York Timea Saturday Review of Books:
LLAINS who are desirous of poisoning' the valuable dogs of their neighbors are strongly advised not to allow themselves to be misled by an Incident in the splendid new novel, ** The Trident and the Net-’* I can tesTify from experience dating back more than forty years that powdered glass is a completely innoxious substance for use with dogs, and that it is the only vermifuge worth considering for employment against taenia. I have used It on scores of dogs and never knew of any evil effect upon the dog- Youatt, the best authority on diseases of the dog, recommends its use and certifies to its harmlessness. It was from him that I first got the prescription* but I think the substance has been in use for centuries for this purpose.
The notion that powdered	or	dia-
mond dust will kill a man or other animal is a mere survival of the time when our ancestors were in a state of blue funk about mysterious poisonings; when every strange death was attributed to poison; when hundreds of innocent persons were legally murdered as the supposed authors of the deaths of persons who had died of diphtheria, Bright's disease, appendicitis, or* some other of the many diseases then unnamed. It may be true that powdered glass or diamond dust adminis^ tered continuously and in large doses would cause irritation enough to destroy the health of the subject tQ whom it had been administered, but why go to
the trouble of powdering glass, or the expense of procuring diamond dust, when common builders' sand would do, no doubt, just as well?	A.	P.
