E£-' PETRIE’S. third voIum&. i /of the history of Egypt .cot-: ers the period in the story of j that country from the nine-, teenth to the thirtieth dynasty, a . period of some thou- j sand years. It Is a curious booX as Its predecessors have been curious, and for the same reason- We have medal lie histories of various countries; Mr. Petrie’s book is a monumental history* actually as well as figuratively. He Bays in Mg preface:	“	There is. I* be-
lieve, no other country of which there is a complete index to every historical monument that Is known, with a translation or abstract of every historical text.*' It is from these monuments that Mr. Petrie hn^t made up his history, which necessarily is skeleton!c. For this reason, li6e the earlier volumes, the effect of this third volume is somewhat curious. The remaining volumes of the history, to be prepared by Prof. Mahaffy, Mr. J. G. Milne, and Mr. Stanley Lane-Poole, are much more likely to approach the usual form of historical work.
NOT the least interesting part of Mr. Petrie’s book is his preface, wherein
■	he speaks of the chronology of
I	Egyptian events. On this subject he
|	says:
I The greatest care has been taken to get |	all the data together; and, in some parts,
|	as the twenty-second dynasty, a very dif-
ferent face is put on the history by the fresh material /here stated. Broadly, there is not so much as ten years to spare anywhere in this volume. The fixed amounts occupy the whole period very closely, and it is really difficult to suppose that they really come together without more unascertained intervals.
Is it flippant to say that this Is petrified English? The author means that the chronology of his book is everywhere correct within ten years, and that it is wonderful that the Egyptian dates can be reduced to terms of our chronology so closely. It certainly is wonderful; Mr. | Petrie gives us the dates of the nineteenth ' dynasty—that in which the Exodus oc- I curred—as B. C. 1328 and B. C. 1202; just as a modem historian might say that the House of Hanover ruled in Great Britain from 1714 to 1901.

EACH dynasty is treated in a separate chapter of the volume before us. Even the great Kings require but little fuller treatment than the lesser ones; for Mr. Petrie indulges in no descriptive writing, but contents himself with retelling what the monuments tell. His labor was not in writing the history, but in collecting material to write about. At the beginning of the part of the story devoted to each King Mr. Petrie gives the monarch's cipher or hieroglyphic, then the location of his tomb and coffin, a list, longer or shorter, as the case may be, of
I	monuments and inscriptions relating or referring to him and his family; and then a list of the officials of the reign. So complete has been his search over Egypt that Mr. Petrie can name some of the very Cabinet officers of Sety L, who died 1300 B. C. Pasar was his vizier, Panabu his chief archer, Huy-Shera his scribe of gold. Ram ess u n. has a list of over 200 officials following his story.
It is unexpected to find no mention of the Exodus. On April 27, B. C. 1&29, Merenptah defeated the Libyans, and in a song of triumph for this victory occur , these words:	" Devastated is Tehenu,
[Libya] * * * Kanaan is seized with every evil • * • the people of Israel is laid waste—their crops are not, Kharu [Palestine] has become as a widow by Egypt.” This, says Mr. Petrie, is the only mention of the name Israel on any monument; " it is clearly outside of our literary information, whieh has led to the belief that there were no Israelites in Palestine between the going into Egypt [of Jacob and his family] and the entry at Jericho, [after the Exodus.”] He notes further that the records show that the Egyptians were welcoming more Semitic tribes only a few years before the Exodus.” Mr. Petrie is apparently divided in his allegiance. The Bible says that the Egyptians treated the Jews cruelly, and were forced finally to let them depart; but the records under his eyes show anything but that—which shall we believe?
The history comes down to B. C. 342, when the last native king of Egypt, Nekhtnebf, fled before the Persians. With his abdication the old Egypt departed forever, which " had led the civilization of the Mediterranean for all its youth of five thousand years or more.”
