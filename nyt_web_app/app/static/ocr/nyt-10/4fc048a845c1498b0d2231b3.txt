EASTERN CALIPHATE,
A Description of "Western Central Asia During the European Dark Ages.*
fjODERN research is doing as much for the Arabs of the so-callr-d Dark Agcs as it has done for the people of Vr of the Chaldees. For what it has done for Abram and his forefathers and friends, one need merely turn to Dr. Fas’ce's edition of Genesis; for what it is doing for the Arabs of a thousand years ago. one should read Mr. G. Le Strange’s “ I^nds of the Eastern Caliphate.” The volume deals with Mesopotamia. Persia, and Central Asia, from a*x>ut 650 to 1400 A D. Those were the Dark Ages of Europe; in the Caliphate they were the Golden Age of the Arabs. Mr. Le Strange’s book is nominally a geography, but it is more than that—it Is a fairly close description of Western Central Asia during the time of its greatest prosperity, with especial reference, of course, to the geography of the country
ARAB writers wlio lived between SG4 and 1000 A. D. afford the material which Mr. Lo Strange has worked into his book and into an earlier volume on the histon' of Bagdad. Twenty-four such writers are named by our author. His plan is that followed by many of them—to describe briefly the Caliphate as a whole, giving (in words as well as by an outline map) the relative positions of the provinces oomposing it, and then he describes at pomo length those provinces separately. Most important of them was Irak, the Babylonia of earlier times, the chief city of which, as well as the capital of the I'aliphate. was Baghdad, the jclty of Haroun al-Haschid. Aaron tho Orthodox. From Baghdad in every direction ran highways, leading to the uttermost liarts of the Caliphate; this road system Is described by contemporaries, and with Mr. Le Strange's help it becomes almost aii ’well known to us as that of our own country a century ago. or even less. The most famous of the roads, and Mr. Le Strange says the best described, was the great Khurasan Hoad, which connected the capital with the frontier towns on the borders of China. " Leaving East Baghdad by the Khurasan gate, it went across the plain to Hulwan:” that might be a road of to-day, instead of one laid out more than twelve centuries ago. The accurate knowledge we have of the roads Is due <o four Road Books, one of them by the Postmnstef-bf an important province, another by a revenue accountant. These give the distances and names of the various stages, and describe the country through which the roads run.

IRAK, besides its roads, had a superb irrigation system, which the Arabs acquired with the country at the conquest. The surplus water of the Euphrates was carried to the Tigris and the country east of the latter river was watered by canals brought down from the mountains, and by loop canals, which left and returned to the Tigris. Above Irak was the Province of Ja^lrah, wherein were the ruins of Nineveh, Mosul, the chief city, was made famous by Mr. Lay-ard years ago in his account Of his explorations among the ruins. Seven hundred years ago Mosul was a flourishing city, with three ** Friday Mosques,” a hospital, colleges and schools, Christian convents, and in the suburbs many small" mosques, hosteiries, and baths. Crossing the Tigris by a bridge of boats one reached Ninaway. (Nineveh,> about a mile from which was a healing spring named for the prophot Tunis or Jonah, and there was se^n the Tree of the Gourd, planted by Jonah himself. Bartalla, north of Mosul, was a town inhabited chiefly by market gardeners, most of whom were Christians.
Mcrv, the chief town of Khurasan, before the Mongol invasion was noted for its libraries. Tho Aziziyah, with more than 12,0»«0 volumes, and the Kamaliyalv were in the Great Mosque; there were two large private libraries, another founded by the Samanids, one in the Khatuniyah College, and another; and " finally and especially there was the Du-mayriyah Library in one of the Lervish convents, containing only i!00 volumes.1’ but ench of those was unique. The Mongols in 11TJ0 A. D. destroyed them all. and made Merv what it still Is, a desert oasis. Khurasan Province is famous for its Veiled Prophet. Mukanna, whose revolt in the eighth century caused SO much trouble to the Caliphs. He came from the Province of SughO, however, and from a well in the City of Nakhshab in that province he used to cause the moon to ri^e every night to the wonder of all behold rs, whose confidence in him was Increas.-d by the repetition of the miracle. In Jibal Province was the sLrong-hold of Hasan Sabah, the Old Man of the Mountain.^, which he and hir successors held for 17u .wars—A. D. HHK> to 12S0.

After this place, Alamut, had been taken, the other hundred castles -of the-old man. and his assassins were quickly captured and destroyed.
MR. LE STRANGE S volume is full of allusions to these and other tales of the Eajst. It docs not purport to be a history of the Caliphate—merely a geography; so none of the' stories is told at length. But the book is extremely suggestive and provocative of thought; it tells such tales as it has to tell in a.n interesting way, and throws a strong side light on the civilization of the Arab “ misbelievers ” at a time when^Christian Europe was groveling In outer darkness.
