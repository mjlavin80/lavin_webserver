rWO appropriate additions to TjCs Classiques Frangais, edited by H. D. O'Connor, have just come to hand {Feuillet’s •* Jeune Homme Pauvre,” and Constant’s ** Adolphe." (Putnam. 51 net per volume.) These little long lGmos., exquisitely bound in full pliable leather with ornate gold stamping, are admirable in editing- and as pieces of the bookmaker’s art. Feuillet’s familiar story has for frontispiece a photogravure of the author with autograph; Constant’s work is favored in the same way: both have daintily designed rubricated title-pages. Augustin Filon who furnishes an introduction for the first tells of his meeting with Feuillct in 1S6.S, and incidentally furnishes an interesting foot-note to the regime of letters that occupied the closing years of the Second Empire, and fought with its books the never-ending battle between realism and romanticism. As an achievement in the latter category Le Roman d'un Jeune Homme Pauvre '* is “ rien de plus et rien de moins.” ■
Paul Bourget, who edits Constant, regards " Adolphc ” as the most passionate and living literary tnonumfcnt of the nineteenth century. There are no qualifying, limiting clauses in the superlatives uttered by this sole survivor in France of classico-scientific criticism, and so the fact that his essay on " Adolphe *' contains impressions Instead of dicta is some-tvliat disconcerting. Of the series in general, it may be sard that for persons who wish to read the French language in all its simplicity and tranquil beauty, free from the literary argot of the boulevards, the Quartier, Montmartre, and even of the Academy itself, and in a thoroughly appropriate setting, these little volumes leave little to be aesired.
