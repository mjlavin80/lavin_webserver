Its achievement is the net result of c.ussion, and popular action crystallized into law. It is the common sense of the people registered in the event.

There will be a revolutionary party. • * * There will be a party which is ne^^r conservative nor revolutionary, but radical as compared with conservatism, and evolutionary as cpmpared with the spirit of revolution. And it is this latter party which will surely prevail in the near future, leading the nation through a course of scientific preparation for a higher expression of human brotherhood in societv and government, because it Is this partv which will be the best ra-terpreter of contemporaneous events.
