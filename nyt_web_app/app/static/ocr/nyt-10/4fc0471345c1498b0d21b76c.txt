AT the Sign of the Jack-o’-Lantern ” is the alluring title under whltfb Myrtle Reed includes a curious mixture of solemn moral lessons, ponderous dissertations on the pursuit of literature as a profession, and a main theme which is the broadest kind of farce. She works these three seemingly incompatible elements fuirly well together, but it Is quite certain that it will be the exceptional reader who will not be inclined to skip the serious parts of the book in order to arrive more speedily at the amusing events which went on at the Jack-o’-l„antern.‘’ In these events, he it said. probat>flit3' and reason take absolutely no part, but absurdity is added to absurdity and impossibility to impossibility after a fashion more characteristic of comic opera than anything else, and tin* result is just about as satisfying mental food. However, Miss Reed is mistress of a delicacy of thought and style which lends itself grate! uily to the light and airy exaggeration of human foibles, and most of her funrnaking is very provocative of that quiet kind of chuckling on the reader’s p*irt which is sure proof of a pretty humor in the writer. Such touches as the naming of a cow Maud because she insisted upon going into the garden may not b^j a mark of the most intellectual kind of wit, but it savors so strongly of the home variety as to be immensely appealing to th'* risibilities.
".At tile Sign of the Jadi-o'-Lantern ” is partly a studv in the troublous processes by which the honeyihhkms of inexperienced young couples gradually mergr into the quietudes of congenial married life and partly a frankly farcical tale of the adventures that befell a New York newspapti man and his bride when they tried to live in a ijm er »,Id luirloom of a house bequeathed to tli' iii by an eccentric uncle.

But newspaper men who have abandoned journalism for " literature " and married on the sirenmri (jf ;in heirloom in Uic shiijK.* of a furnMnd house and a capital of JS-’iOT.u:; cannot be too critical in the matter of abodes, and it was finally decided that th- Jack o’ Santera would be just the place in which to write Harlan's first book—" s<* quiet and restful," said Dorothy. Bui hardly had the first page been written when the true inwardness of I’ncle K'M tie^i-t‘s gift beg.i,i to appear. The rel.iti\v--. did nut small to lot a little thinic hke rliMii^ of ownership keep them from their annual visit to their own particular “ wings," and they arrived singly ;ind in groups of var\ing numbers. One can i;:-,.i^ine the possibilities for deveh*pmen;s in ;ch materials. but it is better to lei the author imagine fr^r one and lazily enjoy her clever flights of fancy. The scene in the garden at midnight, with the relatives assembled to dig for the buried treasure, is certainly funny enough to repay one for reading the book, but there are many other scenes almost as mirth-provoking. While looked at in one way, the very serious view of his new profes>ion taken by Mr. Carr is far and away the funniest tiling in the book. We arc not quite sure, though, that Miss Heed meant It that way.
