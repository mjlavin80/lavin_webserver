Cleopatrii’s Deatls
iVctc York Times Saittrilay Review of Bnnk<s:
Historians seem In a quund'iry as to the manner of Cleopatra's death. It is certain, however, that after fourteen years of consuming and sensual passion her death must have .been violent and" tragic. l*ride must have been us powerful motive, for at no time duripg her life dfd she show a particle of sjiamo. Jacob Abbot shows a wiJc* difference In his histories of Julius Caesar and CieopaLra. In his history of Julius Caesar. Pago -111, (■Harper, IS-!!).) he says:	“ Hhe Jaid the
poisonous reptile on her nakc-d urm and tiled immediately of the bite which It inflicted.”
On this same page he declares that It was at a great bamiuez inat her death occurred. Then, immediately afterward, in his history of Cleopatra, Page olG-17, (Imrpor, ISTil,) he declares: “Cleopatra was alone with her two waiting women. On entering the room she was lying dead on a couch. They looked about the room, but no poison or weapons were to be round. They examined the body with great care, but no marks of any bite or sting could be found except two slight and scarccly discernible puncturcs on the arm.” -
Lord. In his " Beacon Lights of History," says:	“ She destroyed herself not
probably by the bite of asps, as is the popular opinion, but by some potent and subtle poison.” (Vol. 5, Pago 4r>.) Plutarch says: “ Cleopatra locked herself In her monument and sent a letter to Caesar. Caesar suspected something had happened and sent messengers at full speed. On opening the doors they found Cleoputrti stone dead, but what really took place is. known to 110 one. The asp was not seen within the monument, nor was there so much as a spot found upon her body." *
Merivale says: “Cleopatra retired to her monument and-»was found dead the next morning. Cause unknown.” Siddell:
“ The manner of her death was never ascertained."
In Abbott’s M History of Caesar ’/ he stales it was an asp, and Immediately afterward, in his history of Cleopatra, snys that ** the means and manner of her death are an impenetrable mystery.” Judging from the various quotations I ha\o given the manner of Cleopatra’s death must be, as he states in -her history, an impenetrable mystery, and not, as he states in Caesar's history, the bite of an asp. It is up to Andrew Lang to add an addition to his historical mysteries.	LAWRENCE COKTRFGHT.
