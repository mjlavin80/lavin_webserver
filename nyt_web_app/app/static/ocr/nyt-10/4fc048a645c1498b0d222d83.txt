THE FORD ” is not a commonplacc novel. It displays close observation and an unusual knowledge of life, and tells its story in excellent style, terse and graceful. The characters are drawn -with vigor, and altogether the book is quit* out of the ordinary in both iLs plot and its workmanship.
While it is interesting, however, it fails to compel interest. It is too skippable for so well conceived and well ^written a tale. The hero is ralher wooden, in spite of his many fine qualities; all our admiration is perforce given to the Sir Launcelot of the novel, the gravest fault of which is a painfully pervasive moral miasma. The plain word with which old Mrs. Carlyle characterized the w*.men of Wilhelm Meister is as well merited by the ladles of " The Ford," while as for the men—even the impeccable Kalph regards a woman’s weakness ay a man’s opportunity; and the rest—well, the Iuss said about them the bet ter. The book is not salacious,^ not crutic: it means to be a straightforward love story*, but it does ** leave a bad taste in one's mouth," and is likely to bring a not unfroqut-nt biush to the check of the middle aged!
It holds many just views forcibly put, Paul Gledd,iyne Is the protagonist of the Ktoiy, ** a mixture of a saint and a black' guard. * * * always In love with some one eises wife."’ Since his vices have left him before he appears on the stage, we should find him altogether admirable but for the frank revelation or a shameful earlier career. His ripe find gentle wisdom, his unselfishness, his targe tolerance, are all singularly attractive. ,We think ill of the author for mingling so much of “ the blackguard " with traits so rare and fine, as well as for permitting us but a grudging admiration for a book of real literary charm and clear intelligence.
