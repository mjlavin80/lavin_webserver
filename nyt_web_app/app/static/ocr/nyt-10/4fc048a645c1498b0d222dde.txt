A Chinaman's "Views on the Status of Railroading: in China.
Ncto Torfc Timrs Saturday Review of Books:
S not Mr. Adams mistaken in stating -that the Hankow-Canton Railroad is a concession held by Americans, in his review of Archibald Little’s book, in your issue of Oct. 21? Last Summer this concession was, if I recall rightly, disposed of to the Chinese.
Let me ask of you to publish a short abstract on tins question from the Chinese standpoint. The inclosed is an abstract of a paper read by Mr. Wang before the Economic Section of the American Association for the Advancement of Science at Philadelphia, as published in Science, March 24. 1SI03.

llnclusure.J THE PRESENT STATUS OF RAILROADING IN CHINA. Chuns Hul Wang, Vale University Law School.	.
The present method of railroading in China constitutes one of the prime factors in the shaping of the future destiny of that country* While other countries are now" lined with networks of railways, we find tha- in China the * iron road ’ has not yet become a household word. Foreign observers who have but a superficial view of the subject do not hesitate to attribute the cause of this to the superstition, ignorance, prejudice, and what not of the Chinese people, fn my opinion there are two fundamental causes back or this, the one financial and the other political. If we "hear in mind that the construction of even* mile of railroad costs upward of $10,000, we can well imagine the financial difficulties with which we are confronted in the construction of a complete system of railroads. Moreover, the heavy indemnities and exactions which have been wrnng from us by the foreign powers at different periods since the opium war of 1M1 up to the Boxer uprising of litOO have almost exhausted our resources, and have consequently increased the difficulties of our problem. Again, railroading is more than a mere economic undertaking; it has political as well as strategic importance. The main objection which has been urged by the high officials against the adoption of railroads is that as long as China is not strong enough to defend herself against'foreign aggressions, the presence of rail wavs would be a constant menace to the safety of the country. If we read the Chinese State papers on the subject we shall notice that the problem has been somewhat overestimated in its political and strategic importance, and underestimated in its economic and commercial aspects.	.	„	.	__
To Li Hung Chang is usually given the credit for the construction of the first permanent railway in China in connection with the lviping coal mines, eighty-four miles northeast of Tien-Tsin; but the credit is justly due to a subordinate official, Mr. Tong King Shing, the pioneer of the introduction of modern improvements into China.	*
After the Chino-Japanese war of ISM the idea of constructing railroads exclusively with Chinese capital was abandoned as being impracticable, and in March of that year an imperial edict was issued encouraging the constructipn of railroads, and in October an official of high rank, Sheng Sun Hawai, was appointed Director General of Railroads, with full power to raise foreign loans. This was the beginning of <the period of ** concessions."
Within the past few years “ railroad concessions " covering about 3.000 miles of railway lines have been granted to different syndicates, the largest of which is the Belgian. These “ concessions ** provide that the ownership in the railways ultimately reverts to the Chinese Government. Concessions are really contracts between the native company of Chinese railways and the foreign syndicates.
