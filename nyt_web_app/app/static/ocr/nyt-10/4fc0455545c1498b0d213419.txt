A Good Translation of the 'Works ■ of the Satirist, of Samosata.:;:
BOUT the most modern oC Greek writers was Lucian of Samosata^not tlic saint, but the satirist. He ought really to have written in English; as it is, he endures translation very easily. The sea-change from Greek to English docs not affect him, 'tls his Attic saJt that keeps him as sweet as when the first edition of his works came out, seventeen centuries or so ago. Emerson declared sententiously that one ought to read foreign books only in English translations. This was easy to say, but certainly It is good advice in the case of Lucian as translated by H. W. Fowler and F. G. Fowler. Their work might be original, so far as its ease and v'vacity are concerned; the reader forgets that he is reading dialogues and essays written seventeen hundred years ago. There is liUle in Lu.:ian’s -subjects to remind one of tha centuries that have passed since they were discussed by him; and there is nothing in ihe new English version to suggest that Lucian wrote in anything but good modern English.
Lucian was a Syrian by birth; he learned to speak almost pure Attic Greek; taught rhetoric In Grcece, Italy, and Gaul, and then lived in Antioch and In Atlens, winding up his career in a well-paid legal post in Egypt. He was a jester-a good-natured forerunner of Dean Swift, who certainly got the suggestion of his ’* Gulliver's Travels " from Lucian’s " True History.” i!ut Swift Is not the only one to be influenced by the Greek author; within a week a newspaper of this city printed an editorial in dialogue suggested—possibly quite without the writer's knowledge—by Luciai.'s dialogues. For Lucian Is as modern as Horace; his essay on the art of writing history might have come out in any recent review, and is entirely applicable to-day. The sneers it the persons who hurry into historical writing might have been written after reading a list of books on the Spanish war by the heroes who took part in it—vicariously and otherwise. Hfs dialogues of the god3, of the dead, of the hetairae, are the models for dialogues of to-day, in style, wit, and " smartness.” St. Paul quoted from Menander; a good many saints and sinners are pupils of Lucian, we Lhink.
Ordinarily a translator is but a name; tut this translation of Lucian is so excellent that ope wants more than the names of those who have made It. j ” H. W. Fowler and F. G. Fowler,” says : the title page. But who are they? Are 1 they Oxford men—or are they Oxford women7 We should not be surprised if they were women. The translation has a femininity about It—is dainty as well as accurate and finished. The fad that certain parts of Lucian's writings are omitted " by way of expurgation ” Is evidence that the translators are women, for in his desire for " completeness ” the ordinary male translator would leave out nothing, least of all what called for expurgation. In either case, however, this Fowler translation is a work of high art, for which its authors are to be thanked.
