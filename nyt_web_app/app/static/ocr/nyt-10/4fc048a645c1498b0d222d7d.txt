HURSDAY of this week was the three hundredth anni-^	versary of the birth in
"*	Cheapside, London, of the
famous writer and wise physician Sir Thomas Browne. It is probably true, as one of the London literary journals suggests, that the year 1905 has been, thus far, rather too prolific of	literary anniversaries and
their celebrations. Too much of this sort of thing is not likely to increase the multitude's reverence for literature. But there are many English writers of comparative worth whom we could afford to forget rather tiian Sir Thomas Browne. There was a celebration Thursday in old Norwich, where Browne dwelt and wrote and practiced medicine full forty years. A bronze statue was unveiled, and Lord Avebury, appropriately both a man of letters and student of nature, delivered an address. Sir Thomas Browne was extolled by Coleridge and greatly admired by Charles Lamb. He was a curious product of his age, a strange combination of wisdom and liberality, narrowness and superstition. His “ Religio Medici ” is a book the critics of literature have found it hard to classify and analyze. Humorist, idealist, and philosopher Browne was, with a strong infusion of the poet, which shows itself not so much in his verse as in some of his prose, certain chapters of “ Urn Burial," for instance. His books are still excellent company. One may read the “ Heligio Medici ” and the " Vulgar Errors ” with delight for the charm of the rich personality that shines through them, for tie light they throw on the development of the human intellect in the seventeenth century. A new life of Sir Thomas Browne, by Edmund Gosse, appears in the English Men of Letters Series.
WE SHALL leave to persons with a keener taste for statistical information the task of computing just how far the works of fiction by American authors outnumber those by English authors in the publishers’ lists this Fall. Only a short time ago it was a cause for regret that the native novelist had no chance. The publishers neglected him and exported their fiction, while the reading public uttered no rebuke. But all that is changed now. The American story tellers dominate in the American lists. If the reader of fiction In this country sometimes reflects that the average of merit in the English novels within his reach is perceptibly higher than in those of native origin, he must remember that the American publishers now are using much more discrimination than they formerly used in the selection of English novels. Of those we get only the best, and, say, the second best. The time has not come when the number of new English novels circulated in the United States in any given season is no larger than the number of new American novels circulated at the same time in London; but that time is coming. An interesting and significant article on current American novels, taking ten of merely average merit as its theme, will
DR. EDWARD STANWOOD’S “ Life of James Gillespie Blaine ” comes from the house of Houghton, Mifflin & Co. The biographer is convinced that ** no man who has borne a conspicuous part in the political history of the United States has had a personality more interesting.” He credits his subject with a ** keen, active mind, well trained by early education and ripened by long experience,” as well as ** a strong and comprehensive grasp of public questions" and an " unwavering devotion to principles." The political skill of Mr. Blaine he probably does not overestimate. In the conduct of political controversy and the management of a canvass Blaine was certainly a master. It is also true that he had a multitude of devoted followers to the last. He inspired affection and confidence because of his fine presence, his agreeable manners, his power to make friends, his marvelous memory of names and faces. These qualities, it seems to us, should be enumerated in a candid estimate of the famous Maine politician before his " grasp of public questions.** and his 11 devotion to principles.*' Dr. Stanwood believes that some of the " many interesting problems ” the career of Blaine offers to students of political history must still be left for the historians of another generation. He does not, therefore, put forward his book as a collection of “ Final Memorials,” like Talfourd’s biography of Lamb. Dr. Stanwood frankly admits that his own opinion of Mr. Blaine ** will undoubtedly be regarded as too much biased by personal friendship to be accepted.” His last word is that Mr. Blaine was actuated by high motives, inspired by lofty patriotism, and " obedient to the promptings of a sensitive conscience." In the notorious matter of the Little Rock and Fort Smith bond purchase the biographer holds that “ only those who can believe nothing good of Mr. Blaine will maintain that he was not entitled to a verdict of absolute innocence." But he tells the whole story clearly enough, and his narrative from first to last is picturesque and entertaining. Dr. Stanwood, we believe, is a relative of Mrs. Blaine. He writes sincerely of a man he knew and greatly admired.
WE begin this week our annual series of articles on books for children, none too soon considering thfe already formidable array of new " juveniles " on our book shelves. Such books will come forth from the presses in increasing numbers until December, when the production of Christmas books ceases. Tear by year the number of books written and published for children grows, in proportion with the increase of all books. This year the “ juveniles ** promise to be unusually interesting. A good selection of the early ones has been made for notice in the article appearing in this number.
GIFT books for the holidays are already coming from the presses. Nowadays Buch books, in the making of which the best mechanical skill and artistic taste are frequently employed, are generally new editions of some well-known w*ork in prose or verse. We have already spoken admiringly of the beautiful edition of Washington Irving’s " Rip Van Winkle/’ with Arthur Rackham’s highly imaginative and finely executed colored plates, which is published here by Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. Now we have received, from Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., in a handsome book, printed on calendered paper, Bret Harte’F three familiar poems, ** Her Letter," “ His Answer to Her Letter,” and " Her Last Letter/’ with colored pictures by Arthur L Keller. ** Her Letter " is one of the best of all Harte’s poems inspired by the mining camp life of California, and ” the man who shot
Sandy McGee ’* will gro down into history in the same delightful category aa Old John Naps of Greece, and Henry Pimpernell. “ His Answer to Her Letter,” communicated through Truthful James, has less of the touch of inspiration, w'hile M Her Last Letter” was an afterthought, written, we believe, as lately" as 1898. ** Her Letter ” belongs to 1S70, almost the beginning of Harte's career. The book is a beautiful example of typography, and Mr. Keller's skillfully executed pictures are full of the true Bret Harte humor. Perhaps It was a trifle bold to attempt to portray ** the man who shot Sandy McGee.” Mr. Keller does as well with that subject as might have been expected. But the young lady, though her countenance varies greatly from stage to stage of her experience, is always charming. Truthful James we accept unhesitatingly. Here is the very associate of Bill Nye and chronicler of that famous break-up of the society upon the Stanislaus. The fashions In women’s dress of the early 70 s are attractively represented.
ANOTHER of the newT gift books is the ** Tales from Shakespeare," by Charles and Mary Lamb. There <are, indeed, two new editions of this lesser classic at hand. The Oxford edition (Henry Frowde) is but an every day sort of book, compared with the other, but it contains sixteen illustrations from more or less famous paintings, and is a handy volume, well-printed, neatly bound. The other is sumptuous in gilding and decorative work, has a large octavo page, reproductions of portraits of Charles and Mary Lamb in the National Portrait Gallery, London, and twenty full-page pictures by Norman M. Price, printed in colors. The illustrator of the Lambs* “ Tales " is, of course, an interpreter of Shakespeare. Mr. Price’s pictures are to be judged only from a high standard. But they suffer nothing by comparison; they are ■ praiseworthy alike as pictures and as illustrations. They have original force and delicate Imagination. Beatrice and Imogen are beautiful women and like enough to their characters. Some of the large groups are most impressive, and the sense of mere theatricalism is not present in them. The artist has drawn his inspiration directly from the poet. Messrs. Charles Scribner’s Sons import this book.
CHARLES LAMB and his sister devised these charming tales as an introduction to the study of Shakespeare for very young persons, especially for girls. Boys, they thought, generally had access to their fathers' libraries. The prudery of contemporary democracy could hardly comprehend so much. The stories of nearly all the plays, including even “ All’s Well That Ends Well ” and “ Measure for Measure ” are told simply, tastefully, but plainly. English writers of Lamb’s day never dreamed that stories of that sort could be called immoral by any stretch of an ill-governed imagination. Yet we doubt not there are people who would call the " Tales from Shakespeare M immoral. They certainly deal with the play of high passions and the fundamental truths of human life. They have no taint of Elizabethan coarseness. Lamb was one of the purest-minded of men. We should not hesitate to com’’ mend the intelligent reading of the '* Tales ” to all persons, old or young, who have sufficient intelligence to read Shakespeare,
MR, HOWELLS’S new book, " London Films,” made up of his papers in Harper’s Monthly recording his later impressions of life in the world's greatest metropolis, easily takes its place among the few most noteworthy books of the season. Mr. Howells describes what he saw with the skill of an able journalist and tells what he felt with something of a poet’s sympathy, and leavens It all 'with the
wisdom of. an amiable philosopher and the gayety of a humorist. You may take his book as a guide to what one should see in and about London and not go wrong, though few of us, alas! are likely ever to see all that Mr. Howells saw, without Mr. Howells’s eyes. The Harpers publish his book, and it contains the pictures from the ma.ga.zine.
