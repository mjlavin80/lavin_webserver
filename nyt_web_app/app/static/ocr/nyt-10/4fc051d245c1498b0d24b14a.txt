Th>* action begins with :in elopement— a h<*avy chaise crossing the sands ahead of tho racing tide. ....I in the chaise a vi ry intfrosting ;'nd willful young woman and :t ynm,r trnin, who presently turn? out to ' ■■ ;i pitiful villain. Most of the later nction occurs at an English inn, (with a sharp-tongued landlady.) but it shifts now and again to the highway outside, to a wretched hovel, (the house of Starvecrow Farm.) to a smugglers' den. and to Kendal Jail. It is the willful young woman who goes to Kendal Jail, by the way, and makes there a very pretty (if incongruous) picture, with skirts tucked up, sweeping out the prison yard. For Miss Henrietta Damer, sister ol Sir Charles, has run away with a blackguard on the very eve of what was to have been her marriage with Capt. Clyne. a stern, elderly widower, late Captain in his Majesty’s Navy.
The blackguard not only has a wife already, but is wanted for radicalism and rioting besides. And Capt. Clyne is very much hurt and very haughty. Matters are complicated by the venoms and jealousies of a handsome, dark, tempestuous gypsy girl called Bess. Bess has heard of what the reds did to the aristocrats in France, and she has a notion that she would like herself to grind, the faces and trample the necks of a few pretty golden-haired British aristocrats—especially Miss Henrietta JDamer. There is a chaplain who is a most Weyinanesque invention and loves Miss Damer, there is a wicked squire-parson, and a runner from Bow Street—after the blackguard, of course. With that material you may trust the author to make the best of its possibilities for adventures, misunderstandings, dramatic incidents, surprises, conversations* scenes, rages, tears, and the rest of the things which tickle the romance reader's palate.
