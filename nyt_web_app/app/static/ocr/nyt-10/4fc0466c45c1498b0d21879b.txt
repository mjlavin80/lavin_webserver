Three Modern Rulers.
" Makers of Modern History," »>' the Hon. Edward Cadofjan, son of the former Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, is published in this country by James Pott & Co. The struggle between conservative principles and revolutionary forces constitutes the framcvork of the history of the nineteenth century. With this great move-
ment are closely associated the names of Louis Napoleon, Cavour, and Bismarck, the subjects of the three essays included in this little volume. “ We have made history," said Cavour upon a memorable occasion, ** now let us go to dinner." It Is on the epoch making, the history making1, actions of these men that emphasis is here laid. Perhaps the fact most frequently illustrated in the careers of these three men is that Machiavellianism Is apt to so hand in hand with statesmanship, and that in the conduct of nations Jesuitical principles are not obsolete.
