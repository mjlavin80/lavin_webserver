CASPAR WHITNEY'S admirable book of Journeys In Bunnah, Siam, Sumatra, and India is a most interesting and informing volume. It Is full of observations of life in Southeastern Asia— the life as well of the men and women as of the beasts of the Jungle- Mr. Whitney begins with Bangkok, where the humbler world lives in boats and the alien Chinaman or his descendant, the Simo-Chlnese, does most of the work. Then he tells how he met the King’s mahout, Chfio Poh, Lek, and went with him elephant catching— with occasion to note many things of the ways of my lord the elephant and the men of his country. Returning to Bangkok, you >**ad that:
Sampeng is a street of character; It Is the Bowery of Bangkok. It is at continuous bazaar from end to end. with many alleylike tributaries leading for the greater number to open-air theatres or to large crowded rooms, where natives squat to gamble and a band sends up imlnterrupt-ed melody from the darkness at the rear.
Again:	,
The Siamese builds his house of~ one atory and on stilts for several reasons. The first no doubt, is to avoid the unpardonable sin of living in a lower story while an upper one is occupied by other human beings, especially women, who in Slam are not regarded as of much importance. The second, and I should say the most practlcaLJf not the most aesthetic, reason is to nJTVe a waste gate easy of access for the continually flowing saliva from betel nut chewing and household J refuse, which may Lhus be easily dia-
{)osed of through the crevices of the opea-y constructed floor.
Then Mr. Whitney goes alter buffalo on the borders of Slam and Burmah, ea-, corted in state by Phra Ham, “ governmental chief of the line ” separating those two States. Phra Ram takes opportunity to turn the whole affair into a . pious pllgTimage to his ancestral home, with incidental revelations vastly more interesting to most readers than the mere tracking of bttffailo—though the buffalo also are tracked with all the enthusiasm and patience In life.
Traveling in the interior of the Malay peninsula Mr. Whitney encounters the " Sakai,” or tree dwellers, users of tho blowgun and poisoned darts which used to make such a figure In bloodcurdling i stories of adventures In those parts. Tho " Sakai.’' it appears, is very shy, he wears j no clothing to speak of. and paints himself fantastically in stripes and flower designs. His marriage ceremony also is primitive, peculiar, and engaging. Of course Mr. Whitney hunts the rhinoceros, the wild boar* and several kinds of deer ; and wild cattle, sample pictures of whose heads and horns are mingled with photographs of aborigines, male and female, variously clad and unclad. He goes to Sumatra to hunt wild elephants, and he speaks ill of French and Dutch methods with subject peoples. In India he hunts the tiger—spends nights waiting for him In trees, tracks him with boaters through the jungle- But he tells us that In six months he bagged not a single tiger, though he wounded three of the beasts.
