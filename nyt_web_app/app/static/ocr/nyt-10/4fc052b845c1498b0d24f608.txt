The elder Dumas’s “ Romanc€3 of the Russian Court '* has been translated Into Kris’]Is!) by a Russian, and now appears with the title " Celebrated Crimes of the Russian Court." Crimes these romances were, undoubtedly, from a moral point of view, but not crimes like those described In the famous French collections of " Causes C616bres.” Of coulee, tho new name is simply to excite interest and take advantage of any that may be aroused in Russia and its “mysterious”
Court.	•
The stories in the book have gained nothing in the course of the translation, and probably have lost much. As they are now. they are of little interest^ and less historic value. The chapter on “ Cor- " ruption in Russia,” however, is probably as true to-day as it was half a century ago.	'
