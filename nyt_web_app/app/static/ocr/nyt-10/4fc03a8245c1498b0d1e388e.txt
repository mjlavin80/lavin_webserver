UMBRIA
Edward Hutton’s Pleasing Book: About Old Italian Cities.*
AIjY is a most fertile theme for the book writers; and always, it would seem, is there a bocik ready to drop out of the blue Italian sky into the lap of whatever English writer will perform, well or ill, understanding^ or not, the proper rites. Mr. Hutton has performed them, on the whole, well and understanding^'. He is familiar with the Umbrian country; he loves it, has In a way penetrated into its spirit. His book is a rather curious compound of poetical rhapsody and eloquence, with guide-book explicitness. He has his fling, as most have, at that 41 mighty army of martyrs who are led about Italy by Baedeker”, but we sometimes cannot escape from Baedekerism even between his covers. There is* however, so much more, and so much that is agreeably told, that perhaps he who wishes to shun the mighty army and escape martyrdom would "very well intrust himself to Mr. Hutton’s guidance.
Perugia, Assisi, are of course tht . first places to which he escorts us, and confides to us fragments of history and judgments of their paintings and churches and monuments, as well as something of the spirit of the places. Perugia stands above all the perfection of the landscape, “ ever at attention on her hills, terrible of aspect with all her beauty, and with great angry eyes as of old, searching out her enemies/* Of Assisi he writes:
Hallowed by the tears and footsteps, sorrowful and bleeding, of many thousands of pilgrims, she has grown lovely under their love, beautiful in some exquisite Christian manner ywith the sorrows that the world has laid at her feet for hundreds of years now; a simple country virgin, very pure and innocent, who has had but one lover, Christ her Lord.
And of St. Francis and his memorials he also has much, of course, to say; but he enters his protest against the " enthusiastic sentimentality ’* of those who come to worship him without understanding him or his faith, and throws a brick at “ the Protestant Frenchman who has made his fa: e out of this saint of the Catholic Church," which Mr. Sabatier may not find it necessary to dodge, Spello none should miss, save-those who are desperate with hurry, and there may be seen the work of the great and exquisite sentimentalist, Eintoricchio. Through the other Umbrian cities Mr Hutton takes us to Urbina at last.
The next chapters are devoted to a consideration of Umbrian art—an art that was for the most part a religious, vowed to God. Its two schools were those of Gubbio and Perugia, both the handmaid of the Church, touching life only rarely, having no life of its own apart from religion. In the section ** Umbria Mystica" are discussed the saints who illumine the history of the district—Joachim dl Flore, the forerunner of St. Francis; St. Francis himself, his friend St. Clare, Brothers Bernard and Elias. Now again he returns to M. Sabatier, who divined much in the fragmentary legend of Francis’s life by his exquisite and loving care, his patient and profound scholarship, but who yet discovered In him qualities of a revolutionary, a progressive reformer, an amiable Martin Luther, that Mr Hutton thinks were not there. AH this is a part of Umbria, and it Is all neces-aary for him who wTould understand what Umbria means. The book has much that is useful and valuable as a contribution toward the understand- 1

ing of the Italian life and spirit in their manifold manifestations, much that Is suggestive, much that is concrete and firmly to be taken hold of.
