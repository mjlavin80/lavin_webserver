violin, its makers,' and their supposed secrets, arc an Inexhaustible subject of Hterf ary activity, and one that tlit^ dilettante especially fond of expatiating''upon. It * seems clear that , the dilettante is holding forth in this • f new addition to violin literature. The book is aptly characterized by its title.
It is not a technical or exact historical .work, yet touches much on both technical and historical matters. The author discusses the ancestors and relatives of the
violin, the rebec, crwth* and vielle, or hurdy-gurdy, and the earlier forms of vLols, In an offhand and generally entertaining manner, though not always with precise accuracy, Then she undertakes to tell of the first makers of the violin Itself, (strangely omitting all reference to Dulffoprugcar;) tells much of AntonTo Stradivari, then of some other Italian makers, and of German, French, and English makers. Various anecdotes, of which the violin has always been a fertile source, are given, of more or less significance.
Among the less known of such stories are several of Tarisio, carpenter, amateur fiddle repairer, and collector, who was one of the first to go into ** collecting " on a large scale, and who found many treasures in Italy. He began about the middle of the last century, and went to -England in 1851. Charles Reade, who was an Impassioned collector of violins and is set down as a connoisseur, knew him well, and has recorded a number of his amusing traits and experiences.
In her description of the construction of the violin are some sensible words about the great varnish question. " The secret of the Cremona varnish,’* she declares, '* lies in the fact that it never was any secret at &1L” It was not worth anybody’s while to write down a recipe ^ that everybody knew, and, the introduction of quick-drying varnishes having killed the Cremonese varnishes, the world awakened to find that it had suffered the grievous loss of a recipe once common property. And, finally, the varnish made and used to-day by some of the best mak- _ ers is as fine as any varnish that the Amatis or Stradivarius ever made or used.
" It is not the Cremona varnish. It has no need to be, for, if anything, It Is better.”
The last chapters of this strangely contrived little volume are practically treatises on how to keep and how to play the violin. Of course, a few hundred words about the latter far-reaching subject, Illustrated only by three or four sketches of the position of the left hand, cannot be expected to amount to much. What boots it to be told to “ raise your arm naturally, keeping the elbow down, and bend the wrist naturally,” unless you are poing to be^ carried through the whole discipline of violin playing, for which years oC study under a master and reams of oxeroiscs are necessary? The appendix is given over to a large collection of stories about Paganini, of more or less interest, and generally of less'importance. Miss Racstcr’s English style Is frequent-* ly vivacious, but often unfinished, and she is imperfectly informed as to the spelling of many foreign proper names and other words. And is it exactly respectful for a devotee of the violin to speak of the great master Antonio Stradivari almost all through a long- account of his life and work as " Strad *’?
