The chief centres of needle laec-making were Venicc, Brussels, an J Alenqon; while most of the so-called Spanish point or’g-inated from Venice, and the Greek lace— a cut work of geometrical design—was also probably Italian. While pillow* laces were made, during different periods, all over Europe, nowhere else did they attain to such beauty as in Flanders, where it is believed ihe art of lace-mak:ng was ^Invented. Mrs. Sharp has chapters on ! Italian needle and pillow laces, French, Flemish, English, and Irish laccs, made by hand and the machine. The, closing i chapter is a summary, and includes briefly-stated facts about laces. A glossary of technical and French, Flemish, Italian, and other forc'gn terms has been inserted.
There are many pictures in the book showing the different styles of laces. The frontispiece is a photogravure portrait of the Princess Eleanora of Mantua, from the painting fcn the Pitt! Palace at Florence, showing the collar of point lace which also adorns the cuffs of the bodice.
