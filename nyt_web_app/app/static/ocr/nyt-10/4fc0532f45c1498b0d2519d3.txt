Its History front tfie Beginning of tire Revolution to the Establishment of the Republic.^
HE scholar to whom was as- I signed the task of writing the history of the Revolution for the American Nation Series,- Prof. Claude Halstead ^ Van Tyne, has labored under special difficulties. The greatest of these, probably, is the immense amount of material that exists on tho Revolutionary period, not only on its military, but on its political, constitutional, and social phases as well. The present volume takes account of all these phases. Prof. Van Tyne ha** succeeded in turning out a fresh,. original, and, considering the limitations of space imposed, an adequate history of the Revolution.
The history of this epoch may be, and has been, written from different points of view. Bancroft and Fiske have taken the patriotic American standpoint. Trevelyan represents the liberal-minded Englishman In sympathy with America, Lecky is the judicious historian in the highest sense of the word. - Prof. Van Tyne, while it would be too much to say that he. writes from the American Tory point of view, Bets forth In a sympathetic manner the claims and the cause of the loyalists. His exhaustive study of this class, the results of which he published some time ago, predisposes him toward a tenderness for them.
He lays special stress upon the social conditions in the revolting Colonies and shows what scholars are now agreed upon, that the Revolution was essentially a civil war. " The Declaration of IndependenCe proclaimed not only war with
*
England, but a civil war between the Whigs and Tories in America." We miss a description of the contest that went on in England, where also there was a civil war, though a bloodless one; but Prof. Van Tyne had not space for everything. There is a question that may arise In the mind of the reader of this book Jn reflecting upon the author’s presentation of the claims and merits of the loyalists. If they were so numerous, wealthy, and Intelligent a party, why did they not do something? If the Whigs inaugurated a Red Terror, why did not they get up an opposition V White Terror ” ? It is difficult to share the author's sympathy for so un-energetlc a party wh03e most constant and characteristic mode was flight.
While Prof. Van Tyne treats military history in a brief way, he makes clear what the military situation was. He dwells upon the terrible discouragements which confronted Washington on taking command of the army- before Boston. Prof. Van Tyne makes extensive use of Washington’s correspondence, and after reading this volume, though it is not written in the conventional patriotic vein, one’s estimate of Washington will probably be raised, though his admiration for some of Washington’s contemporaries may be diminished. The errors and blunders of the British Generals are shown, j and especially their mistake in making anything but Washington’s army their military objective. This army, rather than American possession of New York or Philadelphia or even the Hudson Valley, sustained the revolt.
On the diplomatic aspects of the Revolution Prof. Van Tyne wilt be found interesting and instructive. Among other points which he makes, he shows that Frederick the Great’s enthusiastic friendship for the United States is a myth. The conditions under which France came to our assistance are explained carefully. Prof. Van Tyne calls attention to a ponderous publication he has found of much value, B. F. Stevens's “ Fac Similes of Manuscripts in European Archives Relating to America.”
The West is not neglected. *' The people of the back country had a strong influence upon the Revolution by their aid in democratizing the new Statu Constitutions, and giving a more democratic flavor to the whole movement.” That Is to say, considering the Revolution as a movement for greater equality, the West supplemented the East by furnishing con-
ditions ; that made possl hie the existence of I a iriore perfect democracy,
/ The great constitutional question in the Revolutionary period is, Where was the sovereign power? Was it in the American people or was It in the people of the States^ represented by their State legislatures? Later when State sovereignty became an issue, this historical anil con-	|
stitutional Question became of vital Im-	I
portance. As a historian Prof. Van Tyne rejects the theory that the act of breaking the bonds between the Colonies and England threw down iriter-State barriers and formed one nation whose sovereignty was vested In Congress except possibly In a purely “ metaphysical sense." “ Few contemporaries,’* he says, believed that .the Continental Congress was anything more than an ** inter-fitate committee of safety.’* " So far as objective institutions were concerned there were, at least until the Articles of Confederation were adopted, thirteen independent and sovereign	I
States which banded themselves together	8
to fight a common enemy.” Prof. Hart,	I
by the way, in his editorial preface disclaims any responsibility for this view.
44 It is no part of the scheme of the series,” he says, " to adjust the conclusions of the" individual writers to the editor’s frame of mind.’*
Mr. McLaughlin's task has been to write the history of the eventful and critical years from the defeat of Cornwallis to the adoption of the Federal Constitution. His subject matter includes the diplomatic negotiations leading up to the treaty of Paris, the history of the Confederation, an account of the efforts to amend the articles, culminating in the work of the Philadelphia convention, and the ratification of the Federal Constitution.
lie reiterates Prof. Van Tyne's insistence on the necessity of viewing the Rev- H olutlon as a civil war. Otherwise we cannot understand the problems that confronted Americans when peace came. The political problem was to get a Government in working order. When in 1781 the thirteenth State signed the Articles of Confederation, what Mr. McLaughlin calls the first form of " Imperial organization," a *' confederation of sovereign States ” was established.
This simple arrangement, a confederation of sovereign States, performing certain functions through a body of delegates, proved in the course of time so inadequate that it is easy to pass these articles by with an amused smile at their utter unfitness for the work at hand. As a matter of fact, they were In many respects models of what articles of confederation ought to be, an advance on previous instruments of like kind in the world’s history. Their inadequacy arose from the fact that a mere confederacy of sovereign States was not adapted to the social, political, and Industrial needs of the time.
The history of the years after the close of the Revolution is a history of the failure ol this first form of '* Imperial organization." In Chapter XI. the proposals	I
and efforts to amend the articles, which date almost from the beginning of the confederation, are sketched.
Mr. McLaughlin's account of what went on behind the closed doors of the Phila-	I
delphla convention is, of course, based on	J
the few but well-known original sources	!
of information. It is not possible to say	I
anything startiingiy novel about the work	1
of the convention Mr. McLaughlin conceives of the “ Second Form of Imperial Organization," the Constitution, as establishing a real Government and a permanent Union. The whole constitutional movement was, of course, revolutionary and illegal, according to the public law of the Confederation. The revolution was consummai,ed when the people, acting through ratifying conventions in the several States, accepted the Constitution.	R.	L.	S.
