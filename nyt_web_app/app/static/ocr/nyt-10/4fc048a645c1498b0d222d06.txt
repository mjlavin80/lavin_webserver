There are spaces for the signatures of the receiving parties at her d£but and some of the guests; a place for the names of those who sent flowers, and other pages for affairs given In honor of certain people which the girl attended; for breakfasts, luncheons, teas, and dinners to which she was invited and attended; also chafing dish parties and card parties, musicales, dances, receptions, and theatre parties; the different sports of the seasons which she witnessed or took part In; travels and shopping tours of interest, and in addition there is a space for parting in samples of " her ” favorite gowns; also newspaper notices, and a page for items concerning college, the volume closing with a page presumably for the date of “ her ’’ marriage, because it is headed by a wee figure with wings, veiled and wreathed*
Each page has a heading, the design indicating the subject to be written about, as, for example, heading the blank page for the records of " Five o’Clock Teas " is a Chinese cupid drinking tea; ** Dinners," a cupid in a man's swallow-tail coat; “ Dances," a tiny figure sitting behind a fan, the wings and head only being visible; “Spring Sports,*' wherein are seen three players in the distance and a cupid In the foreground, dropping bow and arrow on account of the scare he gets upon being hit in the region of the heart by a golf ball, &c.	“ Her Memory Book ” is
