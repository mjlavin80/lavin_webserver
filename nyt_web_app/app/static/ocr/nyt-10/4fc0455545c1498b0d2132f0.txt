HTLE Mrs. Wharton’s new novel
Ha —	ICTION leads in the pub-
t&I	Ushers’ Autumn announce-
ments inevitabii'; the novel is assuredly not going out of fashion this season. The lists in the special Autumn number of The New York Times Book Review, to be published next Saturday, will include many columns of titles of new works of English and American fiction, which have been published recently or are still in press. These books* though they give promise of no sensational triumph in the most popular of all literary fields, are, In many cases, the works of Well-known and well-liked authors. As the reviews of some of the newest novels printed in this number indicate, the standard of merit is reasonably high. In. American fiction the first place among the Autumn novels will undoubtedly be filled by Edith Wharton's powerful social study, " The House of Mirth,” which reaches its tragic climax in the November Scribner’s; but the new books by Ellen Glasgow, Winston Churchill, Margaret Sherwood, Alice French, (Octave Thanet,) Robert W. Chambers, J. S. Connolly, and some others are sure of cordial reception. Among the new English books there are Mr. Wells’s " Kipps.” (which we rtview to-davt) Mr. QutUer-Couch’s M Mayor of Troy,” Mrs, Craigie’s “ Flutes of Pan,” ‘‘.The Lake,” by George Moore, Anthony Hope’s “ A Servant of the People,” and a new novel by Ouida. A new book by Robert Hichens will come later. There is nothing of fiction in sight from Mr. Howells or Mr. James. The first-named writer's nearest forthcoming book, It seems, is his “ London F'ilms,” the record of his -impressions and reflections during his recent stay abroad. Mr. James is publishing oaly a little book containing his two recent lectures. There is, certainly, *' plenty of room at the top ” in the field of American fiction.
THE Autumn Book number of next week will contain many special features of interest besides the tabulated lists of new books in all branches of literature. For instance, there will be an article embodying a view of the situation in the book market as the retail l^ookweller sees it. New York is a town of many bookshops and of much book buying, but there is no doubt that the business of retail bookselling (in comparison with what it will be ten, twenty years hence) is still in its infancy. Tin- growth in recent years has been wonderful, and many -American booksellers are beginning to realize so clearly the possibilities of their trade that we doubt if an opposition could be organized here against any novel scheme in the bookselling line so formidable as that set on foot in London to check the development of The London Times’s new circulating library and bookshop plan. Many ingenious reasons have been put forward to explain this opposition to new comp.-ti-tion, but the principal reason is the fear of the competition. This is shortsighted, of course* The Times’s jjcbemo

fifty years after “The Potiphar Papers ’’ of George William Curtis satirized the worldly clergyman as- the Rev. Cream Cheese. In Its serial publication, we fancy, the new story attracted comparatively little notice; but we bespeak for it a general hearing now. It narrates the adventures among the rich, vain, and reasonably well-cultivated of New York of a young writer and his nice wife, and contains vivid and veracious pictures of the dinner party, the
*	coaching party,, the theatre party, and many other “ social functions,” glimpses of literary, artistic; and dramatic “ sets,” with a study of the manners of a mannerless age, and a hint or two of its morals.
THERE is food for the imagination in the communication we print elsewhere, from Mr. Avem Pardoe of the Ontario Legislative Library in Toronto, relating to the poisoning of a dog, in a recent novel, by administering powdered glass. It seems that powdered glass has been, for many years, a favorite medicine for certain diseases to which dogs are, subject, and our correspondent believes that the eating of powdered glass would not kill a human being* The notion that a small quantity of it would kill suddenly, he declares, is one of the traditions of the age when the world was full of fables of poisons and poisonings, and every mysterious death (mysterious because of the common ignorance of anatomy and pathology) was attributed to the poisoner. Of course, powdered glass has been a deadly thing, in the imagination, for many centuries, and one would not careen ow to take it up as an article of diet. But what a world of fancy Mr. Pardoe’s letter wakens up, what a reconstruction it suggests, of the popular ideas of Loeusta and Lucrezia Borgia!
G GREGORY SMITH, the latest
•	editor, of Pepys, has just been appointed to the Professorship of English Literature at Queen’s College, Belfast, not precisely because of that work of editorship, though that reveals qualities of taste'and discrimination desirable in a professor of English Literature as well as an ample store of knowledge. Prof. Gregory Smith’s edition of " The Diary of Samuel Pepys ’* is published in the Macmillan Company's handy Globe Series. It contains the Braybrooke text, with the corrections of Mynors Bright, printed in rather small but clean type on double-columned pages. For ordinary library use a better editibn of the immortal diary could not be desired. The index Js copious, while there are plenty of useful notes.
ONE might sufficiently admire the literary work of George Borrow, . for its broad sympathy with human nature, and the charm of life out-of-doors that pervades it, to be called a veritable Borrovian, and yet have no use at all for Borrow’s Romany glossary, and his theories of the origin of the Gypsy language. These, however, form only a part of the latest volume in the new edition of Borrow’s works, published here by Messr^- G. P. Putnam's Sons. " Romano Lavo-Lil ” contains not only Borrow’s remarks on the history of Romany, and his vocabulary of the language, occupying fifty-odd pages, but a batch of Gypsy proverbs, in Romany and English, some scraps of the Scriptures rendered into Gypsy, the " Book of Wisdom of the Egyptians,” a
list of .favoredJ Gypsy names of countries and to^ns, and many quaint and
curious odds and ends of the folk-lore
• . . . r \
of the wandering people accumulated by Borrow. It is, In fact, a book in which the admirer of Isopel Berners* may find much to entertain him for an hour or so.
THERE was no particular reason, probably, why the' Dublishers of Scribner’s Magazine should choose to celebrate the eighteenth or the nineteenth anniversary of the first publication of their excellent periodical rather than the fifteenth or the twentieth. The pamphlet they have just issued as " a brief retrospect M comes now by mere chance, but is not the less welcome. From the first Scribner’s has been one of the most Interesting and veritably “ readable ” of all the magazines. Its "Unpublished Letters of Thackeray ” caused a literary sensation at the very beginning, and it has been a rich mine of biography and personal reminiscence. Stanley, the Bancrofts, Minister Washburne, the Everetts, Gen. Sheridan, Gen. Gordon, Hugh McCulloch, and Mme. Waddington-are only a f§w of the illustrious contributors In this line. Serial fiction has been contributed by Stevenson, Barrie, Richard Harding Davis, Harold Frederic, F. HopkiiVson Smith, Mrs. Humphry Ward, .peorge Meredith, Robert Grant, and a host of others, not to mention Edith Wharton. Some of the l?est short stories of Kipling, Hopkinson Smith, Cable, James, Kenneth Grahame, and Josephine Daskam o/iginally appeared in Scribner’s. The " brief retrospect ” will be found an interesting stimulus to pleasant memories by many a reader of i good magazines.	^
LEST you should marvel all in vain over the meaninK of the title of a new volume of verse by the novelist, Eden Phillpotts, which is now announced in the Autumn lists—" Up Along and Down Along ”—it is well to remember that Mr. Phillpotts. though he was born in India, is of a Devonshire family, and dwells in that beautiful land now. "Up along” and "down along ” are Devonshire locutions. " Be you going up along? ” means are you going away from home, out 'of the county. “ Dear down along ” Charles Kingsley called Devonshire.
MR. IRA D. SAN KEY, formerly associated with the la.te Dwight L. Moody in evangelical work, informs us that he is rewriting his unpublished book, “ The Story of the Gospel Hymns,” the original manuscript of which was destroyed by fire four years ago, and asks us to give space to his request that our readers will acquaint him with any facts or anecdotes they may have touching the modern hymns. Mr. Sankey’s address is 14S South Oxford Street, Brooklyn Borough.
