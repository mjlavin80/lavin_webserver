No More “Dull Seasons** in the 'Trade
' ^
—Talk About the Autumn Outlook.
|NE of the bept-known booksellers in ‘ New" York remarked the other day that events were rapidly moving to the point where the city would have no dull seasons. '* New York,” said he, M is rapidly getting in that regard to be Uke Paris. In Paris we have no dull seasons; when the Parisians go out of town the Americans come in. In New York, when the New Yorkers go away, all other Americans come in. Nobody stays long, perhaps, but the stream flows steadily. Time was, and that not very long- ago, when here in our book shop, for instance, we had little to do in August and September; now there is less and less slackening of trade during those months. The visitors to the city furnish a steady -and dependable custom.’'
Prom this and other observations it seems certain that the retail book trade, at least in New York, tends less and less to run in “ seasons,” and, as a natural consequence, that books tend less and less to be of the kind which are made for a particular season. Even Christmas books (as another bookseller remarked) are to a less and less extent books good for Christmas and for no other time—worth, say, $2 on Dec. 24 and 2 cents two days afterward.
A necessary result of this lack of differentiating features in the books of any particular season, this tendency to sell the same kind of book all the year round, is a loss of some of the most picturesque features of the trade as for a long time we have known it. For instance, inquiries as to present conditions and prospects elicit the most encouraging replies as to the volume and steadiness of trade, and when that is said all is said. For, in general, there’s no unanimous public rage after any particular book or kind of book, and no concentration of trade energies in any particular line. Further mark of the prosperous uniformity already mentioned, the booksellers are not loading their shelves and counters with excess of the current crop of books. Whether fiction or what not—the current crop has its place, of course, and a conspicuous one, but it by no means overbalances those fit survivals of the literary contributions of the ages which should logically form, but have not always actually formed, the bulk of a bookseller’s stock. All the dealers report the continuance of a drift they have been remarking more or less for some years past toward a conservative habit in book buyers. These book buyers more and more each year purchase the classics, in the less pretentious shops in cheaper, and in the more pretentious in plain but handsome library editions. In the matter of current publications generally and in fiction particularly they proceed selectively and tend less and less to rush in vast numbers toward the newest thing. As a matter of fact, only two novels of the present season were mentioned by any bookseller as causing any rush at all. The booksellers at large, however, explained the absence of such a rush by pointing to the lack of suitable material in the publishers’ lists—with the one notable novel by a notable hand, Mrs. Wharton’s 44 House of Mirth," and Mrs. Wharton’s manner not one of the widest public appeal—with no concentration of interest (as last year) upon war and the Far East, but, instead, almost ideal conditions for public interests and curiosity to spread over a vast number of subjects ail pretty well represented in those lists. Indeed, the one single conspicuous and picturesque feature of the Autumn trade in books up to date is the vogue of the works of Mr. George Bernard Shaw, who, after being neglected for so long, then talked of so much by the distinctly “ literary ’* contingent, seems to have arrived definitely at his goal—the general reader. At all events, they are buying Shaw in every book shop, and the buyers are pretty much all sorts of people. The writer of this watched a stream of such buyers the morning after Mr. Shaw's now somewhat celebrated letter to Ths New York Times on " Comstockery.” and really the stream in question was worth watching.
A large book shop down in the lower part of the city furnishes some curious observations on the effects of rapid transit upon bookselling. When Colum-
bia UniversUy'ahd several other insti-’ tutions were less far removed from the City Hall than they are now, the students used to frequent this shop and make large purchases of school books— when the institutions emigrated the students came no more. Now, with the Subway and its expresses, these students have come back again, and the trade in school books—which had suffered-sadiy in that particular shop—has revived mightily.
The head of a shop in Twenty-third Street was asked a variety of questions .about the Autumn business, and espe-dally about the M expectations " as to volume. He had just been giving his orders to the salesman of one of the publishingTfbuses and he explained that such orders, without being extravagant, had been with him liberal. As what has been said above would lead you to expect, these orders had not been " bunched *’ upon particular lines, but distributed over the field, with especial reference to books with proved staying qualities. This particular bookseller did not expect to bank this season upon any ** quick seller,’* or book a large edition of which could be rushed off and then the book forgotten. He spoke trustfully of certain books of certain authors not yet “ classics ’* which were now, after several successful years, selling more copies than they had ever sold. “ These," he said in effect, *' are my jewels,” And this particular policy of this particular bookseller gives as much as any other thing the keynote of the season. Naturally there is a reflex action upon the publishers. When the booksellers give their orders upon principles of this sort, the “ gambling ** element of the business, upon which a certain publisher in his confessions had so much insisted, is largely le-moved, or substituted at any rate, by a set of chances more nearly calculable.
All of which does not mean that you will not find the usual piles of fiction in the usual places when you visit your favorite shop. The piles are there, and some very big ones go very rapidly and some very small ones go very slowly. And In spite of the decline of M season books," you will find on the counters plenty of books of the elaborately illustrated sort which are expected to catch the eye of the buyers of gifts; much-illustrated editions of very lightweight sentimental fiction and verse, but especially books on the more pictorial corners of the earth—as Italy, India, France, England—with illustrations extraordinarily fine in effect and execution. Nearly every publishing house has provided at least one of these books, and one, as usual, has several. You will find, too, a generous variety of historl-cal matter, most of it with a biographical twist, and a vast number of volumes on sociological subjects, with especial regard to recent so-called '* high " financial sidelights. One bookseller remarked that his patrons—a very representative lot of patrons they are— seem to turn more and more to the essay, not so many years ago counted extinct. Of course the word essay is to be taken in a wide sense as including books of comment and reflection on literature and life from a great many points of view. For such books there is an increasing demand. The observation of the bookseller just quoted is clinched by the very obvious fact that the publishers are venturing more and more books of that,’ sort. It is possible to suppose, at least, that the biographical drift of the past few years has. as it were, led the public by degrees back to this particular watering trough.
Among these, however, you'll find no single volume—whether in the field of illustration, biography, literary comment, or sociology—for which the man behind the counter reports a sale at all phenomenal In the past or for which he expects such a sale in the future.
Aa the head of one of the most highly considered shops in town said, *' there is a growing demand for good books in good shape," there is a growing demand for books in general, there is a growing class who buy books intelligently. The retail trade is expanding in very satisfactory fashion, and tending, as the first paragraph of this paper indicated, to get over a certain habit of fitfulness which used to belong to it and not infrequently grievously disconcerted the layer in of stock. On the whole, the impression gathered after talking with a great many booksellers was this: That the book trade of the
Autumn or 1905 furnishes a. deal more
solid comfort to the sellers -of books than it does material of readable " copy ** to the writer about books and bookmen.
