Jiaw to Judge a Poet
Vew York Times Saturday Review of Books:
Your very interesting and scholarly comments on Mr. Bettany’s " Confessions of Lord Byron ” have tempted me to offer a few remarks upon the subject.
I am of the opinion that if Mr. Bet-tany Hntends to have his readers understand by the title of his book that Byron ever confessed to anything of a criminal nature charged against him he will disappoint them unless he bas discovered some new and authentic evidence on that unfortunate subject. Byron, so far as I have been able to find, not only did never confess to having committed any of the many Infamies attributed to him, mostly by unknown accusers, but defied them all to produce any substantial proof in support of a single one. But if Mr. Bettany means by the " Confessions '* to say in substance to his readers: Here are Byron’s letters and diaries and poems, in whole or in part, peruse them carefully, and draw your own conclusions, that ia another thing. With all due deference to the author I will say that I do not think It prudent to place any too much reliance on such a source, especially the first two parts of it, in order to be able to judge fairly of the poet’s character. The letters of a man, especially those of an impulsive man, and a poet, merely represent, it seem§ to me, the unstudied expressions coming from a mind swayed by the influence of circumstances which bear upon It for good or for evil at the time of writing them. For this same reason I would not place any reliance, for arriving at the same end, on the works of a poet which showed plainly that they were prompted by the bravado of youth or deep resentment. I believe that the surer way by which to foi*m a fair estimate of a poet’s real character is to examine the sentiments he gives utterance to at the moment where self is obliterated from his otrind—when he is oblivious to all save his poetic inspirations, because it Is then and only then that his soul speaks and reveals the innermost convictions of the man. It is only by this standard, if I may so express it, that I would try to determine for myself, foi* instance, the poet's attitude toward Christian principles and ideals. If I discovered in his poetical flights that man In his mental distress can only find solace in appealing to God—if I found that he depicted patience, fortitude, and resignation in a manner that could only have been inspired by the example set us by the Son—if I saw in his descriptions of nature that deep love for It which is nothing less than a deep love for the Creator of it, and, lastly, if all this had the power to arouse in my own soul corresponding feelings, I would certainly reach the conclusion that the man was a true poet and fundamentally a true Christian. And here I would pause, for, satisfied from a moral point of view that the poet had left us many examples both pleasing and instructive and worthy of emulation, I could not see any reason for bringing to the notice of the new generation of readers what would prove objectionable to them.
