IN putting into English M. Elie Metch-nikoff's new book, " Immunity in Infective Diseases,” Prancis G. Binnie of tho Lniversity of Cambridge has attempt- j ed to give " a faithful rendering of the ideas and arguments of the original, even at the ri?k of an occasional crude expression. rather than to attempt to reproduce the brilliancy of the original by any wide verbal departure from the text.”
As M. Metchnikoff points out in his dedicatory letter to MM. E. Duclaux and E. Roux, the book " sums up the labors of twenty-five years." It Is based on reports and articles on “ Immunity " which he published during the past ten years. The table of contents forms an analytical summary of the principal topics; there is also in this edition an index which serves not only as a key to the details discussed in the body of the book, but also as a reference to the numerous authors cited. The pages of the original work have been indicated in the margins. The illustrations comprise forty-five figures in the text* The MacmillaJi Company is issuing the volume.
