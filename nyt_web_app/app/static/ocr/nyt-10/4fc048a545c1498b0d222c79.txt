j Co. $7.50 net) In a large and handsome quarto, printed on light, EngHsh-t made paper, in large, <dear type, and bound in green boards with buckram ! back, the Wolsey arms being stamped in gold on the cover. The' edition is believed to be from the rao^t authoritative j text and contains the full-page photo; gravures, reproduced in sepia and red j chalk tints, of Wolsey, King Henry VHL, Thomas Crorawell, Catherine of j Aragon, Anne Boleyn, Mary Tudor, and Charles Brandon, and others men-| tioned in the book, reproduced from paintings by Holbein and others.
The original manuscript of the biog-j raphy was left by George Cavendish | upon his death in 1561. Cavendish *was , gentleman usher to the great Cardinal, j and was with him through the period i of his rise to eminence, his tragic fall and death. He later returned into the country and spent the rest of his life in solitude. He seems to have taken to heart the lesson of the ** wondrous mutability of vain honor, the brittle assurances of abundance, the uncertainty of dignities, the flattering of vain friends, and the tickle trust to worldly Princes." And he consoled himself in his poverty by writing the simple story of his service as one of Wolsey's suite.
The work remained long in manuscript owing to the fact that It contained numerous reflections on the character of Henry VIH., and could not very well be published during the reign of his immediate descendants. It first appeared in 1641, but in an incomplete form, and was later brought out in various other forms, until, in 1815, 1 S. W. Singer reprinted it from what has been established as the author’s manuscript. The present edition is a reprint of Singer’s and also includes some corrections made by P. S. EIHs for the editions of 1893 and 1899. It is certainly a work of great interest for the historical student, and is now presented in a most beautiful and appropriate setting.
