HI*" choice of a good name ,1s highly advisable; sometimes one can make use of it In a way to bring in fame and money. The name of Napoleon, or even of Bonaparte, is still one to conjure with* It is to the /net that he was his father's son that the fame of the Duke of Reich-stadt is due; he did nothing—he was allcwed to do nothing; the chronicle of his life is mainly of small beer. Vet writers with some pretensions to be historians dig- up unimportant facts about his short life, and exult over new discoveries, and the public runs to buy their reports of their treasure trove. Tho shadow of a gre:U name surrounds him. and historical writers record and discuss his every net as if he*1 had h,.*en a real King, instead of merely the IT.

MR. EDWAftD DE WKRTHlIMMR is the latest writer to make a study of Napoleon's son. His energy and thoroughness are to be commended; he has had access to the Royal and Imperial Archives of Vienna, and to those of the various State departments, and to many private collections, and it sooms as if what he had not discovered would not be worth discovering hereafter. This is not to be taken as admitting the worth of what he has found already, He begins his life of the Duke with the marriage ni Napoleon and the Archduchess Marie JjCuise of Austria. ;tnd traces ft almost day by day to his death at the age of -1- Nothing is too unimportant for him; he has scraped everything together, sorted it out,^.sifted it, and arranged it in what must be acknowledged to be an interesting story. The matter is not important, however, as a fact; it i$ Nupo-leonic—that is its excuse.
The chapter on the political status of the Duke is the only one of consequence in the book. As the father was exiled to St. Helena, so the son was exiled in Vienna. The Byzantine Emperors suppressed uncomfortable relatives, not in quite the same way as, but no more effectively than. Europe suppressed the Duke of Reichstadt. There were adherents of Napoleon in France -who said they were ready to work for his son. Possibly they Were; his cousin, the Counfess Napoleone C’amerata. tried to abduct him from Vienna to put him at the head of his adherents. But most of the matter was merely talk, seemingly, by persons who cared more for Napoleon and his son only because they cared less for the Bourbons and the Orleans dynasties. But the Duke's importance was wholly in posse, not in esse.
During the time that elapsed between the success of the revolution and the election of the Duke of Orleans to the throne
I	of France) Metternich must certainly have thought of the Duke uf Reichstadt as the possible future ruler of Prance.
I.’nder	the cry of “ Long live Napoleon
II.’.”	there was fighting in the streets of Paris. It was the misfortune of the Kmpt-ror's son that, far from France and personally unknown to the French na-tinn. he should then be living in Vienna under the control of the Austrian Court. Had lie beefl present in the French capital ;it that critical moment, there is no doubt that the crown would have fallen to him.
A few pages earlier, referring to the illness of Louis XVIII. in lS^, Mr. de Wertheimer remarks;
Had the Duke of Reichstadt been of a suitable age, and had his grandfather Ithe Emperor of Austria] and Metternich been willing to support him, truly no better moment could have been chosen for his proclamation.
There is something ludicrous in this insistence on the “ IF.” We all know if Cleopatra's nose had been longer—if the Wise Men of Gotham’s bowl had been stronger—what would liave happened. Whateley’s " Historic Doubts ** are as valuable a-s Mr. de Wertheimer’s IFs in the case of the Duke of Reichstadt. There was more truth than most epigrams contain in the instructions of the French Ministry to the Prefects: ” Napoleon’s son * belongs neither to history nor to France and Mr. de Wprtheimer’s attempt to exalt him into a historical personage of importance merely proves the truth of the Ministers* stat*-ment,

THE Duke Jived and died. Mr. de Wertheimer is a very Jenkins in his
. description of him and his educa- | tioh. " Wonderfully spirited are the Tew lines In which he begs the Archduke tp let him be present at tlf« manoeuvres"; 1 “ his talent for adapting himself to other people’s views, as though they were liis own. was quite remarkable.” Most Jen-kinslike is this: '* He always dressed in the latest fashion, and displayed a tendency to extreme eccentricity in his clothes.

the French felt themselves face to face with a very unsettled destiny. Since the fall of Louis Philippe was imminent, the loss of the Duke of Reichstadt meant a groat calamity to France ”! The Duke died in 1&12, the imminent fall of Loula Philippe occurred in 1S4S! It is evident that the Court newsman has overcome whatever thore was oi tho historian in Mr. de Wertheimer.
The English translation of Mr. de Wertheimer's book is good. Tf the author had been less of a courtier wu should have ascribed to the translator the crimes of leaving out year dates, making incomplete references, and omitting a real index—for English writers are given to the commission of such tortious acts upon their readers. We think that Mr. de Wertheimer, however, is probably to be held responsible tor all the shortcomings of the book.
