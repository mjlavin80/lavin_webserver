MB. FYVIE has been very successful In compiling his book on ’* Some Famous Women of Wit and Beauty." It deals with the lives of eight famous "women, and might easily have become a mere cyclopaedic report], as bald as the average biography in a national dictionary. Instead of that, the biographies are told con amort1, the women placed before us with firm strokes and careful shading; and the result is wholly pleasing. Mrs. Fitzherberi, l^idy Hamilton, Mrs. Montagu, I,ady Blessington, Mrs. Lennox, Mrs. Grote, Mrs. Norton, and Lady Eastlake are the »*ight women described—not wholly a Georgian galaxy. All are well pictured—I>ady Hamilton possibly most satisfactorily, Mrs. Lennox-least important—with the least success. Mrs. Lennox, who is almost wholly forgotten now, and owes such fame as she has to Samuel Johnson's admiration for her, was a New Yorker, daughter of Lieut. Gov. James Ramsay. Her most successful work was ” The Femaie Quixote," published in 1752, and this, says a critic—not Mr. Fyvic - entitles her to be called a genius.. So little is known about Mrs. Lennox, as a fact, that the author of the book befnre us tells the story of the novel, that his biography may he long enough to gain admittance to his volume. Excellent portraits add to the interest of Mr. Fyvie’s collection of biog-ra phies*
