A new edition of “ Ramona ” by Helen I Hunt Jackson, (“ H. H.,”) which was I first published over twenty years ago, | will serve to remind a great many elder I people of a past pleasure. (Little; Brown 6 & Co.) No doubt It will also cause many j of these to renew the pleasure and in- I spire some younger folk, to whom the R book is entirely new, to read the pict- I uresque romance.	|
The introduction by Susan CooIIdge Is 8 a biographical sketch of Mrs, Jackson I written from the point of view of an admiring friend. “ To those who knew and loved her,” saya the biographer, '* it seems cause for just regret that a personality so unique, so vivid, and so fascinating as hers should be suffered to drop Into the oblivion which waits for ordinary lives. In these few years, even, her memory has grown dim; against our wills we are forgetting her, as the impression of a face long unseen fades till we can no more recall the exact look and smile." With such spirit In the writer it is needless to say that the Introduction is in no way critical. It la a eulogy of Helen Maria, bora Fiske, in Massachusetts In 1831, married first to Edward Bissell Hunt, United States Army, then to William Sharpless Jackson, a banker of Colorado Springs, died In San Francisco sixteen years ago. The eulogy concludes with a copy of verses. Of this story it Is I not necessary to say anything here. This | edition is printed In large type on good paper and provided with the Illustrations —most of them unusually good, made
under Mrs. Jackson’s eye by Henry Sand-hara, who also contributes an introductory note.
