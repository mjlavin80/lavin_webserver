NEARLY twenty years ago .Judge Christy of Washington completed a collection of maxims and proverbs of all ages. He was becomingly modest about his work, so far as his preface went, but the book itself was not quite what it should have been. Now it is republished, two volumes in one, unchanged, except that one cover takes the place of two covers, and that the thin paper fad has reached It. In other words, it is printed on thin paper, and bound in flexible ^leather. There is justification for thin paper and flexible leather binding; books that one carries in his pocket or handbag may well be made up with them. But there is no justification for*. their employment in the case of a seldom-used reference book.
As a fact. Judge Christy's collection Is what a bibliographer or art curator would call a "tentative list” of proverbs. In spite of the vulgar proverbs that Kay recorded In his famous collection, that list will remain the standard treasury of English adages for years to come. Judge Ray's expurgated collcction does not compare with it. The latter compiler has left out dozens of well-established adages and put in many expressions proverbial In appearance, but not yet accepted at their face value. Somo of the sayings included by him are no more proverbs, as yet, than are Mr. Dooley’s comments on current events, or Mr. Ade’s fables in slang. Then the provenance of Mr. Christy's-proverbs is not Indicated sufficiently, as a rule. Of course, one does not look for the chapter and verse of a real proverb, but where a remark is erected into a proverb by the grace of a compiler, something more definite than *' Shaks ’* or “ Dr. Johnson ” might be expected. Judge Christy groups his proverbs under many heads. Under the caption “ Exertion ” we find this:	" Roast pigeons don't fly
through the air." There are similar Infelicities of classification to be noticed. The collection needs a careful revision, and is worth It even as it stands; it contains the material for a good treasury of proverbial sayings.
