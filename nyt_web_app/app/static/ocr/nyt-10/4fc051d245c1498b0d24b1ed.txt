Emily POST, in her story of " Purple and Fine Linen," (Appleton?.) deals with the world-old questions or love and marriage, riches and happiness, and all the other things that- go to make life bearable or unbearable. Camilla James, a young1 debutante fresh from school, launches cheerfully into matrimonj. Anthony Stuart was a figure to attract and hold the attention of older and wiser women than Camilla—indeed, young, handsome, rich, and wonderfulJ3” intelligent, it is small wonder that Camilla was really madly and demonstratively fond of her husband. As for Tony, he thought Camilla a “dear kid,0 and showered her with presents and fondled her as a child would a wax doll, and never thought lo look for companionship or sympathy from her.
Of course the result is the logical thing both in lire and books; Camilla suffers from loneliness and neglect—is crushed for a time, then lives her own life in a dull, empty sort of way—soon finds the thoughts of another man crowding out tliose of her husband, and finally stands face lo face with the question of divorce.
The author's manner of handling her subject is the excuse for I he hook's e xistence. Camilla's transition from the child to the woman is not a sudden happening. but a gradual progress, brought on by surrounding conditions. It is quite easy to imagine how, if things had remained as they were in the beginning. Camilla might, have continued to be a wax doll to the end.
The book has, of course, the regulation " hangers on of society novels *’—men and women who are lnrdened, and bitter, and cynical, and clever, and flirtatious. These are thrown in in pleasing confusion and Tiake a background against which the principals stand out all tlio more clearly.
