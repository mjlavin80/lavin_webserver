Cloth* Boston: Little, Brown & Co. 51.SO.
IT Is a relief to turn from tlie long-drawn-out, complicated, and usually j tragic lives of animals as portrayed ; by so many modern nature-writers to these simple tales based upon the generally known bare facts of the babyhood of the wild folk. The stories are too meagre for grown-ups, but should be entirely satisfactory to children, all the more because an emphasis as ‘important as it is true is laid* upon the element of play in the lives of these “ wilderness babies.*' It is positively immoral to afflict childhood with such tragedies of bird and beast as have been recorded for its reading, and we gratefully welcome a book written in a different vein. "
It is important, liowevcr, that a nature-book should truly present nature, and certain slips in verity should be correctcd before another edition.
Reptiles lay their eggs in, not on, sand. (Page. 13,)
Many birds have feathers when hatched, and the megapodes of mound-bullders of Australia hatch full-winged, and are absolutely independent of their parents. (Page. 14.)
The statements that the bear is the most surly, and the wolf the most fierce, of mammals, have no foundation; they are pure fiction. (Page. 20.)
The notion of an opossum putting a wildcat to rout is hardly serious. Why did the opossum family ** play ’possum before the dogs and not before the wildcat? Does instinct in the untaught young creatures include a knowledge of such distinctions? (Page 10.)
The writer is more at home on land than in water, where she Is prone to get beyond her depth, as evidenced b> the folKS^dng examples:
Starfish ido not “ float along." They are only able to crawl slowly over the bottom by means of their myriad sucker feet. Neither can mussels swim about, except pectens, and never '* in search of food." They depend upon the currents of water to bring them aliment. (Pago 24.)
The figure of the whales, facing Pago 3G, has the wrong legend; the* “strangers " in the drawing being “ killers,'* (Page 39,) and not the herd of whales.
To make the stories quite perfect, It would be well that a naturalist should give them careful revision, so they may teach as well as charm the children, for whom they are written.
