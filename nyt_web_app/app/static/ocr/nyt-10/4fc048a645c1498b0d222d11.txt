AN attempt is made by Prof. K. Vernon Arnoid of the University College of North Wales, in his book, ** Vedic Metres," published by the Macmillan Company, to examine the differences in metre of some parts of the Rigveda, the well-known collection of hymns on the civilization of the Aryas of India and their culture and social organization, and " to see whether they can assist us to obtain an arrangement of the whole of the Rigveda. upon historical principles," the author writes in his preface.
The object of the work is ** the study of the metre of the Rigveda In connection with its history, and of the history of the Rigveda by the aid of the metre. In this study the fundamental questions which concern the metre of the Atharvaveda and other early Indian poetry are implicitly contained/’ Prof. Arnold writes:
To students of the European tradition the Rigveda is not a book, but a library and a literature. Our acquaintance with the poetry of many other countries, leads us quickly to the conviction that its ten “ Mandalas " or cycles have gathered up the work of many periods, and that the original composition of the hymns was probably the work of many centuries.
He has divided the book Into four parts —the text of the Rigveda., the metres, the rearrangement of the Rigveda In homogeneous parts, and the historical development of the art of versification. In the introductory chapter are stated the general conclusions which have been accepted or independently reached by the author and the nature of the evidence by which they are supported, and In subsequent chapters the different parts of the subject are considered in detail.
