The impressions recorded by Abb6 Ffelix Klein in his book on ** The Land of. the Strenuous Life,1' the original French of I which has already been reviewed in these columns, are appearing with the imprint of A. C. McClurg & Co. of .Chicago. The, , author voices his opinions and observations on American life and comments on each city he visited. Including New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington. He tells his purpose in the introduction:
What I proposed to myself In crossing the Atlantic was to seek in your country the_ profitable example of certain virtues which you possess in a very high degree, and ivhich we in some measure lack. As a sort of representative for a commercial establishment on the moral realm, I went to select among the various products of your land those which otirs do not supply in sufficient quantity, and upon my return to distribute them as widely as possible.
While the picture the Ab'b^ draws of Americans as a whole is flattering, he good-naturedly also shows their defects. ’"'He writes in one place:
You are a people at once energetic and tolerant; you promote without hindrance your own freedom, and you respect as sacred the freedom of all your brothers. In this at least—and it is a great deal— you deserve to be taken as the model of the world, and I count it a favor of God to have the honor to set this example before France jurft at the moment when it is most needed.
