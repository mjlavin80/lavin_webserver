The introduction to Ralph Adams Cramt volume on " The Ruined Abbeys of Great Britain,” published by James Pott & Co., sums up his judgment on the character of the monasteries in Great Britain at the time of their abolition and of the motives that led to their ruination- Toward the end he writes:
We may say, then, that the destruction of the English monasteries resulted in unnumbered murders; the reduction to beggary of 100,000 men, women, and children; the total destruction of about $200,000,OUO worth of property; the alienation to those who had no claim to it whatever of estates the rentable value of which was about $11,000,000 per year; the temporary extinction of education, mercy, and public charity; the abolition or great sections of territory and for several millions of people of the services and ministrations of religion; the eternal loss of works of art of Immeasurable value, and, as the event proved, ** the creation of a large cla-ss of poor to whose poverty was attached the stigma of crime.”
The ruins described and illustrated are Glastonbury, Whitby, Lindisfarne, Beaulieu, Netley, Tintern, Gisburgh, Bolton, Jedburgh, Kelso, Rievaulx, By land, Melrose, Dryburgh, Kirkstall, Malmsbury, York, and Fountains.
In the concluding chapter Mr. Cram, who Is the author of " Church Building '* and other books on architecture, estimates the position of the abbeys In English social and economic life and the effect of their suppression upon the moral and religious condition of the people. The book is fully illustrated and has a full Index of names and places.
