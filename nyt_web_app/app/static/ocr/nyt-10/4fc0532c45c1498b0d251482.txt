PROF. WILLIAM RIDGEWAY of the University of Cambridge, England, author of ** The Origin of Metallic Currency and Weight Standards," *' The Early Age of Greece,”.-&c., has compiled a volume on ** The Origin and Influence of the Thoroughbred Horse,” published by the Macmillan Company. He treats not only of all the chief breeds of British domestic horses known in historical times, but also takes a survey of all the other ‘living equidae, as well as of the ancestors of the genus. He has made an attempt to trace historically the origin of the various colors found, in English horses; at the same time indicating the influence exercised on the history of the chief nations of the ancient, mediaeval, and modern world by the possession of horses, especially by the acquisition of what he terms the “ Libyan ” horse. Besides all this he has "also tried to point out the lessons Of supreme importance to the breeder which can be learned from the contempla-: tion of the injury wrought to breeds of great value by the ill-judged and unscientific introduction of alien blood, a practice in no small degree due to a lack of historical knowledge, and to a general belief that all our domestic races of horses, like those of tame pigeons, have been obtained solely by artificial breeding from a single wild species." -A supplementary chapter has been included considering *' The Development of Equitation.” There are also addenda and a full index, besides numerous illustrations.
