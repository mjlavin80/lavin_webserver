The period between 1873 and 1875 is dealt with In the second volume of Gabriel Hanotaux's work on " Contemporary France,” which G. P. Putnam’s Sons have down for issue early in November. It contains the history of the first two Cabinets of the Due de Broglie and an Account of the double failure of the attempt to restore the monarchy in France. Four chapters ard devoted to the analysis of the state of public feeling In February, 1875. and to an -account of the material recovery and intellectual activity of France. This retrospective study in national psychology, the author explains in his introduction, actually extends over a period of ten years, from 1871 to 1S80.
For this reason, he has reserved Vol. Ill for the voting of the Constitution and the enterprise of May 16. With the appearance of this volume, the first part of his history—*' The History of the National Assembly ajid of the Establishment of the Third Republic in France.”—will be complete*
