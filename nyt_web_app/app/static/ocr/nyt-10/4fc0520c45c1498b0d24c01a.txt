R. . PAUL ELMER MORE'S . first two collections of crltl- * ■ cal essays marked him out as a literary critic of origi- ' nirtlty and discernment, a "“writer of siyle with an admirable equipment of learning. This third volume (“Shelburne ‘ Essays: Thlfd Series,” Putnam,) will' enhance that reputation, and it will be , agreeable and stimulating reading to those who enjoy real literary criticism in the higher sense. There Is something far-reaching in his views, something that goes beyond the immediate fashion of the hour.. He is sound and sane, and he cair penetrate sympathetically to Inner realities of the works and the men he is. stiidying. He is Independent and he-thinks for himself.
Cowper’s correspondence, Whittier the .Poet, Salnt-Beuve, *' Scotch Novels and Scotch History,"^ Swinburne, Christina 1 Rossetti, Browning’s popularity, Byron’s “ Don Juan," Laurence Sterne, and Mr. Shorthouse are the subjects on which he writes. ** The line of least resistance," he observes in his essay on Whittier,
" is what many critics have followed, without taking the trouble to form an Independent opinion; and the line of least , resistance has a miserable trick of leading us astray.” He is writing especially concerning Whittier’s “ Pennsylvania Pilgrim,” a beautiful Idyl that he considers quite the most characteristic of his works.
Whittier himself thought it perhaps the best of them; "better than 4 Snowbound,*, but nobody will find it out." The analysis of the sources of Whittier’s strengtli and weakness fn that essay Is admirable In its candor and impartiality.
It Is a far cry from the provincial poet of New England to the brilliant cosmopolitanism of Salnte-Beuvc; but here is a j theme which he treats with the same knowledge and the same kind of discrlmi- i nating judgment. Toward the subtle drawing of distinctions the bent of Sainte-Beuve’s intellect drew him, and the way his scalpel cut into the work of Hugo and Lamartine, severing what Is morbid from what is sound, causes Mr. More to exclaim: “ That is criticism.”
It is interesting to note Mr. More’s remark in closing his essay that the reason why England has never had and may never have a critic comparable to Saintc-Beuve is that the glory of English literature lies " In the very field where French is weakest, in the lonely and unsociable life of the spirit,” and the critical temperament consists primarily in just this Unking together of literature and life.
The essay on Swinburne is a severe arraignment, logically carried through from the point of view; finding much beauty of a sort in Swinburne’s " wind-swept rhapsodies,” the critic is yet left cold, and he analyzes the reasons for it: A stream of crowding, half-visualize.d abstractions, a cadenced movement developed Into a kind of giddy race, a needless reiteration of noble ideas buffeted about as by a shuttlecock, are some of the things in his poetry that make Mr. More averse to Swinburne. For him Christina Rossetti Is the purest expression fn English of the feminine genius, because of her perfectly passive attitude toward the powers that command her heart and soul—a place he cannot give to Mrs. Browning, because of the very scope attempted by her. As a result of his inquiry into Browning’s popularity, Mr. More comes to the conclusion that he is a “ false prophet,” the secret of whose esoteric fame is that he dresses a worldly and easy philosophy in the forms of spiritual life, deceiving the troubled seekers after the higher life.
