AS so often happens in present-day Action, Mrs.- Kcays’s new novel begins where those of an older fashion were wont to leave off—with the marriage of hero and heroine.
Christian Bronsart, the hero, is the son of a plutocrat, who in early life had brought about the financial ruin of John Forsythe, and. as a result, the death of Forsythe’s wife. Nevertheless, when the younger Bronsart becomes engaged to Aylmer Forsythe, the elders hide their enmity, and the course-of true love runs even more smoothly than is its wont under less inauspicious conditions. The trouble begins when'the ideals of the wife, reared by a noble Puritan father, clash with those of the easy-going young husband, whose life of luxury has gtyen him a moral myopia, and whose business ethics have distorted his conscience. Moreover, Aylmer is inspired to a championship of the down-trodden mill employes by Boothroyd, an enthusiastic Socialistic preacher. Naturally, *' ructions " follow, in which, we confess, our sneaking sympathies are inclined to go with *' the party of the other part," rather than with the high-souled Aylmer and Boothroyd. Cer talnly, the reprehensible Bronsart p&re was possessed of *' a great patience " with a particularly trying, not to say insulting, daughter-in-law; and orfe can hardly blame the devoted young husband for strenuously objecting to having his wife take into their home a woman of most evil repute. Mrs. Keays is true to the logic of events, and makes the situation end in the only possible way. Meanwhile, however, it has wrought as much mischief as was to have been expected. Wise old Forsythe gives his daughter better counsel than does the incendiary young preacher, who “ eggs her on ’’ to her course, but seems to take good care to keep out of tho fray himself.
The book will not contribute much to the solution of problems economic or marital, but it Is a strong and clever story; the Interest well sustained, despite a little too much preaching; some of the characters (why nave they all such extraordinary names?) are vivacious enough to relieve the general gravity of the situations, and all are original and vital. The purpose of the story is high. It is no small praise to say that one lays it aside with a clearer vision of the things that really matter, even though the way thereto be not made plain.
