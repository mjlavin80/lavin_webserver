TO bring together In attractive form the best texts of the lcss-l<nown English poets, and to offer mem to the public at a reasonable price—such is tho idea of the series ot books called “The Muses' Library.” Under Mr. A. H Bullen’s editorial direction, the idea has been carried out successfully; and the *' Library " now includes the works of many well-known and ipore almost forgo iten poets. Though the general editing has been in Mr. Bullen’s hands, other critics have looked after the various writers whose works compose the library. For example: William Butler Yeats edits the poems of William Blake, Prof. G. A. Aitken those of Andrew Marvell, Mrs. Meynell those of Coventry Patmore, and tho other poets are in equally capable hands.	.	.
It is interesting to note how widely popular many of the poems of the English " minor poets *' are. With the exception'of Keats and Coleridge—and we except the latter, and possibly the former, " under correction"—none of the chief metrical writers of England Is Included in “ The Muses' Library *’ thus far completed. Yet among the works of the lesser poets represented here^are found poems as unforgotten and unforgettable as any by poets who rank them in critical estimation. Edmund Waller still lives as the author of " Go, lovely rose Henry Vaughan's " They are all gone into a world of light,” still keeps e memory of tho Silurist green; Coleridge’s “ Hymn Before Sunrise in the Vale of Chamouni," Gay's ** Black-Eyed Susan," Marvell’s “ The Spacious Firmament on High," Miss Proctor’s "Lost Chord," aro till living poems of their respective writers, and more than merely remembered. ** The Muses’ Library ” brings these famjiiar poorns within reach of the many and opens-to them the gate for a fuller and more intimate acquaintance witli writers who are by no means worthy of neglect merely because they are not in the very first rank of English poets.
