SOUTH AMERICA.
A Plan for a Customs Union and Possibly for a Union of Republics.^'
ENOR SEEBER’S T>ook Is not a mere collection of stutls‘.>^s regarding the seven South American republics named in the title, or a bold comparison and setting-off of one country 8	with another. He has prepared the
volume with a great purpose in mind. and every figure and state-
Imcnt, every illustration is directed toward the realisation of that plan. His Idea is the creation of a Zollverein among' Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, extended, possibly, to Bolivia, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay, and, seemingly, though he docs not say so in words, the erection of a United States of South America. We think it sale to say that this is the final end of his plan because of hjs insistence on the succors of the German *£oll\ crein
of 18G3.	•
Being a German, or, at all events, of
Gorman ancestry, Mr. Seeber has naturally been interested in the growth of a I	united Germany out of the nearly two-
I	score separate Teutonic States in ths
short space of forty ycar^. He quotes the details of the German Zollverein, and points out the effects that it had—*' The historian TreiLschke says that at the end of the first ten years the country' hati1 at last again attained the well-being which It enjoyed before the thirty years’ war" years earlier)—and continues:
It may be easily understood how, Imbued with these principles and examples, I have conceived ideas so beneficial and grand as those which this part of South America would attain if its interests could be united for producing results similar to those which the German States obtained without ignoring the fact that circumstances would not be the same, and that the fiscal and economic convention between independent nations of different origin would liave to be less strict and to be different in detail, and even fundamentally, compared with those which it was possible to establish among confederated countrif-s. which eventually formed a single nation by. the identity of race, language, and aspirations.
The time is ripe. Hr. Seeber thinks, for moving in the matter. Argentina and
Brazil have settled their boundary disputes; Argentina and Chile have " got together," and it seems as if the questions between Bolivia, Chile, and Peru and “ the inconceivable dispute " between Bolivia and Brazil over Acre were also to be solved; and thi'n " tliis continent will be Been fr\e for many years from th^ danger of international wars." lie does not expect the plan to be adopted at once. “ The difference of race and customs, the distance, the false economic principles which prevail in most of them ” -make slow stepping unavoidable.’*
But if the idea be premature tho examination of the economic iaterests which affect every one of these countries, the study of their laws, of their riches and civilization, the comparison of their productive and economic capacities, may serve for preparing the bases of a future union, nnd what Is more important, *>f a unification of monqy. and a political entente offering greater guarantees of peaco and mutual defense against aggressions.
The aggressions, which Mr, Seeber does not expect, however, he says later, are “ foreign absorptions, conquests, and Invasions, the partition of Southern and Central America among the United States and some European States.”
To further his plan Mr. Seeber considers the >*even countries from various points of view; their population and Immigration, education. Post Office and telegraphs, railways, tariffs, imports and exports, debts, armies and navies, and other subjects of more local Importance, such sls the question of inconvertible paper money, which still troubles some of the countries.
A chapter on the capitals contains much of Interest. Of Buenos Ayres Mr. Seeber notes; '* Already there are only four cities in the world, Paris, London, Berlin, and New York, whose life rtr.d movement can astonish the inhabitants of Buenos Ayres.'* Two hundred and twelve periodicals are published there, in languages varying from English. French, and German to Basque. Scandinavian, and Arabic. The book la well Illustrated with views of the cities and industries of tho seven countries; from the titles of some of them It appears that Buenos Ayres owes much to Mr. Seeber. who founded the historical museum, built th^town or Catalina, the Galleria Florida, which houses the Museum of Pine Arts; gave his house to the university, and as Mayor of Buenos Ayres founded the zoological gardens. His plan as set forth in this volume Is Interesting and feasible. When it is carried out Seftor Seeber will deserve to rank with the Grand Old Man of Argentina, Gen. BartolomG Mitre.
