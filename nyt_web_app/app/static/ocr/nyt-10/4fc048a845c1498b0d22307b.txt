ilHE number of books tflat has appeared on Canada lately seems to Indicate that a spirit of patriotic pride In the past is	keeping	»ace	. with the
spread of	civilization into
the wilds and the extraordinary development of enterprise, *' The Makers of Canada," written by Canadians, promises to be a valuable and instructive series. It begins very appropriately with Champlain, the founder of Quebec, select-er of the site of Montreal, who may be said to have been the Father of New France.	In	his	** Life of	Lord	Elgin," Sir
John	Bourinot	remarks	that	we should
not forget to pay a tribute to the French Canadians, who built lip a province by patience and industry, in despite of the indifference and neglect of their Kings. In fact, we are struck by the Indifference fn those early days of French and English alike to the possession of a magnificent transatlantic dominion. At the retrocession of Canada, after Quebec had capitulated to Kirke, the bargaining turned on pounds and pence, on tho value of half a dozen fur stores and a couple of captured ships. It vcas against that indifference
with intrigue and corruption that the enthusiastic Champlain had to contend through a strenuous life of arduous toil and frequent disappointment; often disgusted, he never despaired, and his success was extraordinary considering his means. We do not think that Mr. Dionne praises him too highly in a volume in which the only serious fault we can find is a certain lack of sequence. Once, for example, we are puzzled to find Champlain a prisoner on a British ship when we have heard nothing of his capture. The explanation is given in the following chapter, which tells of the surrender of Quebec. That was the most trying of the great colonizing experiences, and in every respect he was an extraordinary man. He took all practical business for his province; he was statesman, politician, ex-^ plorer, cartographer, and something of a courtier as well.	,
Had his thoughts turned to the Church in place of the army he would have been the most zealous of missionaries and carried the cross into the wilds like any of the Jesuit martyrs. As it was. as a de- ! vout and bigoted Catholic he assented to the policy of Richelieu, who desired that in the New France there should be no conflict of creeds.

BUT It must be remembered that that was the time of tho wars of the religion, and that Champlain in early youth had borne arms against the Rochel-lois. We chanced lately upon a contemporary passage in the Marine Archives of Paris which confirms all that Mr. Dionne says inSiis praise;
He was the very man for such a scheme; a great courage, wisdom, piety, of great experience; a robust body which rendered him indefatigable, capable to endure hunger, heat, and cold.
Indefatigable he certainly was; eighteen times he crossed the Atlantic to seek support and fresh resources Tor the settlements he was nursing, to induce merchant capitalists to back his enterprises, to make interest at Court, and find influential patrons. With his energy and eloquence, he generally had his way, but when hfs back was turned and he had taken passage for one side or other he Invariably left trouble behind him. Sometimes. It must be owned, his settlements were ill-chosen, and the mortality among the adventurers was needlessly great. Scurvy was even a more terrible scourge on land than in overcrowded ships; and it seems strange that Champlain, a prac-.. tlcal savant, knew nothing of the Indian specific which had saved Curtice's people on a second visitation. -The mortality was great, and the misfortune was that colonists only came out by driblets till Richelieu’s Company of the '* Hundred Associates " took the matter more seriously in hand. Champlain's slender forces were perhaps his best apology for engaging in the barbarous Indian wars and aiding the Hurons against the Iroquois. He had to choose between fighting with the savages or against them, and. indirectly the gain was great, for it enabled him to prospect and survey a vast extent of country. Later, when he reluctantly capitulated to Klrke, in the hamlet he had stockaded on the heights of Quebec, he had barely forty fighting men under his command. His own fortunes and those of his friends and partners fluctuated as monopolies were granted or withdrawn. It seems even now a question, as matter of public policy, how

far those monopolies were wise or the reverse. On the one hand, they were almost indispensable to a private company with limited means; on the other, when they were withdrawn, a great impulse was
given to general trade. In every case Champlain, as deputy of the King's Lieutenant, whose solo function seems to have teen to draw pay and sell places, had endless trouble with the agents and clerks of the Norman and Breton traders. No man had done more to encourage the trade which was to be the life of the colony, for no man had greater influence with the Indians. If he was calumniated and cursed in life, he died universally regretted, for even his unfriends realized their loss, and now a stately monument In his own city of Quebec records his deeds and commemorates his virtues. His will was probably dictated on his deathbed by his father confessor, for in contrast to all the actions of a noble life, it sets legality and natural affect inn alike at defiance.
SIR JOHN BOURINOT’S life of Lord Elgin is as eulogistic as that of I	Champlain. It supplements the re-
1 cent biography by Mr. Wrong, and it only | concerns itself with Lord Elgin’s administration of Canada. Even so. It is less of a life than a study of Canadian politics, and few men understood them in all their details more thoroughly than the late Sir John. He traces besides with fair impartiality the embarrassing social conditions—notably the institutions and sentiments, the legacy of the French regime, with which Lord Elgin had to deal. It was his Lordship’s lot to be Invariably charged with delicate missions. In Jamaica, China, Japan, and the India of the Mutiny, when a brilliant career was pre-| maturely cut short. But of all the posts he was sent to fill, that of Canada seemed ! the least enviable. Sir John Bourinot's j laudation might appear excessive, for he I presents an almost perfect character and ; an ideal statesman.
j Tet the testimony of Mr. Buchanan when 1 American Minister in London, who had : often transacted business with the Canadian Governor, was scarcely less flattering, and during the first years of the Governor Generalship English and American relations had been severely strained. When Lord Elgin landed In Quebec the country was slowly recovering from the ravages of the recent rebellion, and racial animosities were at fever heat. The French of the lower province had been goaded Into revolt by what they rightly called the working of a Constitution. Their grievances had been recognized, the Constitution had been remodeled, and the now Governor was there to apply the principles Lord Durham had advocated. From the first ^ie rose superior to party, and, though his own sympathies were notoriously with the Conservatives, he always held to the principle that the strongest political party must have the conduct of affairs.
The French Canadians, who had complained of exclusion from power, were conciliated by a fair share of the administration. Generally, and with good reason, the most popular of Governors, there was a time when he provoked a storm of unpopularity, which put his life in actual peril and gave him an opportunity of proving the courage which had been questioned. It was as to indemnifying for their losses men who had been actually in revolt or were notoriously rebel sympathizers, and when the Governor gave'his assent to the bill of Indemnity the policy may.have been a prudent one. But to sufferers smarting from wrongs it naturally seemed overgenerous, and we cannot agree with Sir John when he asserts that the opposition led by Sir Allan McNab was not one of principle.
NOR was it only with political complications he had to deal. The economic situation was bad as could be, trade was paralyzed, commerce was languishing, and by the crushing navigation laws and the new free-trade legislation the country was being brought to the verge of bankruptcy. Even the loyal English, in disgust at disregarded appeals, were turning their thoughts to annexation to the States. That. Lord Elgin determined, must be avoided at any cost, If his counsels could influence the home ‘Government, It was thanks to him, though only after some years, that the navigation laws were repealed—It was he whose tactful diplomacy negotiated the reciprocity treaty at Washington—floated In champagne, as Laurence Ollphant said —an episode barely touched by Sir John, but which deserved more elaborate notice. Profoundly interested in the future of Canada, an imperialist before the word had be^n invented, when answering a mischievous speech of the Premier, Lord John Russell, he declared It to be an un- ■ sound and dangerous theory that British colonies could not attain maturity without separation. Finally, In his prescience of the grand possibilities of the future, he gave a great Impulse to the railways construction and other public works which are making such marvelous progress in our time. In truth, we may agree with Sir ^Tohn Bourinot that In all circumstances and in every clime- he was one of' the greatest of English Viceroys.
