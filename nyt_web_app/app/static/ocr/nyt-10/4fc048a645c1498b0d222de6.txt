New York Time# Saturday Review of Books:
I g m surprised to see no comment from your readers in answer to your little arti-j cle about Mr. Bernard Shaw. I wish ! there had been more of it. Truly, " Mr. Shaw has made himself too big a problem in literature to be treated with anything but gravity,” since he has found a following both for his artistic and moral belief, j Perhaps “ belief ” is too definite a word to use about any of the opinions of G. B. S. Still, I think tha-t his moral and artistic ideals might be thus condensed: Anything is right if you can prove it so with clever epigrams, anything is beautiful if it is unexpected enough to dazzle your hearers. It is rather a dangerous thing to set up cleverness as the highest aim of literature. If even a few young people take him seriously, the result is likely to be a writing and a reading of books which will resemble the *' Dyspeptic Philosophy ** and " Musings of a Cynic " in the Sunday papers. Most people can acquire these mental acrobatic feats, but fortunately most minds are not quite so double-jointed as Mr. Shaw's.
He wants the old-fashioned but very convincing quality of truth, not especially truth of character or situation, for these are unimportant, but truth of feeling. By and by he will be found out. But so long as one person takes him seriously, either in his art or his opinion, I believe him to be doing the most harm when he is at his best.	JPJSSJE	E.	SAMPTER.
