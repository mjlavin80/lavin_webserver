'-pHIS book, by Prof. Prank W. Black-
I mar of the University of Kansas, ■which the Macmillan Company Is issuing In The Citizen’s Library, presents a brief outline of sociology founded on the principles established by standard authorities on the subject. It is intended to be a " working manual " for the student. In the first part are discussed the nature and import of sociology—social life In general, the definition and scope of sociology, and the purpose and method. Book II., on “ Social Evolution,” gives a. general description of the origin and development of human society, and prepares the way to the study, in Book.III., of ''Socialization and Social Control.'* The fourth section treats of social theory and the " tclic ” force of social life, showing the power of society to reform or devote itself along specific lines of conduct. In following chapters are treated the abnormal conditions of society, the encouragement of sociological investigation, closing with a brief review of the progress of sociological thought. The references provided by Prof. Blackmar at the end of each chapter are for further study.
While including much preparatory material that might not be found in a critical study of pure sociology, “ The Elements of Sociology ” does not contain, the author points out in his preface, ** the elaboration of many interesting theories and scientific discussions that might properly appear in an extended treatise on sociology."
