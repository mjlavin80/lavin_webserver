Margaret Westrup’s Nfcw Story of an Entertaining Little Boy.^
;OM its capitally descriptive cover to Its very last word '* The Coming of Billy," by Margaret Westrup, is for once in a way a delightful ! and refreshing contrast to the sensations and problems that make up *s° large a part of present-day fiction, and is well worthy of a place in the not very lengthy ; list of classics in child study* Billy Is not at all like tho ordinary property child that appears now and then in stories about j grown-ups, plays his Utile part, and then , disappears. BHly holds the centre of the
stage in this book, and any grown-ups [ that it contains serve merely as the accessories in the development of Billy s I character and attainments. The best of it is that Billy does not grow up, at least not within the limits of the story.
Billy is a very little boy who is sent ! home from India to grow up in the care of his five maiden aunts in a small Eng lish village. Aunt Agatha is typically stiff and prim and opinionated, Aunt Primrose, sweet and lovable, and the i three intermediates, just echoes of Sister Agatha, not even designated by names of their onn. As their knowledge of boys was entirely summed up in more or less hazy recollections of the childhood of I their brother, Billy's father, the small ; boy’s arrival was the occasion of much excitrment and of minute planning as to what should be done with him. Aunt Agatha went to the station to meet him with the governess’s cart, expecting tr ^ I hold him on her lap and console him for homcsicknoss, but she found a sturdy I offish, capable little lad who systematically resisted both then and ever after . all attempts to " babby ” him and played 1 the gentleman to the best of his ability.
I Subsequent happenings all hinge on the irresistible mixture in Billy of the born , gentleman and the ineradicable boy, and ; the utter inability of all but Primrose f among the aunts to comprehend him or | reach the really homesick, yearning little : heart concealed under his very thorny ex-| terior manner. By implication Primrose's superior sympathy and insight is explained by her being youthful enough to engage in a romance with the curate, the I happy conclusion of which, by tho way, l is brought about by a wonderfully ingenious plan of Billy's and almost at the
: cost of his life,
Billy’s pranks, Billy's troubles, and Billy's disciplining at the hands of his well-meaning but inexperienced aunties make up a delightfully humorous story that is told with a wholly charming grace and simplicity. Incidentally, there is a little girl who bears a large part in the doings of Billy, and is just as much a, work of art as Miss Westrup’s hero.
