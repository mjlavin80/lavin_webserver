LIFE IN THE ZOO
SA-ZADA 'FALKS. By W_ A. Fraser. llliis-irau^i by Arthur Hemlns. Cloih, 1-mo. Scribner?.	$11.
A NOVEL, sort of beast book is this, w^ere the prisoners of a Zoo, among them Bagheela the tiger, Pardus the panther, and Hansor the Laugher or hyena, gather peaceably together and at the inspiration of Sa-Zada, their keeper, rehearse their pasts.
Undoubtedly a leopard cannot change his spots, but we are almost convinced that a man can get inside a leopard's skin and tell iis how those spots feel. Mr. Fraser at least can tell us how the famous jungle people and other wild folk, both of the " blood kind ’’ and of the
" peace kind." - feel about Zoo life, and what were their habits and eccentricities before their capture.
Not one of these “ dwellers in Animal Town " but has had some exciting adventure, and the author’s knowledge of natural history, his skill in story telling, and his humorous sympathy, enable him to thrill the lover of forest 'creatures and even to thrall jaded readers who may scorn all popular nature books.
