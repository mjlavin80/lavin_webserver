Bullen an cl Melville
Kcic York Timed Saturday Rcvicio of Boohs:
I am very glad that Mr. Prank Bullen made an exception to his rule, by writing the letter in the last number of The New York Times book Review. Glad also that he did not read *' Moby Dick ” before he wrote “ The Cruise of the Cachalot.” The world would have been the loser indeed If the latter book had not been written. Melville's book simply carried me away. " The Cruise of the Cachalot ” I had read several times before I read "Moby Dick," and am ready to readmit as many times again, after having read the older book. I think in these days everybody prefers a well-written narrative ot facts to a poem as a steady diet. Although Mr. Bullen has no reason to be as modest as he expresses himself, it is pleasant to know that he was misrepresented in the quotations, one of which 1 used at second or third hand. M. U. O.
