“ANIMAL HEROES."
Ernest Thompson seton’s new
boQ^c of animal stories, which contains the '* Histories of a Cat, a Dog, a Pigeon, a Lynx, Two Wolves, and a Reindeer," is out this week with the im-jirint of Charles Scribner’s Sons. Every one of the stories, writes the author in his prefatory note, though more or less composite, is founded on the actual life of a veritable animal hero." He continues:
The most composite is the White Reindeer. This story I wrote at Utrovand in Norway, during the Summer of 1900, whMe the reindeer herds grazed in sight on the near-by uplands. The Lypx is founded on some of my own early experiences in the backwoods. It is less than ten yeajs slnco the “ Jack Warhorse ” won his hero crown. Thousands of ’* Kaskadoans *’ will remember him, and by the name ** War-horse ” his coursing exploits are recorded in several dally papers. The least com- i posite is Arnaux, (** The Chronicle of a Homing Pigeon.”) It is so nearly historical that several who knew -the bird have supplied additional items of information. The nest of the destroying peregrines, with its owners and their young, is now to be seen in the American Museum ol‘ Natural History of^New York.
There are over 200 drawings in the book 1 made by the author himself. They include , a number offull-page pictures and mar- I ginal illustrations on every page. They hove been inserted, as stated on the title page, " in elucidation ** of the “ histories " of the various “ Animal Heroes.”
