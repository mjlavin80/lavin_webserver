THIS book is a collection of biographical sketches relating to the chief personages in England at the time of the civil war. The only connection that binds them together is the common period of which they treat and the historical thread that runs through them. The political, military, religious, literary, and social figures of the time are all illustrated in these essays, which, taken altogether* thus present in a way a sort of picture of the moving forces of the period. They are well and clearly written and without bias. There is appreciation and understanding for the principles and point of view of Roundhead and Cavalier alike.
Thus Charles I.’s personal valor and true religious devotion, nis patience and dignity as a royal captive, are recognized, not less than his weakness and perfidiousness. and the narrowness of his understanding that cost him his throne anti his life. The sketch of Cromwell is brief and does justice to that iron character which " waged war on the whole with mercy and moderation," and which trained him after forty to be first an excellent soldier, then all able and successful General, and the founder of the New Model army. As Protector his endeavor was conscientious to build up again the Institutions of his country as they had been In earlier days. Then we come again to the Cavaliers, and for them Mrs, Boas evidently has a soft spot in her heart, as for them who have kept alive the noblest side of the Bnglish “ loyal passion for our temperate Kings.” She has an entertaining account of the manners of the time, and then sketches the three chief Generals of Charles’s forces, Prince Rupert, Montrose, and Goring.
In depicting the Puritan she tries to keep to the hither side of the extremist type; for the word has been made to cover a wide significance. John Hampden and Col. Hutchinson are the men the author chooses for its illustration.
Strange contrasts in the religious activities of the time are afforded by a consideration of the careers of Laud, Bishop Juxon, Bunyan, Jeremy Taylor, George Fox, George Herbert, and Lord Falkland. Among the secular writers are Lord Clarendon, historian of the civil war, and Sir Thomas Browne, whose minute learning and strange mixture of dreamy faith and fantastic imagery have- been the delight of his admirers, and are to-day. There is also a chapter upon the poets—Waller, Carew, Herrick, Lovelace. Suckling, the Court poets; Vaughan, Traherne, and ^Crashaw, the religious; while there is a closing chapter devoted to Milton.-*"
Mrs. Boas's literary criticism has no claim to distinction or original insight. Nor has her narrative, either biographical or historical, great and unusual force or illumination. But she has written soundly and soberly and from abundance of information. She has not made her work abstruse, and it is a clear and consistent account of a momentous period in English history.
