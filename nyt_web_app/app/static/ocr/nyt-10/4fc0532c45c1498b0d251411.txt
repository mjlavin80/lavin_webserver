Sara Crewe Agaiji—Some cf the Many New Juveniles of 1905.
1.
LEN one is beginning 10 talk of the* children's holiday books there is difficulty in deciding which one to lake up first. Shall it be a boy’s book, a girl’s book, a serious one or a frivolous one, or which one of all is the most interesting? In looking through the first arrivals this year there is no doubt as to which this important first one is. It is " Little Princess,” by Frances Hodgson Burnett, (Scribner's, ?2,) with illustrations by Ethel Franklin Betts. “ The Little Princess" is ‘ The Whole Story of Sara Crewe, Told for the First Time," a delightful story told as only Mrs. Burnett coul^ toll it, bound in the prettiest of covers.
and the colored pictures so charming that they are almost as good as the story, which is saying a great deal.
Mrs. Burnett, in the preface, tells how the book came to be written. There is always, she says, in every story a grcaL deal more than Is ever written. So when she came to make a play from the book which told the first part of the history of Sara Crewe she found “ three acts full of things and girls who had been at Miss Minchin’s school whom she had never known.” Then, when the children of New York liked the play of " The Little Princess ” and laughed and cried over it, the publishers asked Mr?. Burnett to rewrite the story of Sara Crewe, including the new parts in the play, which she did, adding still more of the little girl’s history, which had been hidden all the lime somewhere far back in her brain.
The result is a story which every little girl wiJI read many times, which her papa and mamma will read, too, and possibly the brothers of the family, though it is not always possible to prophesy about boys. There are tears in the book, also many smiles, many beautiful thoughts, and all the fascinating make-believes, as well as real mysteries that any little sirl could desire. There is a delightful ending, and in the pictures the little princess, or Sara Crewe, looks as every one knows she must have looked.
Many lands have been called upon for stories for Esther Singleton's " The Wild Flower Fairy Book," (.Dodd, Mead & Co., There are a couple of dozen of them, altogether, coming from Hindu and Arabia, from Japan and China, from Norway, Denmark, and different European countries. A number of them are familiar, Tom Thumb and the Sleeping Beauty among them, but told a liftle differently, and one never tires of. reading fairy stories of any kind. Thefre are many interesting colored illustrations by Charles Burkles Falls, and the wild flowers which give the book its name nre drawn in outline, running through the text and covering each page.
One very interesting book this year will please the little girl who has long been too old for mud pies and who still likes to make things if she can only cook them In a real oven. The book is called " A Little Cook Book for a Little Giri.” It is by the author of ** Gala Day Luncheons," (Dana Estes & Co. 75 cents.)
The introduction is a story in itself. It tells how a little girl named Margaret tried very hard to cook from recipes that she saw in the grown-up cook books. But she found nothing but big names and impossible dishes. There were mousses and timbales and sautes, which, when she tried them, turned out to be very drc-adful indeed. All the grown people said: " When you are older we will teach you to cook.” but Margaret wished to learn immediately. Then the nicest thing that could have happened came to her. She had a birthday, and her presents were cooking utensils. There was an oilcloth covered table, bright tins, spoons, toasting forks, little gingham cooking aprons, and a cook book all her own. This is the book which tells of nice things to make for breakfast, luncheon, and dinner. The recipes are all comparatively easy. The book is dedicated to ( “ Katherine. Monica, and Betty, three little girls who love to do little sirl cooking.*’
A LIBRARY of six books, in a pretty little book case, will be one of the attractive additions to the little people's collections of stories this year. Thre^ volumes contain fairy tales, one " Little Black Sambo.’’ one “ The Night Before Christmas,” and the ” Animal A, B, C.” is in another. The bookcase is of !
I
cardboard representing smoked oak, with j an imitation glass door. The covers of the book are in lively tones, and the ilhis- j trations are in gay colors. An Introduc- 1 tion to each volume is written by L. Frank Baum, (Reilly & Britton Company, Chicago.) It is called the Christinas Stocking Series, and the books are each about three inches tall.
" Stories of King Arthur's Knights ” is ; a pretty little book of tales of the Round
Table by Mary MacGregor, with lllus-tlons in color by Katharine Cameron, (E. P. Dutton & Co., r»0 cents.) A companion book by the same publisher at the same price Is ** Stories of Robin Hood,” by H. E. Marshall, illustrated by A. S. Forrest,
In “ The Child’s Dickens ” the stories of “ David Copperfield ” and ” Oliver Twist ” are retold by Annie Douglas Severance, (American Book Company.) The stories are much condensed, the two being told in 100 pages. A small portrait of Dickens, surrounded by many smaller Oliver Twists, forms a part of the decorations of the green linen cover. A very nice little book for very nice little boys is Burges Johnson's “Rhymes of Little Boys.” (Crowell, $1.) The small boys cither talk themselves in the rhymes or are talked about. Many of the rhymes have already appeared in different magazines. The illustrations are confined to the title page and inside the two covers, but they are worth while—small boys and sunflowers in colors. The cover is good, a fine, red plaid gingham, over boards.
Companion volumes, intended to give the little people an idea of the manners and customs of their small cousins across the water, are " Our Little French Cousin," by Blanche McManus, and “ Our Little Korean Cousin,” by H. Lee M. Pike. (L. C. Page& Co., each 60 cents.) They are entertainingly written, and ' vitb pictures.

There are many illustrations, and the greater number of them are sewed in to add to the serviceable qualities of the book. This Is the first volume of a series of historical stories. (Century Company, (J5 cents.) There are 179 pages.
” The Runaway Donkey and Other Rhymes,” by Emilie Poulsson, illustrated by L. J. Bridgeman, (Lothrop, Lee & Shepard Company, 51.50,) is a good sized square book of SI pages of heavy paper, large type, and many pictures. Most of the rhymes are about animals, and an Interesting one is the history of the coasting experiment of two little girls who hitch the donkey to the sled and try to make him drag them up the hill. Miss Poulsson is the author of the popular ” Finger Plays ” for the kindergarten.
A little larger than the donkey book is that containing the history of " The Yellow Cat and Some Friends,” by Grace V. R. Dwight, illustrated by Edith Dimock, (Appleton, $3.50.) These are different stories, in prose, very nice stories, too, and every child will be delighted with the pictures.
" Forest Land ” is another of the thick, square books of fine typographical appearance. It is a nature book, a continuous story in several chapters by Robert W. Chambers. The full-page colored and smaller black and white pictures are by Emily Benson Knipe. (D. Appleton & Co.)

‘‘ The Woozlebcasts,” by J. P. Benson, (Moffat, Yard & Co., $1.25,) is one of the modern wonder books for children. It is bound in yellow linen-covered boards, and has a single verse telling of each of the monsters depicted, while on the opposite page the creature is pictured in buff and

All sorts and kinds of other interesting things happen, and finally Ben goes into business. (Lothrop Publishing Company, $1.50.)

The young people find themselves in a little French village and have all sorts and kinds of good times. There is a race on logs in a shallow river where Janet and Paul pole themselves along, which is particularly jolly. Sidney, the heroine of the book, is a very "good sort” of girl; there is an invalid young man cousin around whom the narrative of the story is woven; there is pretty and self-sufficient Judith who comes out in the end a much nicer girl than she promised; there are the little people, Ruth and Bungay, to add to the fun; there is a satisfactory end and promises of more good times in the future.

A PLEASANT way for any boy or girl to get acquainted with the sixteenth century is to read “ The Queen’s Page," by Cornelia Baker, with illustrations by Fanny Y. Cory. (Bobbs, Merrill & Co.) Pedro de Valesco and his twin sister Petronilla are as beautiful as two children ought to be, and as healthy and happy. They are ten when the story starts, and they live in a lonely old castle in Navarre. The romance begins when a fairy godmother of a Marquise comes and carries them off to court. What the children wore, what they ate, in what wondrous chateaux they stayed, how the Queen spoke to them, and how, indeed, Pedro came to please her so well that she made him her own page—these things, and many more besides, can be learned from the magic pages of the book.
Let no boy or girl suppose ** An Island in the Air” by Ernest Ingersoll (Macmillan) was written just to amuse. It seeks to combine amusement with instruction in geology, archaeology, and the use of drugs. A camping pnrtv is cut off for a time from the woria anil provided with a young doctor just out of college and hospital for its leader. The others are his brother, his sisters,
and a hired man. The scene is the West * —among the Rocky Mountains—and the time it>53. Capt. Richard Manning of Kentucky is traveling to California, with his family and servants including a negro cook. They have a " prairie schooner ’j drawn by oxen and an ” ambulance ” drawn by mules. Some of theirt are mounted on horses. The ox wagon .stops with the elders at a certain place for repairs. The young people going ahead with the lighter part of tne gear are cut off by a landslide, which shuts them in upon a table land with steep sides all around. They hunt, find an ancient Indian village, rescue an aged medicine man or priest (who has just been bitten by a rattlesnake.) have a touch of mountain fever, (to show how fever should be treated), and at last find a way down from their “ Island in the Air," and are almost captured by Navajos. They arc just standing off these * redskins for the ltw~t time in fact when a bugle sings on the breeze and Uncle Sam’s cavalry’ gallops to the rescue.	'
