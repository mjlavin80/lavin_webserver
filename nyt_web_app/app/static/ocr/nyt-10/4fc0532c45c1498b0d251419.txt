SiPRS *■ tVsiime and I,ilii*s," which gives tlie tiiie to the eighth volume of Messrs. K. T. Conji aiul Alc.vandfr Wr'dtlrrbtim’s now tuition of Ruskin, (Longmans.) the voL umc rr.ntnins “The Kth~ ic.s	of the	Dust,”	“ Tho	Ce.'tus of
Aglaia,” " Tho Crown of Wild Olive,1’ "The Qm*en of'the Air,’* “The Story of Arachne.” and “ The Tortoise Of Aegina ”
—all	written	or composed primarily for
oral delivery—besides a large number of letters and extracts from diaries which form	a most valuable	addition	to Ruskin-
ana.	Nearly	all this	material	was writ- !
ten. in original or in completed form, between. lStM and 1870. a period covering the interval between the death of Ruskin's father and his entering the Slade Professorship at Oxford. But not only should Ruskin's mental state—sad yet hopeful, still fanciful 3'et yearning toward the useful and practical—be borne in mind by readers of this volume, but also the in-toihctual condition of the times in which its pages were penned.
From Greek art and Egyptian mythology the great art critic, who would be accepted as a political economist, passes to female education, the duties of soldiers, the treatment of domestics, and the virtues of co-operative Socialism. He was, indeed, well worthy of the t«rm which he applied to himself at this time, a man of “incurably de.-ultory character'*; still his uncertainties of vision and his mean-derings in the realm of sociology were never quite conclusive—even to himself. Better than his admiring contemporaries, and as well as his critics of forty years later, he understood that what he called the “ vital truths of economic, social, and ethical modern England,” savored of the *' paradoxical and the impracticable.” His theories were in advance of public opinion; his suggestions for applying them untried or long since exploded.
To persons who are already familiar with the essays in these volumes the added letter?, whether public and. controversial or personal and explanatory, will prove a most absorbing series o£ illuminating human documents. Through his father's death Ruskin inherited £l*-iO,OW, together with other property, including art treasures valued at £10,000 more. A few days after, realizing that he had now an abundance with which he might carry out his most fantastic dreams for revolutionizing English art and reforming the British body politic, he wrote to Prof. Aclaud of Oxford:
You never have had—nor, with all your medical experience, have probably never seen— the loss of a father who would have sacrificed his life for his son, and yet who forced his son to sacrifice his life to him, and >-«st sacrifice it in vain.
Those who are familiar with ” Modern Painters " will cry out against this appalling injustice, and yet many things are explained by it which have so far remained hidden in ” Sesame and Lilies.”
