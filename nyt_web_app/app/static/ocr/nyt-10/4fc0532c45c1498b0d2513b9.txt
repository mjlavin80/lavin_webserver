MR. STRINGEJR is-versatile; a writer of good verse, -with an earlier prose Reduction of a strong psyehologi-cal study to his credit, he has now written the entertaining- story of the youthful adventures of Lonely O’Malley, that strange mixture of the young savage and angel which characterizes the real hoy.
Lonely, a corruption of his mother’s family patronymic of Lomely, had his own pathetic story of how lie came by that strange name. He hunclied up his shoulder * and squinted a little—" always an ominous sign to those who knew him.**	.
** I was Horn twins, at first,” he explained feelingly, ** but the other one of us he up an' died, and left me all alone!
*	* * Then the doctor he wrapped me up In a blanket and he brung me over to maw, an" he put me in the bed next to her, an' he fiays, * this lonely Ifttle fellow, you’ll have him to look after.’ AJi’ maw she said, * Poor lonely little fellow.* An’ she says it kind o* stuck, that word, and so she just called me Lonely right along.'*
When Lonely saw red he murdered truth, and he saw "red very often in the course of his young life. His father kept a bakesnop and he won easy laurels as a hero who was forced to lick out all the maple sugar pans and eat all left-over chocolate mice.
“ Why,** proceeded Lonely, seeing red*
*	* • why, all I got to do is to take a
&hd sit idown an’ . cat w’at I want. But ; choc'lato ’mice are* what take me!
*	I * * So soft an’ mushy' Inside,- an’ then * the taste o’ the choc’late kind o’ mixed In with it.** He fqlt in his pocket y/ith a sudden remembering hand. ’* Gee! I had six or seven in there a few minutes ago!' Must have forgot an" eaten ’em ail up, 1 guess.1
“ * 0 * Why, Pop comes-out o’ the bake-oven an’ says to me, kind o’ cross, too, * Lonely, why ain't you eaten' that maple sugar up, so as your maw. can wash the pans out? You finish up them choC-lale mice,’ he says, 'before you-.go- out an’ play this morning! ’ An’ of course I’ve got to eat ’em—got to, whether I want to or not.*'	.	-
** But, Lonely,” interposed Annie CH&a, Quite impersonally and innocently, ’* don’t you ever feel like getting some one to help you? ’’	.	w .
’* How d* you mean? *’
" Why, when he’s mad about you’re not doing them kind o* things fast enough! "
’* Nope,” said Lonely. ** Pop don’t like folks round the shop/’
But Lonely’s triumph was short lived, for Annie Eliza and an intimate friend .went into the shop one day to make penny puj-chases and heard Lonely in the back room begging in vain for a pan to lick.
We eagerly follow Lonely indefinitely through all his adventures; through his triumphs and bis humiliations; through his doubts and his queer, strange, tortuous methods of reasoning; through his mad, imaginative wanderings from the narrow path of truth, a 1 his wicked foraging of apple orchards und his killing of neighboring chickens, and—but the list grows and grows, and we are really sorry when at last Mr. Stringer leaves our ragged little hero standing a bero indeed— uneasy beneath the weight of the laurels thrust upon him.
