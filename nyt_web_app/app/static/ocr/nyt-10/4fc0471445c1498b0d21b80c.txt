T is not as we feared. Pye-croft does not appear in the story. The date is A. D. 2025, and Pyecroft, happily, has been “ re-enlarged upon the earth/’ Capt. Hodgson and Capt. Pumall, who command the night mail from the London General Post Office tower in London to Quebec, one gusty Winter night, through atmos-_ pheric disturbances only a poet could Imagine aad only an inspired student of meteorology and modem engineering could describe, are both " re-enlarged,” highly developed Pyecrofts, men of the bright future. And let the quarrelsome malcontents who are forever trying to stay the march of progress with their howls for “ peace ” take notice that in the year 2025 war is to be a thing of the past. Truly, Mr. Kipling's story in the November McClure’s is a wonderful story, a work of genius, representing, perhaps, his greatest imaginative flight. Do not try to read it with a dictionary of technical terms at hand. Do not try vainly to measure and weigh all its statements. Let your own imagination be guided solely by that of the poet's, fo'r poet Kipling is, once more, In this tale. Do not, we beg of you, try to comprehend the Fleury ray, Mag-niac’s bow rudder, or Castelli’s *' gull-wing curra” They are tkere vividly before you, and you know in your heart that you cannot comprehend the Marconi system. The cloud-breaking lights, the diamond shaft bearings are actualities in the story about which you need make no inquiries. The charm is all in the swift movement, the marvelously imagined fight with the currents, the prodigious moving picture comprehending the deveCopments of air navigation, deep-sea navigation, the giant growth of ocean traffic, which may all come to pass if our civilization receive no set-back, and the suggestion, so artistically conveyed, of the effect on humanity of this tremendous scientific advancement. Moreover, the story is essentially a story, well wrought and full of real human interest.
WE have so frequently taken exception to Mr. ECrwin Abbey’s illustrations of Shakespeare’s plays, as they have appeared from time to time in Harper's Monthly, (not as pictures, for they are not* often open to criticism on technical grounds, but simply as interpretations of the poet,) that the rare spirit and just interpretative quality of the plates depicting scenes in "King Henry VI.: Parts 2 and 3,” in the November Harper seem to demand a special note of praise. The subjects are well chosen, the personages well portrayed. Perhaps because few of us have formed ideals of the sixth Henry, his dangerous Queen, Warwick, and the others in the York and Lancaster cycle of plays, the artist’s work in treating them is not so difficult. These historical dramas, reflecting the Tudor idea of happenings that led to the Tudor's seizure of the crown, form a most interesting and too generally neglected subject for critical discussion. The comment of Ernest Rhys, which accompanies Mr. Abbey's pictures, is judicious and discerning.
The question of the’uiixed authorship' he handles boldly; and' few. will question' his Judgment that the genius of Mar--lowe shines strongly- throughout the: triology and that Shakespeare corrected
and adapted and rewrote. Peele and

Greene almost certainly had a hand in ' the authorship.
THE death of Jos£ Maria de Heredia, the sonneteer, whose literary fame rests on one volume of perfect verse, has left a vacant chair in the French Academy. A movement has already been vigorously set on foot in Paris to secure the honor for Catulle Mendcs, and this, in its . turn, has caused a little outbreak, even in the • ■
French capital, of what Mr. Bernard Shaw calls ** Comstockery.” There are actually men of letters in France who object to indecent ^literature, and Men-des, brilliant as he is, has often seemed to be pursuing dirt for dirt’s sake. To be sure, he is a real poet, and he has many stanch adherents. Mendes, is now about 04 years, old. He has published much, and his prose is considered, inferior to his polished verse. He was once the husband of Judith Gautier.
IN the “ Handy Volume Classics ” (Crowell) we have “ Selections from the Writings of Benjamin Franklin,” edited by U. Waldo Cutler. The editor is at pains to tell us in his introduction that Benjamin Franklin shared “ the highest honors in English literature of the eighteenth century” with Samuel Johnson and Jonathan Edwards. He has two pages or more devoted to the ** contrasts ” and “ likenesses ” in the careers of these three; Of course this sort of thing is worse than useless, and poor stuff to put in the hands of young students. But the selections in the book are well chosen. There are passages from “ Poor Richard’s Almanack ” to begin with; some of Franklin's newspaper contributions, passages from his correspondence and state papers. Another volume in the same series contains “ One Hundred Best American Poems,” selected by John R. Howard, which is a tasteful and useful compilation.
LAURENCE STERNE may or may not be read nowadays. He certainly is not as “ popular ’’ as Bernard Shaw, and for that we can see no cause for regret. But Sterne is indubitably a classic, and there is much charm in his writing which the ages have not dispelled. One may not call himself cultivated in English literature who does not know Sterne. Wherefore the two new editions of his writings are both welcome. The first, a dainty, thin-paper volume of the Newnes Cax-ton series (imported by Scribner) contains both " The Life and Opinions nf Tristram Shandy, Gent ” and “ A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy,” with a portrait of the author and nothing by way of commentary— neither introduction nor note. It is a tasteful and handy volume to have and to keep. A veritable edition de luxe of the “ Sentimental Journey ” comes from Houghton, Mifflin &.Co. in an octavo volume, bound in leather-backed boards, printed on hand-made paper, from special type. This is a book to serve as a choice gift for a man of culture, a fit setting for matter of undying literary worth. The edition is limited, of course, and the price is high, ($7.50,) but no one who Is likely to think of buying the book will think it too expensive.
MR. CLEMENT SHORTER’S new book on the/ Brontes, which we review this week, comes pat with the belated commemoration in England of the fiftieth anniversary of the death of the author of “Jane Eyre.” This occurred the other day, six months after the right date, in the rebuilt parish church at Haworth, and the inevitable address was made by Mr. Ernest de Selincourt, whose admirable new edition of the poems of John Keats wo
ite^ewedlast^weefeife franks two; of the 'Brqnt&s, Charlottei : and Emily, with Dickens and Thackeray among the novelists of the mid-* •Victorian era; He accords the sisters this high honor, and assumes that the rest of us have done so, because of “the passionate intensity witli which the writers recalled their inner experience.” Their vfork, he declared, had “an essentially lyrical quality.” A poetic atmosphere “ brooded ” over their novels. We* fear this is “ academic ” criticism, and will never reach the mind of the multitude. The absurdity of some of the details in Charlotte’s novels, especially in “ Jane Eyre,” he contended, was redeemed by their essential truth. This is clearer and more comprehensible. She had inborn knowledge of the human soul, but knew too little of manners and customs. But the consideration of Charlotte Bronte's genius, it seems, must still provoke rhapsodical language and cryptic comparisons.
A WORLD WITHOUT A CHILD,” by Coulson Kernahan, CRevell,) is a tract written in a somewhat inflated and artificial manner, and dealing with the theme, which President Roosevelt has pladed prominently for public consideration. We have no objection whatever to grave discussion of this subject, but the reading of a few pages suffices to show that Coulson Kernahan, though he may be perfectly sincere, has pitched his song of woe in a false key. He is intensely religious, and his book may please folks who like to have religion treated of in a showy, spectacular way.
WALTER C. BRONSON of Brown University has selected and edited a new book of “ English Essays *’ (Heury Holt) It is intended as an introductory course in literature for colleges, but it will be of use to anybody who desires to have on his bookshelves a good selection of English essays from Bacon to Stevenson. Milton, Browne, Dryden, .Steele, Addison, Swift, Defoe, Johnson, Goldsmith, Burke, Hazlitt, Lamb, Lander, De Quincey, Macaulay, Thackeray, Ruskin, Newman, Arnold, Pater, Huxley—all are represented, some whose works are easily accessible but sparsely. There are also selections Crom Mandeville and Malory, Latimer, Lyly, Sidney, and Hooker.
THE smallest set of books that has yet come in for review is the Miniature Irving, (Thomas T. Crowell,) five volumes, each measuring about one and a half by two inches, bound securely in stamped and gilded Russia leather covers and set in a tiny case of the same material. *' The Christmas Stories,” and selections from “ Bracebridge Hall,” 41 The Alhambra,” " Tales of a Traveller,” and “ The Sketch Book ” are thus available as dainty gifts, either together or separately, to serve as Christmas cards. The type is clear and legible.
