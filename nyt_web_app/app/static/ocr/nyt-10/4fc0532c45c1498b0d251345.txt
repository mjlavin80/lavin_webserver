WHY, asks the author of this little f volume, may not the physician to the body be a proper pergon to offer his advice toward a prescription for the diseases of society? Society is. after all. but the sum of its individuals: its defects are conditioned upon the defects of those individuals, and all the individual defects spring from physiological causes, which it is the physician's business to observe. Obviously, a doctor of medicine is at least as competent to give sociological advice as a doctor of divinity or a doctor cf laws or a doctor of polite letters.
Such is the gist of Dr. Chapin's very modest and very reasonable plea for a hearing. What he has to say upon " vital Questions " is, as might be expected after such an introduction, neither new "nor startling, but it is sane. In brief, he urges prevention instead of cure, a diversion of some, at least, of the organized energies for social betterment from the building of hospitals for the sick and almshouses for the inefficient, to the task of creating sanitary conditions alike in the dwellings and the minds of the poor.
The destruction and reconstruction of society, he says, will still leave in force those laws of nature which have produced the present social troubles, and like causes will produce like effects in any new system. Therefore the dreams of the communist are empty._All schemes of reform, In fact, which look to sweeping changes fcy force of law are foredoomed to failure. There remain only slow’ and gradual processes, and especially the substitution of heaJthfuI environment for unhealthful. knowledge of essential things for igno-ranee. There are two unescapable conditions of life; Calvinism has named them “ predestination ” and “ foreordinatfon science calls them " heredity " and “ environment." " Advanced sociology will devote its principal energy to avoiding the propagation of the unfit, and then by ; prop^j- isolation see to it that they do not survive beyond one generation." That for the ultimate end. Meantime, Dr. Chapin considers what may be done to prevent (not cure) present abject poverty, and shows how vast is the harm done by tlie Insufficient nutrition of very young children. He has figures on that point from , his own practice in New York, which are eloquent enough. “ Lack of employment "
- is the chief cause back of this trouble, and the fault is at least as often that of j industrial conditions as of the individual potential wage earner. Following is a very interesting chapter on child growth j and Its circumstances. Another chapter points to misdirected energy in lines of falsely named education, affecting the public schools at large ami the training | of women in particular—" Woman should j be educated with the idea of becoming a wife rather than a school teacher." Indeed. Dr. Chapin uses many such terse and telling phrases in stating his views. Another such, where he is speaking of religion, suggests that divinity students be trained “less in .theology and more in sociology."
A final chapter on ‘‘ Death " seeks to mitigate the horror of that dark passage, j which, the dbctor says, is usually pain-i less, or nearly so. Altogether, one must account the book exceedingly readable,
| earnest, and useful, i - - -------------------------------
