TH K audacious and ingenious “A. W* has spun another of his yarns about the subterrnnean parts of world wars and policies. This time, for fear his air oi‘ verislmiiii udf may mislead the unwary, he takes pains to warn his readers that his book i>, as Mr. Shaw says, ** a fiction." The famous episode of Ho-jestvensky's battle in the night with the fisher fleet on the Dodger Banks is the occasion anti climax of the present narrative-one which has already appeared in sections in a magazine. By his veracious account. " A. V." is employed by Queen Alexandra to assist Ktnpress Dag-ra;tr to prevent the embroiling of Russia and Ftritain. On ihe oilier side is “ A. Ws ” old crony, the German Emperor, who is plotting industriously to bring about just that particular embroilment. “ A. V." repairs to St. Petersburg, where he moots another secret agent. a lovely Russian Count* ss. Ho is drugged and kidnapped, but m ana ups, nevertheless, (in the uniform of an officer of the ThirJ Section,) to cross Siberia and convey in the innoccnt form of a cigarette a raes-sag'1 from the Czar to the Kmperor.
Also he falls in love with a Japanese lady. Then he returns to St. Petersburg, lias further adventures with the beautiful Countess, foils tho Russian pnlicc, executes a conspirator, deceives the head of the German secret service, and manages, in disguise, to converge even with his old friend William II. without any suspicion of his identity crossing the monarch's mind. William it is who sends him with a submarine to lurk amid the fishers of the North Sea and alarm the Russians into firing into these peaceful persons. Lord Charles Be res ford (it is expected) will do the rest with the indignation of England to back him. “ A. V." goes with every intention of betraying William's confidence and saving the encounter. But there is another submarine before him— and the Countess in it, of course.
