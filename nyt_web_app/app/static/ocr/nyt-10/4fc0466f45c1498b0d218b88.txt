THE? BALUr-SG-'rOiSSS.
, An Uncommonly .Original and Powerful New Novel by Frances Squire.®
T must be confessed that when a novel by an unknown author comos into the hands of a reviewer ho Is likely to open it with the listless mental exclamation of “Yet another! ” The most sated reader, however, cannot turn many pages of " The Ballingtons" without becoming aware that it is by no means *' another,” but distinctly itself, a book of striking originality and power, and of intense human interest It has a double drama in the lives of two married pairs, hi one of which the husband holds the purse, in the other the wife. In tho one financial despotism makes the situation insupportable, in the other the wife's refusal to recognize her husband’s manly resolution to be Independent. The tyranny of withholding and the tyranny of giving are set In contrast. The interest of the story centres in the former pair, the latter being just a little melodramatic, and more slightly sketched than the former. We have rarely seen a picture more accurate in detail, more logical in consequences, more true in all its coloring, more subtle in every *' nuance " than this of the wedded life of Ferdinand and Agnes Ballington. Tiie writer has felt and thought deeply, with the result of a wonderfully true presentation of marriage under certain conditions, and of the inevitable effect upon a woman's character. Each step, from the early romance through the gradual disillusion to the ultimate tragedy, is taken in strict accord with “ the logic of events."
There is never a point where the author swerves from absolute truth. She shows her fidelity to life and the courage of her fidelity by making the issue betw?en husband and wife—or, rather, between husbands and wives—a practical, not merely an emotional one. Only very young people analyze, comparo, exploit their emotions, and find love shipwrecked when they clash. The real murderers of love are the brutal frankness of speech, the financial jarring;*, the differences of opinion In regard to the management of household or of children, the discovery of pettiness or of meanness, revealed, perhaps slowly, by the years of married intimacy and Interdependence—and these are the murderers Mrs. Squire employs At the same time she does not falter in her ethfeal loyalties, and her profotind conception oj; the sanctity or marriage. Moreover, although Kerdinand stirs our souls with the same h Jpless rage Grand-court was wont to arouse, although Agnes claims a deeper compassion than Gwendolen commanded, although Fred' and Beatrice seem to have made a hopeless mess of their lives, although we fear nothing is left for Tom and MiVlam butf a life-long Illustration of Jean Inge-low’s ** Divided," such is the author's art and humor that the book Is scarcely a sombre one. It is very much more than the stor3f of unhappy loves. And here again does it “ hold the mirror up to nature." Mrs. Squire recognizes that life is Still interesting to the middle-aged, and that the middle-aged are not without value as factors therein. IJke Mrs. Deland, she does not cull heroes and heroines merely: she fills her pages with just such human beings as fill our world.
In Mrs. Sidney the author lias painted a wonderful portrait, especially in view of our latter-day judgments. An uncompromising Calvinist, perfectly Puritanical In her attitude toward “ worldly amusements," narrow and hard. If you like, she nevertheless surprises us by being as loveworthy as she is trustworthy, and it is because her crystalline veracity of soul is matched by its large generosity, its freedom from small egotisms and resentments, and from sordid alms.
Again and again, in her lighter touches, the author puts her finger upon facts— and usually ignored facts—of human nature, as, for example, in her description of the well-beloved physician’s death. Few who are familiar with such scenes have not been astonished at just such reactions on the part of those suffering most, a merciful relief from unbearable tension.
Certain faults might, of course, be pointed out. Here and there the workmanship is a bit crude; here and there the book would have gained by compression and excision, but, take it all in all, It is the most remarkable novel that has come to our desk for many a long day. It Is written with distinction of style, with large sympathy, with clear vision, but not these qualities nor its absorbing Interest put it upon a height unapproached by the great majority of even the best novels of the day; it takes its rare and high place because, as we read we say again and again, not ** This hi lifelike,” but " This is life.”
