IT would be an easy matter to say something1 questionably clever by a slight parody upon the title of " The Irrational ICnot,” by Bernard Shaw, (Brentano’s.) Hut, unfortunately, perhaps. Mr. Shaw has made himself too big a problem in literature to be treated with anything but gravity. But after reading " The Irrational Knot,” the subject of which need not be mentioned, it is a question as to whether or not the Author is Treating the reader with due gravity.
| This novel (which Mr. Shaw in a preface disowns because he wrote it in his younger days, and later, in a postscript, claims because he thinks it is clever) knocks the foundations away
■	from a house without putting up props. In that house of matrimony some of us live, happily or unhappily; others aspire to live in it; some do not; but every sane person is agreed that the house of marriage is not a perfection of architecture and is satisfied to be content.
Mr. Shaw is not satisfied to be content about our marriage house. (We wonder if he is satisfied with his own.) He has written a book in which he introduces an American-Irish engineer who is as mechanical in his living and thought as one of the machines which stole the happiness of tho woman he married- There is a suspicion left in the mind that i* is the presence of *his human dynamo that is responsible lor the marital unhappiness of everybody else in the book; but Mr. Shaw meant him to be the presence which brought out the misery of the marriage system, which was there whether Connolly was tn the book or riot. Mr. Shaw wrote the book, of course—and “ knows best.”
