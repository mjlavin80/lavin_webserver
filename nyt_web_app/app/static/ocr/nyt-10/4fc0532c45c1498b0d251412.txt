THE HORSE*
John Gilmer Speed’s Book on Ihe Cultivation and Development of ' Horses In This Country.^
TREATISE on the horse, dealing with technical questions of breeding and expressing convictions on subjects about which there has always been and always will be the greatest diversity of ; opinion among practical horsemen, la sure to win favor with the class whose views it , supports and seriously to offend those | whose theories it opposes. In this latest book. John Gilmer Speed* although profess* j ing to present both sides of disputed ques-tlons while Indorsing one or the other, has ; already provoked the adverse criticism of j many who have made breeding and training their life study. Hie advocates are Uiely to be as numerous and possibly as Influential. On whichever side the horse lover may stand, he will unquestionably read the work with interest and discuss it with feeling.
Presented In most attractive form and treating the whole subject as thoroughly as the limited size of the volume admits, it will afford entertainment to all those who regard the equine with more than | passing interest Its relation of the his- 1 tory of the horse In this country, intro- J duced by a sketch of its early history prior to its Importation here, will not be seriously found fault with save in those deductions which are drawn as to the effects of various influences on the development of the leading types.
Mr. Speed favors strongly the Arab and Barb stock to Improve the modern types, and In this provokes the antagonism of a large class that regards the very name of Arab as an anathema. He is a strong advocate of the Morgans and Clay-Ara-bians and of the Denmarks for saddle purposes, and an unsparing critic or hackneys, Orlofs, and other foreign breeds. The Percheroir and Clydesdale he tolerates, and the thoroughbred he commends for Its particular purposes, but to the American types alone does he appear to give his unqualified indorsement. Much that he says on this score j is indisputable, but many of his theories cannot be accepted so long as the questions touched upon remain In reasonable dispute.
Kis recital of the history of famous meetings, such as the race between Eclipse and Sir Henry, of Grey Eagle and Wagner, and of Lecompte and Lexington, classics of the turf, will be read with unqualified enjoyment, and his belief in the ability of these horses to more than hold their own with the modern racers trained to high speed for short stretches rather than the old four-mile heat races, | may be dismissed as a purely personal opinion, admitting of no demonstration, j and, therefore, more interesting than im- I portanL
He follows this ante-civil war period with a fleeting reference to the perform- ■ ancea of Longfellow, Harry iiassett. Ten Broeck, Prioress, and other favorites of old Jerome Park, and then brings us up . to the modern racing with the story of Hindoo, Miss Woodford, Hamburg, Fi-renzl, Troubadour, The Bard, Salvator, Tenny, Domino, Dobbins, Hamburg, son of Hanover; Waterboy, and others.
To trotting and pacing he devotes the same attention, from the time of Flora Temple and Dexter to Dan Patch and Lou Dillon, tracing their breeding back through Hambletonian to Messenger and through Messenger to Lying Childers,
“ the best horse in the studbook," and closes with suggestions for bu3Ting horses, for the handling and training of them, for I the conduct of the stables, and kindred topics.
Taken all in all, the book should serve Its purpose, to interest and forward tho breeding of good types, though whether or not It will have any lasting influence In increasing the favor of the types Mr.
Speed advocates remains for time to determine.
