. A RIV AL OF CONRADl
!	Edward Noble’s New Novel, “The
J	Edge	of Circumstance.”*
DWARD NOBLE’S new novel, “The Edgev of Circumstance,” will come to most readers as a first book by an unknown author, and their supposition .	or assumption is not so far from u,c-
’	curacy that anybody need impose much
restraint on his wonder or hers at its 03any and unusual excellencies. And yet the - appearance from unexpected places of books more or less “ great ** is„ a not infrequently observed phenomenon of the day—not less* frequently observed than its converse. <■ Names tried and proved in the literary world all too often are found signed to disappointing matter, but such nodding on the part of the gods can surely be looked upon with equanimity so long as it is possible to come all unawares upon such a moving and satisfying example of the story-teHer’s art as is this tale of the ■ sea with its irritatingly uncotnmunica-' live title/ Admirers of Mr- Joseph Con-r. rad will not concede because of It that I his laurels are yet .in any immediate i danger, but a. would-be rival has certainly appeared in Mr. Conrad’s own particular /field of fiction, and The Edge of Circumstance ” gives many indications ihat Mr. Noble has come to stay and.that there is much more good stuff where this story came from. At any rate, it is to be hoped there is and that there will be as little delay as possible in converting it into book form.
" The Edge ol Circumstance ” is a " sea story," but not at all -one of the old-fashioned sort, in which the interest centred entirely in the number and :	size of the perils encountered by some
ill-fated ship and her abnormally un-■ fortunate crew. The sea and its dangers are h-re the background. The men , who take part in the drama all have to do with the sea in some capacity, but the real story, which absorbs One’s every faculty frum the first page to the last of Mr. Noble’s book, deals with the old, old subject of the human pas-I sions and the war of man against man. Incidentally there are included some pictures of the sea that are convincing enough in their realism to satisfy the most skeptical that the writer is describing such things as he himself has experienced and that he comprehends the spirit of the sea as well as he does the natures of its children.
In a preface, which the author for some inscrutable reason has turned into an “ apologia,” he admits his story's lack of the conventional chief :	ingredient of a novel—admits that it is
without a plot, as plots are commonly understood, and that it has no feminine interest w ha lever, but these are peculiar^ i s thiit* will trouble no one who has onco heroine absorbed in the life-and-doath struggle between Messrs. Joseffs, Arun and Schlan^e, a Cardiff firm of ship own rs, and two men who, as , Taptain and engineer, respectively,
. sign an agreement to sail their tramp steamer Titan for a period of three years. The Titan was a sort of freak in marine architecture, designed and built by Arun himself for the avowed purpose of carrying more cargo at a smaller cost than any other freighter afloat. To this end she had been fitted out with every patent labor-saving, economizing machine known to shipbuilders; was intended to be operated by a crew of half a dozen men or less, and, finally, to add a handsome sum to the profits of her scheming owners by being run on the co-operative plan. Thanks to her dishonest builders the Titan was not only such a freak in appearance that her Dutch crew promptly rechristened her the Schweinigel, but also such a manifest deathtrap that it looked lor a long time as if she would never go to sea for want of officers and crew. But there is no venture so hazardous that some one’s necessity will not ignore the risk, and in this case it was Capt. Robert Shirwill and Engineer McGrabbut whom lack of employment j drove to accepi charge of the Titan. ! From the date of their engagement the
■	story practically resolves itself into a deadly firm determination on their part ! to keep the uiia'ieldy monster afloat and a frantic ctFnrt on the part of the J owners to ge< rid of it at any cost. For from the utart the Titan proved a

With-some men-In ch&rge Arun could have carried out his purpose easily enough, and the Titan would have gone the way that so many ships have gone when well insured and of no further use to their" owners, but Shirwill and McGrabbut were of different stuff— “ knew too much/' as Arun was wont angrily to remark when, as frequently happened, he and they collided In their intentions—and in spite of Arun’s best ifforts, the Titan survived unspeakable perils and came-battered, but safely, into port. The story of how it was all accomplished is of enthralling interest.. Shirwill .and McGrabbut are marvels of character drawing, but the
intricacies., and complexities of Arun's denotement"are little short, of a masterpiece, and the ending of, the struggle of wills between these three men is most satisfying in its artistic avoidance of the.obvious.
Only the merest outline can here be given of Mr. Noble’s story and no Idea at all of its many striking and thrilling scenes, or of the clever talk** with which- its-pages overflow. But it is a rarely good—even a great—book in.some respects, and it seem8 destined to take high, rank in the sea literature of its
class.
