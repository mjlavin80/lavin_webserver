MR BAGOT has written a pretty love-story of modern Italy, " the little town of Monteflano, nestling among the lower spurs of the Sabine Hills," Its setting. Here Donna Bianca Acorarl is wooed and won by a young Roman engineer, her inferior in birth. The complications that follow and the outcome of them all shall be left to the author to reveal—as is his right. His heroine is as spirited as she is beautiful, and her stepmother is not the cruel step-dame of folk-lore, but a woman consclen-tious and kind, though led into wrong paths by two wily villains—her brother i and the suave Abb6 Roux. Mr. Bagot has depicted the.se with much skill, and his summing up is excellent. Quoth a priest as good as the Abb£ was bad:
j Do you know, Silvio, that I cannot make up my mind as to which Is the greater scoundrel of the two. Monsieur le Abb<5 or Monsieur le Baron. But there can be no question as to which has the better head —oh, none at all! The Abbe Roux put all bis eggs in one basket; but M. d'Antiri divided his with admirable judgment. All the same, with it all, M. d’Aniin is a gentleman in his villanies and a man of courage. The Abbfi is neither the one nor the other. Moreover, M. d’Antin has a decided sense of humor, and humor, like charity, covers many sins.
Silvio Is the young lover, brave and frank as young lovers should be. The story is to be commended, by the bye, for the common sense and honor of its lovers. They do not have those misei'able i misunderstandings which, more than partings themselves, " press the life froip out young hearts," nor do they cherish the creed that romance flings ethics to the winds. They are refreshingly honest, even with particularly unsympathetic elders. The chief character of the novel is. however, Don Agostino, the parish priest of Monteflano—a noble and benig-i nant figure, the sorrows of whose early manhood have been fused into a great tenderness, a large comprehension. He j it is who holds " the passport,r—the credentials which give him a right to act as the deus ex machiml in the little romance ! that threatens to go all wrong.
The relation of the house of Acorari to I the peasants, their uprising against an ! unjust raising of rents, its quelling by the opportune appearance of the Donna Btanca, and the confusion of the ma- j chinations of the two conspirators, are all. related with dramatic power. The book is one of much interest, and the beautiful character of Don Agostino, to whom the closing words are fitly devoted, , is not soon to he forgotten.
