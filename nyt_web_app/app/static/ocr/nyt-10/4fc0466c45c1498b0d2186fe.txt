jVTRS* WHITOE^S POH1VIS
•	FASTIDIOUSNESS o f , taste, a clear personal vision, and a perfect sincerity are qualities that go far in makin" any writing, verse or prose, agreeable to read ■
' ♦ and worthy of £bspect. If added to them is a delicate insight into the human heart of common mortals the result is certain to be sympathetic, to use a much abused \yord. Mrs. Whitney’s “ Sonnets and Songs *’ (Harpers, '$1.20,) are quite what one would expect from a daughter of her race, and possess-to a^high degree this little catalogue of attributes. - Their mood is chiefry that of quiet wistfulness, touched by the fears and sorrows of uncertain human fate, but open also to the influences of wholesome joy and unaffected sentiment. The sonnet
"As a Pale Child ’’ reflects* the suggestion of somewhat conscious withdrawal from the lustier interests of the world, and strikes a note that may be called feminine in its hint of Inherited repressions and conventions:
&s a pale child, hemmed in by windy rain,	.
Patiently turns to touch his well-known toys,	.
Playing as children play, who make no noise,
Yet happy in a way: then sighs again,
To watch the world against the storm'd im pane.
And sees with-wistful eyes glad girls and boys
; Who romp betleath the rain’s unli-1	censed	joys,
And feels wild longings sweep his gentle brain,
So I, contented with my flowers for stars,
Stroll in my fair walled garden hap;	pily,
Knowing no gladder game till, shrill and sweet,
I hear life’s cry ring down the silent street,
And press my face against ?he sunlit bars
To watch the joyous spirits who are 1	free.

It is characteristic of this cloistered mood that nature plays but a small part in Mrs. Whitney’s poems. Except I for the metrically imperfect lines to ** The Rose-Colored Camelia Tree,” and two or three poetic landscapes, there is little record *n the collection of "close observation of or love for the natural world, and there is a delightful absence of the " nature poseM which constantly suggests on the part of the poet the conviction so frankly expressed by the Ettrick Shepherd when he remarked, “ I consider myself ex- ^ qulsite at descriptions of nature, and mountain scenery in particular." Nevertheless there is in many of the psychological poems the. touch of actuality that gives the element of sturdiness to the emotion expressed and saves it from the taint~*-too common in modern verse—of morbidness. In this poem on " The Wanderer,” for example, the familiar complaint of unrealized aspiration is given a tonic suggestion by the light swift references to nature in her wilder aspect:
Have I finished my life, am I done?
Is my heart-blood thin and cold,
That I gnaw the bones of tho town? Am I empty and old?
My flags are the chimneys* grime,
Tossed on a languid breeze.
Have I dreamed of the roaring rhyme,
A storm through the trees?
The snow in the streets is black.
Profaned with the city’s sin;
I know of a star-lit track Where God’s hand lias been.
Have I finished with snow and sun.
With th-i wind on the open plain.
That I starve in the barren town—
Is my ife in vain?
This is distinctly above the average of even the better class of minor poetry of the present time. It is expressive and not too fluent, and it holds the promise of a riper art in the future, when the spontaneous fitting of words and cadence to the thought has had more rigorous direction and revision in accordance with the author's own obviously dignified standards of poetic utterance. Her contemplative mind naturally turns to tt^e subjects best fitted for quiet verse neither overburdened with significance nor metric- j ally various, and her choice of the sonnet form for the larger number of her poems is a fortunate one, although she has yet to master the technical precision by which that form attains its peculiar charm.
