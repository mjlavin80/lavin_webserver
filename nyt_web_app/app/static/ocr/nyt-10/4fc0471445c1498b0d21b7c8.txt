There are many ways In which the museums can co-operate in spreading a. knowledge and appreciation of art. In the smaller cities the library is the centre of all intellectual life, and in each library there Is usually a halt that cun be used for exhibition purposes. Here is a field where loans from the museums would be gratefully received. Two steps along these lines have already been taken. During the period of its annual exhibition in 11)04 the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburg lent twenty important painxtne3 from its permanent collection to the Tni-versily of Kansas. *	*	* The L>etroU
Museum of Art has arranged a group of Oriental art objects from the Stearns collection which jt is prepared to lend for exhibition purposes to libraries and other responsible institutions. The reproduction of paintings belonging to the permanent collection of the Carnegie Institute and the circulation of these photographs In the public schools of Pittsburg has ]pd to a better appreciation of the originals.
