HE“ gUmcur of ll’.c Bront'is,” as Mr. Shorter calls it, is slill a potent spell in the literary world. There is something perennially fascinating In the image of the three delicate, rather unhappy country girls suddenly deciding to write and turning out, two of. them at least, novels that cm- still, alter half a century, make good a claim to being among the greatest in the language. ** Jane Eyre,” “ Shirley, *
“ Villette,” ** Wutherhig Heights." were, indeed, and still remain, almost inexplicable phenomena, and the tracing cf their genesis and the influences that formed their authors into masters of their art is an absorbing pursuit.
Mr. Shorter has done something more than contribute a volume necessary to the completeness o£ a series. • Mrs. Gaskell wrote the authoritative life of Charlotte Bronte, but much new material has been published since she wrote, and that material, as Mr. ShorLer points out, has not been gathered into one brief narrative. Ivor has it before been subjected to the critical inspection that he gives it in this volume. He is also able to add a little unpublished material. His aim .has been more biographical than critical—he is continually disavowing the critical point of view and shutting himself off from criticism. But of coursc no such biography
could dispense with criticism, expressed and Implied, and what Mj\ Shorter has allowed himself to utter cannot be regarded as among the less important elements of his work.
The story of the Brontes is a simple and distinctly a depressing one. The parochial surroundings in which their father’s several incumbencies kept them, the sombreness and gloom of tlr^ir lives, partly, no doubt, the outcome of their temperaments, but increased by the distaste of their experiences as governesses; the tragedy of their brother, Bran well Bronte's wasted life, many of the episodes in the careers of the three girls, make anything but an exhilarating narrative. There can be no doubt, of course, but that these things influenced their intellectual fibre as writers, and so wrought themselves into the pages of their books. There is really little to tell, as a story, of these three intertwined lives. Mr. Shorter is, perhaps, inclined to dwell on some of the pathos. The mother’s life he seems to think especially pathetic, not only In that it was short, which was a pathetic fact, but also in that there was 4* a constant succession of little children,’’ which was not. The little Brontes were fragile 1 —wherein lay, according to Air. Shorter, the whole tragedy of their lives—and the i oldest two died in childhood. There was ; much happiness, however, in the early : lives of Charlotte, Emily, and Anne—and yet not a trace of the literary genius that afterward blossomed full. Their original compositions are extant in a hundred little manuscript books that show no particular talent. Charlotte's early | schooldays were really a very happy time in her life. Returning with Emily to the same school at Roe Head, when she was * nineteen and her sister seventeen, she entered upon the period that is least pleas- | ant to survey; for she was ill-adapted to looking after a crowd of girls and had a bitter tongue. Emily broke down under it. As a governess in private families j Charlotte seems to have been alternately i plunged in dudgeon because she was : treated as a hireling or depressed because i she was neglected, and with as little real j cause in either case.	i
The most important circumstance in her life, in the estimation of this b.og- ; raplier, is her experience in Brussels, at the H£ger pension. He believes that had she not spent this time in Brussels, the world would never have heard' of her and of her sisters. Even up lo this time, when she was tweri^-six years old, she had accomplished nothing significant in lit-eraturc. M. H£ger cultivated her crude tastes, and helped her to arm herself with just the equipment that was necessary for her to write her books. He, indeed, appears in “ Villetto,** and some of the I Bronte biographers have suggested that sbe was in love with him. She did, certainly, paint a harsh portrait in Mme. Beck, who has been identified with Mme. H£ger. But Mr. Shorter hasten.; to add i that there was nothing in Charlotte's attitude toward M. HCger that Mrs. Grundy's sourest disciple rould have disapproved.

thing To'say, aiid "SviH not1 agree With Mr. Birrell jthat ** we. haye jno use., for .this young man.** lie certainly did haye* much ! influence on the life and work of his s stcrs. But the story is not an erifiven-ing one. The first publications, the experiences with the publishers, the criticism of the three young authors who pyt forth their writings as the work; of Cur-rer, Ellis, and AeLon Ball, the various criticisms, many of, Lhcm amusing now in their ineptitude, the cju:ck popularity that the novels gained, are all matters that have been many times recounted, but they have an ever fresh interest.
The poems oi Emily Bronte, the one poet of the family—although Anne wrote poems that „ have kept their , place in -the hymnals—Mf. Shorter judges with perhaps more enthusiasm than many will share with him. She was in some respects the most remarkable of the family. Her biographer calls her- the Sph'nx of modern English literature. "She is known j by but one novel—“ Wuthering Ileishts | —which Mr. Shorter considers ** tht- j greatest bock ever written by a woman.” Ail speculation as to the sources of her inspiration he declares to be beside the mark, for it is a book by itself. For Charlotte’s originality and power he finds terms equally strong. “ Jane Eyre ’ is “ as original a novel as was ever submitted to the judgment of the reading public "—characterized briefly by its intense sincerity; and the estimate of another critic that it contains some of the '• most great and simple prose of all this century ’* is eagerly accepted by this one.
** Shirley ** is unequal,, the first two volumes showing the effects of the strain | upon her of her brother’s and two sister* Illness and death. “ Vlllette " is ** one of the great novels of literature " and had the great?st intensity, the most genuine passion, the most satiric strength, of any novel of Its period; and it Is the crowning achievement of its writer.
There has been perhaps as much effort j to trace the originals of Miss Bronte’s j characters and places as in the case of any novelist; and Mr. Shorter gives up a i good d’eal of space to this not wholly profitable task. “Biography,” he observes, " insists upon identification.’' AVe may believe that it is a task more congenial to" the biographer tlian to most of ; the readers of the novels. -There has : been some anguish over identifications in Charlotte Bronte's case. Many of them appear perfectly plain, and it is clear that she derived many of her types, If not actual personages, from the people by whom she was surrounded. So, too, many of her scenes and places can be traced in < the near-by regions of Yorkshire. Some of the portraits of people are cruel, tut genius is frequently cruel, " with a certain ostrich-like quality added, nc\ er knowing its cruelty and never anticipating Identification, as Mr. Shorter observes.
The task, on the whole, he has performed with much skill, with an entire power of making even less enthusiastic i readers share with him something of " the , glamour of the Brontes.
