In other places however, the book if? quite up to date—for example, a reference is made to the liJOl edition of ** Nos Deputes,” a book which corresponds to our *' Congresfional Directory."
The-se criticisms do not Impugn the Interest of the book. Despite the familiar Knglisii wail of superiority that there If1 no word for “ home '* in French, Miss Eduards lias dared to call her volume “ Home Life in Franee"; and she makes out a very good case for doing so. Ht^r chapters are chiefly unconnected studies of certain elements in French life, but are so numerous that she covers very nearly Ihe whole routine of existence in France. From a first chapter on social usages she takes us housekeeping and holiday making, and then in a series of chapters takes up the family, beginning with the appropriately named ‘\21onsieur (or Mam'sell) the Baby," and leading us down to marriage or old maidhood and bachelordom. Then she describes various isolated elements in Frcnch life, characters that appear In many books about France, such as the cure, the juge de paix, the French officer; tells of the family council and the part it plays in French life, and winds up with a chapter on the entente cordiale which she thinks ia growing between England and its nearest neighbor.
In so many chapters, Miss Edwards is able lo throw new light on many French traits and characteristics* Her thumbnail sketches of French homes are almost microscopic.
It has ever been a marvel to me that our sisters over the water have their bonnets- straight and their coiffure irreproachable. A French' sleeping apartment abounds in reflectors, never by any chancc can you see yourself properly.
*	* * in a French house no prevailing savor of fried bacon between S and y o’clock announces the family breakfast; your coffee and rolls are served while you still luxuriate on your pillows. • • V 'The next -experience of a French household is its extreme animation—with apologies to my friends, I will say noisiness. No sooner are the shutters thrown open in France than a dozen sounds announce the resumption of work, the return to daily tasks. * * * French ladies, be it recalled by the way, never smoke. The habit is entirely left to the Bohemian and the undassed. The early dejeuner hastens on the hourJof calls. -Visits, alike' ceremonial and friendly, are generally mad*j between 1 and 2- o’clock. * * * A minor matter shows the hold of tradition on French etiquette. It strikes us oddly to receive a letter signed ” Very affectionately yours. Countess of K—or. 44 Yours -sincerely, Slarquls of X.** but the usage is historic^ Thus, great ladies and gentlemen of* the seventeenth century signed ; themselves when writing to friends.
unw Edwards's 'chapter on .housekeeping is detailed. Defying the usual belief thax living is much cheaper in France than in England, she insists that it costs much more; the National genius for eebn-omy and cooking enables people to live on less than in England. Everything Is taxed in France; “ from a postage stamp upward—there are neither penny stamps nor half-penny postcards In France—wo may safely assume that every commodity costs a third more on the other side of the Channel.”
The French officer of to-day is " an indefatigable worker, one to whom fireside joys and intellectual pleasures are especially dear, to whom self-abnegation In the loftiest as well as the domestic sense becomes a second nature. I should say that in no [other] class shine more pre-eminently the virtues of forethought and disinterestedness. * * * Indebtedness .is Impossible to a French officer. Should debts remain unpaid, the offender is sus; pended for three years. * * * Many superior officers never dream of taking a holiday, and with the constantly wlden-ing area of military science'more arduous become their duties and more absorbing their pursuits/*	.
