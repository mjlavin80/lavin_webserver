TEESE sporting- sketches,” said a man who sometimes uses gun and line himself, " these sporting sketches are intended for folks that : live In flats.” And so no doubt they ; are. Mr. Sandy a has a sort of flavor In all his writings which suggests the ; Sunday school story of our unhappy youth. Not that he is a moralist In the ordinary sense—but he is a missionary. His tales of shooting and fishing are related in much the manner In which the returned apostles used to tell | the good church people at home—espe-cially the boys and girls—about the customs of the cannibal Isies or the sphinxlike, slant-eyed Chinese.
This particular volume of Mr. 'Sandys contains stories — all carefully fanned into an imitation wiid wood and outdoor breeziness—about going out after a groat many kinds of birds and beasts and fishes—wild geese, grouse, snipe, curlew, reed birds, turkey, wolves' hares, squirrels, bass, pike, salmon, muskallong-e,	He	is,	he insists, no
formalist in sport, he is of the school in which the barefoot country boy naturally grows up, the school of '* tho
free folk.” Mr. Sandys seems to think there is a.certain wizardry in such phrases as that, and perhaps they do , suggest the smell of earth and green ! growing things and tho touch of cool, running water to the flat dwellers already mentioned. Tho only trouble j with the stuff is its essential artificiality—though wo are not pretending to say that Mr. Sandys doesn’t know’ both how to shoot and how to fish.
