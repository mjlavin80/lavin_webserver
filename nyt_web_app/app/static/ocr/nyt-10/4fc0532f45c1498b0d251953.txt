H"E study of the French occupation of Canada, the explorations under the remarkable men who penterated far into the wilds, and the struggle with England for the supremacy has been scalously pursued in recent years. Mr. Douglas adds a very substantial and comprehensive volume to the literature of the subject- He has derived his facts and opinions, he declares, from original sources, though he has had no access to unpublished documents. He carries his account down to the close of the seventeenth century, the end of the “ heroic period ’’ of Canadian history- He begins It with the voyages of Cartier, in 1534 and after; Raberval’s futile attempts at colonization in 1343, and the “ dark age " of Canadian history which followed, up to Champlain’s fcundation of Quebec in J60S. Then began the real history of Canada.
From now cn Dr. Douglas relates the sequence of events with great detail. Trading was the primary motive of the French colonization schemes, and '* a sincere, though not very ar-Jent, desire to Christianize the Indians." The King's professed object was the conversion of the savages; but there had been complications from the succession of Huguenot and Catholic influences. He holds a fair balance between them. He has words of admiration for the Jesuit missionaries, while he is not blind to all the bearings of their activities. Thus, of the “ Jesuit Relations,” he says that they were “ manifestly written with the triple object Of magnifying the missionary work of the Society of Jesus, soliciting subscriptions for their great schemes, and glorifying the colonization efforts and the religious motives of the company of One Hundred Associates and its officers."
Tt was a pious community in Quebec, and whatever heretics were landed from time to time were unable to withstand the arguments of the priests and the pressure of public opinion. No one remained long who questioned the authority of the Church. There was even greater and more perfect religious unanimity than in the Puritan colonies of New England, but the music and color and dramatically effective details of the altar service appealed more to the senses of the Indiana than anything the Puritans could offer them. Primitive Roman Catholicism has, in fact, retained its Influence over the French in Lower Canada more effectively than Puritanism In Its primitive form has maintained its hold on the people of New England.
The sluggishness of Canadian development as compared with that of New England or Louisiana is the subject of some Interesting conjectures. No one reason suffices to explain it; rigid bureaucracy, trade monopoly, ultramontanism in religion, made the colony unpopular in France, Furthermore. Frenchmen were as unwilling to leave France in the eighteenth century as they are In the twentieth. Dr. Douglas hazards the suggestion that had Canada been a refuge for Huguenots, as New England -j^as for Puritans, and had the home Government not interfered In the development of the country* there might have been a new nationality created in the Western world which, retaining Gallic characteristics, would have developed a type of national existence as different from that of old France as the New England type now is from that of old England. But Canada, it must be remembered, lacked New England’s splendid opportunities for commerce.
One of the most important features of the book are its illustrations. There are many reproductions of old pictures, maps, diagrams, and portraits, almost always excellent. There are also numerous photographic -views of places as they appear to-day in illustrations of points treated In the text. The important chapter on “ Quebec as it appeared at the end of the eighteenth century ’* is full of such views and of reproductions of old drawings. In fact, though Dr. Douglas has trod In paths that had been pretty well blazed out and explored before him, he has achieved a work of value.
