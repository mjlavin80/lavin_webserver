THK Derby Genealogy,” by Viola A. Derby Bromley. (The Grafton Press,) is a good piece of work which should prove Immediately interesting1 to all the descendants of Thomas Derby of Stow, Mass., and of aid to future genealogists. For there are no Chinese walls around American families, and Thomas Derby's descendants, to the eighth generation recorded in this book, have connected themselves widely with those of other founders of families. A prolific race, Thomas’s children, with good solid names, \\e find no great men or women among them, but a family of sturdy Americans, as valuable to the country as if they were all members of Congress and Presidents of women’s suffrage clubs.
