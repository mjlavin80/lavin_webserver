ROF. DOWDEN'S Montaigne has the quality we always look for in the work of that capable critic. This writer is not a virtuoso among biographers; but what he	lacks in brilliancy is more than made
up	for in sober force. Not that he fa
pedantic or plodding; it is rather to be suggested that his method has a certain quiet security, a “ grace abounding” of the literary sort, which parts the best criticism as far from the doctoral thesis product orf the one hand as from the pleasing flam-boyancies	of a	Huneker or a Chesterton on the other.	Montaigne, with his “ classical M value, and
ever-new and flatteringly modern discursiveness, is tempting if not fair game for the critic of either extreme. It is not difficult for your true scholar to approximate! very nearly the date of nativity of a given essay: it is still easier for your true discursor to indite his notion of the relation of that essay to the critic himself. The method has its merits, but it is, after all, not the soundest method of biography; certainly it is not Prof. Dowden's method. He has in this it.stance a theme far less difficult than that which he lately encountered in Browning. Montaigne died a Inng time ago, and his principal object in life was to make himself understood. No serious problems of fact remain to be solved in connection with his character or work. Otherwise, to be sure, he , had not a few matters in common with that uncouth niudei n whose “ sprightly step and inquiring eye " I-andor commended so highly.
Nevertheless, Prof. Dowden has had before him a task quite as important in its way as any which can fall to a biographer* If there is no direct problem to be attacked in dealing with such a name as Montaigne's. no fresh matter to be elucidated, no new point of view to be reasonably taken, a subtle difficulty still remains; our great name must be divested if its memorial shroud, must take on bone and flesh again, and be seen to breathe. In this instance the happiest material lay to the biographer’s hand, but material does not commonly arrange itself into a product. Even persons who have loved and lived with the Essays, which are all about himself, may have a vague or false notion of the man who wrote them. Their very diversity, their apparent and somewhat eagerly avowed casualnoss, are somewhat misleading. What a nice old duffer he was, how amiably pedantic, how frankly amorous, how engagingly conceited; in some such amber of kindly condescension Montaigne is embalmed to the world. Dowden sees him alive, vigorous, efficient, a man of the world as well as a man of letters, a useful man as well as a talkative one.
If Montaigne had chanced to live in the present era of advanced civilization (this we acknowledge to be a foolish speculation) he might have “ succeeded ’* in almost any honorable calling. He could not have been a Rockefeller, (vide Tarbell, passim,) and it Is probable that he would have failed as a ward politician, (vide anybody;) but the man who could serve two terms as Mayor of Bordeaux, in the troublous times of the Henris of France and of Navarre, and serve with distinction, had in his constitution considerably more of the Jerome than of the Croker, though most of him was Montaigne.	.

This man Prof, Dowden has brought before us, in form and feature as he was, no easy matter.
And the credit of the achievement is not diminished by the fact that the Dowden form and feature are somewhat clearly present in the background. A biographer must after all write from, if not about, himself. The phraseology employed is as much as possible Montaigne's own. Few passages of any length are quoted, but the narrative is largely a mosaic of remembered phrases which the biographer wisely leaves unincumbered by quotation marks. It is a method requiring great nicety of discrimination. If any one thinks it is easier to invent words about a writer eo discursive and voluminous as Montaigne than to quote him effectively, let him try it and learn to the contrary. Everything the man wrote may be intelligible and interesting, but

The question is; What of hts writingia -most interesting, ihost intelligible, most characteristic? -	"	.. '	"
With Montaigne that Question Is, says oar biographer, especially bard to answer:.
*** -
HOW full and varied an experience of life fell to our humorous philosopher it is wortii whiia. for us to recall. With all his literary addictions, his quaint bookish ness, uis Instinct for verbal expression, his “ politeness " In the old sense of the word, the fact remains that he was mainly absorbed, not in ideas and bocks, but In humankind and the common activities of humankind. In his pursuit of experience he displayed that union of eagerness and tranquillltv which marks the exceptional personality, to which, when it produces something, we give the convenient label of genius. Born in troublous times, he passed through them not without diversity of fortune, certainly not without bearing his full share of the conflict, yet wich untroubled spirit. It was a period of excesses, social, political, and religious. Religion, in particular, had become sponsor for the basest crimes. The idealism of the earlier Renaissance period was giving way to pedantry, libertinism, or equally unbridled higotry. A monster like Calvin was to be offset by a prodigy such as the St, Bartholomew massacre. The Ideal of justice had little hold upon* men's minds; crime was simply something inconvenient done by the other party; when done by one's own party, it was really so near a virtue that there was no use In splitting the last determining hair of evidence one way or the other. That was very many years ago. ” He who in our age," says Montaigne, with his usual placid candor,
“ is but a parricide and a sacrilegious person is a man of worth and of honor." For himself, he was one of the most honorable men of his time; and. if we except his outspoken heterodoxy in the theory and practice of the sexual relation, of any modern age.
Montaigne's great-grandfather was a thriving wine merchant In Bordeaux, who summed up his bourgeois career in the approved fashion by purchasing thf1 estate of a noble but impoverished family, and founding a new house of Montaigne. His son, keeping to the original trade, increased the family assets. The third in line, father of the essayist, seems to have been content to be Seigneur de Montaigne. Like his brothers, he was apparently a man of cultivation if not of profound learning. He served in the Italian wars, and on his way back to France met and married a girl of Spanlsh-Hebrew blood. Michel de Montaigne was the oldest son of this marriage to survive infancy. Later his father proved himself by no means an adventurous degenerate from a sturdy stock. He displayed both zeal and integrity In public affairs, and eventually served as councilor, sub-Mayor, and Mnvur of Bordeaux.
BY his own account the fourth Montaigne was not a clever boy; he learned with difficulty and forgot easily. Nevertheless he must have got on respectably at school, college, and law school, for at 23 he became a councilor at Bordeaux, (this was durfng his father’s Mayoralty.) and seems to have been of use In that capacity.	..
ITe seems to have undertaken the study of law and the duties of councilorship rather to please his father than himself. Of his bodily habit he has given sufficiently modest account, as in that passage written when he finds himself “ engaged in the avenues of age, being already past forty.”
Among his fellow-councillors at Bordeaux was Etienne la Boetie. two years his senior, and in many respects his opposite, Between them sprang up a friendship which was the one great passion of Montaigne’s life, a relation worthy of mark, as he more than once asserted, among the few perfect friendships of history. La Buetie came of a purer strain than his Spanish-Gas-con friend. He was more ?tatd and controlled, more scholarly, a somewhat solemn person, faultless In manners and morals; rather a prig on the whole, we might think, if we could imagine Montaigne the friend of a prig. Rhetoric, it appears, was his only dissipation; that fiery discourse of his " On Voluntary Servitude " did not interfere with his own loyal service of the powers that were. Presently La Boetie marries a good woman, and is a sood husband to her; but marriage is an incident whfch in no way affects the deeper union of friendship. In a few years the elder dies In his friend's arms; and not Ion< :j'ter Montaigne himself marries. Marriag.;, he perceives, is one of the duties of life, at least for an elder son; he is thirty-
three years old, and his parents are anx-

He spends a year and a half in travel, and is recalled from Rome to serve two terms as Mayor of Bordeaux, a service of no little responsibility and difficulty. Thereafter ho made his final return to Rome to complete his essays, and not long, after to die there, being not yet sixty, .	.

S	URELY this was the career of a useful and honorable man. One flaw j	only	In his life and philosophy, ac-
, cording to our standard, is to be discerned j in his attitude toward what we call the problem of sex. Naturally we, with our j cherished prudery, or prurience, for the j things commonly go together, are dls-| posed to smirk a good deal about his , ” immorality.” Montaigne, like Boccaccio, and Rabelais, and Fielding, is a writer highly condemned and widely read for his alleged nastiness. It cannot be said that he had an elevated notion of Woman. She might be a delightful mistress or an estimable consort; but it never occurred to him that she was ** a per-feet creature nobly planned,” and he certainly would have given short shrift to her warnings and commands. He had no roman tit conception of the relation of the sexes; his own romance was a friendship.
The love of man for woman, or of woman for man (need we apologize for saying it?) meant to him delirium Induced by a strong instinct toward the performance of a natural function. He was able to value a chastity in his father and hfs friend to which he himself could not attain; it seemed to him a little beyond the normal. In short, he expressed, without prudery or any other device of concealment, the opinion which many—perhaps most—men have held, for better or worse, since the world began, and which only a race of ** supermen ’’ can be expected altogether to outgrow. He alludes to his own amorous adventures without shame, and even with complacency, but he is never merely obscene. Robust and licentious, let us call his speech; let us even admit now and then an approach to a leer on that otherwise amiable countenance; at all events his confessions lack that abject and shameful matter and manner which belong to the indecent revelations of a Rousseau. He knows that his frank speech is going to expose him to the lifted hands of prudery, but it is a part of his task to conceal nothing. His object is to throw all possible light upon the man he is and upon the being man is.
Why do we continue to cherish the memory and the work of such a writer? Do we turn back and again turn back to these essays as a ** human document,” or as^a product of the literary art? That Is a species of question with which we often tease ourselves unreasonably. Is not every work of art a human document, and every human document which lives In men’s minds (we do not mean In the back-rhamber of some scholar’s memory) a work of art? Matter so fine Is Incapable of expression through manner less fine. Prof. Dowden notes, with somewhat unnecessary emphasis, Montaigne’s defect In construction and unity. It is surely daring to speculate that this grand past master of the discursive would have been a grander past master If he linrt ii*on less discursive.
THE sum of the matter is that Montaigne has delighted several ages with his portrait of himself, and that he proposed to himself no other task. Says the author to the reader in that marvelously compact and eloquent introduction—and the words have left little. In truth, fer biographers and commentators of a later age to say—” Had I proposed to court the favor of the world I had set myself out in borrowed beauties; but ’t was my wish to be seen in my simple, natural, and ordinary garb, without study or artifice, for ’t was myself I had to paint. My defects will appear to the life, in all their native form, as far as consists with respect to the public. *	•	•
Thus, reader, thou perceivest, I am my-j self the subject of my book; ’t is not worth thy while to take up thy time further with such a trivial matter; so fare thee well.” What could such a farewell be but a beginning of intimacy?
