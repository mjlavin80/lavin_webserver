THE "Autobiographies " of ** The Cat,” by Violet Hunt, and " The Black Bear," by Ferry Robinson, in the series of Animal Autobiographies which the Macmillan Company is bringing out in this country, are slow appearing. The story of the cat, Loki, has a dozen colored pictures by Adolph Birkenruth, and the | same number by Joan Vort embellish the volume on the bear.
I The editor of the series, speaking in j his preface to “ The Cat,*’ says that j " Loki is a real cat in more senses than i one, and those who follow his life story j will find themselves better able to un! derstand their own cats than they have j ever been before.” In the foreword of his volume H. P. Robinson writes of the “ pathos ’’ when, in the western part of America, man invades the country of the ! bears and other animals. He writes:
Here in these rocky, tree-clad fastnesses the bears have kinged it for centu- I ries. * * * iiach Winter they have laid themselves down * * * to sleep through I Lhe bitter months. * * * But a Spring comes when they issue from their Winter j lairs and new sounds are borne to them on the keen, resin-scented mountain air. •* * * pimly wondering at the strange- ; ness of it all, the bears go forth, blunder-half awake, down the new-made pathways, not angry, but curious and perplexed, and by the trailside they meet man—man with a rifle in his hand. And, still not angry, still only wondering and fearing nothing—for are they not lords of all the mountainsides?—they die.
