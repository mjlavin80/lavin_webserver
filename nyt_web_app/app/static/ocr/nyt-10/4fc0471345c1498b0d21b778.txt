A. New Udition of His Complete Writings Translated Into ILnglish— His Place In Literature.
LFRED DE MUSSET, even in France, has a reputation curiously difficult to define or analyze, and, necessarily, his reputation among: readers of English is but a reflection, an echo, certainly subdued
i
and more or less perverted, of his repu-| tation in France. Three or four of his plays still, from time to time, reappear upon the stage, and i when they are rendered by actors with adequate passion and refinement, command admiration decidedly greater than was accorded them in the lifetime of their unfortunate writer. Certain of his verses are frequently praised and not infrequently cited, and there is reported a revival of demand for a portion of his novels and his published dramas. But the impression the general reader of French literature is most likely to get is that poor de Musset is oftenest spoken of and best remembered on account of his much-recounted and much-commented experience with George Sand, and beyond this source of current memory of him there remains of his writings, actually read in these days, barely enough to fill a couple of small volumes.
Yet it has occurred to a publishing house in New York (the Edwin C. Hill Company) to bring out in ten good-sized volumes, quite carefully illustrated, translations by various hands of his " Complete 'Writings." As the edition is of a thousand copies, and is handsuii. ly produced, it is to be assumed that expert judgment finds evidence of an interest in possessing de Musset’s writings which justifies the venture, and exceeds what we should have supposed to exist- The publishers would seem even to be confident of an interest that will put up with some pretty bad rendering of de Musset, since the translations, some of which are nearly as good as could be hoped for, include not a few that are singularly awkward, defective, and misleading. But if this elaborate edition In English shall turn the attention of readers to the really good work of de Musset and suggest to them to master it^n French, so far as those born to an alien tongue can hope to master it. it will have served a good purpose.

DE MUSSET’S best work was done before he was 30. most of it between the ages of 23 and 2G, and even in this short period of production the earlier output was better than the later. His very earliest was startlingly precocious, but hardly foreshadowed what was so soon to follow. It was the fluent expression, in the form of imitation, of intense admiration for the then heroes of the romantic school, and Its sincerity was undoubted. But within a few years, almost within a few months, it was to give place to work in which, professedly and actually, he sought to combine and did combine the best elements of the romantic and the classic schools and to these added a grace, suavity, strength, and sobriety quite his own. He was very young, a mere lad. He was plunged in the dissipations of youth in more than : one direction. He was courted, flattered, beloved, betrayed, and lived in a whirl of emotion, sentiment, passion. His brother Paul, six years older, and writing more than twenty years after the death of Alfred, describes his existence at this period in a ; manner that reveals much and implies more of its tremendous excitement, its moral and' mental dis-orderllness, its approach to what would now be re- 1 garded as a form of madness. Yet it was precisely at this time that de Musset- produced his plays— ! 44 Les Caprices de Marianne,*’ “ On ne badine pas avec 1* Amour"—and his poems “* L»es Nutts,” '* A ; Lamartine ”—and a few others by which he has , lived and will live in the literature of his language, j And, as it seems to the present writer, the essential
I_________________________________;_______________________
characteristic of these productions, which has enabled them to survive, is their dignity, their innate, subtle, adequate conformity to the conditions imposed by their subjects. Their sparkling wit, their intense passion, their humor and their pathos, the grace of manner, the sweep of swift advance to ' tragic culmination, are almost unfailingly and imperatively fitting. The oftener one reads them, If one surrenders himself to their spirit, the more complete and engaging is this sense of their admirable and compelling composition—not in the narrow sense of the word, but in the artist's sense.

JT requires something like temerity to compare any writer to Shakespeare, but so deliberate and responsible a critic as Henry James has made the venture in the case of de Musset with reference to the pure gayety, the native joyousness of his lighter vein. The kinship is even more apparent in the fortunate daring w*th which each sets the amusing and grotesque features of common life beside the profoundest tragedy. Nearly every character in " On ne badine pas avec 1’Amour,’* save the two women toward whose fate the drama resistlessly moves—even the man who brings that fate upon them—is touched with ridicule and satire. And it is only at the last moment that the drama turns from high comedy to intense tragedy. But the movement is the movement of life; the crisis arrives with perfect simplicity; it is more than convincing, it is inevitable. The reader, or the spectator, feels in very deed that the most wayward, the lightest-minded of us “ ne badine pas " with the elemental passion. Such emotion it is the privilege of few—very few— among the writers of any nation to disclose to us. And in works which, out of a pretty large output would, as we have intimated, fill only a couple of email volumes, de Musset does this.	E.	C,	,
