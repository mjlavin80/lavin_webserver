BOSTON NOTES.
A Handbook of United States Polit-ieal History—Other New Books Already Published or Announced.
T rurr intervals one nieouliters a	work of reference
tempting one to imitate that friend of the Autocrat who re .id ihe first volume of the " Nor/	American Eneyelo-
pacdia *' from “ A ” to “ Am/* and .such a book is Mr. Malcolm Townsend's ‘‘Handbook of I'niied Stairs Political	History.”	The publication of
works	of	tins sort	began early in the
nineteenth century, but it is a long way from “The American's Guide,” printed in Philadelphia in 1S10. lo this book of nearly ihricc ils size, and touching on topics not even named in 1S10. Prepared under the stimulus of the merciless questioning- of the author's boys, this work gives complete tables of information of all species. Genealogies, nicknames, autographs, lists uf the writings of all the Presidents; accounts of their educational advantages, and descriptions of their inaugural ions anti burial places; a political history oT the Confederate States; the province of each department of the general Government, ar° some of the contents of the volume. "When first issued, with the old Lothrop imprint, as “ I’- S. ('urious Facts,” it was comparatively small, but its size is now doubled and us information comes down to the* present year, justify, -ing its new title.

Mrs. Augusta Hale Gifford's " Italy ” has been in type for some time, but now appears formally. It is a volume 01 800 pages, indexed loss minutely than is strictly desirable, but fairly well equipped for reference, and it states the case between the blacks and the whites with uncommon fairness. It is strongest in its history of Rome, and the period between the fall of the empire and the accession of the^ House of Savoy to sovereignty Ls treated in decidedly summary fashion.
How to be naughty although virtuous is the problem solved by the children in Mrs. Richards’s holiday book, " The Armstrongs.” The story will be published by Messrs. Dana Estes & Co., and at the same time will appear Mr. Edward S. Ellis’s '* Plucky Jo,” which, beginning in an American district school, with the achievement of damming a forest spring to make a swimming place, ends with adventures among the Chunchos, "the worst Indians in Peru and in all South America.’*

An odd survival of the literary convention that the poor are essentially blameless appears In the protests against Air. George S. Wasson’s “ The Green Shay," with its portrayal of the wrecker and his ways, and of the dull indifference to Christianity in some seaboard settlements. On the other hand, the officials of the Life Saving Service have hastened to thank the author for the accuracy of his descriptions of their work, and of the lawless deeds of the wreckers. The first edition has been sold in the United States, a second in England, and the third is nearly ready.

A third edition of Mr. George Cary Eggleston's ** A Daughter of the South ’* is already necessary within six weeks of its publication day, and the Victorian Society's intended celebration of Trafalgar Day Is beyond all expectation augmenting the orders Cor Capt. Mahan's " Sea Power in Its Relations to the War of 1R12But who can tell what may happen to any book, serious or light? *'Jorn Uhl,” Gustave Frenssen’s novel, which at first seemed likely to repeat Its European success in this , country, and then was neglected, is now the object of a steady stream of small orders from booksellers all over the Union wheresoever there are German settlers. The death of Mr. Jefferson causes the appearance of a holiday edition of Mr. Nathan Haskell Dole's “ Joseph Jefferson at Home,” a monograph, illustrated with sixteen photographs of Mr. Jefferson’s Summer 'environment; it will be bound in ooze leather, with Jefferson’s autograph reproduced on the cover, and will bear the Estes imprint.

Besides Capt. Mahan’s boofc, Messrs: Little; Brown & Co. will also publish tomorrow Miss t.fltan \vhltlnff*s ** The Joy That No Man Taketh from You," a little book Intended to exhibit the entire possibility of leading a Christian life, and containing the witness both in prose and poetry of a great number of confessors of many shades of Christianity. “ Tho Select Poems of Robert Browning," arranged in chronological order by Mr. N. J. George, Is set down for tho same date. Mr. George’s intention Is both biographical and critical, and bo recounts the cir-under which each poem was written, besides comparing the author with Wordsworth and Tennyson.

Saturday of next week wUJ bring Mr. Jlenry Jnmes's " English Hours,’’ with its eighty pictures by Mr, Pennell, and four papers not before printed in book form, and " in Our Convent Days." by Miss Agnes Reppiier. It is a striking exem- | piifieation of the proverVi concerning half the world and the other half that Protestant readers of The Atlantic papers con- , stituting this book have supposed that its j scene was a French convent, although it Is really situated in Pennsylvania. The pupils are more strictly cloistered, if the word may be allowed, than in some other convents, and to-day the government is exactly what is was in Miss Repplier’s time. Mr. Edward Stanwood’s " James G. Blaine/' Mr. Albert Phelps's " Louis* iana," Mr. George Cabot Lodge's sonnet sequence, " The Great Adventure,” " Letters from the Dead to the Dead," by “ Oliver Lector," and ** Saxe,” an illustrated group of sixteen poems, and i Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co.’s further announcements for the last Saturday in October. There is also a new edition of Dr. Holmes’s *' The One Hoss Shay," with Mr. Howard** Pyle's illustrations, now placcd at the price of an ordinary novel.
"The Bible Beautiful,'* by MUa Estelle M. Huril, published by Messrs. L. C. Page & Co. this week, will be conspicuous ; among religious gift books, for it is much more than a collection of pictures on Scriptural subjects. The author has studied the subject of Bible printing and publication, and has used her wide knowledge of art to such good purpose that no century and no country Is left unnoted in her book. An illuminated title page printed in gold and two colors; some of the great hymns of the Church; an outline of subjects in the “ Bihlia Pau-perum ” and selections from the *' Byzantine Guide to Painting ” are added to the text, and the work is indexed by “Artists." by "Places," and by “Bible Subjects,” a precautionary measure of much value in these days when the Scriptures are not too sedulously searched. j STEPHENSON BHOWNB.
