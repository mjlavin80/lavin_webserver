the TRAVELING THIRDS. By Gertrud©

MRS. ATHERTON'S lutust story is as unlike her stories of “ Senator North '* and " The Conquerors *' as is Mark Twain’s humor unlike that of Carolyn Wells's. The writing of “ The Traveling Thirds" was probably simply a relaxation from Mrs. Atherton's usually strenuous style. The Moultons, excellent ; middle, class suburbanites, have decided j to tour the continent. Mr. Moulton, a kindly gentleman and a reader and literary adviser for a large publishing house, has a certain position to sustain. His daughters, Jane and Lydia, have spent their lives in a " literary atmosphere." Not among the giants of the profession, because these are always too busy to go to suburban house parties, but among the lesser lights that are trying to illuminate the world with their feeble candlepowers. Lydia, the younger daughter, having but lately passed the first quarter century post, yearns for the congeniality of an, unliterary mind. Lydia is of a gold and white prettiness and is a bit of a flirt.
To join the party comes Catalina Shore, a product of the golden West. Frankly, we are disappointed in Catalina, Why should a writer of Mrs. Atherton’s ability create so commonplace a heroine? Does not almost every lady of modern fiction carry her head like a Queen above the ** white column of her throat”? Have not nearly all of them wonderful, unfathomable eyes of a strange .mysterious beauty; hair of shimmering abundance, and a figure of tender youthful curves? Catalina, In spite of a far-off Indian ancestor. is much like other heroines of romance.
In Spain, where the party goes, romances crop up at once. Only one long-drawn-out one for Catalina, but the flirtatious Lydia's pale charms attract first a decadent nobleman and later a dusky peasant—a man with* the impious name of Jesus Maria—a beautiful, passionate, and very annoying savage, who wants not only Lydia, but the money which he foolishly supposed the paternal Moulton possesses.
There -are,--of ^course/ TTmrry adventures and a final quarrel between Catalina and her relatives—whereupon the relatives, Including the much-sought Lydia, take passage for home at once and straightway fade out of the utory. But Catalina stays on and finishes *ier romance.
