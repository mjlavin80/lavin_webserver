. The -American girls also are credited with adopting the g&me more wholeheartedly than their English sisters., The average English girl does not make so many sacrifices for golf as the American. Vardon’s familiarity with these differences in both countries causes him ^to say of the American girl:
She tucks up her sleeves like a man, and in the soles of her shoes she has plenty of goodly sized nails. And | ishe does not look a tittle the worse for any of these things; indeed, the picture | of the determined, strenuous, and yet charming lady golfer was one of the most attractive that I saw when in America.	*
The novice seeking for points as well as the veteran who may peruse its pages for mere entertainment will find this book equally interesting. The sixty-five illustrations are admirable object lessons in the study of easy and difficult strokes; while some of the anecdotes that give piquancy to the reminiscences will repay repetition
T IS paying high- but well-deserved praise to Haxry Vardon to saythat alInsincere lovers of 'the; gartfe* will enjoy reading his booH on golf as much as they enjoy seeing him play. He has accomplished what has often been, called the Impossible, the writing of a helpful vbook in an entertaining manner by one swho is an acknowledged expert of the game. This success is all the more pleasing in Harry Vardon's case, because practically his entire life has "been spent on the links. At the age of
7	years he began his golfing career as a caddie on the Isle of Jersey, where he was born in 1S70. At the age of 20 he got his first position as club “ professional.” At 23 he made his first bid for that great honor coveted by every professional, the open championship of Great Britain. It was not until three years later, when 2G years old, that he reached that pinnacle of golfing excellence, and his title has since been unquestioned as one of the most finished players that the ifnnals of the sport can show.
Vardon has held the British open championship four times, the American open championship once, besides winning first prise in over forty-eight first-class tournaments. Truly a record to be proud of and one that would doubtless cause 1)9 per cent, of our amateurs to cry “ enough.” But not a hint does Vardon give of his inclination to retire.
“ I hope to play many of my best games in the future,” he says confidently, ** for it takes longer to kill the golf in a man than it does to breed it.’’
These words are indicative of the keynote of the book, foi* a whole-hearted enthusiasm, coupled with the everpresent hopefulness of better things to come, runs through it from cover to cover. Above all, it is brim full of common sense* The didactic method is happily lacking. Because Vardon prefers a certain club or makes a stroke in a certain way, he does not demand that the novice do likewise. He recognizes the great latitude of individuality in golf and humors, even if he may smile, at the little absurdities which frequently take such complete possession of a player’s confidence.
SOME OF VARDON’S ADVICE.
NO GOLFER plays well with a club in which he has completely lost confidence,” he adds, and cites that well-known warning that a player should stick to his old tools when about to engage in an important match. Has not every golfer at some time, as he stepped to the tee, instinctively ” had bis doots " about his ability to do as well as he ought with his favorite club V	{
When this grave uncertainty exists, and there is a new and good substitute ready at hand, the latter should not be disregarded because of a kind of instinct that In a big fight it is best to stick to the old weapons. A golfer may have been putting badly for a long time, but directly he takes a new putter In his hand he feels that a great change for the better has been effected, and forthwith he begins to astonish himself by holing out from almost anywhere. There is no accounting for these things. They seem absurd, but there they are.
However advisable it may be for the beginner to curtail eccentricities of form in the fundamentals of the game, La the delicate and trying art of putting, he is advised to give free scope to the method that comes most naturally to him. Here, then, is something delightfully consoling to the novitiate who has been laboriously striving to ape the style of _some famous veteran of the links. As Vardon expresses It:
I believe seriously that every man has had a particular kind of putting method awarded to him by nature, and when he putts exactly in this way he will do well, and when he departs from his natural system he will miss the long ones, and the short ones, too*. It will come unconsciously to his aid when he Is not thinking of anybody’s advice or ot anything that he has ever read in any book on golf.
Naturally, the game individuality holds good in respect to the putter itself. Whether it Is a crooked neck affair, a putting cleek, an ordinary aluminium, a wooden putter, or the latest

rfesice" of “one of these freaks of fancy in his own case. Never in his life, he says, has he putted better than In the two rounds which won him his first championship. He was playing off the tie fSen with 3* H, Taylor. Having Celt he was off his putting, he picked up in Ben Sayers’s shop at North Berwick a light cleek that had apparently been cast aside as useless. A sudden inspiration came to him to use the cleek as a putter with the substitution of a shorter shaft. ** I fancied this new discovery of mine and had confidence in it, and that was why I got all those long putts down," but, adds Vardon, “ though I keep it still and treasure it, I have never played with that putter since. It has done its duty."
THE NEED OF PATIENT PRACTICE.
IF THE practical suggestions offered to the beginner were more generally adopted the percentage of good golfers as compared to what Vardon aptly styles " the noble army of fooz-lers,” would be considerably enhanced. But the desire to reduce one’s score at the uutset rises paramount in nine cases out of ten to the necessity of patient practice, and ere long the player finds himself hopelessly enmeshed in the class of mediocrity.
Get hold of the game stroke by stroke,” advises Vardon, and undergo this slow process of tuition for three months at least, preferably more. The excellent golf of Prime Minister Balfour is due to this tedious method of learning. Under the guidance of Tom Dunn Mr. Balfour spent a miserable fortnight in bunkers alone learning how to get out of them from every possible position. Vardon is a firm believer in professional advice for the beginner, but this is not all. He places great faith in the study of other players* methods. “ There are few from whom one is not~abIe to learn something,” he says. As for himself, he admits tha£ be never took a golfing lesson in his life, and he attributes whatever style he may possess to the result of watching others play. How many -golfers have attributed their failure to that horrible bugaboo, nervousness! Vardon frankly admits that he does not know what it is. Fortunate man, indeed, and his explanation is philosophic, oven though it may not be wholly convincing to the rank and file.
The feeling uppermost in my mind was that I had everything to gain and nothing to lose. Only when a man has everything to lose and nothing to gain should he become uneasy about his game. My rapid success may have been in large measure due to this indifference.	;
SELECTION OP CLUBS.
VAHDON'S words on the selection of clubs come in very apropos at the present time, and they may have a sobering effect upon those players who have suddenly become enamored of long-shaft drivers simply because Travis and other players of note have commenced playing with them. Vardon deprecates extremes in length or shortness. 41 There is nothing like the happy medium," he adds, “ which has proved its capability of getting the longest balls.’* Naturally the length of the club should vary according to the height of the player. It is best to buy few clubs at the start, knowing that probably not one will have a place In the bag a yfear or two later. Six dubs are ample for the beginner—a driver, brassie, cleek, iron, mashle, and putter—to which, a little later, a niblick may be added. Vardon’s set consists of eleven—two drivers, a brassie. a baffy, or spoon, which is returning to favor; two cleeks, an iron, two mashles, one for running up and one for pitching; a niblick^ and two putters. Vardon,gives his reasons, and very good ones they are, for preferring the spliced driver to the socket ! driver. What the latter gains in neat* ness of appearance it loses In spring : and life.
