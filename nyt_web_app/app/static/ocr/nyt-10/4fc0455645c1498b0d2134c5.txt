THE Idea of sacrifice here unfolded is precious to Prof. Woodberry and is in a marked degree the prominent, if not the controlling, idea in his work. But we cannot find that it is necessarily involved in the events which he describes. Undoubtedly there has been a series of civilizations and nations, and there haa been a series of great cultures. But IL does not appear clear that each member of these series perished in the interest of its successor. Rather each member was in considerable degree merged in its successor, contributed to its force, continued in that way a really vital existence. Particu-: larly is this true in the matter of cultures. The j Greek nation, the Roman nation, as a politically organized entity, passed away, but the descendants of ! the Greeks and those of the Homans mingled with, other races, and were a most important element In the resulting combination. Still more obviously did Greek culture and later Greco-Roman culture merge in the evolving intellectual life of Europe and of the world. The characteristics of sacrifice in the.process are not apparent. And in modern times, say, broadly,
since the close of the mediaeval period, not only has the absolute subjugation of peoples ceased practically to occur, but the interaction of intellectual currents has become so free and is likely to become so much more free that the “ dying *' of a great culture is extremely difficult to imagine, and it is still rooro difficult to demonstrate.

WHEN Prof. Woodberry leaves the field of thdj* ory, or, rather, when he imports Into that field specific appreciation and criticism, he is often extremely instructive, and, what is more important, if he will pardon us for saying so, he is stimulating,, satisfying, and quite delightful. What he has to say of Shelley particularly, in whom he takes great joy, and his acute and sympathetic estimate of Milton, are things which the lovers of these poets' or of their poetry may feed upon with relish and digest to profit And though it is late in the day. to repeat ltt and needless, it is a pleasure to acknowledge - the sincerity, the pure-xnindedness, ■ the ,;wholo-hearted love of the best, that shine In Prof.
O	FIND the secret of intellectual evolu- I tion, to explain the continuity which is to be seen in it and account for the breaks which also are to be seen—this certainly is a fascinating pursuit, and few professional students of literature escape its allurement. Prof. George Edward Woodberry has certain qualifications for the task which justify his undertaking it, though he may fall perceptibly short of its achievement. A couple of years since he delivered before the Lowell Institute of Boston a series of eight lectures with practically this V aim. Their announced subject was " Race Power In Literature,” and they are now published by McClure, Phillips & Co. under the title of " The Torch,0 which is appropriate in its indefiniteness.
The theorizing portion of Prof. Woodberry's extremely interesting little volume does not strike the unprofessional student of literature as the best por» tion. It seems to suffer from an excess of emotion.
It is slightly overeloquent and proportionately defective in clearness. The writer is impressed and moved by certain aspects of history and seeks to present them, with entire sincerity, but not altogether convincingly, as 1:1 such passages as this:
Race history is a perpetual celebration of the mass. The Cross initials every page with its broad gold, and he whose eye misses that letter has lost the ciue to the meaning. I do not refer to the.self-devotion of individuals, the sacred lives of the race. I speak of the involuntary element in1 the life of na-* tions, or what seems such on the vast scale of social life. Always some great culture is dying to enrich the soil of new harvests, some civilization is crumbling to rubbish to be the hill of a more beautiful city, some race is spending itself that a lower and more barbarous world may inherit its stored treasure house.
