First among all other things. I-uther Burbank is unique among men in his knowledge of nature and in his manipulations and interpretation of her forces. Other men have been plant breeders and have pro.duced remarkable results in Improved fruits and flowers- They have achieved a merited reputation; indeed, in some cases this high reputation has passed on into a certain measure of fame. But Mr. Burbank has not only created plants and improved them upon a colossal scale, but he has.- at the same time studied nature with infinite patience and skill, observing her manifestations, analyzing her laws, and defining and interpreting her functions. His life work has been primarily twofold in its sweep:	First, em~
bracing the wildest possible service to the world, and, second, accomplishing this service under the most exacting and persistent adherence to scientific truth* He is, in his department of life, scientist and philosopher and plant breeder and horti- , culturist bound into one.
Thus writes W. S. Harwood in his ac- ! count of the life and work of the well- j known plant breeder, Luther Burbank, which Is published by the Macmillan i Company under the title, " New Creations in Plant Life." Following the brief ' account of Mr. Burbank's career down to the present time, Mr. Harwood has a chapter on his methods of work in general. He then passes on to a discussion of the individual creations of the breeder, describing the trees created by him, the
amaryllis and the poppy, the Dotato and “ pomato." Ulles, plums, and prunes, the " Shasta." daisy, cacti, breeding plants for perfumes, &c. There are also chapters on breeding and grafting and the commercial aspect of the work; a description of a day with Mr. Burbank, and his personality. The volume is profusely illustrated from photograph*.
