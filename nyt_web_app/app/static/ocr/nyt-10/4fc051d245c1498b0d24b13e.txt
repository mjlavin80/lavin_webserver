AT THE EM PE HOIl’S WISH. A Tale of the New Japan. fciy Oscar King- Davis. IllustnitcnJ in colors. lUmo. .New Yoik: ID. Appleton & Co.
MR. DAVIS names this a tale of the new Japan. Really in the romantic j	essentials it is very much like those
i tales of old Japan—surpassingly brave In men and lovely in women—with which we are familiar in the works of Mr. John ' Luther Long and Mrs. Frazior and the I rest. To be sure, the bravery is displayed j In the late war in Manchuria, and In the I face not of mediaeval two-sworded samu-^ raJ, but of intrenched Russians with modern rifles. The story tells of old Kudo Jukichi, a samurai with only his
*	traditions left—officially there are no longer samurai in Japan—proud but poor, and Kutami Chobei, a commoner, who is rich and otherwise admirable. Kutami makes shoes, which he presents to the Emperor’s soldiers to march in, and both Kudo and Kutami have sons, the apples 1 of their several eyes—the samurai dos-tined for the army and the commoner for commerce.	j
They go to the same school—one found- j . ed and endowed by the commoner—and are not friends, and when the war comes both fight in Manchuria in the same company, so that the gentleman by immemorial descent may learn that a commoner’s son may be a better gentleman and a better soldier. The Interest of the story depends really upcn a girl—the daughter of old Kudo, a girl who Is everything that a woman in ** romance of " new Japan ” ought to be—beautiful, simple, brave, devoted. For she loves the commoner's son from her school days upward. The little story deals pleasantly 1 with noble sentiments and poeLic justice, and ts adorned about the heads of the pages with the usual vanities of " holiday books.” It is, however, one of those stories which play upon the ” prettinesses ” of Japan—even the manly virtues are so sublimated as to have that aspect —and, as a Japanese gentleman remarked the other day, the Japanese are no ** butterfly people,’* but men even us we. Per- . haps they resent this kind of thing.
