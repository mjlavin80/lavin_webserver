HOLLAND.
A Book of RambTes and Miscellaneous Bataviana by E. V- Lacas.*
MEN it is said that Mr. Lucas has made his Dutch towns and canals as charming as he did the highway a uiid byways of English Sussex, everything has been said which need be said In praise of this new book of his. Rambling over Holland as fancy leads, he mingles with quaint observations of the country and people as they now are a whimsical miscellany of reminiscence—scraps of history —bits about paintings and painters, scholars, soldiers, princes, and other British wanderers among the Dutch—like Goldsmith, say—with quotations from what these others have written in praise and blame. The fact is Mr. Lucas comes near being in his book exactly what one would like a well-informed and companionable fellow-traveler to be If one were seeing Holland with one's own eyes. And the pictures, both Mr. Marshall’s water colors and the reproductions of the masters, fit in exactly with the author’s humor and are as excellently executed as they are judiciously chosen. These sage general remarks will not serve, however, to give the reader so good an idea of "A Wanderer in Holland * as may be gathered from a few very * andom passages from the text. Such passages are therefore provided. Here is one very characteristic. The immediate subjects are Dutch barges and canal boats:
*
Spring cleaning goes on here, as in the Dutch houses, ail the year round, and the domiciliary part of the vessels is SDOtless. Every bulwark has a washing tray that can be fixed or detached In a moment.
Its a fine day, let us kill something," says the Englishman; “ here's an odd moment, let us wash something,” says the Dutch vtouw.
In another place Mr. Lucas observes upon the universal Dutch appearance of health, and adds:
That the Dutch die (nevertheless) there is no doubt, for a funeral Is aii almost ' daily object and the aanspreker Is continually hurrying by: but where are the dead? The cemeteries are minute and the churches have no churchyards. Of death, however, when he comes the nation Is very proud. The mourning customs are -severe and enduring. No expense is spared in spreading the interes* ing tidings. It is for this purpose that the aanspreker flourishes in his importance and pomp. Draped heavily In black from house to house he moves, wherever the slightest ties of personal or business acquaintanceship exist, and announces his news. A lady of Hilversum tells me that she was once formally the recipient of the message, ** Please, ma’am, the baker’s compliments and he's dead.** the time and place of the Interment following. The aanspreker was once occasionally assisted by the huilehalk, but I am afraid his day is over. The huilebalk accompanied the aanspreker from house to house and wept on the completion of their sad message. If properly paid, says my informant, real tears coursed down his cheeks; in any case, his presence was a luxury possible only to the rich. The aanspreker is called in also at the other end of life. Assuming a jocund air, he trips from house to house announcing little strangers.
At Rotterdam (of which In general he thinks but meanly) Mr. Lucas praises the zoo and writes particularly of the stork “ whose nest is set high on a pinnacle of the buffalo house."
He was building in the leisure! v style of the British workingman. He would negligently descend from the heavens with a stick. This he would lav on the fabric and then carefully perform his toilet, looking round and down all the time to see that every one else was busy. Whenever his eye lighted upon a toddling child or a perambulator it visibly brightened. ** My true work! *’ he seemed to
-	say “This nest building is a mere bypath Of industry,*’
At Dordrecht, naturally, one traveling in Mr. Lucas’s company finds Dumas and “ La Tulipe Noire,” with good Rosa and envious Boxtel and the brothers De Witt —a more authentic account of whose end Is inserted, as well as the story of the " evasion ’’ of the philosopher Grotlus, whose wife sent him out of prison concealed, appropriately, in a box of book3. At Gorinchem (called Gorcum) the author was much stared at by the inhabitants on account of the headgear of his companion—'* one of those comely straw hats trimmed with roses which we rail early Victorian and which the hot Summer of 1904 brought in again." To the people of Gorcum the *' comelyM thing was an offense. “ The men whistled, the women sniggered, the girls laughed, the children shouted and ran beside us. The town's aesthetic ideals were honestly outraged, and it took the simplest means of making its protest,”
At The Hague the author stopped at a hotel with a tragedy. “ For the greatest misfortune that had come upon a hotel keeper had crushcd this house. Baedeker I had excised their star.” Mr. Lucas won- ; dered, as he observed the landlady’s grief, “if it were better to have had a j star and lost it, or never to have hart a star at alL”	i

fertjes and two waffeln.” These confections are prepared witli such celerity that Mr. Lucas, who doesn't seem to know that the waffle is domesticated In many parts of the United States, declares, nevertheless, that the Americans* “ quick lunch ’* has a Dutch origin. They borrowed celerity in cooking and serving from some Knickerbocker deviser of pof-fertjes and waffeln in the early days of New York." H.e wonders that Washington Irving omitted to say as much.
