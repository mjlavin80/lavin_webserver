MISS G. E. MITTON’S book on “ Normandy,” for which Nico Jun groan has made forty colored pictures, is at last being sent out by the Macmillan Company. She has endeavored* she writes in her preliminary chapter, to write of those towns and sights that are of most interest to the traveler who does not go through Normandy with guidebook in hand. On her way from town to town She stops to examine a native's dress, j her or his way of talking, the customs,
! &C.
; Among the cities described are Houen, Caen, Falaise, Bayeux, Cotentln, Dieppe, and several smaller ones. There are also a couple of chapters on " The Norman Dukes ” and “ The Mighty William.” and the final chapter is about a sail '* Up the Seine/*
The illustrations, like those in the other volumes of this series, including “ Holland/* “Ireland," “Brittany/* 41 The English Lakes/’ &c., are beautiful, and are reproduced in their original ^colors. They show Norman peasants, their various costumes, houses, cathedrals, rural scenes, streets, &c. The author's preface reads as follows:
Pen and brosh 2 re both necessary in the attempt to give an impression of a country—ipord painting for the brain, color for the eye. Yet even then there must be gaps and a sad lack of completeness, which is felt by njo one more than by the coadjutors who have produced this book. There are so many aspects under which a country, may be seen. In the case of Normandy, for instance, one man looks for magnificent architecture alone, another for country scenes, another for peasant life, and each and all will cavil at a book which docs not cater for their particular taste. Cavil they must; tlie artist and author have tried here * * * to show Normandy as it appeared to them, and the matter must be colored by their personalities.
