ART AND SCIENCE..
An Untechnical Glance at Dr. Austin Flint’s New “ Handbook of Physiology.”
E do not undertake to comment on technical scientific works, especially those designed for use in instruction in professional sc	hools. Such	comment would
necessarily	take us into	a field too wide
and varied and demanding' for its proper treatment more	‘	expert *’ writing than the	general reader
would	find	interesting.	But there is	a feature of Dr.
Austin Flint’s “ Handbook of Physiology,” just brought out by the Macmillan Company, which is of distinctly general interest and to which attention may properly he called. It is the successful use of the three-color process in reproducing, at moderate cost, the appearance of physiologic objects under the microscope.
The printing from ordinary process plates of colored drawings or lithographs at what may be called “ commercial " rates, enabling the resulting representations to be used to advantage in publications of reasonable cost, though relatively new, is well enough understood and quite frequently employed. The reproduction in black and white of microscopic objects is still older and more familiar. And the reproduction of such objects by the three-color process had also been accomplished some ten years since, but at a cost quite prohibitory for ordinary textbooks. But we believe that Dr. Flint's illustrations in color, which are quite numerous, are the first which reproduce with almost perfect accuracy as to form and color the exact appearance of microscopic objects.
THIS achievement., in the first place, adds very greatly to the beauty of the illustrations and to the ease ~ and certainty w*ith which they can be studied. But they have, in such works as his, a peculiar value due to the fact that the histological elements are often differentiated by their affinities for various dyes, and can be recognized in stained preparations only. The colors disclosed by prepared objects do not, therefore, aid simply in the ready recognition of the elements, they reveal at a glance the ' actual character of each element and render it impossible to confuse it with another. Even the general reader can see in this something of the advantage of the process of representative colors used; for example, in the valuable atlases of the Census Bureau, which give immediate and emphatic impressions of truth based on a mass of statistics, and difficult fully to grasp by the most careful study. The difficulties encountered in the effort to master the complete revelations of the microscope when presented solely in black and white are, of course, almost incalculably greater. The method attained after long experimentation by Dr. Flint, with the aid of Dr. Edward Learning, Instructor in Photography in Columbia University, who produced the negatives through accurate color filters, practically removes these difficulties.

JT is not in the preparation of textbooks like the *• Handbook of Physiology" only that this development of photomicrography will prove of signal value. It opens a very large part of the general field of study by means of the microscope to a vast number of students. We happen to know, for instance, of Original work in the microscopic study of bacteriology of substantial value, the results of which ii papers illustrated with approximate accuracy from colored drawings made by the investigator could only be published at a cost almpst prohibitory. With the improved method the publication of such results can be made at very small cost, with illustrations reproduced directly from photomicrographs and almost completely accurate as to color as well as form. It is a change equivalent to the sub-

stitution in historical research, or in litigation, of original docu nents for more or less imperfect copies.
Since Dr. Flint's “ Handbook " is the occasion for this article, we cannot leave it without a word of recognition for tho extraordinarily lucid style which this veteran professor—with nearly a half century of teaching now to his credit—has achieved. It might well be the envy if not the despair oj professional writers.
ONE OF THE FOUNDERS.
Ti;DOR JENKS, in his “ Captain Myles Standish," (Century Company,) has given an interesting account of what he calls an “ unexplained figure " among the founders of New England—unexplained because, though a true comrade of the Mayflower brethren, Myles Standish1 was not of their Church nor a participant in their religious views, and left a life of professional soldiering to accompany them, yet \\ as revered and beloved. The method the author of this book has followed is like that of his other book on John Smith. It is intended, perhaps, more for youthful than for mature readers, although we imagine that it will interest these as well. The story of Myles Standish involves, of course, that of the Pilgrims in their adventures in America, a little of their experiences in Holland, a little of the conditions of Elizabethan England. Indeed, this chron^ icle is more of them than of him, and is practically a history of the Plymouth settlement.''
The story of the Pilgrims’ landing and their earlier struggles is one that few could make dull; Mr. Jenks has made it extremely entertaining. If is a story that contains naught about the stern and rock-bound coa3t, constant dread of hostile Indians, or the survival of the first Winter by the miserable remnant of a terror-stricken band. The Pilgrims were fortunate in their landing, wise and friendly and firm in their treatment of the Indians; and instead of experiencing the exceptionally severe Winter that the romancers have imagined, experienced a rather mild one. The later complications that arose were indeed serious, and involved many questions of policy and decisive actions in which Standish took a leading part. Yet the story is rather one of successful and bold procedure than of suffering and failure in any respect. Mr. Jenks contrasts it significantly with that of the Jamestown settlement.
He takes occasion to consider the sentimental tradition that Longfellow has erected into literature in " The Courts'.iip of Myles Standish.” It is no more than a tradition, and it may be true; but, as is pointed out, it is not likely that Capt. Standish would have sent Alden to do his courting for him, being not a bashful youth, but a widower. Nor is the picture of men and manners in Plymouth that Longfellow drew at all true to the facts of history, and it has done much to spread wrong ideas about them. It is to be observed that Standish sent for the sister of his first wife to come over from England to marry him not less than a year before Priscilla Mullins's marriage.
