MR.. WATERS has produced an interesting: history of an interesting New England town. He claims Macaulay as his model, and adds: “ I have tried to tell accurately but in readable fashion the story of the builders of our town; their homes and I home life-, their employments, their | Sabbath keeping, their love of learning,
; their administration of town affairs, | their stern delusions, their heroism in j j war and In resistance to tyranny.”
1 Ipswich was a typical New England town, starting as most other towns started, and going through the usual 1 tribulations. Founded in 1623, the town wa3 called Agawam first; its name was changed to Ipswich in 1634. j In 1067 one of its deputies to the General Court, Capt. Appleton, was not allowed to sit because he had signed a petition against the measures of Charles II. Ipswich, in fact, presented the largest petition against the establishment of Episcopacy, seventy-two freemen signing it, while only twenty-six signed one from Boston. In 1642 Ipswich freemen granted that there shal be a free Schole M; and the school founded then is still " keeping ” to-day. King Philip’s war did not actually reach Ipswich town; but her sons took part in it, Daniel Denison being Commander in Chief of all the Massachusetts forces, and six score Ipswich men serving in the ranks. In 1656 Ipswich began to indulge in witches; but not until 1692, when Salem had set the pace, did the town join in extermInat- ! ing witches and wizards. Giles Corey, I who has the melancholy fame of being the only person pressed to death in this 1 country, was an Ipswich man, and cth- i er victims came from the same place, j During the wars with the French and I the Indians in the time of William and Mary Ipswich played a good part,
; hundreds of men carrying arms in defense of their neighbors' homes as well as their own.
, Mr. Waters’s description of the man-j ners and customs of the Ipswich people is entertaining—not differing probably from those of their fellow-colonists, but told in the old chronicles with cu-| riously photographic exactness. Mr, Ward, the minister of the town, as early as 1650 let himself out against the wealthy women of his congregation in these well-chosen words: “ When I heare a nugiperous Gentle-dame inquire what dress the Queen is in this week, what the nudius tertian of the Court, I look at her as the very gizzard of a trifle, the product of the Quarter of a ^cypher, the epitome of nothing, fitter to be kickt, if she were of a kickable substance, than either honored or humored.’' What could they have been wearing in those days and in that place to deserve such language? Mr. Waters says that our idea of Prisciila the Puritan maiden is incorrect; Mistress Lechford of Ipswich had a tailor-made gown in 1040, and no one went in a plain gown who could afford one laced.
The second part of Mr. Waters’s book deals with the houses and lands of the town; he hopes to complete the hist Dry of Ipswich in another volume.
