This is the theme of Dr. Henry van Dyke's new volume of “ Essays in Application," which Charles Scribner's Sons are publishing. He deals with such subjects as *‘ Ruling Classes in a Democracy,’1
Publieomania," ** The Powers That Be," “ The Flood of Books," " Books, Literature, and the People,” " Christianity and Current Literature" ** The Church in the City." “ The Creative Ideal of Education," " The School of Life." &c. He has taken up the different topics from the point of view of " one who wishes to be guided in every day judgments and affairs by a sane idealism. The book makes no claim to be a defense or even a statement of a complete system of philosophy or faith. It is simply a collection of essays in application." Dr. van Dyke writes in his preface:
The forces that impel action reside in temperament. The ideals and convictions that guide, it are hidden in the mind and heart. A man moves slowly or swiftly, he does his work weakly or strongly, according to the energy that is in him. But the direction of his life, this way or that way, follows the unseen influence of what he admires and loves and believes in* It is not easy to take stock of these controlling Ideals and convictions and estimate them at their true value. It is harder still to arrange and order them in a system-clear, logical, consistent—a philosophy of life. *	*	* And if, as I believe, life is
the test of thought, rather than thought the test of life, we should be able to get light on the real worth of a man's theories, ideals, beliefs, by looking at the shape which they would give to human existence if they were faithfully applied.
