MR. RUSSELL’S Lock is made up, apparent J y with little or no change, of a series, of articles published by j Every body's Magazine during the pact i few months;. The greatest trust in . the ! world, according to Mr. Russell, is the so-called Beef Trust; and accepting his figures as conecl, it must be owned that he seems to justify his ascription of the I it! p.	.
Over a year ago Mr. Thomas W„ Lawson “ of lioston '* began to contribute articles cn "Frenzied Finance’* to the j same magazine. After sixteen or seventeen months Mr. Lawcon appears to be about as far along in his story, whatever that is, as he was before he began—like i the dog;, that turns around half a dozen times and lies down on the same spot. Air. Russell, however, a trained newspaper man, dealing with a subject of much greater public Interest than the half-maudlin, half-triumphant confessions of Mr. Lawson, has told* his story, and told it. well. Except in his chapter headings and in his lust few chapters he has told it soberly, marshaling his facts i and stating his case plainly, a’hd on the whole forcibly.
The author traces the development of ! this trust from the Invention of ibe private refrigerator car. Each car pays for itself in a little over two years; the railroads haul the cars at lower than the regular rates, and make repairs on them; the "trust” charges several prices for Ice, whether ice be used or not. Thus fortified, able to terrify the Presidents of the “ great '* railroads so that they dared not‘meet publicly to protest against its ! demands; the I!ecf Trust sits, like the Old

on those of the American public. Mr. Russell tells how it has suppressed competition, and of the ruin that has followed | its progress in the grazing States. lie names thirty-two banks that failed owing to the trust’s demoralization of the cattle markets; in fact, his statements | arc as a rule supported by evidence, and , the trust has not sued him or his pub-Ushers for libel—as yet.
An interesting part of the book deals with Commissioner Garfield's report on t!ie Eeef Trust. Mr. Russell ridiculcs and attacks this, making statements distinctly libelous If untrue. He says, for example, that Mr. Garfield d:d not write the report himself, that he was entertained too well at the Saddle and Sirloin Club in Paekingtown to care to Investigate his entertainers; that he saw only what the packers wanted him to see, and that his figures arc wrong, and hence his deductions. In support of this last statement, Mr. Russell offers the testi-many of various experts in the cattle business; he says that Mr. Garfield was ** fubbed off ” with the figures kept for public inspection, and never took notice that the trust got rebates. In fact, he makes a very good case against Mr. Garfield as incompetent for his job, and against the value of his report. Recent court, events—the heavy fines imposed on four of the trust’s managers on their confession of guilt, the evidence before the Inter-State Commerce Commission on the icing matter, and the private-car linos, all bear out Mr. Russell’s book, fin:shed some months ago.
The book is interesting and may be of value. It is handicapped, of course, by having appeared serially in the magazine which “features’* Mr. Lawson's story; if it is worth anything, however, It will make a placc for itself.
