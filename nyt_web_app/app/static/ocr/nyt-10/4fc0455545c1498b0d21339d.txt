MR. BROWN Is right In saying that Venice has not yet been written Out. His book is proof of the correctness of his statement, so far as it is concerned; what yet remains lo be told we do not know. He saya, however, that the city is inexhaustible The book Is a collection of essays on various sides of Venetian life, evincing great knowledge of the place and Us people, put together in no particular order, but all connected because they have to do with Venice. In the introductory chapter occurs a typical digression. Talking of the comfort of traveling in a gondola, Mr. Brown remarks that one ought to visit the squero where gondolas are built; then he launches into a description of the building of a gondola that shows he has followed his own advice. rind spent more than one morning at the boat yard. Later the author takes us to Torcello. and indulges us in a storm as he brings us back to the city. Of the Venetian people he remarks, apropos of the statement that few crowds are more cheerful or better ordered than a Venetian crowd:
As a rule the popolo is the lightest and most easygoing in the world. Indeed, this carelessness, is a characteristic of the race
in general. The writer once had the misfortune to be a witness before the Pretore. Ills fellow-witness was an old woman in a thick flann „•! petticoat. After weary waiting in the anteroom, where every one was smoking, we were summoned Into court and levtured on the nature of an oath. While :his was going on one of the policemen said to the old woman, " You're burning," but he never moved; and sure enough a thin thread of smoke was rising from the old lady’s petticoat. “ Santls-sima Maria Vorgine! ” she cried; but no one moved. The Judge put his finger tips together and confirmed the policeman’s remark, *’ Yes, you’re burning," and prosecutor, counsel, and public confirmed the Judge, “ Yes, she’s burning.’’ The old lady's fellow witness could not let her burn quite quietly, so he caught her petticoats in his hands, while the Judge, still with his finger tips together, nodded approval and said, Squeeze her, squeeze her well." Th-' smoldering flame was soon put out. The Judge smiled, the policeman smiled, the public smiled, and the case went on.
Mr. Brown is afraid that the Campanile will not be the last Venetian tower to fall, though he does not point out what he thinks will po next. Several chapters are devotfd to the Campanile and its fall and to the restoration of the column of St. Mark and the Theodore column. This last piece of wnrk seems to have been a very pretty piece of engineering, Tho famous lion of St. Mark. Mr. Brown
says, was made up of a head, body, and legs from an Assyrian palace, wings and pawa of murh later date, while the tall is only about a hundred years old. A chapter on Venetian door knockers is extremely Interesting; so la one on the Giustinianl, who, besides being Venetian nobles, are poors of Scotlar/1—surely a joke on Fortune’s part. " Piles and pile driving ” forms an interesting chapter, in which the author preserves, with translations. three of the songs which tie men of the pile drivers sing jis they hoist and drop the weights. The book, in fact, Is full of all sorts of Information about Venice—architectural, such as Ruskin liked; such as Hire would have given, (did give, for that matter,) and also Information that neither of them gave. The book nif'^ht be called " Venice Intime "—there is no English equivalent for the expression. If the publishers had provided an index, or even a table of contents. its value, already considerable, would have been enhanced greatly. As it is. they have don** all in their power to make the book a failure.
