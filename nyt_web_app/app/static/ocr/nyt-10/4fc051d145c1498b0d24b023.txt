THE Life of Granville George Loveson Gower, Second Earl Granville, K.
G.,	by Lord Edmund
Fitzmaurice, is about to be published, in two volumes, by Longmans, Green. & Co. The work is principally made up of extracts from Earl Granville's diaries and correspondence and from letters from his mother, from the late Queen Victoria, and the Prince Consort, Gladstone, Lord Spencer, William Edward Forster, the Du*te of Devonshire, Lord Aberdeen, John Bright, Lofd Russell, Lord Palmerston, and many others with whom Earl Granville was intimate and acquainted. Some of the epistles have been printed in earlier publications dealing with this period, notably in Morley’s life of Gladstone; but, as the biographer writes In his preface, " the close connection of Mr. Gladstone and LorJl Granville, both political and p?r-sonaC for so many years, may be deemed to have had a fitting counterpart in the appearance of their biographies at no great interval of time from each other." Among the other published material arc the substance of the account of Egyptian affairs and the history of the Home Rule question.
Among the earliest reminiscences in the book are those the late Earl wrote of the Duke of Wellington.
The activity of the Duke was wonderful. No idle young man was so exact in the discharge of all social duties. * • • The respect for his great qualities in public and in private was universal.
•	• • In the streets everybody touched their hats *to him as he passed. • * * There was a delay of an hour at Lord Wellesley’s funeral. He complained that It was very inconvenient* " One might have done something else.” His military punctuality was great. * • • The Duke of Wellington walked every morning on the Batteries, and went hunting with the harriers, almost to his death. *	* * He
was proud of his French, which was not very good, and peculiarly pronounced. Very civil to foreigners.
There are several illustrations, including portraits of Earl Granville, Earl Canning, and others.	^
