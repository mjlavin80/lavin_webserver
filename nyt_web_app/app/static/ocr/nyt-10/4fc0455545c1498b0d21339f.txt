\V. P. Ker's " Essays on Mediaevnl TJt-eraturc ” have been collected uruler this title into a volume bearing the imprint of the Macmillan Company. The essays, which have appeared in magazines and works on the various subjects, arc “ Tho Earlier History of English Prose,” " Historical Notes on the Similes of Dante,” “ Boccaccio,” *' Chaucer,’’ “ Gower,” “ Froissart,” and " Gaston Paris.” The last name*!, in memory of the learned French writer, appeared in The Quarterly Review a year ago last July, and Mr. Ker says of Paris:
Gaston Paris himself, in his writing, had that instinctive clearness which he finds constant in French literature—that same regard for his hearers which, in the earliest authors of his nation, as he points out, distinguished the even, plain discourse of the “ chanson? de ge."te ” from the more high-flown heroic poetry of other nations. At the same time, his literary judgment, moving so freely among generalizations, was always based on particulars—a different tiling from the peremptory opinions of less patient critics.
