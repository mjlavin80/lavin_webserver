the recent death of Lewis Fraser the artists and woed cnoHivera of America have lost one of their most intimate and sympathetic friends.
A little over a quarter of a century ago Mr. Fraser closed his ca-: reer in the practice of art to nssist in I the management of The Century M.L^a-zine, <then Scribner’s Monthly.) This was the period of the “ new school,” as It Is termed, in wood engraving and lliat wave of enthusiasm amonj the younger paLnters of America who brought buck j with them from their student days in France new perceptions of the meaning or art and an advance in technical knowl- i edge and methods which opened the door for free individual expression, hitherto closed to the prisoners of tradition.	1
To these forces in the younger men Mr. Fraser, as young in spirit as they, and with longer experience unwarped by prejudice for any school, helped to give direction, in co-operation with Mr. Drake, me chief of the art department. In the field of illustration, where his position mi^ht have been, in a less cultivated and sympathetic mind, tbc occasion of wounding the sensitive artistic temperament unnecessarily, liis honest judgment was not only not resented, but, it may safely be said, in^ variably received with the artist’s ready appreciation of true practical criticism. He had the rare faculty of puncturing a fault without leaving a sting. One day an artist, after Ions struggles with □ refractory drawing* presented it to Mr. Fraser, who received it without a word, good or bad. Well, what do you tliinli of It?" he ventured In the somewhat chilly atmosphere. I think you cun do better." came from the formidable-look-ing little man behind his spectacles. Not so much the words as the inflection acted like a spur. The artist wont away with his labored production, and, putting every fibre of his being into a new composition, soon earned the coveted few words of approbation.
As is naturai, during the progressive movement alluded to, many '* fads " were developed, at first glance likely to be mistaken for new and true principles just brought to light. It was here that the youthful spirit and sound judgment of Mr. Fraser divined rightly.^ Never losing his poise, he always gave sympathetic consideration to every phase of art, unerringly discriminating between the actually spurious, and that which, although perhaps only in embryo, contained a genuine impulse.
Outside the sphere of magazine and book illustration, his opinion and judgment were sought by painters and sculp- > tors alike, with whom he always main- ; tained a friendly fellowship. His practical judgment in the affairs and exhibitions of the Salmagundi Club, now so popular, did much to further that end.
Mr. Fraser will also be remembered as a useful and brilliant entertainer, as a lecturer on the history and character of Illustration, involving greg«t research into j early printing and engraving, especially i wood-engraving in this country. It is ; much to be regretted that he did not live to finish a comprehensive twork on this subject long in progress, although a fire which destroyed his notes and many books and prints of reference might have rendered the task Impossible.	'
As a man, William Fraser was manysided. Full of fun and an excellent story teller and mimic, he was a leading spirit In society. His home and family life was pure, sweet, and self-denying. Deep In his nature, under ihe stress and glamour of a professional career ran the pure stream of his religious life, the influence of which Christian spirit will always bo felt in many Tfaysidc and obscure places.
