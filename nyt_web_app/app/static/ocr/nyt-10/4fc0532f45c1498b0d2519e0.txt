WO English Officers have broken away from the tradi-'tion of the armj- that one must not be too keen—two have done so pre-eminently, that is—Major Gen. Sir Frederick Maurice and the late Cot George F. R. Hehderebn The latter especially is of interest to Americans, "because he studied the civil war closely and has written a gtx>d deal about it—lor an Englishman with very great impartiality. He died in 1003, and his scattered writings and essays have been collected by one of his pupils; and it is noteworthy that even in his latest lectures and articles he refers to our war as one most fruitful in lessons for his own country.
To the volume of his last essays Lord Roberts contributes a memoir, less perfunctory than most of that rather overrated soldier’s appreciations. From this it appears that Henderson was born in St. Heller, Jersey, in 18T>4i and, graduating from Oxford, became a Second Lieutenant In the army in 1878- Lord Roberts notes that he was Captain of the cricket eleven at Sandhurst; probably he studied there, too—Sandhurst being like Columbia College: “ There’s no reason why a man should study, but there's nothing to prevent him, if he’s inclined that way.” In ISS^ Henderson was in Egypt, fighting Arabs and studying Arabic. Then he went to Bermuda, where the idea of writing a history of the war of secess^n efiiared his mind, and in 1&sn he visited the Virginia battlefields, where he studied the fighting on the spot. In the same year he entered the Ordnance Department to obtain better pay and more leisure. While stationed at Port George, in Inverness-shire, he wrote his first book, “ The Campaign of Fredericksburg,” especially for the instruction of the officers of the local volunteers. Then he studied German, and produced a book on Spicheren, one of the battles of the Franco-German war of 1S70. In 1880 he.went to Sandhurst as instructor in tactics, and in 1{$»2 was transferred to the Staff College. At the former place he began his study of Stonewall Jackson, not published until 1SS8—at once his own and his subject s chitf monument. Lord Roberts writes of this:
For some time before war was declared I had given a considerable amount of thought to the probability of hostilities in South Atrica and the measures which should oe adopted to meet such an outbreak. While still thinking over this problem 1 read " Stonewall Jackson," and was much struck with the extraordina.-y effect which strategy, whether Lee’s or Jackson's—had upon the campaign in Virginia, and also with the result of Jackson’s swift and unexpected moven^ents, as described by Henderson.
Bearing all this in mind, when appointed to the ?hief command in South Africa I determined thai the w'isest thing to do was to march on the capitals of the Orange Free State and the Transvaal, and so to break up their combination.
*.*
THE naivete of this deserves passing notice. Roberts actually thought of war before it came—a remarkable thing for an English officer to do, as history shows; and after he had got his route he formed a plan! He says it was based on Jackson's or Lee’s strategy— possibly lie thinks it was, but the strategy of Jackson, with its " swift and unexpected movements,'* can hardly be compared to the deliberate progress of Field Marshal l^ord Roberts, who reached Cape Town on Jan. S, 1000; Bloemfontein March 13, and Pretoria on June 0. We fear that his Lordship, in spite of being an Irishman, takes himself too seriously.
Henderson went to South Africa with Lord Roberts as Director of Intelligence, but his health broke down, and he had to return. In 1001 he went back to South Africa to study the country, but again his health failed, and he died in Egypt, where he had gone on account of the climate, In the Spring of 100;i. His chief writings have been mentioned; but those in the volume before us are minor only in the matter of quantity, not at all in that of quality. The book of course will go on the shelves of our War College and General Staff libraries, and some of our officers will read it—probably those who need it least. But it should be read by every President, and by all our rapid succession of Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries of War, for It contains comments on the methods followed in 1861-0 and in 180S, that might and certainly should give pause to the appointing powers if ever war break out again. Jefferson Davis, says Col. Henderson, 41 regardless of seniority, [in .he old army,] chose the man he thought best suited for the billet. All those regular officers who joined tho Confederacy were placed in high command. In the North, the regular officers were at first somewhat overlooked In favor of the volunteers, and nearly GOO Captains and subalterns were retained with
their own regiments.. Nor .did Mr.; Davis,.. taught by military. experience, desert a commander because he had been unfortunate. The chief army .of the North was „ cv7»nmand‘3d by no less than six different officers, each one of whom, except the last, was degraded for ill-success.” Then untrained civilians (president and Secretaries) overruled Generals as they pleased, ■ and intruded other ; untrained civilians ! into military positions, with resultant defeat, until at last Grant was tnade Commander in Chief, with a free hand. Wo know all this; but perhaps it might affect our future Presidents and Secretaries if they knew that other people knew it too—
1 and that those others could set down our big " butchers* bills ” to the necessities of ^ our politics.
THE last three chapters of'the book are entitled ** The Training of Infantry for Attack,” ** Foreign Criticism," and ** The British Army." These all deal with recent events. In the first, Henderson concludes from a study of recent wars that “ when two forces meet whose armament ls^equal the slaughter is not likely to be abnormal. Shrapnel* Maxims, and the small bore do not seem to increase the butcher’s bill to the extent that some would have us believe." The Russo-Japanese war bears out this deduction. CoL Henderson’s death, when only 48, was a loss to our own army, as well as to that of his own country.
