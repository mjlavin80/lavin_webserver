Their Origin and Development and Their Relation to the State.*
HE SB two substantial volumes are the result of the author’s intention to write a brief ihtroductlon to a work on the Corporation Question.” - It must be re.	garded as a loss to political
science that so keen a student did not live to complete more than the Introduction to his subject. While the larger portion of these volumes is devoted to the historical growth of corporations—the ecclesiastical corporations, guilds, universities, Colonial companies, &.c.—Dr. Davis gives us chapters on the ** Nature of Corporations,” the " Legal Conception of Corporations," and a brief chapter showing the relation between the older and the modern corporations.
He believes that *' the technical legal conception of them [corporations] Is so clearly unscientific that it must sooner or 2ater be greatly modified or entirely dispensed with.” He believes that the importance of corporations has been overlooked by historians, whose attention has been fixed mainly on the framework of the State and National activity. Dr. Davis's study of the nature of corporations leads up to this definition of them:
A corporation Is a body of persons upon whom the State has conferred such voluntarily accepted but compulsorily maintained relations to one another and to all others that as an autonomous, selfsufficient, and self-renewing body they may determine and enforce their common will, and in the pursuit of their private interest may exercise more efficiently social functions both specially conducive to public welfare and most appropriately exercised by associated persons.
Dt. Davis has evidently no sympathy With the legal principles of *• artificial personality,*’ or “ limited liability,” which latter, he says, was not a feature of early
•CORPORATIONS. A Study of the Orifrtn and Development of Great Business Cotnbl-naUona and of Their Relation to the Authority of the State. By John P. Davis, Ph. D. Two volumes. Vol. I., Pp. iv.-318: Vol. II., Pp. 111.-205. New York and London; G. P. Putnam’s Sons. The Knickerbocker Press. 1905.
corporate life In ' England.. ^ He believes that, its “undue prevalence '* . In this country has been because when risks are involved men will not Invest unless they know the limit of their liability. " Limited liability ” now, he says, is often regarded by promoters and investors as a positive detriment. The principle that
V	a charter is a contract '* he considers vicious. ** The conception of a bargain between a state and a group of its citizens is illogical.’* In short, he believes that the system of law lingers behind society in Its progress and delays to translate newly formed social relations into enforceable rights and obligations until (in many cases) long after 'they have been fully formed.*’ He criticises the modern law of corporations from three points of view: 1, It conserves obsolete social relations. 2. It falls to recognize new social relations. 3. It employs a vicious system to provide apparent harmony between an old system of law and new elements o£ society.
Coming down to modern corporations, he comments on the remarkable change in public opinion regarding the functions of the State. The masses, conscious of the powers enjoyed by corporations, although having formerly opposed increased activity of the State, lest it might encroach upon their own, are now clamoring for such activity to protect themselves against the corporations. The Governmental features of corporations will be gradually absorbed by the State, though in the so-called " economic *’ corporations this absorption has not as yet gone far.
Within corporations the process of ** corporate shrinkage " Is marked* The exclusion of the small stockholder from participation In corporate activity is an instance of thia. Under the “ new feudalism ** the baronage will consist of the small bodies to which corporations have shrunk, exercising as *' private rights ” the public powers of corporations that have so shrunk.
The all-pervasiveness of corporations is a fact which the student of society has to take into account. The modern citizen discovers, says Dr. Davis, that citizenship in his country has been largely metamorphosed into membership in corporations and patriotism into fidelity to them.
