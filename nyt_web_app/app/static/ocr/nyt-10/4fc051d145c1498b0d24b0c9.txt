The historical method ia followed by Prof. A. S. Wilkins in writing of '* Roman Education *’ in the little book published by the Macmillan Company in this country. and the subject is studied in Its sue- i cessive stages.
The introductory chapter considers the national Roman ideals, the results of Greek influence, and the plan of the book.
It is followed by chapters on education in the early Republic, under the influence ! of Greece, the elementary schools and j studies, rhetoric and philosophy, and tho endowment of education. Prof. Wilkins 1 outlines the book as follows:
First will come tho purely national stage. * * • For more than five centuries we have nothing like contemporary evidence; traditions may have been, and in some cases we know they were, colored by the usage of later times, and therefore may often be misleading. * * * We must first take pains to put out of our minds all that we can ascertain to have been of later growth or importation, and * * * whatever we can ascribe to Greek teachers or methods. * *	•	Next
we shall have to trace the effect in this direction of the great flood of Greek influence, -which poured into Rome from the middle of the third century B. C. onward, and this in the distinct departments of literary * * • education, and in the higher training of rhetoric and philosophy. • • • Then • * • the days of the later republic and early empire * • • may be studied.
