rHZS volume is the third In a series which succeeds In a rather unusual degree in accomplishing the impossible. It is a “ popularization,” in other words, which manages to retain a vital spark or two. Mr. Jenks has already " done" Chaucer and Shakespeare and their times in words of one syllable, (historiographically speaking.) Now he applies the same process to Milton. He i doesn’t assume that you know anything— he explains in general terms what cava! llers were, what Puritans were, what j were the conditions and troubles of Eng-i land under Elizabeth and James and ; Charles, and how Milton grew out of . those conditions. He tells of Milton's parentage, his schooling at St. Paul’s and i Cambridge, his lyrical youth at Horton, his travels In France and Italy, his middie age of secretarial duties ajid political pamphleteering, and his epic old age in the shadow ol blindness.
Mr. Jenks gets In a very considerable number of facts and rebukes Dr. Samuel Johnson for jeering at the burst of eager patriotism on the poet's part, called forth by the war between Parliament and Charles I.—tho burst of patriotism which ended in his teaching a boys* school. It Is In short Mr. Jenks’s policy to explain away the human weaknesses of the author of ** Lycidas ” and ** The Areopagitica ’* and " Paradise I^ost/’ and make his appeal to readers still presumably young and im-\ pressionaBle wUli tho nobler side of the | hero. That process does not leave Milton [ an Interesting figure as a man, but by . and large the book Is both instructive
