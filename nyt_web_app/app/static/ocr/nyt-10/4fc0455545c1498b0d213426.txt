Mr. De Selincourt’s ILdition of the Works of the Lyrist Who “ Is With Shakespeare.”
HE first question any lover of English poetry will be tempted or moved to ask, upon the appearance of this goodly volume, is why any new Keats at all. With no poet except Shakespeare has contemporary neglect been more fully attempted to be repaired by posthumous research. After Lord Houghton and Buxton Furman, what remains to be found out or said about the poet in the way of new facts? And as for criticism, who has been more profusely' criticiscd, from the “ mere maudlin sensibility ” of Carlyle to the " He is with Shakespeare ” of Matthew Arnold? Why, then, another Keats?
%*
THIS question, which jumps to the lips at the
sight of the outside of the volume, it is for the
inside of the volume to answer, with the initial '
presumption against it. Mr. De Selincourt shows
himself quite aware of the presumption, although,
and very properly, he does not undertake to rebut it
by any express apology or pretend to the discovery
of “ new evidence." He shows himself aware that
his work must stand or fall by what it is and not by
what he says about it. He treats his predecessors,
Woodhouse, Buxton Forman, Sidney Colvin, and the
rest with the utmost courtesy, and there is nothing of
the controversial in his attitude. He does, indeed,
alter the received order and arrangement of the
poems from the strictly chronological to the moro
critical, relegating to the appendix, without regard
to their dating, such verses of Keats as do not seem
to him to be poetry. This was a needful amendment. Of the received order Mr. Swinburne has remarked, with that cautious moderation of language which so distinguishes him when he is writing critical prose* that “ the ‘ Ode to a Nightingale,* one of the final masterpieces of human work in all times and for all ages. Is immediately preceded, in all the ! editions now [1882] current, by some of the most vulgar and fulsome doggerel ever whimpered by a vapid and effeminate rhymester in the sickly stage of whelphood.” Without attempting to verify this diagnosis, one may observe that the ode in question is “ immediately preceded," in the present edition, by “ The Eve of St. Agnes," which Don Furibondo cannot possibly be supposed to have had in mind.
BUT the mere rearrangement of the poems, in accordance with a nice critical sense, would not justify a new edition, an edition which runs to " Pp. IxviiL, 613,'* in large octavo, and for which Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co., the American publishers, charge you <$2.25. The arrangement and the selection have been perfectly <Ione before, by Mr. Palgrave, in his “ Golden Treasury," and the selection is so good, within the limits of Mr. Palgrave’s purpose of " Songs and Lyrics," that one is tempted sometimes, in his haste, to say that it comprises all of Keats that is really worth having. Certainly it comprises what is most indispensable and best worth living with. The odes and the sonnets and the shorter narrative poems and the ballads—the lyrics, In a word—are what are " most endeared ” in Keats, are the nearly perfect expression of his genius, bo far as we know, whatever we may surmise. The place of these things being quite secure, it is about them, his successes, and not about his failures, that curiosity is most excited. How did they come about? How comes it that next to *' masterpieces," according to Mr. Swinburne's classification, there are pieces which are so far from being masterpieces that they owe their entire poetical interest to the pieces to which they are adjoined. How happen these hiatuses, these lapses?
•»*
THESE questions arise more or less about every poet whose work shows inequality, in other words about every poet. Perhaps Milton is the English poet about whom they least urgently arise, who gives least occasion for them by being most c6n-sistently equal to himself. Perhaps Keats is the English poet about whom they most urgently arise. The editor’s contribution to his edition, apart from his rearrangement, consists in the eighty-odd pages of introduction, and in the two
hundred-odd pages of notes. In the former is a sketch, in bare outline, of Keats’s life; in the latter i a most minute examination of the poems, line by line, almost word by word, made to trace every expression to its source, if it had any outside the poet’s mind. It is a minute inquiry which makes the experienced reader apprehend a “ monograph,” after the German manner, extensively followed in American institutions of learning, to wit, a certain instrument in writing, produced “ in partial fulfillment of the requirements ” for some kind of academic degree, and thereafter illegible to all mankind, excepting the , examiners and the proofreaders.
BUT one rejoices lo ascertain that this is not the case. Mr. De Selincourt is not a German nor, as his patronymic shows, the son of a German, j “ On the contrary,” his patronymic indicates that he is the son of a Frenchman, and his entire ^vork, dated from Oxford, that he is an English scholar. In both these capacities he takes the anti-Teutonic and j old-fashioned view that things which are written ! are written in order that they may be read, and that ! the reader should not be repelled, but contrariwise attracted. He begins In his introduction by pointing out the conflict between Keats’s “ heredity ” and Keats’s “ environment.’* He goes on not only to say i but to show that Keats was, to all intents and purposes, " educated by the English poets," having only schoolboy Latin and no Greek; that the diction he was in the w'ay of hearing at home was not only not poetical diction but was cockney commonness, which often rubbed off on his verse to the shame of the better vocabulary he had picked up from his poets, but that his " verbal magic ” was derived from his reading of English poets, beginning with Spenser. No doubt it was due, next after his own almost unfailing taste in words and phrases, to his association with men better brought up than himself, notably with Leigh Hunt and Shelley.
«*#*
HOWEVER that may be. Mr. De Selincourt’s tracing of Keats, line by line to his sources, is an undertaking full of interest to the student of English poetry. It is a quest in which it is easy to make a fool of one’s self, if one happens to be a fool, to trace fantastic resemblances and impossible analogies. But so far as we have observed Mr. De Selincourt has avoided these pitfalls. He has not often “ considered too curiously.’* His industry is commonly attended with judgment. And so his effort, though the success of it is not exactly of a kind to fill Madison Square Garden, or even Carnegie Hall, with shouting admirers, has yet been a real success. It is complete if he has succeeded in producing the ** definitive ” edition of Keats. And it seems that it has really done that.	M. S.
