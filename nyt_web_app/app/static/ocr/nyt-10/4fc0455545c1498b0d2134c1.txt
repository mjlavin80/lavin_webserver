PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT has dedicated his new book, “ Outdoor. Pastimes o£ an American Hunter,” which-Charles Scribner’s Sons arc bringing out this week, with numerous illus-i trations from photographs by members of Mr. Roosevelt's parties at the differ! ent hunts, to John Burroughs. He ex: presses his " hearty appreciation ” of ! Burroughs's “ warfare against the sham I nature writers ”—'* the yellow journalists of the woods,” as Mr. Burroughs calls them. The President continues:
Prom the days of Aesop to the days of Reinecke Fuchs, and from, the days ot* j Reinecke Fuchs to the present time, there has been a distinct and attractive place In literature for those who write avowed fiction In which the heroes are animals with human or semi-human attributes. This fiction serves a useful purpose in , many ways, even in the way of encouraging people to take the right view of outdoor life and outdoor creatures; but it is unpardonable for any observer of nature to write fiction and then publish It as truth, and he who exposes and wars against such action Is entitled to respect and support. You In your own person have illustrated what. can be done by the lover of nature who has trained himself to keen observation, who describes accurately what is thus observed, and who, finally, possesses the additional gift of writing with charm and interest.
As will be seen, the dedication is in the form of a letter, which the writer addresses to M Dear Oom John." Five of the chapters In the volume are new, while the other half dozen originally appeared in Caspar Whitney’s " Deer Family ” and other publications. They describe a couger hunt, a Colorado bear hunt, wolf coursing, hunting in the cattle country, a shot at mountain she^p, the white-tail deer, the mule deer or " Rocky Mountain blacktail,” the wapiti or round-homed elk. Yellowstone Park, books on big game, and " At Home.”
In the last chapter the author writes about the home pets, which, at one time, included kangaroo rats, flying squirrels, guinea pigs, a bear, and two or three wild animals. The President writes of horses and horsemanship.	‘
The best among vigorous out-of-door sports should be more than pastimes. Play Is good for play‘s sake, within moderate limits, especially if It is athletic play, and, again within moderate limits, it Is good because a healthy body helps toward healthiness of mind.
