Arthur Tomson shows In his study of Jean Kramjols Millet in the volume " Jean Francois MiJlet and the Barbizon School ’* (12mo. New and cheaper edition. Illustrated. Pp. 231. Boards. Green cloth. New York: The Macmillan Company. $2.25,) that the painter’s sorrows have been, for thn most part, exaggerated by certain writers:
"WhHe In conversation with a well-known collector and possessor of many beautiful pictures by Millet,'I mentioned that the creator of a certain drawing, at which we were looking1, could never have been as unhappy a man as Millet was generally represented to be. The answer that 1 received was, “ No, he was not always unhappy. Many a time have I talked at length with Mme. Millet about ln-r husband .and she assured me that at Barbizon Millet was far from unhappy; there he had everything that he wanted.”
And Mr. Tomson goes on to describe the master’s life at Barbizon and his relations to tho other painters there. The other chapters in the book deal with the life and work of Jules Dupr6, Narcisse-Vlrgilia Diaz, and Theodore Rousseau, and in a chapter-on " The Influence of the Romantic School ” arc briefly considered Paul Huet, Charles Jacque, Jules Breton, Monticeili, Basticn-Lepage, Adolphc Ilervler, Harpignles, and two or three others.
The illustrations number fifty-three, and include examples of some of the best-known pictures of the artists studied— Millet’s 11 Goose Maiden," Rousseau’s study of a tree, Dupr6's ** The Pool ** and landscapes, Diaz’s ** Girl Playing with a Dog,” and others.
This " new and cheaper ” edition of a measurably well-known and highly prized work now places a delightful and authoritative series of connoisseur studies— critical, biographical, intimate—within reach of the humblest admirer and disciple of that great French open-air school which combined a free and healthy romancing with nature’s realities, and gave the Initial impulse to Impressionism.-
