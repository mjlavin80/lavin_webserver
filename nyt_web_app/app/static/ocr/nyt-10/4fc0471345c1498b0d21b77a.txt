Dr. Henry Churchill King of Oborlin College, author of " Theology and tho Social Consciousness,” &c., has undertaken, in his new book, “ Rational Living1: Some Practical Inferences from Modern Psychology," which is out this week from the Macmillan Company, to make generally available the most valuable suggestions for living that can be drawn from the results of the best workers in psychology. While the book does not aim to be a technical treatise upon psychology nor profess to embody the results of original Investigation, *' it does distinctly aim,” Dr. King points out, “ to give in the field of practical living something of that sense of unity and sure ness that the investigator in natural science has, and' that can come only from a knowledge of the Jaws invol\*od.
The book has been divided into four parts—" The Complexity of Life:	The
Multiplicity and Intricacy of Relations,"
" The Unity of Man," " The Central Importance of Will and Action," and " The Concreteness of the Real—The Interrelatedness of All." Under each division an attempt has b^en made to give briefly but sufficiently the psychological basis,
and then to show the most important derived practical suggestions.
