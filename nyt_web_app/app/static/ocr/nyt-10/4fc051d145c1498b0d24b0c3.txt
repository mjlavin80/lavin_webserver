The essays on this theme, which were delivered by Prof. George Edward Wood** oerry at the Lowell Institute in Boston, have been gathered into a volume under the title. " The Torch,” and will be published in a few days by McClure, Phillips
&	Co. The author brings out, in his accounts of the great writers of the world and comparisons of them, the idea that, as each race reaches the climax of its power and dies, it passes on its inheritance of literature to some other race that has risen to be the torch-bearer. Prof. Wcc.dberry writes in his opening chapter:	*
It belongs to a highly developed race 1 to become, in a true sense, aristocratic— j n treasury of its best in practical and spiritual types, and then to disappear in 1 tne Burroundlng tides of men. So Athens dissolved like a pearl in the cup of the Mediterranean, and Rome in the cup of Europe, and Judea in the cup of the Universal Communion. Though death is the law of all life, man touches this earthen fact with the wand of the spirit and transforms it Into the law of sacrifice. Man has won no victory over hts environment so sublime os this, finding in his , moral sentence the true choice of the soul j I and in the road out of Paradise the open I highway of eternal life. Races die, but ! the ideal of sacrifice as the highest race destiny has seldom occurred to men,
1 though it has been suggested both by devout Jews and by devout Irishmen as the | | divinely appointed organic law of the , Hebrew and the Celt.	j
