A FOX HPIC*
RED FOX. Thn Story of Ilis Adventurous Career in the Rin&waok Wilda ami of Hia Irinal Triumph Over the Enemies of II! 3 Kind. Told by Charles U. D. Roberts, author of •• The Kindred of the Wild," &c. With many illustrations by rhcrles l.ivlng-.3 ton Bull. J2mo. Boston; L.. C. Pago <fc Co.
OF the very Interesting animal who Is the hero of these adventures, Mr. Roberts says that “ the Incidents In his career are not only consistent with the known characteristics and capacities of tho fox family, but there is authentic record of them all in the accounts of careful observers. Every one of these experiences has befallen some red fox in the past, and may befall other red foxes In the future/’ No matter how extraordinary the things you read afterward, therefore, you may not doubt their entire fcxtncss. Any disposition to skepticism merely argues your own ignorance of the animal whom Mr. Roberts and the ancients agree in making the astutest of all the beasts. To be sure, Mr. Roberta confesses that he has combined in hia particular red fox the many invention^ of a vast number of real foxes. He Is, in short, the epic fox. As to the emotions and mental processes which he ascribes to his hero, Mr. Roberts warns you not to consider these processes as human processes transferred without authority. Man, he reminds you, Is an animal, and many of his processes—animal processes —are as fairly the heritage and right of foxes as—of professors of polite letters.
In the course of his life, from early puppyhood to his prime—all carefully traced here—red fox is represented as doing majiy things which on the face of them no bookworm would believe a fox ever did. He outwits dogs, of course, by all sorts of ingenious devices^that is a fox's specialty; he hunts skillfully in wood and field and barnyard—that is his profession. But he makes, also, a study of men. He engages in a contest of wits with Jabez Smith, a fellow with primitive hunting Instincts, and observes with curiosity the ways of a creature of the new school of gunless hunters called Boy— obviously Intended for Mr. Roberts himself. Boy goes about the woods to see things—not to shoot them—and red fox takes note of him as an oddity, and not dangerous like Jabez and other tall, upstanding creatures.
Tin; recital is rather fascinating—one must needs admire and believe (more or ! less) in red fox. Especially since Mr. Bull has drawn so many excellent pictures of him and his friends and enemies in the woods. Altogether the book with Mr, j Rotforts's text and Mr. Bull s pictures is a rare thing among animal biographies.
1 The interest, at least, is quite human.
