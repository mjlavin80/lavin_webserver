HIS history of the agitation in Russia against the despotism of the autocracy and the bureaucracy was originally written to enlighten public opinion in a part of the Czar’s dominions, Finland, where, in the main, only loyalty to his dynasty had been expressed, until he ruthlessly and foolishly broke his promise to rule the grand duchy according to Its Constitution* The Finnish Opposition, called into being by the Czar’s treachery, began to advocate an alliance with the revolutionary elements in Russia, which up till that time had been regarded by the naturally conservative Finns with horror; and began a campaign of education to show the people what is the causc for which the Russian revolutionists contend. This work was a part’ of this educational literature. In the form in which it now appears, however, Finland is no more referred to than any other part of : the Russian Empire. The author s pur- , pose Is to sketch for English-speaking I readers the history of the long struggle against despotism which he believes has at last brought victory* within sight.
When Peter the Great began those reforms from above which were to transform Russia from an Oriental into a European and civilized State, he unwittingly set in motion a train of events which could logically result only in the ultimate destruction of despotism. Neither be nor his successors saw that Russia could not be reformed on its economic and industrial side without being at the same time reformed on its political and governmental side; and the reader of this book will probacy be inclined to believe that the failure to grasp this simple proposition is the most disastrous that the much-blundering Romanoffs have ever made. Mr. Zilliacus describes briefly the beginnings of Russian liberalism, which was imported into Russia when the armies that had fought Napoleon returned from their long sojourn in Western Europe. Nicholas I. suppressed all manifestations of discontent with relentless cruelty, but the revolutionary spirit he could not gag. “Despotism,** ^ays Mr. Zilliacus, “begat opposition, and the violence used against opponents in speech only brought to maturity the feeling that a system of government which permitted such arbitrary action was essentially bad.*' In other words, Nicholas began the policy of sitting upon the safety valve which his successors have in the main consistently pursued.
The revolutionary movement was stemmed by the reforms of the early reign of Alexander IL But when the Czar surrendered "himself to reaction, the revolutionists recognized that peaceful reforms were at ,of the question. Hence spr&ng the " Terror ” of 187S. The stronger were the measures of repression the bolder grew the terrorists, who finally, through ’aeir Executive Committee, passed sentence of death on Alexander. The sentence was carried out, for the terrorists were unaware that the Czar had finally acceded to the moderate reforms proposed by Loris Melikoff.
Alexander III. began his reign by writing on the draft of Melfkoff’s reform programme the words “ Particularly well done." It soon became clear, however, that he would consent to no comprehensive reforms. The reactionary party, headed by Pobiedonostseff, triumphed, and the Czar announced that he would consent to no limitation of the autocracy. The Procurator of the Holy Synod becomes the dominant factor in the Government. The forces of revolution and the forces of reaction under Alexander III. are carefully outlined for us.
Nicholas II., when he came to the throne, had a chance to win for himself the affcction of his subjects by putting to an end the period of desperate reaction which marked the reign of Alexander III. The hopes of the liberals were* again dashed. “ Let it be understood,” said the young Czar in a speech from the throne. ** that 1 devote my whole power to the best service of the people, but that the principle of the autocracy will be maintained by me as firmly and unswervingly as it was by my ever-revered father.” Evidently this could mean nothing but a continuance of the Pobiedonostseff regime, “ tlie Pobiedonostseff Government with the Czar Nicholas II. Its chief in name,” as Mr. Zilliacus calls it. Reaction reached its high-water mark when Von Plehve held the position of Minister , of the Interior. The Czar backed his Minister up even to the extent of having •' political criminals ” tried before mill- ; tary tribunals rather than before the ordl- i nary courts. It is impossible to describe j here or even to enumerate the various i classes of atrocities perpetrated by the execratcd Minister, His actions, more-

The last_ great historical events touched upon by Mr. Zilliacus are the meeting of the Zemstvo Congress, which Von Plehve's successor, the liberal Svlatopolk-Mirski had allowed to convene, and the demonstration of the workingmen, led by Father Gapon, on the E2d of January, 1905. To the demands of the congress, the importance of which Nicholas probably wholly failed to grasp, he * turned a deaf ear, again showing how completely servile he was to the reactionaries. His behavior toward the workers’ demonstration and petition showed that he could no longer pose as the loving father of his subjects.
“ He left his palace in haste, almost like a thiei^iriN the middle of the night," leaving hfs Uncle Vladimir to deal with the . people. Vladimir dealt with them so effectually that nearly 3,000 men, women, and children lay dead or dying In the streets of St. Petersburg because they had come unarmed to hand a petition to the Czar.
Mr. Zilliacus does not pretend to be unbiased. He frankly sympathizes with the revolutionists. But his general statements are abundantly supported by spe-*^* cific facts. He has done what he set out to do, what Indeed it was not hard to do—he has written a terrible Indictment against the bureaucratic despotism called the Russian Government. He believes that the time has gone by when Nicholas can decide whether he will grant a constitution. The people will dcclde, and they will also decide whether he will continue to reign as constitutional monarch or not. " All those who have attentively followed the development of events in Russia can no longer remain in doubt that as the autocratic Czar he has been condemned to be Nicholas the Last.”
