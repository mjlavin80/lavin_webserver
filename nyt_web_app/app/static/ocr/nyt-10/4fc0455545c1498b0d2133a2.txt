THE young Indiana Senator writes of young from the point of view of a young man who has found success coming his way. These papers are collected from the periodical in which they first appeared, the series growing from day to day largely out of tho suggestions of the reao*-rs. He is one of ihe successful ones, and so it is natural that, like many others, he should, he called upon to explain how he himself gained his success, and to lay down principles to gukle others In doing the same. Success comes in so many different ways, and in response to so many different qualities, and so many different environments, that those who lay down rules seldom lay down the same ones; for which reason, if for no other, the validity of them all is open to some question. Good advice, however, is always in order, and Mr. Beveridge has much that is excellent, based on his own experience and observation.	\
Learn your limitations, and start out In the direction for which you are fitted, is his fiist suggestion. Also keep working, and working hard, and don't worry- Kcad, and mingle with people, and cultivate nature. Take vacations. Courage, nerve, faith in one s self are necessary. And then he sums it all up at the end of his first paper in the words, ** Be a man." The home and the father and mother in f it are the subject of his next paper. On the question whether to go to college or not he takes a position that might be defined as a ” straddle,’1 but he answers in the affirmative, with advice to “ cut out tobacco,” and to those who cannot go he has little difficulty in showing that they have just as good a chance as those who can. Get married young; and If you are not strong enough to protect a wife and children you are not worth while. Mr. Beveridge advises tho you-ng lawyer, tinsels the public speaker, and gives his Views as to the young man thinking of entering the ministry. There is much to be done yet in the world, just as goad a chance as ever, he thinks, and he quotes sadly the college students who feel that progress is finished, and that for them there is nothing to do but to eat, sleep, „ laugh, grieve, and go to their graves.
He goes over some of the fundamentals i again, and conies to the conclusion that only the very highest types of effectiveness succeed. " Brain of ice, hand of steel, heart of fire, clear vision, and cold, steady grasp of the lever,
, and masterful ana yet a passionate relentlessnoss "—thoi c are necessary. This is, perhaps, rather $ counsel of perfection to offer to the very numerous people who are not naturally endowed with that particular kind of brain, hand, heart, and vision. It seems rather a description of I a certain class who have succeeded than an available direction for securing suc-: cess. But that is the trouble with many of the guides to success. Mr. Beveridge has given a great deal of good advice that Is much more tangible th:in this, however; much that will stimulate and help to strengthen.
