MOHAMMED has arrived late at his place in the Heroes of the Nations Series, which he would seem pre-eminently to deserve. His life contained the seeds of results most Important for the world, and the history of his activity touches the world's history at many points. Mr. Margoll-outh has given an elaborate account of it, and of the circumstances and surroundings from which the power of Islam was derived. There is, of course, much material: Mohammed has been thoroughly studied from all points of view and with all sorts of prepossessions, and the author cites from innumerable authorities, which he has well at his command.
He gives first a survey of the conditions of -Arabia and Arab life at the time when Mohammed first appeared. In speaking of the forty years of Mohammed’s career that preceded his “ mission," he finds very little remaining if what is fabulous is omitted. His early training was that of a caravan boy, who learned more about horses, scouting, trading, foreign lands and people than book knowledge, and who possessed an invaluable knowledge of m&fi and the gift of judging them. The occasion that called him to his great work cannot be indicated. The time was ripe for the tribal Arabian idolaters to be brought to the worship of a monotheistic God, to be united under one leadership. Mohammed’s greatness consisted in his recognition of the need and his ability to render the service.
Only a shadowy outline of the beginnings of Mohammed’s divine calling can ever be known; and with it go numerous rationalistic explanations of his methods of obtaining 14 revelationsM and impressing them upon his follow^ ers. His glimpses of the Jewish and Christian religions and his appropriations from them are interesting factors in his progress. It is curious to note how carelessly the Koran was treated in the course of its gradual growth as a document. The Prophet himself had a poor memory about certain portions of it, and persons were ranged at times in order of merit according to the amount of the Koran they had collected, The Prophet, too, was prone to make “ revelations ” according to the needs of the moment, producing oracles as a deus ex machina.
The biography of the Prophet consists largely in following the military, political, and religious campaigns with which he spread the religion of Islam, and which Mr. Margoliouth traces in detail. In fact, ne is somewhat more
concerned with details than with larger considerations. As to the remarkable achievements of Mohammed’s life there can be no doubt. In twenty-three years he had founded an empire that threatened to engulf the world. His genius, according to this biographer, was equal to the emergencies, but not too great for them.
