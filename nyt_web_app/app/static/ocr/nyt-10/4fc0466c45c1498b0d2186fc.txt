A new story of older New York, which centrcs about the old Park Theatre, is " Caroline of Cortlandt Street.” by Wejf mer Jay Mills. The Park Theatre, over opposite City Hall Park, has left its mark upon street nomenclature in a narrow passageway still existing between Beek-man and Ann Streets—back of Park Row— called Theatre Alley to this day.

This lady, Rose by her rijjbt name, personates one Caroline Whitebush. a cousin, and a, member, of tiie British aristocracy, and so imposes herself upon her proud Cortlandt Street kinsfolk, who have cut off her father’s disgraced brand from the family tree. And the false Caroline has fun and adventure. Mr. Mills Is a younjj man who is, it seems, deeply interested in " historic ** Jersey and Manhattan. The Harpers will publish the book Oct. 12.
