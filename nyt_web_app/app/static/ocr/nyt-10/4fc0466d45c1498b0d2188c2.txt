THK salon, always a p’jrely Frcnch growth, came lo its tutiest efitorey-cence hi Paris during the third quarter of the eighteenth century. There were, at that time, as said L.ady Iiervey, ** sureties to suit one in every iiumor, cscept a melancholy one.** Mme. du Dcffanil held 1 her court at the Convent St. Joseph. * * * MIU*. de Lespinutse was the fascinating hostess of the brilliant reunionism in the Ruo do Belle Chasse; but among these and many others of less distinction Mme. Goeffrin's salon had a unique and preeminent position.
This extract from the preface gives a hint of the character of Mme. Gceffrin s salon, which Janet Aldia describes in her volume, *' Madame Goeffrin: Her Silon and Her Times, (1750-1777,)" which G. P. Putnam's Sons will publish early nest month. Among the causes that contributed to the prominence and popularity of this salon, the author continues, were ** the pronounced and remarkable character of the hostess, her talent for steadfast friendship, the high moral tone which she maintained at her gatherings In that lax age.” She goes on:	.

Paris was -seething with new thoughts and ideas; the desire of reform was working as secretly and surely as leaven among the accumulated ■ abuses of that corrupt and vicious period, ' and Mme. Goeffrin’s house, though not | so recognized or labeled in her own day, i was, nevertheless, the stronghold of the j reform partv. It was one of those singular little ironies of life that Mme Goef-frin, *	*	* who once said to Diderot: ;
" What better can I do with my money i than buy peace with It? " should be the j presiding spirit or the salon which was, so to speak, the nursery of the Revolution.
Mme. Goef frin was a " homely bour-geoise without rank and connections/* amd, although, for this reason, she could not be received at Court, herself received Princes and Kings, Dukes and Marfichals In her own house in the Rue St. Honor£; was a patron of artists, although without a knowledge of art, and, without even having received an elementary education, was the *‘ honored friend and adviser’’ of such writers as d’Alembert. Diderot, Grimm, Marmontel, Thomas, and others.
