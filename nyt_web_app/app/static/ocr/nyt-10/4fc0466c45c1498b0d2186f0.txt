O	persistently have the subterranean mysteries of Wel-beck Abbey been kept before the British public since the death of	ttie	late Duke of
Portland	that	the number of
English novels with underground passages is hardly surprising1, but in Mr. Archibald Marshall's “ The House of Merrilees ” there is something more and better. There is a second bit of melodrama in the shape of a case of mysterious parentage, but the thing which makes friends	for	its author	are	its pretty pictures of	family life, and of	manly, honest,
clean living youngsters. The book will be reprinted in the United States by Messrs. Herbert B. Turner & Co.
The new edition of Miss Josephine Preston Peabody's Marlowe ” is one evidence of the poet’s return to favor; another, even more significant, is a quotation In Mrs. Prances Squire's " The Ballingtons.” The book is hardly to be called a religious novel, but if the deacons reputed to buy the Sunday school libraries do not immediately perceive its value to them, they will miss an attraction at least equi\*alent to a picnic.
One of these deacons appears In Miss Edna Edwards Wylie’s '* The Ward of the Sewing Circle/’ which Messrs. Little, Brown & Co. will publish to-morrow, with " The Ballingtons.*’ The author describes the experiences of an orphan successively entertained In five small households, and yet avoids the exaggeration almost Invariable in books of this species, but at best such sojourns are unhappy, and as all children not absolutely spoiled are martyrs in their own eyes, young readers will hugely enjoy the tale.

There cannot be any doubt about Miss Helen Leah Reed’s ” Amy in Arcadia," which is perfectly understood to be written for young girls, or about Mr. Edwin Carlile Litsey’s ** The Race of the Swift," which also comes to-morrow, and is as evidently written for ftfrest lovers with strong nerves, for the author is ruthless with his four-footed heroes.
But there is even better luck for lovers tfra-Ti for the deacons, for it has been decided that Mr. Arthur I. Keller’s holiday edition of Bret Harte's ** Her Letter ” shall be sold at a price that does not suggest the holidays, and it is made for lovers.
" Her Letter,” " His Answer to Her Letter," and " Her Last Letter ’* are series of pictures which " the eyes make when they are shut,” and Mr. Keller has drawn them exquisitely, coloring some, leaving others in tint or in black and white, giving each page further special decoration of white and black on gold, and showing Cupid in countless aspects. The book will be published Oct. IS by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co.
A novel version of Cupid’s own costume appears in a set of end papers prepared for Mr. Frank P. Sebley’s " All by Wire,” to be published by Messrs. John W. Luce & Co. The son of Venus Is arrayed as a messenger boy and in various phases of motion skims over the pages at a pace seldom seen in real life.

■* The Counsels of a Worldly Godmother," although but a few days published, Is making more stir than one expects to note in the case of a book so serious In substance, although amusing in form, but Saturday gives it a formidable rival In " The Coming of the Tide," Miss Margaret Sherwood's story, with its touching picture of an eccentric idler pursuing his unconscious, useless way, beside the tragic or happy lives of the chief characters. In this book, again, the entering wedge of interest is the mischievous sketch of the affected, club-taught women who fancy that they monopolize all knowledge of letters. It is so easy to remember a bit of keen naughtiness! Among the other books to come Saturday are Mr. John Burroughs’s “ Ways of Nature/’ containing his recent controversial essays and some others, and having his portrait for a frontispiece; Miss Alice N. Bacon’s “ In the Land of the Gods,” nominally fiction, but really exemplifications of Japanese religious belief; Mr. Ferris Greenslet’s " Jamea Russell Lowell”; Mr. Henry James’s The Question of Our Speech,** with 300 copies of the first edition, uncut, with paper label, and Mr. Everett T. Tomlinson's ” The Red Chief," a tale of the Cherry Valley massacre.

It is easy to see that this book and Mrs. Mary E. Q. Brush's " The Scarlet Patch ** will often be confused during the coming Winter, especially as troth are stories of New York In the Revolution. The latter
book tell3 of a Tory organizationalmost
equally dangerous to friend and foe, and the conspicuous Indian character is friendly to the Whigs. It is published by Messrs. Lee & Shepard, and has illustrations by Mr. George W. Picknell, whose skill even children can hardly help notiqfe.
Messrs. L. C. Page & Co. are bringing out Dumas's “ Celebrated Crimes of the Russian Court,” with sixteen portraits and an introduction by Mikael Gortsha-kov. Some of the historical papers were translated for Every Saturday, some appeared in London magazines, but nearly all the book appears for the first time in English.

The Cathedral Series is continued by "The Cathedrals and Churches of the Rhine,” by Francis Miltoun and Miss Blanche McManus, and it will be found to have all the useful appendices of the former volumes and an index. The twenty-four full-page pictures are rendered by the same process used in " The Cathedrals of Southern France," and more than fifty sketches in Mne are added.

The Merrymount Press is about to enlarge its borders by the addition of a bindery, and already a choice array of fair volumes has beer added to the attractions of its library. ,Tts chief work will be simple, durable bindings, " sewn on bands,” but the work is to be in charge of Mr. Peter Verburg, designer and pupil of Mr. Douglas Cockerell, and both special designs and reproductions of any desired elaboration will be furnished.
*•* .
Mr. Page having-set the example of free speech, Mr. Henry Holt will follow with an Atlantic Monthly paper on " The Commercialization of Literature/’ to appear in the November number. It should be an interesting paper If it do justice to certain firms. Other papers in the same number will be " The Country in November,” by Mr. H. C. Merwin; "Telephone Development in the United States,” by F. W. Cobum; "How to Know the Fallacies," by Dr. Samuel McChord Crothers; ‘‘ Immigration in the South,” by Mr. Robert De C. Ward, and " Experiences of a Census Taker,” by W. H. Allen, a title promising something in the way of forbidden fruit, if the printed assurances of the Census Bureau’s envelopes be of any significance.
M. Maeterlinck will appear in a later number with a disquisition on ** Our Anxious Morality," a title exciting one’s curiosity as to the second person included in the pronoun, and " Woman Suffrage in the Tenements,” by Miss Elizabeth McCracken. Prof, N. S. Shaler will contribute an article on " Exploration.”
