FRENCH NOVELS.
Four New Ones by Bazin, Remain RoMand, and Others.^
By arrangement with Ttje London Times. j
NCK, many years ago, M. Rfnan remarked that most novo is are wearisome ** because they are not concerned with the problems of conduct. A novel,” said he,
" should represent the give-and-take of principles and passions, and had I a life to spare (he continued) I conceive myself writing a novel which should be a treaty of ethics, in fact a morale en action.” This evidently is the aim of M. Ken£ Bazini but it is complicated by a feeling for geography eminently characteristic of our age. He intends, we imagine, to compose a moral geography of contemporary France! M. Renan would have read with pleasure the novels of M. Renfe Bazin, would have entered into his point of view, and seen what' was reasonable and delicate and right in it, before returning to his own standpoint, which showed conspicuously the other side of the prospect. M, Bazin is not capable of such excursions. But in his own limited and even narrow way he is a man of great moral delicacy and much sincerity of feeling* endowed with that sense of beauty which ts, perhaps, the most usual gift in our days at least among French novelists— for three out of the four authors in our list possess it in a high degree. M. Bazin’s no\ els are conservative and religious, and this one even more so than the rest, but with a note of passion in It—a passionate pit> called up by the recent laws against the reiigious orders in France.
When we say that M. Bazin intends composing a moral geography of France we have in mind especially four of his later books—“ La Terre qui Meurt *’ (our favorite of all his works.) which gives so	,
unforgettable a picture of the Vendean	'
j	marshes with their waterways and punts,
I	while it considers the moral problem of	i
military service, which draws the young peasant from the land, congesting the j city with inefficient unemployed; " Dona-tienne." a study of austere and sterile i Brittany, where the young wife and mother leaves her home in order to serve as foster-mother to the children of the rich :	—M. Brieux has treated the same subject
|	In his **, Rempla^ante **; “ Le Oberie," a
panorama of Alsace, with the great prob-,	lem of patriotism inevitably put to the	:
young French-Alsatian who comes to !	man’s estate, since he must serve in the
I	German Army if he would live on his
!	father’s land—and this novel has pro-
voked an answer from M. Maurice Barr&s in his " Au Service de l'Allemagne." In , his last volume M. Bazin has been happy in his choice of Lyons—fervent, revolutionary. religious Lyons—as the scene of | a story which concerns the disbanding and expulsion of a pious sisterhood, and j the subsequent fate of the nuns turned adrift on the world. It is in fact a pfob-	!
lem not easy to solve, for the Church in	,
France is an empire within an empire, and hostile at every point to that governing empire which is the French Republic.
I	It is naturae, it illiberal, that the State
|	should desire to form its future electors
|	according to its own ideals, and not in-
trust them to the teaching of an enemy.
MONKS and nuns, like all highly specialized workmen, are iii-fitted for everyday life and ordinary duties Just fn proportion as their peculiar faculty is developed at the expense of the rest of their natures. They can pray, or ;	teach, or nurse the sick, or make liqueurs
and sweetmeats, or sew and embroider,
!	as the case may be; but by rote and order,
according to a definite rule. The virtue i	of obedience has deprived them of initia-
tive; and their case, when turned out of their convents into the hustling crowd of the street, is hard indeed. M. Bazin has I	chosen here a fine subject. He has treated
it with too much haste; we see traces of i	the well-known formula of naturalism;
l	the thing is not mature, Inevitable, nat-
i	ural, as is the case with work long brood-
ed over, assimilated, and at last produced by what is unconscious in our nature. Top obviously he has studied the question I	and got up his brief from, the most accu-
rate documents.

BUT the passion and compassion of tho man are sincere enough, and move us through the artifices of his tabulation, which are conspicuous especially toward the end. Sweet unfortunate Soenr Pascale falls too easily; w6 lose our interest In so passive a creature, who holds her soul so cheap. Her murder scarcely moves us. Comnare it with the final fate, almost exactly similar, of the miserable heroine of ** Babre de Montparnasse." There, we feel that the writer treats of what be knows; here, of what he has read. But the beginning of " LfIsolde " ts ! exquisite in its slmpllctty, and, in Adolphe

Mouvaud, M. Bazin has sketched a typo as frequent in French daily life as hitherto unrepresented in French literature. We see the slender man with his big head, tired, kind eyes, and the cropped, bristling black and white hair like worn plush; and we seem to know him, so firm, so gay, so laborious, so fond of action and movement, yet patient—surely the most patient of mortals—beaause (deep ut heart) the most pious; living. indeed, beneath all hig surface of banter and playful rusticity, In perpetual communication with a secret ideal—patlens quia aeternus. Alternately taciturn and gay (and equally natural in either mood, as he is equally a Christian and an artist,) sensitive and brusque. Adolphe Mouvaud is a living figure. And how Charlotte Bronte would have loved this compatriot of M. Paul Emmanuel!
THE season has produced more than one good novel, and one, at least, which will outlast many a season. M. Romain Holland's " Jean Christophe " is a remarkable book—and yet is it a book at all? The third volume of it, recently published, leaves the hero on the eve of manhood, without an adventure in his uneventful history. How many volumes 1 will it take to complete his career? Who I and whence is “Jean Christophe"? We J were admiring the way in which M. Rol-: land had caught the air and spirit of a i little German town toward the close of | the eighteenth century, when, far on in the story, an allusion warned us that Jean Christophe is our contemporary. Much that Is vague and formless and diffuse surrounds the central figure, recalling the goldep Rembrandtllke mists which envelop a scene lit up at night by a single lantern. But that which the ray touches lives and speaks. M. Holland at his best reminds us of the greatest writers only, and the names that rise to our lips are Rousseau, Goethe. He ignores the tricks of the trade. He is not half so clever as M. Abei Hermaui or M. de Regnier. But M. Romain Holland is ** une nature." If he live It is probable that we may have to admire him, with all his faults thick upon his head, and perhaps to consider them (as we consider the emphasis of Rousseau, the prolixity of Goethe) an integral part of his gift. Geniuses arc never impeccable—they leave perfection to a Gautier or a Banville.
Perhaps the first volume (I/Aube) of “Jean Christophe" is the best; it has the double charm of the romance of childhood and the musical novel; * two dangerous styles, but which, when successful, have a haunting felicity of their own. In M. Holland's first volume, the homely grace of the German setting, the force and fidelity of the character-painting, something at once cordial and large, simple and tender, in the telling, reveal the author of the “ Vie de Beethoven.” The last volume, " L’ Adolescent," has, however, one episode—the story of Sabine —which Is even better. It seems a tremendous thing to say. but we have thought It more than once. Godthe might have held the pen which traced these few pages, so natural In their power and grace, and which, re-read for the third or fourth time, seem the more moving for that repetition.
The best of "Jean Christophe" la so very good that the novels we read after tt seem futile and ineffectual. Mme. de Noaille's prose is seldom as happy as her verse, (we except from this verdict " Le Visage 6merveill6,’’ which is, in fact, a prose poem,) and she is not at her best In the book before us. The hero, Antoine Arnaud. reminds us of the heroes of M. j Maurice Barr&s's earlier novels; he, too, is an " homme libre," but the liberty he claims is not intellectual or moral, but merely sensuous and passionate. Hla speeches are the best thing in the book— absurdly lyric, romantic* and jejune—but with the song and joy of youth in them. Antoine is a Don Juan, with all the sex at his feet, who dies at last of love for a
I	young girl—a girl he can never hope to : marry—his wife's sister. There is a mor-j bid delicacy, an ardent melancholy, In j these last chapters; yet nothing that | strikes to the quick with intimate conviction. We cannot justify to ourselves the success—succfes de scandale—of ** La Lueur sur la Cime.” It seems to us neither | very good nor very bad, though either opinion Is orthodox In Paris. We have seldom read-a less interesting book. It follows scrupulously the modern formula-out Of Ibsen by Nietzsche—but jLts dogmatic immorality does not galvanize it into.life. Yet, under the name of Fomina. " Jacque Voutade " contributes to the Figaro notes and studies of considerable literary merit; and she has had a hand in the making of at least one novelist's reputation. She Is a woman of talent, who has not breathed life into her work.
