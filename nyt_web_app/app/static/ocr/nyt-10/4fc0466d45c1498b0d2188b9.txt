URTHER adventures of the celebrat
ed A* 3. Raffles, cricketer and
cracksman, are published in a new ' volume called ** A Thief in the Night,” (Scribncr's.) The chief of these adventures profess to deal with the younger days of Mr. Homung's hero, and one in particular tells how Raffles lost Bunny the heart and hand of the girl who loved him. The two of them broke into the house where the girl lived- She was prowling about in a ball gown—and Bunny yns recognized. - Other tales concern a chest of family silver which was taken to a bank on the^fcopofa cab—with Raffles Inside the chest—a meeting ox the Criminologists' - Club at which a noble Duke and Raffles, with Bunny, assisted, and the lifting of the Jeweled belt and other . .trophies- of. a champion pugilist. The newer stories, while they seem somehow to lack'the snap and go of the earlier ones, are nevertheless not very different . in quality, and- if you are not tired of the old Raffles they may be. trusted to furnish entertainment for an idle hour.
