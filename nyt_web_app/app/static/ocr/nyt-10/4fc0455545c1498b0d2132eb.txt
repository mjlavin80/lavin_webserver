KIPPS AND OTHERS.
ILnterlalning Personages in the New No . els of the Autumn—The Sequel to “She ” and '
" The Gambler.”
«rv - — -
HR now book by II. G. Wells, called “ Kipps: The Story of a Simple Soul," (Scribners,) deals with no formidable problems touching the future of man, involves no majestic sweep of the imagination into the mysteries of the thousandth century, | is bred of no fantastic dreams. It reveals anew, and strikingly, the author's humorous gift, of which he seemed all but bereft when he wrote some of his wildly fanciful tales, such as '* The Sleeper Awakened," and if it is not altogether free from the “ sociological " arguments of " Mankind in the Making” and " A Modern Utopia"—Mr. Wells without the least touch of “ sociology " would not be Mr. Wells at aU— yet that is all effectually subordinated to a story—a good story well told.
On the two hundred and thrfd page of this book, when the story has reached the thickest of its plot,
Mr. Wells has occasion to describe, in his pleasingly ironical way, the library of a well-set-up young middle-class gentleman, living at Folkstone, in Kent, a library containing some obvious books and some unaccountable ones, some good books and much rubbish—■* in fact a compendium of the contemporary British mind.” In this library are the " hundred best books,” including “ Samuel Warren’s ' Ten Thousand a Year.’ ”
Now, the single one of the “ hundred best books " mentioned might as well have been " David Copper-field " or “ Pilgrim’s Progress ” or any one of the ninety-seven others. But here is Mr. Wells’s clever hit at the critical reader, on whom the facts have just dawned that Artie Kipps is a revivification of Tittlebat Titmouse, placed in a modern environment, studied from a new point of view, and that the tale called " Kipps " is Mr. Wells's own *‘ Ten Thousand a Year ”—M twelve 'underd a year ” Is the exact figure, and enough for the purpose, too.
Mr. Wells’s own beloved Kent1 is the scene of most of the story, from Dover clear up to Hastings, with much of moment happening in Folkstone, in Hythe, New Romney, milestone, and Dymchurch. There are glimpses of London, too, and it is at the Crystal Palace, in Sydenham, that Artie and his sweetheart are sitting near the huge effigies of extinct monsters, when the following brief dialogue ensues:
" I wonder *ow all these old antediluvium animals got extinct." he asked. ** No one couldn’t possibly ’ave killed 'em."
" Why! I know that," said Ann. “ They was overtook by the Flood."	„
Kipps meditated for a while. “ But I thought they had to take two of everytbir?g there was—M " Within reason they ’ad," said Ann.
" Kipps,” as we have said, is a humorous Story, but it is not a trifling one.^&nd though it deals largely with humble folk, it has to do, in a broad and forceful way, with much of the seriousness of life. Mr. Wells is a writer of large resource. His fund of
%
information is almost as wonderful as Balzac’s, What a lot he knows, for instance, of the ins and outs of retail trade, and the hangers-on of the theatre; of the house agency business, and the ways of inferior architects? How admirably true, human, (and with the dignity of humanity,) are his portrayals of servants. ''fVe confess that we do not quite understand Miss Helen Walshingham, "but Artie and his uncle, Buggins, Sid Fornick, Ann, Chitterlow, and the consumptive Socialist, Masterman, are all excellent.
. A SEQUEL ■ TO " SHE.”
WE paid courteous attention to Mr. Rider Haggard's sequel to his famous “ She ” from time to time during its serial publication. In book form, however, " Ayesha *■ (Doubleday, Page & Co.) is entitled to fresh consideration. The sequel.is deft-
SI) r JfeUr jJorkSintfu
: icated, as the original was?, to Andrew ■ Liang, and there is a short '"author*?
note ’’ In which Mip. Haggard announces :■ that <f’thfs conclusion of an Imaginative ixagedy" he has always desired to
•	vrite “should he be 'destined to live through those many years 'which., in obedience to his original design; must be allowed la ispse between the events of the first and second part of the . romance.** There is surely something occult in this declaration. Dumas did . not have to live twenty years after " Les Trols Mousquetalres " before he could write “ Vingt Ans Aprfcs." The name of Ayesha, Mr. Haggard informs us. should be pronounced “ Assha."
No doubt, allowing for the disillusionment of years, this sequel is as well-wrought as its original. Probably it is even superior geographically, ethnologically, theologically, and pyrotechnically. Mr. Haggard has gained greatly in stature since he wrote “ She/' and the world of novel readers has grown a trifle wiser as to the Orient and its religious mysteries.
The sheer audacity, the youthful imaginative recklessness of '* She,” however, counted for much. The mystic rites, the spectacular displays, the grisly horrors of the sequel are all more carefully worked up, doubtless, but we who read the original when it was a new book (half apologetically, of course) and felt its charm, can hardly be expected to be equally satisfied with any sequeL. 1’appily, Ayesha has vanished now forever, along with her Leo Vlncy and her mad Holly, and her mystic retinue. The pleasantest remembrances of her latest incarnation centre around Kou-an, the wise, philosophical monk of Buddha, a good mind In a comfortable body.
“ THE SOCIAL SECRETARY.”
THE amazing heroine of Mr. David Graham-Phillips* a new story, " The Social Secretary," (Bobbs-Merrill Company,) tells her own story. She is a charming young woman of birth and breeding, who has fallen up'tm evil days —or what in her set are esteemed evil. How she not only introduces " Ma " and " Pa ** Burke (a Western million-aire-Senator and his wife) into Washington society, but makes of them the most brilliant successes of the season; how she keeps nine books—classified social accounts—how she engineers breakfasts, calls, dinners, balls, (which, to quote Mr. Peggotty, “ is poetry, though not so intended^’;) the people she knows; the havoc she makes in the heart of a young Burke of Harvard diploma and European travel—all this and much more is cleverly set forth. An unnamed but obvious President occasionally appears, and there are inter-
Iesting sidelights upon a peculiarly complex social system. The magnitude of the young lady's salary is enough to make the whole guild of secretaries feminine gasp with astonished envy; but, even after *' Pa " Burke doubles it, we must own it justified in its results.
The real character of the book, however, is good fat Mrs. Burke, taking her world and herself humorously, and possessing one art alone, hut that the finest of them all, “ the art of being kind*"
Mr. Phillips’s airy tale is a fascinating one, and, perhaps, if one locks closely, he may find beneath the daintily flavored meringuo some food for thought
MRS. THURSTON'S N l-y\V STOUT.
THAT Mrs, Katherine Cecil Thurston is a born story teller was shown In " The Circle *' and still more clearly in “ The Masquerader.” Her new book, "The Gambler,” (Harper & Brothers) is not Inferior in interest to her most widely known novel, while it greatly surpasses its predecessor In the vitality of its characters, the cohesion of its plot, the fidelity of both to possibility, and its literary art.
The subject of heredity seems to be peculiarly faecinating to 'the novelist, while full of perils and pitfalls. These Mrs. Thurston adroitly avoids, never making her picture too lurid, npr permitting her heroine to slip from the reader's sympathies.
It is very subtly conceived that from the beginning the young Irish girl, Clo-dagh Asshlin, while loathing the greatgrandfather who kept gamecocks, , played cards, threw dice, squandered 1 money, and killed his brother in a duel; while resisting with all her power tho I gambling passion in her father, should ! yet, with total unconsciousness, show the fatal taint in her own blood—the taint which was later to bring her to
S O HE-O FTHE-NE W
AU^TUMNNOVE LSi ■
f-v	n. i •	-1 -	It J-'
the verge of destruction. To play, for a stake, this was the Asshlin. passion; to hold a debt of honor a sacred thing, this’ an Asshlin did, though he neglected every other obligation on earth. And these two' racial, instincts conspired, but failed; to make utter ruin of a brilliant and loyal young life.
,	J
The character of Clodagh Is wholly original and is.consistently worked out; Nance, the devoted sister andi final rescuer Is an excellent foil—the one her father’s, the other her mother’s child. The men are less Interesting, but fill their rOles sufficiently well, and the reader is led from situation to situation with an unflagging eagerness to know “ What next,"
The author knows Ireland and the Irish, and^ treads firmly upon the soil. She knows the Continent, too, hut she does not overdo either her scenery or her minor characters. All fall into their proper place in the intense-human drarna-
If wc say that a little compression would have improved th# book, we are perhaps looking at it more from tho point of view of the full-fed professional novel reader than of the general public, who will not be likely to quarrel with the goodly number of such ennui-destroying pages. “ The Gatobler " deserves a wider and a more enthusiastic circle of readers than " The Masquerader.” Whether or not It achieves a like popularity, Mrs. 'Thurston will have the satisfaction of knowing that she has made a distinct advance In the. quality of her work.
PATHOLOGICAL.
WHETHER “The Lost Viol," by M. P. Shield (Edward J. Clode,) is a satire or a BerloUs work is a question which a prudent man might hesitate to answer. At all events it is an exceedingly curious document. By the terms of it there is a fat and dull and selfish young violinist who Inspires grand passions in three women. One woman is pretty and French and has “ a good heart," but no particular strength of character. Another is a bouncing English girl—a girl almost indecently healthy and energetic and fairly electric with “ character." The third is a hunchback with every moral and psychical fibre as twisted as her body. The first woman, ot course. Is merely a victim; the other two iteep each a diary. Whole-souled English Hannah sets down her thoughts in short, sharp sentences with the first personal pronoun omitted—sentences which- the author seems to regard as exquisitely expressive of the woman’s personality.
The hunchback’s diary is the expression of her starved longings, her malignity, and her indomitable resolve to get even with a world which has served her so ill* So you have the plot. The hunchback schemes to throw the flabby artist (whose flabbiness appears to impress the author as his chief charm) from the arms of one of the other women (he is married to her) Into the arms of the third. The schemer is inspired partly by sheer impishness, partly by the desperate hope of getting him for herself in the end. This piratical plot in its development permits infinite exhibitions of a diseased mind—murder, wholesale lying, theft, everything that the law and the prophets forbid. The musician throughout it all is as nearly as possible an inert mass—a reduction to lowest terms, as it were, of the man of Mr, G. B. Shaw’s fashionable heterodoxy.
Altogether the writer shows—if the book is intended to £e taken seriously— a most singular combination of insight and lack of it. For Hannah, under the pen name of Viola, writes remarkable love letters to the musician—and from these there are copious quotations, intended, apparently, to expose the “ philosophy of Hannah," who is one of the people to whom unselfishness is pure joy, who reasons not at all, and is, as it were, perpetually drunk with the
wine of her own utter goodness. To- j
i
gether the characters are material which not only excuses but requires a*’ highly melodramatic development of j the story.
The MARRIAGE OF MRS. LARKINS.
THE Larkins Wedding" (Moffat, Yard & Co.) ’s a story on the “ Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch " order. Mrs. Larkins, a washerwoman by profession, a philosopher by
[training, a good woman hy, Instinct, and, a, comely; one by nature, sails, through the story with an .easy amiability calculated to*point a moral to those of her readers whose lives are cast in: more, pleasant lines and who .yet have a habit of grumbling over their lots. "The wed-dln^-came about through Patty. Patty was her daughter, a. .younger edition of ; Mrs.; I^rkins's own good-humored self* and a pretty girl to boot. It was small - wonder that Mr. Brindle, three times a widower, let. his eyes rest admiringly and covetously on Patty's pretty form; and since Mr. Brindle was really an admirable farmer whose only fault was his age as compared to Patty’s, Mrs. Larkins Jfelt it her duty to help the wedding along.
The main thread,of the story runs through a humorous description of Mrs. Larkins’s fond ambitions for her daughter’s wedding, her grotesque preparations, which the good people of Happyville (whose clothes Mrs. Larkins conscientiously washed) gently frustrated, substituting In their place, unknown both to Patty and her mother, more tasteful plans. But the coup d’etat of the story occurs in church, when suddenly Mrs. Larkins saw young Charlie Baxter slipping the ring on Patty’s slim finger. “ Sakes alive! ” cried Mrs. Larkins, “ I knew they*d get things mixed. *	*	* The preacher’s
joining her to the wrong feller. ’Tain’t right to let such a mix-up pass by.” But it developed - that they all knew quite well what they wanted, as was later shown by Mr. Brindle giving the bride away, so that he might himself lead the dazed Mrs. Larkins to the altar, in spite of his previous announcement that he didn’t want any more “ widders,” the three preceding Mrs. Brindfes all having had that fault.
ARTHUR S. PIER’S NEW BOOK.*
MR. PIER’S strong novel, ** The Ancient Grudge,” (Houghton, Mifflin & Co.,) emphasizes the thesis of Mrs. Goodwin’s “ Claims and Counterclaims,” that the last and crowning secret of M the gentle art of making enemies " is to save a man’s life at the risk of one’s own. Mrs. Goodwin’s herd had ample reason to distrust and dislike his rescuer, from which repulsion no chains of gratitude could hold him back. Mr. Pier’s hero, on the contrary, is the rescuer, not the rescued, and that Is Just the trouble; for Stewart Lee, snatched out of the very hand of death, cannot bear to be relegated to the position of sub-hero, and writhes , under the weight of obligation he cannot but feel toward Floyd Halket, as fine a fellow as ever breathed. Mr. Pier has done an excellent piece of work in his portrayal of the contrasting characters of these two young men, and of the relation between them— Stewart handsome, fascinating, brilliant, versatile, but superficial and essentially weak; Floyd his "superior in ability, incomparably his superior In character, but shy, clumsy, homely,
I looking up to the gay and popular Stewart with a sort of adoration. While , Stewart felt his indebtedness to Floyd i as one feels the irritating presence of a hair shirt, wincing when it touched his i loyalty on the raw, Floyd ignored, even , to himself, the fact that to him his friend owed his life. So differing in I temperament and in ideals; roommates at Harvard, loving the-same girl, continually thrown together during their years of manhood, it was inevitable that the situation should be strained to the utmost,* that the uniting cord should finally snap. The author holds the balance true between the men; one sees both sides, and, while giving Halket unstinted admiration, does not withhold sympathy from Lee. Mr. Pier shows in this picture the detachment of the true artist, and has presented along with a vigorous story an interesting study of character.
The novel Is by no means confined to the relation between its leading persons; Lee’s career as an architect and incidentally a paint *r; Halket's as an owner of great steel works—each is a story in itself. Here a fault in the book becomes apparent: it attempts too much. A novel is overweighted when It essays a detailed dual biography. The mind becomes fatigued in hurrying from an absorbed consideration of the subtle relations between the two young men, to plunge into labor troubles with Floyd, into Stewart’s amateurish art, and Colonel Halket's amateurish Industrial philosophies, to touch
■'theology here . arid romance there—rail -jWell done, hut {blurred by the crowding, jlntereats an^vfigures. .•	-	•
The “ -cpnsolation cup " offered-Floyd, in the end seems but inadequate, an 'afterthought on the part of the author, inat the rich vintage of genuine ro-!mance. It .lacJjs aroma, there is some-i thing tepid and tasteless about it. Stewart’s great atonement, dramatic and noble as it is. might have been [brought about in some better way than by means of that howling mob of which we are growing very weary in these latter daysv How often it howls on the pages ot" modem fiction I How frequently It is used for the taking off of the right people at the right time!
; Yet, a^ter we have thrust our fingers ; through all the thin places in Mr. Pier's : narrative, the fact remains that " The : Ancient Grudge ” is a story of uncommon interest, originality, and power. As In Mr. Pier's earlier novel, " The Triumph,” Its men are much more real than its women, robust and distinct personalities, every one. Like the former book, it is wholesome in tone, high in its ideals. The author has made a decided advance tn his art since the publication of “ The Triumph," handling his material more firmly, and making a stronger human appeal. “ The Ancient Grudge ” Is a book not soon to be forgotten by its readers.
DIVORCE IN KENTUCKY.
THIS posthumous book-of Elizabeth Cherry Waltz, " The Ancient Landmark," (McClure, Phillips & Co.,) discusses the question of divorce in a country where marriages are looked upon rigidly from th’e Scriptural point of view of ** whom God hath joined together let no man put asunder.*’ The scene is laid in Kentucky, and the author has given some rather good pictures of the men of that country, its women—unsurpassed anywhere —Its horses—the best In the world—and its mint juleps—indescribable!
Dulcinea Childress, married to Dr. De Witt before she was old enough to really know her own mind, became the unhappy victim of a husband who was morally and physically a wreck. The idea of a divorce had never entered Dulcie’s mind as the simple solution of her troubles, neither had it occurred to any of her friends, who all sympathized with her, who all loved her, and comforted her, and sent her back to martyrdom. But Lucien Beardsley arose upon the horizon. A Virginian by birth, a cosmopolitan by education, a man of modern ideas linked with a certain Indian strain inherited from a long dead ancestor, Lucien found in the unhappy Dulcie a cousin many times removed, and undertook to champion her cause, to upset the" ancient landmark, to establish the new custom of djvorce, and to launch the grief-stricken Dulcinea upon a new and glittering sea of happiness.
Many of the personages are drawn with vitality. One loves the Colonel, with his rough kindliness; one sees in Mrs. Buckman, his wife, a picture of many another fair ana strait-laced lady, bound and riveted by conventions. True, the romantic picture of Van Wye, the lawyer, is c. tolerably old one to readers of Southern novels. Why do' authors delight in making Southern— especially Kentucky—lawyers bachelors with a canker at the heart? But he is so kindhearted a gentleman that one forgives his Jack of originality.
THE CHILD IN LITERATURE.
ALL lovers of the child in literature will take kindly to these stories of ** Rebecca Mary,” by Annio Hamilton Donnell, (Harper & Brothers.) Rebecca Mary was a Plummer, and sha- lived with her Aunt Olivia, a spinster of fifty-nine, who was also a Plummer. Being a Plummer meant a great deaX It meant that by no chance must one ever display any of the deeper emotions that one experiences. Neither must one ever show one’s affection; one must have courage to do what is right, no matter how unpleasant; one must be conscientious to a fault, and above all one must do one's duty if it kills one. And In these sketches—for they are scarcely stories In length or substance— the author draws the character of the child, the yearning of that which was not Plummer in her for sympathy, affection, happiness. In " The Hundred and Oneth" Rebecca Mary rebels against hemming sheets. To Thomas Jefferson, her pet rooster and most intimate friend, she confides her insubordination, After the hundred and oneth stitch she simply will not do an-
Sht JfeUr jJorkSintffl
other one, not if she starves first. And starve she nearly did—but so did Aunt Olivia, for that matter. You see, the trouble was that they were both Plummers.
Th^n there is the sad death scene of Thomas Jr-fferson and Rebecca's inconsolable grief; the do\\ -which had a soul but no body, but which Rebecca Mary crooned softly over, just as though it was a real doll, and many other incidents;—incidents that make one smile even while they bring a lump to one's throat.
On the whole, Rebecca Mary is worth knowing.
BOARDING SCHOOL GIRLS.
MRS. ELEANOR HOYT BRAIN-ERD, who will be remembered
•	as the creator of Nancy and her escapades, has now undertaken to describe life at a fashionable boarding school in New York. " Concerning Belinda ” (Doubleday, Page & Co.) ia written with the same lightness and sprightly humor that characterized the author’s previous stories, Belinda herself was only a teacher in the fashionable finishing school* She was only twenty-two, and she was almost fatally pretty, but she managed to get along fairly well.
As for the girls! Who has not met boarding school girls in the flesh?— and boarding school girls are boarding school girls the world over, even in books. So Mrs. Brainerd is probably not exaggerating when she describes Amelia Bowers, the romantic and sentimental, or any one of the other young creatures assembled in the school, and the things they do, their hero worship, their extravagance of speech, their griefs and their joys. Their escapades are cheerful reading.
MISS CYNTHIA’S REJUVENATION.
IN “ The Resurrection of Miss .Cynthia " (Dodd, Mead Co.) Mrs. Florence Morse Kingsley tells the story of a spinster of thirty-three to whom the doctor allowed one more year of lifev who suddenly broke loose from the traditions of her house, her training, even her instincts, and decided that since life meant only one more year to her, she should have her fling in a world in which she had led thirty-three years of dreary, uneventful existence. So, because Miss Cynthia had all her life worn black for some lamented relative or other, in this last year she cast aside black forever. She clad her small person in pale blues and tender greens, in pinks, and whites* and yellows, and browns. She went into the woods—she. who had never even in childhood attended a picnic—and sat on the damp ground with the Puffer twins, kind-hearted bu,t reckless maidens of very tender years; she took them I by the hand and ran races with them; she allowed them to dig up her garden and wallow in her preserve and jam ! jars; she burned wood reckle*ily in the I front parlor and flared up the lights, al- I though all the traditions of her house favored a dim chilliness. She stopped reading her Bible and gave recklessly to the poor, and altogether she wrought much havoc In her own small world during that allotted period-	!
But soon a buried love affair was unearth w3, as might have been expected, and good little Miss Cynthia, who had planned to live only a year and had tried hard to cultivate resignation, discovered that sometimes Boston doctors make a mistake in their diagnoses. But for all that, the year in Miss Cynthia's life was not wasted.	'
A MOTOR CAR BOOK.	|
MRS. A M. WILLIAMSON and Mr. C. N. Williamson, authors of “ The Lightning Conductor,’’ have written a third clever novel of automobile travel abroad, called u My Frit_nd the Chauffeur,’* (McClure, Phillips & Co.) It holds a peculiar charm for the motorist, but even the lay reader will be thrilled by the adventures of the stanch *' Panhard,” Interested In the unusual tour, amused by the bright dialogue, and, of course, eager to follow to the end the various romances growing out of the expedition of which ** My Friend the Chauffeur ” Is the hero, and resourceful Sir Ralph the 'deviser.
Like many of the novels of the hour, this story has a tendency to sag rather heavily in the middle, and then to “ round up ” its characters at the end, for no particular reason except that the requisite number of pages hag been filled, •
About a third of the pleasant tale goes easily and fleetly; afterward, while
the1 interest of the tour and the love affairs Is well sustained, the sparkle has died out, and the book ranges Itself with the host of guidebook romances, of which the genial and forgotten , “ Porte Crayon ,l was perhaps the pioneer. Still it is never dull, and no reader I is Ukely to lay It aside until the desti-1 nies of the masquerading chauffeur and I the irritatingly superior Malda; of the sensible Ralph and the flippant Beechy; of the dubious Countess, and the more dubious Prince are as well settled as their creators permit.
While one reads the book for entertainment alone—and finds what he seeks—he absorbs not a little information in the process, a thing to be forgiven when so dexterously imparted.
My Friend the Chauffeur ” will be gratefully remembered, - too, as releasing the novel reader from his usual position of a toad under a harrow—there isn’t a pang in its pages; its thrills are just thrilling enough to be agreeable— altogether a bright and pleasing story.
AN AWAKENING.
THE story of Western Kentucky, called, somewhat audaciously, “ A
Brother of Christ," (Broadway Publishing Company,) is told not without considerable literary skill, with a suggestion of the influence of James Lane Allen. Ingram Crockett, the author, has chosen a yotfng mystic for his protagonist, and placed him in the eccentric sect called Christadelphians, domiciled in rural Kentucky, The story Ues in the effect of real life (even in the quiet country) upon this young man, and links with his fate that of two young women of very different types, both real enough. The first is a passionate beauty, and serves to Introduce some highly colored effects; the other is wise and calm and pure, and ia ** good medicine" for the soul of the dreamer.
The “ local color " of the book is particularly to be commended as adding to and not subtracting from the story. You will read of a Sunday morning at the “ synagogue ” of the Christadelphians, when Brother Andrew (the hero) lectures; you will read of a Sunday afternoon at the house of Brother Nathanael and how a country coquette entertains two incongruous suitors; you will read, again, of a barn-raising and the ways of the coquette there, of an old-fashioned dance, and again the ways of the coquette—this time quite scandalous.
The other suitor, of course, the mystic being suitor number one, is a coarse and wicked villain, and he is present at all these festivities. In another place you have a rescue—the catching of a runaway horse—and that introduces the other girl. An account of a public 41 debate ” (lasting three days) between the prophets of the Christadelphians and the local representatives of orthodoxy will serve admirably for a picture of a “ camp meeting ** anywhere in Virginia or Kentucky. The debate, of course, Is merely the occasion for a picnic.
It may be added that the story doesn’t at all give the effect of having been written In order to string these scenes together. The scenes seem the natural background of events conditioned by that background and the peculiarities of the hero.
A FIGHT BEQUEATHED,
THERE was once according to the story of “ Sunrise Acres,” (Dodd, Mead & Co.,) a *' plunger and financial daredevil " who came to die when be was forty-one years old and the possessor .of millions. He had a nephew. And in his youth he had fought another man for a lady and lost, Now he bequeathed half a million dollars to his nephew on condition that the young man, who was a football player and a trained athlete, go out into the world, find the man who had beat his uncle, and with his bare fists and In fair fight administer to him an equally good drubbing, .
This commission, after some misgivings overcome, the nephew undertook, and -s.ent^ to Indiana after his man. The man turned out to be a giant with a pretty daughter and an Invalid wife. Love entered into the plot, and a trained nurse and a comic hired man. But the fight was pulled off In great style out in one of the blg.man's-pastures—for he was a farmer.
The author has an excellent idea for a farce comedy. He has-unfortunately lacked some skill in execution.
