N O LESS wtse than witty ure'tlies?
" Counsels of a Worldly Godmother,” who, by tho by, dees herself less than justice by her adjective, for there is a- potentially wide difference between a -worldly woman and a woman of tl:e world, and hers is the distinction of belonging to the latter-small and charming cla^3.
The counsels " are given in a penes of letters dealing1 with a large range of subjects—grace of. manner, the value of ancestors, the rare art of conversation.
" charity	gone wrong/* speaking with
tongues, womanliness, *' the price of popularity,”	letters of introduction, vul-
garity rampant,” foreign alliances, “ the slime of	tho divcrco court,” books and
reading,	marrying a poor man. tactful
bearing toward a husband, and all ihe essentials of a successful social life.
If these letters to a motherless goddaughter have little. Lo do with renouncing the pomps and vanities of this wicked world, at least they will teach a girl how to bear herself most discreetly and gracefully among them, and to have a just sense of their value in the complex scheme of life. Indeed, we are not sure that the	godmotherly counsels do not	t
point In	the end to a pretty complete	-
[enunciation for the sake of a love great enough to rejoicc in sacrifice.
The^ letters have caught just the right tone; they are light in touch, gently ironicnl, diversified by anecdote, full of sparkling humor, with now and then a serious word which goes straight to the mark all the more surely because of the sunny atmosphere through which it is sped— Now and then we take issue with her as in her somewhat narrow definition of a snob. To our mind a snob is " a vulgar person aping gentility," as Halli-well hath it, both cringcing before Uiose ho esteems hia^Jiettcrs and bent upon pushing him: elf among them; Incidentally, of course, giving pain by his airs of superiority, but that only a detail of his detestable earcer.
Mrs. Mather's advice as to the study of languages:, seems scarcely practical. How many girls can so master French and Italian as to converse fluently and elegantly in both, observing every shade of meaning? We agree with the author, however, in holding " firmly to reading as a means of intellectual salvation.” Reading and association with brilliant men ha\c produced the most fascinating and influential women the world has ever seen, from the earliest French salons to the present day.
Naturally, these counsels are not Intended for the girl who must earn her own bread, though even she may shape 1 her life upon the general lines of Mrs.
I Mather's symmetrical and womanly plan.
| To ihe girl of society the volume may 1 well become a vude mecum. We are moved to cry “ Hear! hear! ’* upon every i page. Our ** worldly godmother ” has a sweet, sound, reverent heart, as well as a most clever head, and if all debutantes
and their mothers should follow her coun-! scls, the social world would become the home of grace and of courtesy, a place for the unfolding of beautiful womanhood —and for the utter and permanent enslaving of mankind.
