OLD GREEK.
A Memoir of Edward North, an Old-Fashioned Professor in an Old-Fashioned College.*
LD GREEK ” was the affectionate nickname of Edward North, for fifty-eight years Professor of Greek in Hamilton Coliege. He resigned in 1001, and survived his resignation only two years. His professorship of fifty-eight years la "as long a period" as any similar service in the same chair in any American collcge or university— the editor of this book is not prepared to say it is the longest. None the less, it Is long enough to be memorable. This volume is an affectionate and enthusiastic memorial of a well beloved and admired friend and teacher. It Is not a critical biography of an American scholar, nor an estimate of his plact in American scholarship. It has all the overflowing zeal and loyal enthusiasm of the " small college" for its great men, whose personal influence is the chief stock in trade of the small college; it celebrates the potency of the small college and of that influence; mourns the modern conditions of American-university life; appeals for the restoration of the classics to the exclusive place to which modern methods have questioned their right. According to the editor, the volume carries a message of momentous import to the American teacher, In Indicating the sources of the teacher’s personal power over his pupils.
Whether or not its message is generally found so momentous, the volume will be a most agreeable one to alumni of the college and pupils of Prof. North. It gives a full sketch of his career, which involves many reminiscences of the elder days at the college, old customs and the old life. There follow numerous chapters concerning special features of his work. One relates to his sojourn in Greece in 1871-2; there are a detailed account of his services to his college, some reminiscences and anecdotes from college history, an analysis of Prof. North's methods, power, and achievements as a teacher, his qualifications as a Greek scholar and as a writer and lecturer, his views as a spelling reformer and as a lover of nature. He was a fluent versifier, and seems to have been in communion with the muse at frequent intervals. Miiny of the results are given; they are often pleasing, sometimes clever; but that they rarely rise to the level of poetry need not be a mat'or* for surprise. Ho was a frequent lecturer and essayist on subjects not connected with the Greek classics, and many specimens of his prose style are given. A candid judgment can hardly find in this prose that supple strength and power that the exclusive classicists so insistentiy claim as resulting from the influence of classical studies on English writers, But the variety of Prof. North’s interests, the occasional humor of his expression, the sound, high plane of his thinking, are well shown in the ex* tracts.
Now, Prof. North, whatever his enthusiastic memorialists may say, will scarcely be remembered as one of the great Greek scholars of this country. Originality and power are not greatly to be attributed to his scholarship. lie passed his life as a faithful teacher of boys in a small college, where he had a strong influence for good in various ways. It is a high and worthy calling, and big friends, pupils, and relatives do well to hold him in affectionate remembrance and to prepare this elah irate memorial of him.
