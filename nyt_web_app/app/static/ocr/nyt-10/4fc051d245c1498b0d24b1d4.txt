The second and Inst volume of Agnes
B.	C. Dunbar’s “ Dictionary of Saintly
Women " is published by the Macmillan
Company. Much of the material In this
interesting collection of the lives of holy
women has been drawn from the Acta
Sanctorum. The author's survey extends over the whole Church before the parting: of the East from the West, the Western Church as a wTToIe to the Reformation, and afterward the Roman Church. Besides being of value as a pious work, the dictionary will also be useful as a work of reference, illustrating as it does, through the lives of the saints, all tlie ages of the Christian era.
