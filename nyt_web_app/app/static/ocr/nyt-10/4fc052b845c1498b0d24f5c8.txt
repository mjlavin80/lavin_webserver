of the British Army. Tt deals especially with military tactics, and has been written from an impartial English point of view. The authors write of the value of the civil war in the introduction:
. It has for officers whoso knowledge of , foreign languages is, for the most part, limited, the great advantage that tho original documents, of which an enormous I mass has been preserved and published, arc, without exception, in English. Its long duration and tho great extent of the theatre of the operations, both by land and sea, make it a storehouse of almost every type of military action. The changes in weapons which have taken place since its conclusion have been so great as to preclude any student from supposing that he can anywhere find in it actions to be precisely copied, a temptation to be avoided* the object of military history being not to provide patterns to be copied mechanically, but to stimulate independent thought.
