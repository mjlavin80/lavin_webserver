But your article on Mr.- CflWeln's poetry, aside from some rather trivial fault finding, is on the whole just and fair, and shows appreciation and* respect for his work. For this much simple Justice the friends and admirers of Mr. Cawein will no doubt be truly grateful. 1

Veto I’orfc Times Saturday Review of Books:
I have read with a grreat deal of Interest, but I rc-gret to with almost entire disapproval, your very able and undeniably well-written review of Mr. Madison Cawein’s poetry, published Sept- 15. The volume -which you had up for review was Mr. Cawein’s recently published " The Vale of Temple,” a book of poems, which tn my opinion merits far more praise and appreciation than your reviewer seems willing to accord to It. This, however, being a matter of personal opinion merely, is not my chief reason for dissension from the views expressed in the notice of the book. What caused me some wonder, and I might say impatience, was the statement at the end of the article, indicating, of course, the exceptions that the critic took to some words which the poet employed as rhyme, and which the reviewer found it " difficult to forgive/’ This statement reads; "What we cannot so well spare is the delicate ear that forbids rhymes like "storm" and "warm”;
4	“ foot " and " lute," " was ’’ and “ buzz."
Why doesn't “ storm" rhyme with “warm" and "foot” with “lute"? What is the matter with these rhymes? These words have been used again and again as rhymes by the best poets and in their finest work. One couplet especially I recall—one of the most famous and beautiful couplets ever written, and one that has been universally quoted and admired—and from the pen of the immortal Bums himself—and it rhymes these identical words " 3torm ” and “ warm." I have no cops* of Burns at hand to refer to I and must quote from memory:
“ Gathering her brows UKe gathering storm,
Nursing her wrath to keep it warm."
Yet no one has found fault with the author of “ Tam o’ Shanter" on this account.
Again, as to the rhyming of " lute" with ** foot." Does not Mr. Aldrich In one of bis sonnets use identical rhymes? Mr. Aldrich is, as I believe, the most exquisite poet in the world; his poetry Is beautiful and flawless. He is, as Mr. Carman has so felicitously called him, ‘* a master workman in the gems of rhyme,” His sonnet “ Pursuit and Possession ” reads (I am quoting again from memory, having no books at handj:
" When I behold what pleasure is pursuit
■	• •
How fairer seems the blossom than the fruit.
*	• * I oft am striken mute. Wondering which attained the higher bliss,
The winged insect or the chrysalis
It thrust aside with onreluctant foot."
Far from finding fault with that sonnet on account of its rhyme tt seems to me one of the noblest sonnets ever written, and its beautiful rhyme-tones afford my ear the most exquisite delight.
I cannot, therefore, consider your reviewer’s objections to these words as rhymes as well fonnfWL
What I do wish & ^iat there was a disposition among the critics to accord praise generously, not begrudgingly, where praise Is due. But this, I suppose, would be too much to expect. Besides, it would not be in accordance with the best trajJitions. Poets in all ages have suffered neglect and detraction- The gentle Keats, ?	the sturdy Tennyson, all have had to enI	dure the shafts of the " indolent review-
