The woman who teils her own story is terribly in earnest about it all. She came here with scarcely anything in her slim purse, eager and anxious to work. In the little country town in which she hud lived and taught school she longed for the broader avenues for her ambition that an imagination fed on happy magazine stories of self-supporting women in a big city pictured to her. When she was finally left alone without any near relatives in the town where she had lived, she decided to start at once toward the golden city of her dreams.
Just how hard it Is for a girl willi only an ordinary education and no experience to speak of in any line of work to set something to do she learned in a short time. At first she thought to pick and choose at a profession, but soon it was a matter of taking- what she could get, and thanking a bountiful Heaven for that.
She tells of experiences in many factories, of the endless drudgeries of it all, the horrible ct iditions that goad the girls on to moral depravity and make them mental and physical wrecks: of the kindnesses of her mates, of her “ lady friends " and their “gentleman friends.” and many other things. For many months she fought against starvation and the things that are worse than starvation before she finally worked her way to the surfacc and became a member of the grade of high-class and respected business women.
In spite of the fact that much of the things she tells are things that most of us know and shut our eyes to—although it has many times been told before by women like Marie Van Vorst and others, who have studied the conditions from practical experiences—this story of ‘* The LfOng Day ” will undoubtedly be read with surprise by many, and perhaps doubted by not a few.
