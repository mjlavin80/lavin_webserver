jgjwgffjfigaTrre lovers of true poetry of the antique fjjpjjj	spirit^ full of thought, originality, and a ]
IgSg	natural unforced music, will read with a
new pleasure “ Days of Old Home,” by Arthur Lewis, a young English poet, published by Elkin Matthews, London, illustrated in outline by the fine and delicate pencil of Edith Calvert, (Mrs. Matthews,) together with a smaller and !
!
later volume entitled “ Way a of Verse.”
In turning these pages it would seem as if a new poet were singing. Although there may be here a j Shelley-like sigh, and there a suggestion of Blake's insight or of Wordsworth's outlook, and occasionally an almost Shakespearean sonorousness of line or j couplet, yet the spirit of the poems is entirely new and individual.
The subjects ot the first volume are altogether ; those suggested by the sight and thought of Old Rome. “The r>ead City”; the story of the apparition of the twin ffods at the fountain of Jutuma in
their blaze of beauty and strength, after the battle !
i
they had helped win, an apostrophe to Catullus; the J lament of Ovid in exile, over his verses of which he | knew “ never praise of their making shall sound in | the ears of their maker," a wonderfully strong and pathetic poem:
Here must it ever be mine to abide through the years and accomplish,	1
Lonesome, the weight of the day’s long drawn desolation and silence Soulless of barren shores, and waters that slumber or gnash them
Whitely betimes with the foam and the curse, and the shriek and the seething,
Fierce from the East, and for me but to add my despair to the tempest.
NOTHEE great poem is “ In Etruria,” given at the tragic moment when the blind old seer declares hl3 people are—
Beyond all impotence of ill
Our cup to fill	1
"With fuller draught and potion of despair.
And none shall know from what or whence we came; j Our very name.
I Our speech, the graven fragment of a phrase;
Our better days,
The linger of tradition, and the theme Of men who dream,
Theirs having been—
A pleasant land
Alive, and fanned
With airs of inspiration, and with thought Mysterious, taught.
Intuitive of hill and woodland vale And starlight pale,	"
And converse with the voices that imbue AU in the view
And reach of immortality’s delight.
In an equally strong vein the reader will find (i Panem et Circenses.” "The Gaul in the Mamer-tlne," " Paul on the Celian,” ** By Night Upon the Appian Way/’ and “ Ad Ostia, A. I>. 150,”
GAIUS.
’Tis good	■
Betimes to look back at her teeming streets.
Her palaces and fanes, from some still spread Of air and sun and silence, as is this.
LUCIUS.
I had thought we ne’er should reach it.
GARJS.
True, O true,
‘Twas a long tramp; but full of mighty dreams.
For pure beauty and pure poetry it would be difficult to find the superior In contemporary verse of such poems as “ Fausilypon ” and “In the Acillan Gardens,*’ Indeed, we have few anywhere finer"and sweeter than the latter. It is replete with grace and charm and dignity in phrase and line and passage;
I	dare to think of thee forever fixed
In that sufficiency of silent thought	!
Whereby the head just droops upon its stem,	!
A lily-weight of loveliness too pure To let the bold sun look within its eoulr
*	*	*	Something	sole . .	:	r	.	j
And central to this exquisite device	j
Of cypress, ilex, and the circuit grace	j
Of pure penteltc stone. '	|

HE other volume of Mr. Lewis’s poems, the “ Ways of Verse,” is an expression of idyllic English life in field and lane and by the hearth. In Mens Sacra ” one feels a rare intimacy with nature, In comprehension of what the poet calls the " good gospel of the morn and other poems betray the exquisite sensitiveness which gives that atmos-pliere of innermost poetry foreign to startling phrase or metaphor.
Some of these poems are finely dramatic, showing the hand practiced in the remarkable play of M Gln-evra,” published a year or two ago. Many of them are tender love poems:
For I will see thee live in all things fair;
And for the wistful view shall never fail The rendering how Of lip and brow,
The course and mystery of that gathered hair. *******
And all the Bilent intercourse to be.
With rock or stream, gray moor or mossy fell,
And desert shore by tone untraveled sea,
Shall of thy life things so delighted tell ^
That thus, O sure
As doth endure ,	-
Fair Earth, be thou immortal unto me.
All of these verses are sustained and strong; the poem u Light of Love,” both in beauty and treatment, exceeds the effect of Rossetti’s “ Jenny.” And where shall we find anything tenderer and sweeter than this “ Unchanged
Sweetheart, I see thee not with beauty seared.
The wrinkled ill of time's disfiguring touch;
But thine, for me, be still that trait endeared.
As ever such
To longing thought of youth and love appeared.
For me, no cloak, nor grayness of decline
Can, shrouding, hide thy soul’s dear shape eteme,
Whose light within—my lamp—shall ever shine,
Must ever burn
And bear me forth, and bring me faith divine, ■ Among father of the verses in this very unpretentious little volume—which, by the way, the poet has printed with his own hand—** The Wolf Boy,” ** The Pyre,” and “ Speak, Speak! ** show a new arid great, if not thoroughly trained, power; while ** Gethsem-ane,” ** The Prophet,” " The Awakening,” and others as well are of deep philosophic thought, and “ Where Silence Was ” and “ The Harvest Moon w are surcharged with loveliness. Indeed, the one fault of the poet, if it is a fault, is that he sees more beauty than, with the great reserve of his verse and his feeling, and a not altogether flexible technique, he is able to -express.
