Pictures of Authors
ffeto York Times Saturday Rcvicto of Books: To-day I received the monthly list of a certain publisher. In it I find fourteen portraits of authors whose works are published by this company. A study of them and the remembrance of the two portraits, of Marie Corelli and W. W. Jacobs, which you printed, make me wonder if it Is fair j to the subjects to print their portraits.
; * The picture of Mr. Jacobs made him look like a cold boiled owl—any one who doubts need but refer to your files; that of Miss Corelli—was it Miss Corelli? It looked like a mature girl, while Miss Corelli, I am told, looks like a great deal more than that. Now, as to the baker’s dozen and one of the publisher. The women come out pretty well; one of them, a would-be actress, I think, has the paint on too thickly, but that is :by the way. The men, however, are anything but prepossessing. Most of them—all but one of the eight—are posing most offensively—as if they were actors, without the excuse of being actors. Mr. E. V. Lucas has an unpleasant hang-dog smirk; Mr. A. C. Benson has a parson's grin on; Mr. W. B. Yeats looks up from a poem that will convulse the world; Mr. John Luther Long Is on very good terms with himself.

Tnank goodness, however, none of the fourteen, man or woman, has a cigarette. (1 knew a young man who gave up a promising caieer as a writer of novels because he would not be photographed with a cigarette between his fingeis, as his publishers assured him was necessary for his success. If the cigarette has gone out, however, he may lemrn—to pose, 1 imagine.) iiut the gi'OJp is posing: there is nothing natural about the men, and about some of the women.
Now it may be interesting lo see what v.*i-iL.*rs look iiUe; but Is not the desire to see thoir pictures wholly morbid? is it one that should be encouragedV Is it good business? I. for one. feel as if 1 should never want to read another Jacobs story, or another one by *' Jack " London, or by Hewlett or Eenson. Do other readers feel like me? (By the way, I take it that i shall read their hooks; but it wui be against my better inclination^.)
