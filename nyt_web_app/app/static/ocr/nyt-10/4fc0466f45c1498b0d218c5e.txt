Dr. Geer's Volume on Our Continental ^rowth- ln “ The History -: of North America.** ^
HIS is \he history of a movement, not of a period or an event. Indeed, the name is not perfectly descriptive of tho subject, and the reader who consults this volume for a detailed and lengthy account of the acquisition of Louisiana will .be’disappointed. What Dr. Geer attempts to do is to write the history of the trans-Alleghany region,- and then show how we acquired Louisiana and finally to. trace the subsequent history of that vast country. That is to say, his subject is the continental expansion of the United States, with the exception of Texas, the Mexican cession, and the Oregon region. For some unexplained reason, probably because the subject Is reserved for a future volume in the history of North America, nothing is satd about Missouri. Kansas, too, Is slighted, possibly for the same reason. The earlier chapters relate the history of the country between the Alle-ghanies and the Mississippi, the territories northwest and south of the Ohio.
The Louisiana purchase itself is taken up in Chapter VI. It is intimately connected with the history of the trans-Alleghany country, the most Important subject of whose history was the free navigation of the Mississippi. The purpose of President Jefferson in beginning those negotiations that finally led to the acquisition by the United States of the vast country between the Mississippi and the Kockies was merely to control the mouth of the river and so its navigation. Dr. Geer points out that at present the control of the country west of the Mississippi is of greater importance than the navigation of the river. This country cannot be said to have been obtained through the skill of Jefferson or the diplomacy of Livingston^ and Monroe. Livingston suggested selling it to some friendly power. None of them realized its immense importance to the United States. “ Napoleon,” says Dr. Geer, “ really forced this Louisiana region upon them. * • * They took it because they could not get what they wanted without it." Considerable attention is given to the political and constitutional aspects of the purchase, and Napoleon's motives for selling Louisiana are explained.
DR. GEER takes up with curc the history oj^.thQ-jState^ which now form the great 'No"rtV\vest',^^a - comes down to the admission of Montana in 18S9. He shows the -effccts of European, particularly the German, immigration to this region. His conclusions are: “Judging from the past and from the work which is going on at present, the conclusion mu3t be reached that the Northwest will become as thoroughly American as any part of the nation, and in the future the typical American may not be the descendant of the English Puritan or Cavalier, but one whose parents came later from Central or Northern Europe/’

THE praise we have given earlier volumes of this series for their illus~ trations must be accorded to this volume as well. Particularly interesting is the frontispiece, a water color fac simile after a painting of Jefferson as an old man. The great fault with the book 15 common to all the volumes of this series, and renders the author’s researches almost valueless as authority. Not a single reference is given. In a few Instances the context makes it clear whence the author has derived his information, but in most cases there is no way of telling. This is a crying defect in a historical work that has any serious purpose.
