CHILDREN'S BOOKS.
Those for Girls and Those for Boys r A Selection of Hoys* Books.
n. v
(HERE Is an Interesting difference between the boys* and the girls* books which Is noticeable at the holiday season, when they appear in f.	- large numbers and can be
compared. If the supply of books, as of other things. Is ‘ supposed to meet the demand, then boys are the greatest readers, for their books outnum^ * ber those -written especially for girls’ reading at least 6 to 1. But while the boys have quantity, the girls are more likely to have Quality In their books. There has been a great change In books for girls within the last twenty, or say thirty, years, If one wishes to look back so far. At that time the girls* books that were worth reading were few. They were of the goody-goody order, with little sense or character, and inordinately dull. Miss Alcott’s books were appearing, but they were exceptional. Girls who looked for life interest in the stories they read took their brothers* Oliver Optics, and were quite well enough satisfied, many of them.	^
But there was a wide field to cover for the girls, particularly as their lives
*
broadened with school and college life, and many good writers have come to the fore to give them books of their own and they have proved to be very good books. They are human books telling about girls as they really are, doing the things girls would be likely to do in a natural way—real studies of human nature. That Is where tney differ from a
good proportion of the boys’ books, and why there are fewer of them. It requires a writer with some degree of ability to write a human nature story, and almost any one once getting the recipe could write the average boy’s book of adventure.
These adventure stories have changed but little. There Is a little more realism / in the setting than in the earlier books, but otherwise there is the same youthful hero doing impossible acts of heroism and bravery, and always coming out alive, well, and entirely successful from the most difficult undertakings. Make a casual study of the geography, climate, natural conditions and animals of a country, consider the most difficult and dangerous things that could be done in it; give the boy hero every good moral, mental, and physical quality and set him to work in the dangerous situations, thwarted perhaps by a few full-grown villains whom he always outwits, and there is the average boy’s story of yesterday, to-day. and probably to-morrow.
With these books there are others based on different historical events, with fewer impossible adventures, but always with sufficient thrills; there are the lives of great men written down to young readers or with histories o£- their boyhood days Improved with the aid of imagination and the probabilities of the times, and then there are the most human of the boys’ books, those giving stories of school life, camping out stories, and other things which might happen to any boy.

ONE of these latter books for this year, and one which all boys will like, is “ The Rival Campers,” by Ruel P. Smith. (L. C. Page & Co. Boston. $1-50.) It is a large book ol 3S8 pages, and as full of adventures as the most enthusiastic boy could desire. They come a little faster, perhaps, than they would in the life of the average boy, but any of them might happen, though burglars -in the haunted house are not common, and that is one of the most exciting parts of the story. There are interesting times in camp, adventures on the water, and hairbreadth escapes that not many mothers would enjoy for their boys, but it is a wholesome story, and Henry Bums, who is its hero, with his friend Jack Ha-vey, is presented with a yacht at the last, and what better end could a book have?	*
'	41 The Young McKinley,*• by Hezekiah
Butterworth, (Appleton, $1.50.) Is a history of the days in the early part of the nineteenth century on the Western Reserve of Ohio and the school da:*s of the late President. The greater part of the story is of actual events and the incidental characters are types of the time and place. The anecdotes of the childhood and youth of McKinley were gather* : from old schoolmates and friends. Om of these is particularly interesting, because Santa Anna, the school teachei who taught the little William his alphabet, encouraged him, when he found learn Ing hard, by saying; “ Never mind, now you may be President yet! ’’ The childrei thought it a joke when It was told to ;
^stupid little boy, but''later 'they remembered It.	T	^	^	~
An Interesting book, not large, and with many Illustrations, Is the1 ** Boys Who became Famous Men,” by Harriet Pearl Skinner, Illustrated by Sears Gallagher, (Little, Brown & Co., $1.) There are stories of eight of these boys—artists, musicians, and writers—Giotto, Bacb* Byron, Gainsborough, ^Handel, Coleridge, Can ova, and* Chopin.

pleasing.	•	■	.

There are marvelous .escapes, mysterious adventures in the ** Chamber'of the Dead Kings,” the Champion Black Catapult takes a big bear in his most approved fashion, with his head, and the treasure for which much Is risked is too interesting to make it wise to spoil the story by telling about it. The book is illustrated.	-
PINKEY Perkins, Just a Boy," by Capt. Harold Hammond, United . States Army, (the Century Company, $1.50,) is a little different from most boys1 books. Pinkey starts in at the very beginning with an M affinity,*’ who continues to be the chief object of his concern to the last chapter. He is so much concerned aboht the young lady that he gives up a long-desired air gun to get the Affinity, whose name Is Hattie Warren, a big valentine, Pinkey Is a bad boy in many ways. He does not always behave in school just as he should, though when he gets " 27 licks with the ruler ** he takes it without a wink; he hasjiis head clipped without asking his mother, distributes a couple of hundred free tickets to a show in town, which is not quite as bad really as it sounds, and is generally what he should not be. He is never monotonous, however, and there are many pictures by George Varlan to show exactly how FInkey looks.
As good as a story is “ The Boy Lincoln/’ by William O. Stoddard, (Appleton, $1-50.) Mr. Stoddard has lived in the early days of Lincoln, and his descriptions are graphic.

Abraham Lincoln his hand and pen he will be Good but god knows When.
