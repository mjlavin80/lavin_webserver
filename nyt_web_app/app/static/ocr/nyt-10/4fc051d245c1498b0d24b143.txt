AHERO, says Mr. Thompson-Seton in his preface, “ is an Individual of unusual gifts or achievements." And granting that definition, ho has every right to call his nice animal3 heroes.
The first nice animal (though the surroundings seem to fit that adjective sin-j guhirly ill) Is a slum cat. Pour of the nine lives of the cat are related. In the I first life she was a slum cat merely. In I the second life she was fattened by a nrifi'cy fancier, became a “ Royal An-j :ii<-sian,” and won the blue ribbon at a cat show. In the third life she lived with a rich family, slept daily upon silk 1 cushions, and was miserable. In the | fourth she returned on her four paws to her slum—but	lived	there	in a new
model tenement or some such place, The 1 second of Mr. Seton’s nicc animals is a homing pigeon nam^d Arnaux—a pigeon who, being liberated from a ship in dis-! tress, traveled “ two hundred and ten
miles in fog over sea !n four Tiours and forty minutes.”
Mr. Seton	has much to	eay of	what
may b<? called the sentimental aspects and the higher life M of eats and pig; copfi, and some very severe things to say | of men with guns who shoot pigeons laden with the message for the doctor. Though	his	Arnaux pigeon also	bears
stock quotations/ sometimes—and beats tlie wire. It is not necessary to say much more abcut Mr. Seton's nice ani-1 mala— the dog called Snap—who came from an old college chum in a box marked ** dangerous ”—the wolves, the lynx, and the rest—all bear the stamp of their creator,	and	all are more	or less	entertaining.	As	for the book,	it is rather a
! pleasant appearing book, with a rubricked title page and many of tlie two hundred drawings such as to charm tho eye and express a good deal of the real animal-more, perhaps, than the text, though that is a matter upon which people differ too widely for us to dogmatize.
