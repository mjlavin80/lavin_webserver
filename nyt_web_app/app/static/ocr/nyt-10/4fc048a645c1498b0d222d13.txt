books are a mass of valuable matter, roughly piled in separate heaps. \\ hat is in the heaps is all good, but not all equally good, and the attempt at the arrangement of material is only partial. The result is a work containing much of interest and importance, and little that is trivial in itself; yet all so badly arranged that the reader has to pick and choose to find what he wants. He will not find it elsewhere, however, at all events in English; so he must give thanks for the index in each volume.
The first volume deals with Provence under the Greeks and Romans. Mr. Cook writes entertainingly of the traces of Marius in Provence. He follows his march, camp by camp, through the country until he met the Teutons and the Ambrons on the bank of the Lar—never mind when; Mr. Cook does not. For nearly eighteen centuries, until 1703, the villagers of Pertuis on each 24th of April (the traditional date of the battle) used to go in procession to the Hill of Victory, singing and dancing; and in the morning the Cur£ of Vauvenargues celebrated mass. In other ways, too, as Mr, Cook points out, Marius has become almost the patron saint of a part of Provence. Three statues at Les Baux, originally effigies of Marius, his wife. Julia, and his attendant prophetess, Martha the Syrian, have been metamorphosed into images of
I^es Trois Maries *'—the Virgin, Mary Magdalene. and Mary the Sister of Lazarus! Marius himself disappears in the change. Around his victory over the barbarians and the historical facts which attended it have been built up a mass of beautiful and harmless legends,

of flower. The scent of roses and syringa is in all the air.
Nostradamus is the most famous child of this beautiful place: and Mr. Cook continues his digression from the account of Roman 1’rovencc to tell us about that
famous adept in the black art. In time, however, we get back to Augustus and his successors and, in a note, hear about Greek and Roman traveling theatrical companies and brotherhoods of actors, one of which was established at Arles, in Provence; they lasted until the sixth century, when eccleslasticism ended their existence. Writing of the famous Maison Carrie at NImes, Mr. Cook says:
It is just its subtle divergencies from mathematical exactness which makes the Parthenon so beautiful and so unapproachable. It is just because the Madeleine in Paris is a strictly mathematical enlargement of the Maison Carrie that the modern building is so dull and unsuccessful.
This fact leads into a discussion of the principles of Greek architecture, involving delicate differences, curves in construction, intentional deviations from exactness—with a sudden return to the history of the Maison Carrie. This was not a temple to Caesar, says Mr. Cook. It was the Hotel de Ville from about 1050 | to 1540; then a private bouse, then a stable; in 1672 it became a church, but in j 1789 was turned into a granary and mar- j ket. In 1823 it was made a museum, and is now under the care of the State. Dis- | cussing the distribution of “ panem et circences" through Provence, Mr. Cook tells of shows lasting three days and nights; " there was scarcely any pause | between one item of the entertainment l and the next." Evidently these were the j original continuous performances. A short consideration of the relative merits of modern football and ancient gladiatorial games Is ended by Mr. Cook with a decision favorable to the latter.
Volume XI. of the account of Provence is no less discursive than the first, and j no less interesting in the same discursive way. It covers the period from about , the time of Charlemagne, say. 900 A- I
D., to the death of the cood King R£n€ In 1480, with excursions back to Greek, I Roman, and Teutonic days and forward j to modern times. It opens with a description of what the author calls the Alyscamps—be Is not consistent in his use of French and English names—the "'Necropolis of Gaul." Original Jy the " Campi Elysii *’ of Arles, it is now a long road, flanked by tombs; in the twelfth century', Mr. Cook writes, M it , was sufficient to place the corpse in a rude coffin fashioned like a barrel and commit it to the Rhone, which brought its I
quiet charge in safety to the beach of La Roquette,” and there probably some one buried it. The plagues at Aries down to 1721 are also described.
The chapter on R£n£, the good King of Sicily, Naples, and Aragon, Count of Provence, Duke of Bar, I-orraine, and Anjou—honorary titles, most of them— discusses at some length the troubadours and their influence on French manners; Petrarch and Laura, who was a Provencal ; Aucassin and Nicolete, and, almost incidentally, King R£n£ himself. Reading' the two volumes one is impressed by an overpowering sense of ill-arranged knowledge. Mr. Cook knows his subject, but his discursiveness becomes wearisome. Ills information weighty and hard to bear. These volumes on Provence are more endurable than his book on Rouen, which simply is duIL They ought to be far better than they are, however.
We have noted the value of the index in each volume; it must be remarked that there is no map of any value in either, and that the author expects the reader to know what he calls “ t^e lie of the land," without the adventitious assistance of geography.
