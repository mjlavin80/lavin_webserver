on Its title page and the word '* Finis " as a colophon.	,
The same applies to a TJlble of- 15S5. Antonio Verderio's " Imagines Deorum, Qui ab. Antiquis Colebantur." bears on Its title page the Imprint, “ Lvdvni, Apvd Stephanvm Michaelem. MDLXXXI.” and as a colophon, ** Lvgduni, Excudebat Gui-chardus IulIIeron Typographus Mense Sextills, Ann. 1581.”
Jacob Carpus’s “ Human Anatomy" gives neither date nor imprint on its title page, and it has no colophon; but we ftod on the fourth page that it was published in Paris, June 14, 1530.
Even in the fifteenth century titles to books were occasionally printed on the first page, for among-the writer’s treasures is an illuminate* black-letter embossed vellum-bound folio of the works of Avicenna, having the title printed in red Ink occupying a small space at the upper left hand corner of the first page, the remainder of the page being occupied by the text of the work in two closely printed black-letter columns, except that the page Is beautifully illuminated with a large and flourishing initial letter at the top and a handsspnfe floral vignette at the bottom of the page, executed in gold and colors as bright as when applied by the patient artist’s brush more than four centuries ago. The' imprint and date line ■Is found at tho end of the solid text, and informs us that it was printed in "Venice In I486. This Is followed, after eighteen pages of table of contents, &c., Cy the word “ Finis *’ as a colophon.
An example of printing before the day of title pages is a tall folio frhlch has absolutely no indication at the beginning of what the - work might be. The first line of the first page starting from the margin without even the usual indentation marking . the commencement or clauses. The page is solid to the bottom. The colophon is as follows:
Absolutum opus epistolarium. C. - Plinii Junioris Neapoli.

Modem printers are not giving us the Elaborate title pages of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but there is as much variety in them as those furnished by the printers of the early examples quoted, ■ as shown by the three latest acquisitions of the writer’s library:
No. 1 has no date given on the title page, or anywhere else in the book, and has for a colophon the words, " The End."
No. 2. has a title page giving publisher and date; and has for a colophon, Printed by T------ and S-----s, E----h." Dashes
; indicate letters omitted by the writer, as be has no idea of advertising publishers
unless he is paid for it.
No. 3 gives all the particulars on the title page and has the printer’s device, repeated from the title page, as a colophon.	J*

*	Correspondents Oct. 7 and 14 take exception to the statement made in your review of J. Herbert Slater’s manual,
“ How to Collect Books," that “ the first title page tv as printed in 1740.’*	i
This is obviously a misprint, for title pages were in regular use for more than ;	two centuries before the date given in
!	The New York Times Book Review as
j	printed. The writer is of the opinion that
■	books without title pages of a date later
than J 524 are very rare. In his little country library there are no less than thirty volumes published between the beginning of the sixteenth century and _	1740, all of which have title pages, some
of them of elaborate and beautiful design. A few examples from the collection will illustrate the great variety of title pages and colophons used during that period.
A fair type is found in a small black letter quarto volume of “ Mundinus De Omnibus Corporis Interioribus Membrls Anathomia," with a picture of an eviscerated female surrounded by the zodiacal emblems, similar to that found in the annual editions of the Farmer’s Almanac. This picture is repeated on the last page as a colophon with the legend: *' Im- 1 pressis Argentori Martinus Fiach Anno Domini MDIII.”
In a beautiful vellum-bound copy of Celsus, printed in 1528, the Aldine mark of an anchor entwined by a dolphin is like the zodiacal emblem of the former example, repeated both on the title page and as a colophon. In this example, however, the publishers’ imprintT with the date. Is found on the page preceding the colophon.
A folio work on distillation has a picture on the title page Illustrating the manufacture of “ Aqua Vitae,” but we have to turn to the colophon to learn that the book was published at Strasburg in 1517.
A vellum-bound duodecimo on mineralogy, published at Cologne in 1559, gives all the particulars of title and publication
