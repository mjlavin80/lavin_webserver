The “ Pioneers of Modern Education ’’ in the seventeenth century are considered by Prof. John W. Adamson in his volume which is being added by the Macmillan Company to the series of Contributions to the History of Education In Mediaeval and Modern Europe, edited by Prof. W. H. Woodward. Chapters are devoted to Comenius, Samuel Hartlib, John Brinsley, Milton, Ratke, William Petty, Montaigne, St. Jean-Baptiste de la Salle, A.
H.	Francke, and others. *‘ As a foil to the ideals of education or of Instruction presented by the innovators," writes the author, “ the actual practice of the seventeenth century schoolroom, reformed or unreformed, is described on the authority of those who knew it at first hand." A full index, a bibliography, and tables of dates, &.c., have been added.
