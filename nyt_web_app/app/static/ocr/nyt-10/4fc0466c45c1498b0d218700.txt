Book Collecting.
FTcuj TorJi Times Saturday Review of Books:
I read with much interest your article on " Book Collecting ’* Sept, 23. In referring to J. Herbert Slater’s manual “ How to Collect Books” you say: “The first title page, however, was printed in 1740 for Arnold ther Hoerner's * Sermo ad po~ P'jlum predlcabillo.’ *' Now, I have a volume with a title page printed by J. Ma-cock for John Martyn at the Bell in St. Paul’s Churchyard in 1675. This volume, “ Towerson on the Decalogue/' is 8 by 12 Inches, and is beautifully printed on paper watermarked with a fool’s cap and bells. The epistle dedicatory is "To the most Reverend Father in God Gilbert, by divine providence Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, &c., &c.” This, ot course, is Dr. Gilbert Sheldon, who founded the Sheldonian Theatre at Oxford in 16G9, the architect of which was ** that incomparable genius ’* Sir Christopher Wren, whose immortal work—St. Paul’s Cathedral—was begun the very year in which part of this book was printed.
I might add that this book, being divided into two parts, has two title pages—the first bearing the date 1676 and the second 1675.	a.	M.	R.
