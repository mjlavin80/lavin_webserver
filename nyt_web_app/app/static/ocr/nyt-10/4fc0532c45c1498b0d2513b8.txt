NEW book that is sure tc	i
be widely read is " The Reign of Gilt," by the nov-	;
elist, David Graham Phil-	|
lips, who is also a journal-1st	of	the	younger school and has	i
trained himself to view life, when need be, from the alarmist's point of view. Mr. Phillip?, to be sure, is not, at heart, an alarmist. He does not really believe,	we are confident, that the
country is going to the dogs. Developing democracy will find the means of --its own salvation. But he has worked himself up into a fine mood of frenzy to describe the vanities and extravagances of this vain and extravagant age, and liis det riptions are certainly eloquent and impressive* Mr. Phillips's book, which is published by James Pott & Co., is one of the three subjects of an article on the condemnation of Neu York society in recent literature, which will appear to-morrow in the Sunday edition of The New York Times. The other books treated of in this article are “ The House of Mirth." by Mrs. Wharton, and ” Our Best Society,” by an anonymous writer, about both of which we have already had much to say in The New Yohk Times Sati'koay Review of Books.
FOLKS still insist, after^Dr. Johnson, tiiai the Scotch/have no sense of humor, though we all know that worth^'Samuel was joking in his ponderous way when he said so. The truth must be that the Scotch sense of humor is so strong that it frequently runs away with the Scotchman. Here is a Glasgow journalist, for instance, writing fmni London to his newspaper about the vanished literary associa^ tions of Fleet Street. It is an old theme, to be sure, but good enough for once in a while. Fleet Street has few literary associations these days. Our Scotch writer found none to speak of, imthing to remind him of literary glory except ” Hall ('nine dodging reporters.” If that phrase does not indicate that Ihe Scotchman’s sense of humor ran away with him. what does it indicate?
THE appearance, in its neat new dress, uniform with the new Dodd, Mead & Co. edition of the novelist's works, of Anthony Troliope’s fascinating Autobiography." will set many of us again to reading it. One who begins it finds that he must persist with it to the end. *' More interesting than a novel ’* is a phrase often written in praise of it since its publication in 1N83:	it is. indeed, more delightful
and absorbing than any of its author's novels, in our opinion, though we still cherish warmly “ Framley Parsonage *’ and ‘‘ Orley Farm.” Thackeray, who declared he always went to sleep on a novel after dinner, finished the first volume of “ The Three Clerks ” at a sitting and then bounded into the drawing room and astonished his family by demanding the second. Hawthorne dropped into hyperbole In praise of Trollope's novels—and not the best of them that were yet to come when Hawthorne died. But neither of these knew his autobiography, a marvel of frank revelation, so sincere, so vivacious, so
THERE are, however, two chapters in the book which seem greatly out of date and which were never illuminating. The charm of Trollope's self-revelation lies in its perfect frankness, un marred alike by malice or hope of favor. He wrote expressly for posthumous publication, and left the date of that publication to the discretion of his son. But in his purely academic mood Trollope was as artificial as we all are in that mood. His limitations as a critic and as a student of literature are sharply defined in bis chapter on the development of the English novel and the work of the English novelists of his hour. His view of the scope of the novel is shown to be exceedingly narrow. His praise of Thackeray, we are forced to believe, was influenced not a little by Thackeray’s kindness to him and his relations with the greater novelist in The Comhill Magazine and the Garrick Club. For in spite of its effusiveness one does not get the idea that here was a man who really appreciated Thaqkeray. His dislike of Dickens is more easily understood than his admiration for Dickens's great rival; but his judgment of Dickens fails. His prophecy of the loss of vogue that was to be the fate of Dickens’s books was a false prophecy. A generation has passed and Dickens is more popular than ever. However, we do not depend on Trollope for literary criticism, and e\en in that he is honest, though obviously more on his guard, posing more in the chapters devoted to it than in his statements touching himself and his work.
POOK SHAKESPEARE. Dr. Thomas Carter, who some years ago w’rote a book to prove that he was a Puritan, C* Shakespeare, Puritan and Ilofusani,**) has now written another to prove the poet's “wide knowledge and use of the Scriptures." This •* proof ” occupies nearly 500 pages, large octavo, and is calculated to leave the sympathetic reader of Shakespeare cold. All English boys, in Shakespeare's time, went to Church and heard the English Psalter (Henry VIII.'s vei-sicn) read as well as passages from the Cranmer and the Bishop's Bible. The King James version whs not published until Shakespeare’s work was all or nearly all done. Yet Dr. Carter actually finds the influence of readings in the King James version in Shakespeare’s plays, as well as that of the Genevan Bible, which was discountenanced by the Church of England. He has made a very careful study, to be sure, and some of it will be of use to the literary student, if the student have the sense and courage not to lot the author's enthusiasm carry him too far afield. Dr. Fumivall years ago decided, in his own mind, that “ Shakespeare was saturated with the Bible story.” Sidney Lee, in his wise moderation, holds that the poet’s knowledge of the Scriptures was not larger than he might have acquired, as man and boy, by hearing them read in Church. Dr. Carter's “ Shakespeare and the Holy Scripture” is published here by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. To say the best for it, it is a curious book and a monument of industry.
NEW books in the Century Company’s dainty Thumbnail Series, with stamped leather covers, and each printed in the best manner of the De Yinne Press, are “ Washington,” “ The Chimes,” Dickens’s Christmas story, and the “ Sonnets from the Portuguese.” The first contains the late Mr. Lecky’s eloquently expressed appreciation of Washington from his ‘‘ History of England in the Eighteenth Century”; the “Farewell Address," the address to his officers in March, 17S3; his circular letter to the Governors, Washington's farewell orders to
*he army/ and his inaugural address. Air. Lecky’s 1 estimate is calmly dls-; passionate an1 presents a view of i the man who is still foremost in the Americkn mind of which we may all wc*l be proud. The little j volume of Mrs. Browningr*s love son-
I nets has for an introduction that
i l ^
i chaxming paper by Richard Watson j Glider in the October Century of which j we spoke a fortnight since. The vol-I ume contains, besides the sonnets, the ; six lyrics of Mrs. Browning which Mr. Gilder includes in the immortal singing of the Brownings* romance, namely, “ Life and Love,” "A Denial,” Proof and Disproof,” “ Question and Answer,” " Inclusions,” and ** Insufficiency and three little poems by Robert Browning, ” One Word More,” -V Prospice,” and “O Lyric Love.”
EVERY now and then Mr. Charles Battell Loomis writes a book. He can perform such work easily. His newest book is entitled ” I’v^ Been Thinking,” and although the contents do not seem to be the result of any great intellectual struggle, the title serves as well as another would. Mr, Loomis explains that he felt the need of a book one could put down quickly, and^stop reading at any time, and not finding such a book accessible decided to write it himself. We fancy he has succeeded and that this is just the kind of a book one can most easily stop reading. But there is always something of a market for humorous ” snippets," and Mr. Loomis is endow'ed with humor of a good quality. Multimillionaires and “ graft,” the danger of motor cars, marriage and divorce, careless letter writing, girls* voices and the need of filing them early in life, breakfast food, mechanical piano players, cowardice, domestic economy, are a very few of Mr. Loomis’s subjects. He has his brief say of many things, and James Pott & Co. publish his book.
