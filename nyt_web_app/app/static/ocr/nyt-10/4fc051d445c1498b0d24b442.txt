MEXICAN BIK0S, '
A Capital Book by the Chief Ornithologist of the Bronx Zoological Gardens.*
1IVDS for bird lovers. These two bird lovers found such an immense number and variety of what they sought in Mexico, and what they found is*chron-i such breathless rapid-detailed fullness, that :ely little else of Mexico and its inhabitants emerges upon their pages. But as Mexicans are no doubt, in some respects at least, better known than Mexican birds to their neighbors on the north, this record of abundant and keen observations will be very welcome, especially to those who follow the birds and their liabits. The number of those who do is continually increasing. They will be interested in the endless stories of searching and finding, of patience rewarded, of bird manners and customs, and anecdotes of bird life that are here given. There are descriptions of many species that are unknown to the north; and to facilitate a close study of what he records, the author has given in an ap-
*	pendix a list of all the birds he met with, with their scientific names and a brief description of their appearance and habits. Mammals were not the chief object of the attention of these travelers, but they saw and observed a good many; and of these there is also a list. Tho whole story is told with much good humor and with evident enthusiasm.
But the interest of the book is not wholly ornithological. There are some entertaining descriptions of the life the bird seekers lived, the people they met, the adventures they had. They penetrated far into the interior, by the roughest kind of " roughing it," reaching even the Pacific Coast, and traveling fearlessly, a man and his wife, with their camping outfit. They found no enemies, few “bad men”; such as there were they disarmed by kindness, as the supposititious bandit, fairly bristling with revolvers and knives, whose two little children they had fed In their tent. Whereupon his robber’s heart was softened, and he helped them in finding certain animals and birds of which Lhey were in search, and in other j ways. Then there was an old Aztec , cowherd who knew no Spanish, and ' greeted them with words sounding ex- | actly like “ ping-pong racket,*’ the return of which in kind afforded him the greatest delight, He gained infinite ^ pleasure also from being spoken to in any anti all languages, of which he understood no word. They had in their service at one time a Mexican boy full of the lore of wild things, who had the ' keenest scent of any human being they had ever seen. " With a single sniff he could invariably tell whether the inhab- 1 itant of an armadillo's burrow was at 1 home or not.*’ From him they learned the singularly musical yodel which the I Mexican Indian uses in attracting the curiosity of deer and other animals.
The travelers gained tho high esteem and rcspcct of some of the poor Mexicans with whom they encamped, and their medicine chest and bottles of formaline established for them the reputation of being infallible physicians. With pitiful faith sick children were brought to diem to cure. A lack of the j knowledge of cleanliness is one of the chief trouhlf-s of these people, and '* a carload of antiseptics and the doetrine of cleanliness " should precede any missionary erfort among them. Says Mr. Beebe:
One bright young fellow whom X tried to cure was literacy dying of dirt. When taken sick, the only treatment which his family advised was complete abstinence from the use of water! Kis food in the hottest weather was fried beans, pork, and tortillas. Indeed, the staple food of the people the whole year round is frijoles (fried beans) and tortillas—hard, flat, leathery cakes made of ground corn and water.
The poor Mexicans were hospitable and kind; and a similar hospitality was extended by the well-to-do farmers. Of the life in the towns there are two sides. There is the patience-trying bartering and shiftlessness, the "mafiana”; unpleasant sights, filth, squalor, and rags in the daytime. But night and the tropical moonlight change it all,

and especially; the music- gives a romantic tinge to the evening existence.
Every native is an ‘ innate lover of music. The Spanish melodies of the skillful. musicians , touch one of the deepest chords in the hearts of the Mexicans and arouse in the usually stolid faces an enjoyment and appreciation -which make them seem a different race of people.
There is a useful and detailed chapter on “ How We Did It,” that gives much excellent advice as to taking this trip far from the beaten paths. Sup; plies and clothing necessary for a man and a woman—and the woman must be prepared to put up with small discom-i forts—are enumerated, with the warning that the woman camper in Mexico ; must be willing to ride cross saddle, though it is not the custom of the country. A revolver is also desirable,
: though not the usual wear of ladies in Mexico. A Mexican woman w*ill often take a pipe from her mouth to express shock and surprise at a sefiorita riding cross saddle, and everybody will invariably offer her cigarettes. Camping in Mexico, if it is. undertaken In the spirit of these two intrepid travelers, is the pure joy of life, with much to charm and interest and to amuse those with a sense of humor.
