Ayi- Attempt to Aggrandize the Cheerful' Princess Who Was the Mother of . Two Russian Ettijifirors,^
[HE mother ot Czflrsr^ws- the Princess; Dorothea, of Wflr-temb erg, niece ot Charles Eugene of that- Grand Duchy. She was torn^in 1750, and on Oct. 1JV was married to the Grand Duke Paul ot Russia, son of Catherine IX. " the Great,” who had usurped his throne and thereafter kept background' until her death,	,	.

toff, himself of German descent; ■ it saye Peter the Great to Russia, hut^died out to the male ltoe to 1T27- Elisabeth daughter of Peter the Great, then seized the throne. She kept ft folf twenty-one years, and was succeeded by a ™Ph°™’ who was soon put to death when his wife ascended the throne, Catherine the Great Her liaisons were countless: the -leo-natra” or •• Semiramis” of the North was the best name her admirers could give her. Paul, whom Dorothea married. was her son; historians affree with Catherine’s husband that Paul was th of Prince Orloff, one ot Catherine’s lov-0j*g
Although Dorothea’s grandfather Lad become a Roman Catholic, herfmhtr and brothers were Lutherans. She an her sisters, however. '• though instructed in region. were members of no ch’Jrch. This plan was adopted In view of their marriages, that they might adopt the beliefs ot their future husbands.” For this reason Dorothea did not have to abjure and curse her former religion when she -became an Orthodox Catholic and married Paul, in 1776. but could take her new name of Marie Feodorowna without even a royal pang of conscience.
Catherine of Russia disliked and distrusted her son. who with his whe spent most of his time in retirement at Gatschlna. Their first child was born in December, ITU, ana was Uapttaed Sex-ander. A second son, bom in May. 17(0. was christened Constantine. But the Empress would not let her hated son aild his wife bring up the children; she took them herself, coinpiled a “ Grandmother’s ABC” and the “ Alexander-Constantine Library " for their use, and even devised' their baby clothes. This was one of their costumes, from her own description: ^
Alt the things are sewn together and put on in one piece, and the garment is fastened behind with two or three hooks.. There are no strings or bands, and the child is hardly aware when he is dressed. The nurses thrust in his arms and legs as they put the suit over his head, and there it is—finished.
Other royalties were pleased with this costume, and asked Catherine for the pattern—just as non-royalties do to one another nowadays, ff seeing' Is believing.
In the Summer of 17S0 Paul obtained permission from his mother to travel incognito through Europe. She hesitated long about giving permission, for she hated to have Paul near her, and equally feared his influence if out of her sight. She gave it at last, however, and the Grand Duke and his wife started out under the name of Comte and Comtesse du Nord, A full hundred pages of the less than three hundred in the book are given up to the account of their £tay in France, token chiefly from the letters and diary . of the Grand Duchess’s friend, the Baroness d’Oberkirch, who went with her as lady in waiting. The details of their trip through Austria, Poland, Italy are not | given, and almost all. dates are' equally Ignored.	1
The Court life of France was one long round of amusement. At the same time, foreign royalties seldom enjoyed it, be^ cause of the etiquette of tbe Court. “They could not sit down at table with the King and Queen, nor was any personal notice taken of them by the sovereign. Those among -them who did visit Versailles always remained incognito and took feigned names, so that their r&r.k tSiould not be called in question. Even relations of the Queen appeared at her receptions in tlvs fashion.” Being Incognito, then, the Grand Duke and his wife were abic to make the most of what they saw. And they did. They stayed at the Russian Embassy. Paul at once began to go about in disguise, visiting the Court before he made his formal appearance, and seeing and hearing much that otherwise he might not have seen or heard. At last the King and Queen received them, gave them a State dinner, a picnic at the Petit-Trianon; they went to the Gobelins tapestry factory, and “ did ” Paris much as one does it now. Then *• the rest of the royal family," as the Kaigltsh say, enter-
-	tained them lavishly, and they went constantly to the Opera, Mrs. Grant tells this' story, apropos of the Opera:	—
One evening, on returning from the Opera, M. de Beaumarchais' appeared and

The royal Dukes made much of . the Grand Duke and. his wife, who visited theT Due d’Orleans,, thevDuc de Chartres* the Prince de Conde, and many others. -...Assaying of the.day. was to the effect-that “ the lving had received the Comte du Noid aa a.friend, the-X)u2 d’Orleiins a -commoner,* the*1 Prince de /?ond£ as a sovereign,*’ At.a party-at Versailles, one1 of the ladies with the .Grand Duchess wore a .coiffure’ devised*: by M:,:Leonard, ^the chief " tonsorial artist” of the - time.
'• Rcund this lady's head was ^placed, a* number of small flat bottles, each filled with water, in which were the stems ot natural flowers wreathed in her hair. They used to declare that the effect of Spring among the powdered locks was ravishing.1* After this party, the royalties took supper with the Princesse de Lam-balle,- murdered'early in the French Revolution. Of one of the hosts of the Russian couple, the Due d'Aumont, this story appears: *’ His father was the most original and the most slovenly man In France. Once when looking at himself in a mirror, he said, 'D'Aumont, God made you a. gentleman; the Xing made you a Duke. You might do something In your turn— at least, you might gfo and shave;'
From Paris they went through the chft-, teaux country. At Muslllac, in Low.er Brittany, the party was forced to stop at a small inn. The Grand Duchess' found that <■" all the hangings and embroideries on the shrines of the Virgin for mites around had been collected and heaped on her bed.”
From France they went through Flanders and Holland, and then to the Grand Duchess’s home at Montheliard, whence they returned to Russia.	■
In 1700 the Empress died and Paul became Czar. His eldest son bad already been married by his grandmother to Princess Louise of Baden, who had received the name Elizabeth. Paul himself, during his long, "Hamlet-like relegation to obscurity, had become a changed man. "Though still full of intelligence and activity of mind, he had become eo centric almost to the point of mania,” writes Mrs. Grant; "his moments of kindness were succeeded by moments of ferocity. Anger would replace benevolence and caprice take the place of justice.” He banished Souvaroff for criticising the adoption by the army of the Prussian pigtails and buckled shoes;' and had the tongue cut out of a man accused^ of originating an epigram about him.
In 1801 Paul's rule had become unbearable, and his chief advisers decided to compel him to abdicate. Like the shillalah of fame, which was ” bent In an argument/* Paul got the worst of the discussion over his abdication; in fact, he was murdered. Alexander, his eldest son, whom Catherine had wished to place on the throne at her own death, then became Czar.
He helped defeat Napoleon, and caused the allies to enter Paris that the French nation might understand that the Napoleonic rule had ended. Like his father, he became more or less of a monomaniac In his later years, and died in 1825 at Taganrog, on the Sea of Azov. He was succeeded by his brother, Nicholas, and in 1S28 the Empress-Mother Marie Feodorowna died.	-
Mrs. Grant strives to exalt Marie’s place in history. It is true that she .was the mother ot two sons wKo became Czars of Russia, but the title of the book implies much more than that. It Implies tnat she influenced them els Cornelia, mother of the Gracchi, Influenced her sons. As a fact, she did not. Catherine brought up Alexander, whom his mother rarely even saw, and Nicholas’s reign was but two year^ old when she died. The value of the book, or, rather, its interest, lies In the views it offers of the French Court just previous to the Revolution—and those may be had elsewhere, and in the scanty glimpses given of Russian manners in the days' of serfdom. For instance, Mrs. Grant tells of one lady of Catherine’s Court who for three years kept her hairdresser in a box in her boudoir, letting him out only that he might arrange her hair, in order that no one should learn that she wore a wig.
The author quotes in large type Napoleon’s remark:	" Scratch a Russian and
you find a Tartar,” but relegates to a footnote a much more interesting saying: " 111 betide the Russian Empire if ever it has a Czar who grows a beard.” The present Czar grows a beard.
