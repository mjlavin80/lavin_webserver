the LABOR MOVEMENT IN AMERICA-
By RichorOl’ Tv Elly. New- edition, revised Brnfl. enlarged- l2mo. Pp. xvl.r399. New York: The Macmillan Company. ?1.26.
Notwithstanding the statement on tbe title.pagc;?tbe.author.In.a.prefatory note affirms that the. present re-issue of his hook, has not undergone revision, although ! some new matter has been added in the ! form of an appendix. The book was first 1 published in 1886. and the labor movement in this country has gone so considerable a distance and taken on so many new manifestations that only a thorough revision could represent tjie present situation and the recent history of it/ This Dr. Ely intimates that he is at work on; but it will take some time to complete, on account of the extent of the field to be covered. Yet the book is in continuous demand, and to meet this demand the Macmillan Company has undertaken the present reprint.
Tli©re are two chief purposes which the author says he had in mind in writing the book—to show that the material furnished to the historian by the movements of the laboring classes in America is interesting, instructive, and . withal not . devoid of the pathetic and picturesque, and to convince his readers of the vastness of our present opportunities, These, both seem rather patent, not requiring argument. But fortunately Dr, Ely, in accomplishing these pur, poses, produced a book that has much of value- in niany directions of economic study not only in Its historical features, but in its present and; practical bearing on immediate problems. Dr. Ely is an | ardent believer in trades unions; and he believes—or did nineteen years ago—that they are playing a rOle in the history of civilization that can scarcely he over-( estimated, among the foremost of educa-, tionai agencies, counteracting the stupe-fylng influences of the modern system of division of labor and elevating large I classes of people who can be reached in j no other manner. Whether he could still j say that while workingmen in organization have been guilty of violence, most 1 ot_ those ' who transgress, the laws are I outside of the organisations; that the sur-9 render of personal liberty is little more
than a fiction in the .case, of 'any well-managed labor organization, or that the
*	leaders of -trades unions are as a rule | far more conservative than the mass of their followers, not urging organized tabor on, but trying to hold it back, would be interesting to know.
His representation of the power of the
I Social Democratic Party shows it to be
comparatively strong, with a tendency to
increase, which, he says, is not to excite
alarm, but to call attention to the nature
of forces now at work. He has a chapter
devoted to a discussion of remedies for existing conditions which’ advances much that is true, but little that is new. Its sympathy with the side of labor is everywhere (evident, and in It Dr. Ely advocates radical measures, such as the com-" plctc - public .control of railways. But whatever may be,thought of its tendencies,1 the book: is a highly significant one, representing as it does the outcome of > investigation and study from a student’s point of view.	.
