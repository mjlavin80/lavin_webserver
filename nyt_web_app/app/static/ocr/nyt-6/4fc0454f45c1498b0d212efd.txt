Here is a story and a fable for those t modern young women who proclaim and believe that men are base creatures and cruel betrayers of, the nobler sex. The narrative relates the history of Giovanna GaZeotti, daughter of an American mother and an Italian father who was & dramatic T>oet and poetically deserted his New England wife for an actress who could interpret Ilfs dramas. Whereby Giovanna's tender youth was tainted with gall and bitterness. You find her at one of those women’s college? (like Radcliffe, say,) which are annexed to masculine universities, and you see her cherishing j toward the male students a fat grudge, partly because of her family tragedy, partly because as a body the men had opposed admitting women to university privileges. There’s a chill, stately lady of the old school for Dean, and there I are a numbertof other girls; several who I affect mannishness with whfsky and to: bacco, and one who is a spoiled, vain 8 j young thing. This last, by a somewhat ■ daring modernity, is half sister to our I Giovanna, being her father's daughter by I the actress who supplanted her mother.
Giovanna takes her college duties very seriously, of course—she is a serious young woman. After college she conceives It her duty to watch over the wayward half sister—called Guida. The two dwell In an apartment in New York, while one teaches and the other cultivates music and masculine admiration with conspicuous millinery.
You perceive in this the materials of tragedy. We leave it to the book to reveal the nature of that tragedy. Presently, however, we find Giovanna, more sombre and bitter than ever, gcvemessing in the family of a distinguished artist. The artist has the temperament of his kind, the vanity, the moral irresponsibility. Giovanna sits to him. There is also in the house a doctor-—an excellent man, wise and very strong, of the kind women love to create. A mere man might find him rather dull compTiny. And still further there is the artist’s proud and neglected wife. That’s material for a number of new developments, but the story takes Itself! to the Maine coast before the end.
The business of It all is to teach the young woman of exalted atmosphere that the artistic temperament is sometimes weakness and complacent selfishness that
Eii iV 0/^inary men are more apt to be . Idlotfc than criminal, and that when it comes to causing each other sorrow and heartaches and being cruel and all that, honors are about even between the sexes t “finauy that oid-fashfoned love and marriage thereupon ensuing are excellent I tnings.	I
