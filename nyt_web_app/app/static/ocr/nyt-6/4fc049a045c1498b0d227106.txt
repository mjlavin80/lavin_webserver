rili Company.
In this volume are two of Mrs. Green’s shorter stories. The first deals with the gruesome revenge of an old man whose brothers had broken an oath to help each other in distress. Anthony was always the weakling of the family, but when they all, nine brothers and sisters, landed as immigrants at Castle Garden their old father had extracted the oath of fealty. Later i when Anthony had married a delicate woman and found that ^ neither he nor she had the strength to earn a living, each prosperous brother and sister in turn cast him off. It was not until the delicate wife died of exhaustion and Anthony found the means of attaining wealth that his relatives clustered about him. ’ It Is a sinister tale which Mrs. Green tells of this ghastly revenge of a ghastly crime, and the impenetrable mist which surrounds the house where the revenge is worked out adds a few extra shudders to the ,tale.
' The second story in the little book deals witff the loss and finding* of a priceless ruby, the accumulation of unjust suspicions, ana the final simple solution the entire mystery.
It wouid be-interesting to know, what point in either of the stories the frontispiece illustrates, however.
