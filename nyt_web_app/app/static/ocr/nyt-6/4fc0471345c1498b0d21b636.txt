LIFE, OUT OF DOORS.
Some New Books About the Garden— Flowers and Vegetables— The Wild Fruits.*
Written for The New York Times Book Review by MABEL OSGOOD WRIGHT.
I.—THINGS OF THE EARTH.
T THE present time we have a greater need for the harmonious beauty of truth in our literature of nature than of any other quality.	.
The term realism which Is supposed to be synonymous with truth is often so distorted as to cover all viewpoints, from the unnecessarily brutal to an overheated and degenerate state of the imagination that is mistaken for real insight by tbe uninitiated. Therefore the perennial statements, from a certain class of dry-as-dust critics, to. the effect that the nature book market is overcrowded and that everything upon the subject has been said, are but mere words from those too inflexible and didactic to comprehend. For, so long as one simple truth is stated in a way to appeal to a single mind 1 as never before, the book that holds the thought is needed; while every truthful presentment of the beautiful in nature is also a contribution to the mental health of the community.
It was a wisely discriminating critic who a short time ago wrote in reference to a book of this class:
“ A contribution to the world’s sanity is of greater value than a contribution to its science/*
England is sending us daily many examples of perfect book making, but none more so than the quarto volume, “ Garden Color/’ recently issued bjr/ the Dent Press. This book is notable both from the standpoint of nature lover and bibliophile, and be--longs to that never-crowded group of garden books'*. that go‘from the hands of the reader to the book-" binder, and with margins carefully preserved arid;" i clad in the elegance of simplicity, returns to the book shelves to become a part of the literature of home. .
The text is largely cultural and the scheme of col-. • or follows the months and seasons of the year.' different author presides over each season, having -assistants in charge of specific months; thus, Mrs. E.! W. Earle tells of Spring, “ E. V. B.” of Summer;* Autumn is by Hose Kingsley, and Winter falls to the'* lot of the Hon. Vicary Gibbs—altogether a quartet notable in garden lore. Margaret H. Waterfield of;-Nackington, Canterbury, is-the maker of the sympa-' thetic water color sketches that render practical and!-< vital tlie suggestions of the text and show the posst-* ' bility of painting artistic pictures in the garden borders with living plants as well as upon canvas with f‘‘ pigments.	t
Especially pleasant is it to find as introduction to Miss WaterOeld’s preface these lines of Whit-’; man's, for, though they were originally written of nature, wild and untrammeled, they are none the less applicable to the revelations, that await the gardener whose soul looks above gain to beauty;	/
The earth never tires.
The earth is rude, silent, incomprehensible at first. Nature is rude and incomprehensible at first.
Be not discouraged, keep on, there are divine things well enveloped,
£ swear to you there are divine things more beautiful than words can telL
*' The Book of the Lily," by William Goldring, is Vol. XVII. of the series of little “Handbooks, of Practical Gardening." This series, though admirably conceived and. well executed throughout, has bi -course a limited value on this side of the water, owing < to the difference in conditions of climate and soil, yet in face of the general reservation, this ** Book of . the Lily *’ Is quite invaluable to the increasing class; of people of small means, who, having gardens of ^ moderate size, do their own thinking as well as plant- -ing, thus making it in a,.great degree possible to alter: ? thelimiting conditions themselves. _	'	-	/
The' introductory chapter oh the geography and ; ; history of the lily is particularly interesting, as well J’

t - Edith Lormg Fullerton has surely given | ;us a very worthy contribution to the ^world's sanity in her., admirably written ; book on “ How to Make a Vegetable Garden.*’ Many men have many minds, also
V	women; there ere those who revel in the y‘Ideal aspect of nature alone, caring nel-: ther to sow nor reap, while there are others who not only desire to sow and reap, but also to eat the results as a practical
; demonstration of ability, even though not led so to do by financial considerations.
-	I do not know of a more absolutely ' healthy recreation for the brain worker
of either sex than the growing of a.
V	. vegetable garden, even if it be no larger ; in size than the bit of land at the rear of
the 100x200 suburban lot. While irre-
■	spective of the amount of land available, v no more should be put under cultivation ; than the amateur gardener can mentally r and physically cope with, for once exceed i^this limit and the tyranny of the soil : can become as fierce and despotic as any
V	other form of overdoing, and dreams of weeds rampant and cutworms and potato
’ . bugs militant will sit nightly as heavily > upon the spirit as the worries of any ' purely commercial proposition wherein the ends fail to meet.	’
*^The titles of the fourteen chapters in Mrs. Fullerton's book are quite enough to infect one with the spirit of vegetable , gardening* while many of the pictures suppled by H. 33. Fullerton put a keen ; edge -upon the appetite of those who yearn for fresh, home-grown vegetables. The book begins with the Winter, sleeping time of earth, when plans may be vmade at leisure* (that is, if there is really any leisure in the strenuous outdoor life; I’ve never found any; it is all living and ' hoping and loving and years that whiz past,) and ends with a most practical planting table.
; Especially good are the sections upon leaves, roots, and seeds and seed pods that we eat, as well as the many diagrams of combination vegetable and flower gardens. For the making of these last the directions are so simple as to be impossible of misunderstanding, yet blended with such a sympathetic compre-hens Ion of the. things of the earth that it both Inspires to action and elevates the worker above the merely commonplace utilitarian viewpoint.
Buy this book, all you who have been told to " get out of doors and turn the soil/’ to turn your thoughts from some too well-worn topic that sets the brain ajar like the contfnual vibration of the haip of one string.
Office man and over-thrifty housewife, do not let the trading Instinct take the chair and ask you Impertinent questions as to whether you could not buy your lettuce, radishes, or tomatoes for far less , money than the seed, manure, and ground rent, plus your own time, will amount to, for in the country of such sordid thoughts Is located the Kingdom of Nervous Prostration.
Or if the question must bo asked, answer it Scotch fashion, by others—'* Who can set a price upon satisfaction? What financial transaction is of deeper Interest than that of personally aiding the earth to bring forth her increase; Who can appraise the worth of a night of natural sleep ^on by toil under the open sky while breathing the free air? ’*
Scripture might be well adapted in tbe rush oZ to-day to read, “ What shall it profit a man it he gain a whole trust ana lose his sleep? " for loss of natural sleep means loss of nerve, grip, and finally of the mind itself.
-	Maud Gridley Peterson is th^ author of a very satisfactory book on ** How to Know Wild Fruits.** For the. dweller or constant visitor in the country there are already books innumerable for the identification of fiower and leaf, but heretofore I do not know of a single volume fcy which wild olants may be identified by their fruits and seeds alone.
The floweTS of Summer that are in bloom during the vacation time are well known, also many of the delicate blossoms of Spring that are specially sought be-
■	cause of their early coming, but there are many plants, both herbs and shrubs, such as shadbush, Juneberry, choke cherry, the wild plums, thorns, dogwoods, viburnums; ’blueberries, v&c.» that are mado^ cpnsplcu-
\ ous for a much longer season by their
