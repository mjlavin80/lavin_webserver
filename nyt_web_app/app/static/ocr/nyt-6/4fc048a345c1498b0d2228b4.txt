DLu THOMAS WENTWORTH Higginson (who, to "be sure.
-	is not exactly , an unprejudiced witness) writes in his brief introduction to this ' volume that it-is “in almost all respects admirable, and shows much more thoroughness in dealing' with both sides than any book recently produced by a Southern white man, except that of Mr. Murphy, which Is -a modei to all Jn Its tone, though even that, I think, does here and there a little
less than justice to the negro.*’	.
The author, in the present Instance, it need hardly be said, is a negro,- or, following a designation he seems to-prefer, a colored man. The preference for this term is officially based on the notion that it includes all shades of Africanized complexion. For the same purpose Prof. Smith in his recent very interesting book adopted the word ** ne^Vold." As to Col. Higginson’s dictum quoted at the beginning, it is fair to say thus much at least in a contrary sense. _Dr. Sinclair's book gives (and pretends to give) but one side of the question—tbe side of his own race —and while he is temperate enough in general he is everywhere as much of an advocate for his side as Dr. Thomas Nelson Page is for bis. Since Col. Higginson says Dr. Page does the negro " utter injustice,” It Is not out of the way to make the point conspicuous.
Naturally the fact that Dr. Sinclair is an advocate for his own people is no manner of reflection upon him. Quite the contrary. He is an able advocate if not altogether a wise one, and his book is very readable—in some points very Impressive, though in points where to himself and those of his preconceptions (like Col. Higginson) he seems most telling he labors under a disadvantage. For he bases his case upon evidence which the other side refuses to admit and makes assumptions which they deny. For instance, when Dr. Sinclair wants to produce proof of tbe atrocity of Southern behavior Just after the war, the terrible nature of " black codes," and the consequent necessity and beneficence of reconstruction, he quotes for facts the narrative of that very brilliant but very parti-/ san politician the late James G. Blaine.
As for the much-maligned “ carpet-baggers/’ " these Northern men,” says Sinclair, (now on his own authority,) who had settled In the South, and whom the
ex-Confederates called ' carpet-baggers/ responded to the call of their country to assist in reconstructing the Southern States In the same spirit of patriotism which they displayed when Sumter was fired on."
One doesn’t know whether this comparison will be quite pleasing to all the volunteers who wore tbe blue—but so it stands. At all events, in Dr. Sinclair's opinion these estimable carpet-baggers, with the " loyalists of the South who had borne contumely and outrage during the four years of the war, whom the ex-Confederates called ' scalawags,' " and " the colored people, bubbling over with rejoicings,'* saved the country in a terrible crisis and prevented a recrudescence of States* rights and slavery. Certainly (pace Col. Higginson) that is a view of the case quite as partisan as any ever made by a representative of the Southern governing classes.
However, the author himself is frankly, almost naively, partisan. A chief aim of his book is to defend the negro from the imputation of unfitness for.the suffrage, and the argument wherewith this fitness Is demonstrated Is (reduced to simple terms) that the negro has consistently voted the Republican ticket from the beginning. The negro, says Dr. Sinclair, has saved the country over and over again by turning the balance in favor of that party which has been (as he distinctly sas's) appointed of God to lead it in the ways of righteousness and prosperity. For instance, the negro elected Hayes, (this fs Dr. Sinclair’s statement,) he defeated Bryan; it was he who gave to Mr. Roosevelt, who after Lincoln is chosen of Heaven to guide us to the heights, his recent very handsome majority1. Therefore the negro is fit to vote. Therefore to de-prlve him of his vote Is a crime. It hath a humorous sound, this, to non-Republicans. But Dr. Sinclair does not present the course of reasoning quite so baldly. It is a thread upon which are hung many particulars of more or less force on his side.
i Dr. Sinclair’s premise is that the negroes are an oppressed people, now as always. There are those who observing the negro, male and female; in the South think that as poorer populations go, he is less oppressed than most, does more of yhflt he pleases, works only when he will.

'Sinclair presents a; mass' of very ugly testimony about convict camps and.peonage in the. Gulf region, which shows.that there are or have been negroes truly and cruelly ^ oppressed. And in the.matter of the ballot nobody .pretends that they.have. h^4 a
,square:deal. -	,
I»ike all writers of his race, also. Dr. Sinclair speaks with outraged feeling of Crow..cars, and ordinances of segregation generally. He writes:	.
The Idea or negro Inferiority enters into the framing and the.. execution of “the law. It has been molded into custom and ^unwritten law. It'is enforced with fierceness and cruelty unspeakably shocking.
It permeates every phase of Southern liie.
It has resulted In the passage of Jim Crow *’ laws which can be fitly described only when called barbarous; and the appropriate appellation for the makers of 3uch laws would be the Jim Crow politicians. These “Jim Crow’* politicians have “ Jim Crowed ” all railway trains, stations, lunch counters, dining rooms, and waiting rooms; they have Jim Crowed " all libraries, theatres, museums, art galleries, public parks and places of public resort and amusement; they have “ Jim Crowed ** all ferryboats .and steamboats; they have "Jim Crowed" some of the trades and callings; they have Jim Crowed" all churches and schools and colleges and other institutions of learning; they have “ Jim Crowed ” the elevators in stores, office buildings, public buildings, and other places; they have ** Jim Crowed ” restaurants, cafes. Ice cream parlors, hotels, saloons, and eyen soda water fountains; they have^- Jim Crowed ” the courts, the making and tbe administration of the law; they have " Jim Crowed" all offices, municipal, county, and State; they have "Jim Crowed" the jury box; they have Jim Crowed" the ballot box. In short, They have “ Jim Crowed ’* the beautiful " Sunny South ” Into the " Jim Crow '* South.
And controlled by a perverted moral sense and a diseased mind, a mania on the questions affecting the negro, some of these leaders are now making a bold, desperate, even reckless effort to “ Jim Crow " the President of the United States and to " Jim Crow " the Government of the United States, and to " Jim Crow ” this great Christian Nation of eighty millions of free people into a ** Jim Crow* Nation. Surely the cup of iniquity of the " Jim Crow" politicians is not only full, but running over!
*
Surely, also, this Is the passionate urgency of the Interested advocate who, by the way, lets his enthusiasm carry him Into several Instances of " Jim Crowlsm ” which if they occur at all are most uncommon. The negro Government official traveling from Washing£on to San Francisco—a five days’ journey—and not a restaurant open to him all the way (as cited by the author) Is doubtless put to sad Inconveniences, but the Southern politicians are hardly responsible for the conditions he meets. Nor have these oftentimes very unwise gentlemen " Jim Crowed *’ the places? where one dines in New York—places nevertheless quite perfectly "Jim Crowed.’’ However, Dr. Sinclair makes an exhibit of several pages of intemperate Southern comment on the celebrated Bcckcr Washington White House luncheon which will grieve the judicious even among those who deplored that incident. And he is obviously more than half right In some of the points which he makes against ^the enemy.
He spends much space upon the part played by the black troops In the civil war, and celebrates the courage of his race with an admirable pride and enthusiasm. He thinks they saved the Union in that day and that the Nation— which he energetically declares is not a white man's country—owes its black citizens a debt of gratitude on that account. He speaks, too, of what the Tenth Cavalry (colored) did at San Juan, where Mr. Roosevelt's Rough Riders were also present-
Everything in the book, however, leads up to tbe plea at the last. Dr. Sinclair urges the Republican Party to carry out the pledges in the Chicago platform to cut down Southern representation In Congress to match the reduced voting lost consequent upon the disfranchisement of the large majority of the negroes by the new State Constitutions. He declares that justice, gratitude, good faith, and the National Constitution demand this action, and he thinks the Southern politician (whom he blames for these laws) will restore the negro to his rights rather than lose power and offices. As for what he names the best Southern element, he thinks this element does not really approve the new Constitutions and Is perhaps not utterly wedded to "Jim Crowism.” Curiously, in Virginia, at least, It happens that the convention which made the new Constitution of that State was made up largely of men not politicians at all. However, Dr. Sinclair is a native of South Carolina.
