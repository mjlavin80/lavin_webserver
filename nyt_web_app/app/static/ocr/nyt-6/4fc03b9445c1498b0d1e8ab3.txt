Catharine of Russia. .
THE COURTSHIPS OF* CATHARINE THE GREAT. By Philip W. Sergeant, B. A., late Scholar ot Trinity College, Ox\ ford. Portraits and map. One volume. 3?p. X.-337. Svo. Cloth. Philadelphia; J--B. Llpplncptt Company.
The word ** Courtships ” in the title of this book Is a weak euphemism. Moreover, Catharine's lovers, except Potemkin, had no influence on the current ot European politics, and'-are of small historical in-, terest, and even Potemkin merely held up Catharine's hands. The book, however, granting its right to existence, is well put together.
The only new matter we have found In it Is The spelling Fotiomkin for the accepted Potemkin, and the assertion that Potemkin did not really delude Catharine with theatrical scenery and supernumeraries to represent the towns and the inhabitants for which she -had supplied tnonfey to build ^and settle ln the Crimea.'
