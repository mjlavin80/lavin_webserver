Vocal teachers more than any other kind of specialists are prone to lay claim to exclusive knowledge. Mr. Howard claimed to have ** exhausted the hitherto little-known sciencc and art of voice production." In support of this claim Mr. Drury curiously enough puts forward his " remarkable ancestry,** which lie traced back to seven lines of Kings and Emperors, to say nothing of Indian fighters and Colonial Governors. Mr. Howard discovered severgj vocal laws of “ supreme importance,*' without a knowledge of which the voce.1 teacher is " working in Egyptian darkness, with a thousand chances to’ one against his success." The “ Old Italian School ” was a myth, a collection *of puerile notions. Mr. Howard’s is expounded in a long series of exercises and comments, some of which are strange.
Mr. Breare has nothing to say of his ancestry. His chief effort is to develop the emotional beauty of English as a language to sing in. He lays great stress on perfection of pronunciation, which he declares to be essential to perfect tone. He, too, ha3 the right method, though he is less urgent in proclaiming Ills exclusive possession of it than some others.
