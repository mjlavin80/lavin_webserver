HE reappearance - between book covers of Mr. W. X*. Alden-s juvenile hero, Jimmy Brown, is an agreeable incident. Jimmy does not age or grow tiresome* In bis time many other imaginative, restless, humorous small boys of American literature have bounded Into the ken of the readers of droll books, have grown up and disappeared. Since Jimmy made his first communications- to the public, on the subject of parental control, Chtmmle Fadden has come into being, with a new language all his own, has grown to maturity, become a family man, and retired as a philosopher.
Jimmy Brown, if our memory serve, first greeted us about twenty years ago, yet here he is still, not a day older, being of "perennial youth like a pixie, as ignorant as ever of the unessential things, like geography and history; as imaginative and inventive, as audacious and as keenly aware of the fun of living.
The new book of Jimmy's adventures is entitled *' Jimmy Brown Trying to Find Europe,” (Harper’s.) and it deals with the travels of James and his friend Mike,
(a pale, juvenile reproduction of Micky Free,) from West Thompsonville, somewhere in New Ydrk State, to Paris, by way of the fields and country roads, the railroad, tlie canal, a steamboat, and finally a freighter from Montreal to Havre.
Jimmy is in search of his father and mother, whose address, he knows, is ** Grand Hotel, Europe." He is disgusted when he learns that the steamer is taking him not to Europe, but to France. However, he finds the Grand Hotel, and his parents, after many vicissitudes, and that, too, without bothering the official quaintly described in the following passage, with a pathetic reminiscence of Mr. Alden's experiences in Rome:
When we got to Paris we could go to the Grand Hotel and see J£ father was there, and if he wasn't we could go to a man who was called a Consul and was sent to Paris by Lhe President with directions to do everything any American r-ould possibly want, and to lend them money and give them food and clothes and tickets for the circus. 1 was delight-	I
ed to hear that there was such a good man in Paris, and Mike and I agreed that if we couldn’t find father there we would go and live with the Consul for a l’ew weeks, and then have him pay our fare back to \Vest Thompsonville and give us some nice presents to take back to our friends.
As a type of the human boy, and making:	due allowances for the exaggera-
tions of the professional and habitual humorist, he is a true type, Jimmy belongs cxactly to the race of Tom Sawyer, Probably if there never had been a	, I
Tom Sawyer Jimmy would never have existed. Yet he distinctly is not Tom Sawyer, but Jimmy Brown, and by virtue of his relationship to Mr. Alden he is, in all his manifestations, incorrigibly Alden-ish, and in some of them he is as surely Mr. Alden’s self as Pippa, the mill "girl, in " Pippa Passes ’* is the late Mr. Browning in short- petticoats. Yet Jimmy is a real youngster, always, in his acts, if not in his narrative of them. Not that the simplicity of the narrative is ever strained. It is all as Quaintly straightforward as the boys’ stories of Jacob Abbott, of delightful memory. A mid-nineteenth century atmosphere inevitably surrounds Jimmy.
He is not exactly of the present moment, naturally enough, and perhaps we like him all the better on that account. Tjast week we gave homage In this column to the sportive Bevis of the English naturalist, Pdchard Jefferies; this week our hero is as quaint a juvenile, more of the domain of humor, perhaps, but as wholesome and buoyant a companion for a pleasant hour.	i
