Sir Horace Plunkett has published through E. P. Dutton & Co. a new and cheap edition of his " Ireland In the New Century." It is accompanied by what the brilliant author calls an " epilogue," and the edition Is made very Inexpensive (60 cents) in order that the book, and still more the epilogue, may reach as many readers as possible. It may be added that It is clearly the desire of Sir Horace that the number of readers in this country shall be as large as the number in old Ireland, or larger. At all events, he and his publishers have furnished for the American public quite a model of good reading, clear print, handsome page, and neat binding at a'remarkably low cost.
Wj& are not at all surprised that Sir Horace Plunkett should have felt impelled to answer the numerous and curious criticisms to which his admirable but not ingratiating book has given rise. In the original edition he se't himself the highly important task of telling his countrymen what he believed to be some of the moral causes of their troubles and pointing out what virtues it was incumbent on them to cultivate.

: Not unnaturally; and; we: shouldliaye supposed, hotvuftexpectedly, these- criticisms have brought "down oh the head ■of their author a great number of unfriendly comments, many of them assailing ‘his ^motives, and nearly all of them directed against the work of. indUstrial organization in which he is so prominent. For th,e £o;rmer Sir Horace Plunkett idoes not seem much to care; as to the latter he ,is sincerely concerned. He admits that the book has produced an unfavorable impression on the minds of some whip are earnestly insympathy with . his , work, and even those who agree with his general criticisms think it- would have been expe-. dient to withhold at least’the reddest of the rags from the eyes of the noto- ■ riously exfcitable bulls in1 the arena of Irish politics and" religion.' This, is hardly the place to deal, with the correctness or the inaccuray of Sir Horace's analysis of the Irish-Englfsh sit-r uation. But „we .think- it quite the proper place to note, and note with a good deal of emphasis, that no people,
big or little, can hope to develop a nat
tional character and a national literature worthy the attei>tion of the world if it cannot tolerate and even welcome such criticism as this volume contains. We have read and reread it with interest, and we find in it the tone of sincerity on the one hand . and on the other precisely the kind of searching of heart which a true patriot owes to his own people. Apart from its literary and intellectual qualities; which distinctly are high, there is the attraction of an independent point of view which even opponents-ought to welcome.
Certainly the author leaves no unflat^ tering or discouraging impression of his j people. Quite the contrary. Measured I from point of starting and with refer-I ence to the obstacles encountered, the | real progress, of the Irish has been re* i markable. That does not Imply that it might not be greater In the future, and the man who points out, as Sir Horace Plunkett does point out, that the future has new difficulties to meet and demands some change of action and feeling, seems to us to render a real service to his countrymen.
