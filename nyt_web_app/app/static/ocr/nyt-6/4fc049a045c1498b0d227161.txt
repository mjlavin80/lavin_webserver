In his everyday life he is a learned, bappy child. His curiosity is matched by his credulity. He is the victim not only of tradesmen but of beggars. He cannot keep his coat clean. *	*	* He
knows every one in his neighborhood.
*	*	* He makes a fine figure of Char-
ity in his old age. * * * He has a large, joyous, curving mouth, side whiskers,
j careless beard, large feet. *	*	•	But
1 in tht pulpit *	* * he always makes
an attempt to dust the wrinkles of his
I waistcoat. * *	•	He	justifies	and	makes
use of his size more than any man I ever saw. *	*	* Standing there, he under-
takes .to speak on behalf of the Deity.
*	*	*	When	he	reads	a	lesson	it	is	plain
to see that above all other gods he loves " the Lord that smiteth.” He opens his mouth and rejoices in the rich and massy Welsh. He makes no attempt at mere clear reading, which would be of no use to an imaginative audience, that is familiar with the Bible, but, raising and lowering his voice, now hurrying as if tqu-a precipice where all will be overthrown, now creeping as if he feared what is to come, he makes the chapter anew, creating it as if he,were sculptor or musician.
1 suppose lie uses nearly as many musical notes as if he sang.
Thus J2dwarcl Thomas describes a preacher of Wales In his book .on " Wales,” for which Robert Kowler, R. .1., has painted a number of scenes, which have here been reproduced in their original colors. The volume further includes a short chapter on the work of the artist written by Alexander J. Finberg. ** Wales " is the latest in the color-illustrated books which appear here through the Macmillan Company.	__
