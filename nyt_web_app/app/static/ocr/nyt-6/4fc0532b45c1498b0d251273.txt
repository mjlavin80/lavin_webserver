Psychology of tho Japanese.
* Prof. Okakura-Yoshlsaburo's little book,
*	The Japanese Spirit/* (1‘J^no, pp. 127. New York: James Poit & Co. ?1 net,) is tfie result of some lectures read to University or London students. The author ; shows not only his knowledge of thjs lit— erature. of his native land, but also his acquaintance with Western writers. Tho lectui^s, as George Meredith writes in his ; Introduction to the volume, ** are com-
*	pendious and explicit in a degree that enables us to form a summary of tnucli that has been otherwise partially obscure, so
■	that we get nearer to the secret of this : singular race than we have had the .chance or doing- before/' And Prof. Oka-kura writes, in condensed form, much
■	about the origin of the Japanese, their •faith, their conceptions of life^and their
Ideals of duty, as well as their metaphysical doctrines. He deals, in short, with everything that bears upon the physical and Intellectual environments of his countrymen which has led to the formation of their character.
He writes about " Bushido/* which is the *' way of the Samurai/' the principle of renunciation on behalf of the,, welfare of | the Fatherland; traces the course of Con- j
i	fuclanism, Shintoism, and Taoism in the 1 Instruction it has given the Japanese In “ Virtue " and shows throughout the book that the ** foolish talk.** as Mr. Meredith terms It, of the yellow peril, is fatuous.
