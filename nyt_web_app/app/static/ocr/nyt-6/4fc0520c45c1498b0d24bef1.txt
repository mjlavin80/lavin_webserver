I The agricultural administration and policy of Hungary are certainly more interesting than in any other country, because the farming industry in Hungary includes nearly every kind of agricultural production under moderate climate; every Rind of cultivation, from the northern pine forests down to the southern vineyards and rice culture: every size of farming, from the large estates of thousands of acres down to the very small cultivation of peasant proprietors; every degree of farmers, from the remarkably intellectual Magyars to the low-cultivated ■Slavs and Roumanians; all the different scales of cultivation, farms, and cultivators. And. dealing with all those in the high road of progress, includes, of course, various necessities, various methods, and a very largo variety of practical measures.
For the above reasons, writes Andrew Gyorgy, in his preface to his translation from the Hungarian of Dr. Ignatius Dar&nyi, of “ The State and Agriculture in Hungary,” published by the Macmillan Company, an account like the present should now, more than ever before, be of additional interest to the student of practical politics. The volume is the report of the Minister of Agriculture on his administration during- tho years 1896-1003. and, as Is natural, It deals with only that side of the question which is played by the State.
There are chapters on peasant farms, viticulture, and vine dressing, orchards and horticulture, bee-keeping, sericulture, pisciculture, forestry, horse breeding, colonization, agricultural laborers, agricultural education, &c. Full tables of sta-tistlcs are included of every branch of the industry.	.	<
