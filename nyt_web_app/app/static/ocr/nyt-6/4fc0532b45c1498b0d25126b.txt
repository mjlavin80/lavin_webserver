The drinking uter.sil -which Percy Bate describes in his volume, ** English Table Glass," (medium Svo. Pp. 130. Illustrated. Gilt Top. In Newnes s Library of the Applied Arts. New York:	Imported	by
Charles Scribner’s Sons. $2.50,) which is the glass of the eighteenth century, has as the author says, ** interesting features and individual beauties." In no way does it resemble the delicacy of Venetian work, nor the florid decoration typical of the German maker; nor are there such ** lofty ” pieces as seen in the Low Countries.
The book has been written, we are told at the beginning, for *' such friends of the arfs of their own country *	*	* in the
expectation that some of those who feel the Individuality of our English drinking glasses, respond to their charm, and care to possess them, m,ay be interested in the experience and the conclusions of a fel-low-collector.” In his introductory and prefatory chapter he writes of the artistic and human interest of a collection such as he has:
I have already spoken of the pleasure I derived from the growth of my small collection, the enjoyment obtained from the pimple beauty of some and the quaint originality of others, and the interest inseparable from the evolution of a series, ihe elucidation of little problems, and the development of a coherent story. This interest was, of course, both artistic and antiquarian, but as yet the charm ot the personal and individual was absent, though soon to appear. There is always to a thoughtful mind a curious fascir.a-tion about those relics of the past that seem to touch, however faintly, the chord of human feeling, that seem to bear with them some suggestion, however slight, of the personality of the long dead men and women who possessed and cherished them in the bvgone years. And gradually glasses came to my hand, frail relics of crced or character, or emotion, which were eloquent of the ardent humility of our predecessors, each with a tale to tell, each demanding hospitality and harborage, and each affording either n vivid ■ flash of insight or a half-veiled glimpse into the minds, the habits, and identities of our ancestors.	,
Besides describing the glasses in his own collection, Mr. Bate also tells about the articles possessed by others, notably those in the cabinet owned , by Mrs. Rees Price of Glasgo^. The author makes .10 attempt to give a history of glassmak-ins in England; his object.is. to teU of the evolution of the art from the pieces with which he is familiar. Glasses for: water, wine, rum, • ale, &c.t and ^gveral1 large drinking vessels, candlesticks, &C-, are described and pictured.— J' - . ’
