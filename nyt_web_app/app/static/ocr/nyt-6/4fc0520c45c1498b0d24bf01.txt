The Memoirs of Fra Salimbene de Adam, a shrewdly observant, impressible, amiable Franciscan friar of the thirteenth century, the age of splendid doings and wonderful dreams, are to be published, without expurgation, in the Monumenta Germanie, (Berlin: Weid-xnann Buchhaendler.) Salimbene was a contemporary of Dante; of the mighty Emperor Frederick H., denounced by the priests as Antichrist; of Abb6 Joachim, the prophet of Calabria; of St. Louis, of the Guelphs and Ghibel-lines. The span of Salimbene's life was reasonably long; he probably lived nearly seventy years, and he remembered the recovery of Jerusalem by the Crusaders, -while he heard with horror, years later, the sad story of the Sicilian vespers.
The memoirs were published in the Monumenta Historica at Parma in 1855, but with many expurgations. The German publishers now intend to put the whole contents of Salimbene's precious manuscript within the reach of scholars. At the same time the rare charm and interest of the work will be advertised to the public at large. It ought to be translated into English and published in popular form. It is an extraordinary human document, and its vitality would impress not only students of Church history, students of Dante curious about the life of his epoch, and specialists in the lore of the
thirteenth century, bu4 the whole
i
world of readers of books.
Salimbene knew Brother Leo, who was present when the body of St. Francis of Assisi was prepared for burial, and saw, the mystical wounds. He knew Asdente, the cobbler prophet of Parma, whom Dante places in hell. He knew Popes, Archbishops, and Kings; he had unbounded faith, a genius for gossip, and plenty of energy.
G. G. Coulton writes in the current number of Tlie Nineteenth Century in praise of Salimbene’s memoirs. But T. L. It. Oliphant, a student of the thirteenth century, went to the trouble,
! as long- ago as 1875, to translate into good, simple English (as easy and picturesque as Defoe's) many vital passages from Salimbene, which were printed in his book called ** The Duke and the Scholar.” Those passages alone, as Mr. Oliphant rearranged them chronologically, would be worth re- I printing as a separate hook.
