Miss Goodloe enters a new and fertile field in her stories of a post of Lhe Northwest Mounted Police In "British Columbia, " a thousand miles from civilization." She has visualized well'her “ kaleidoscopic views of the strange, interesting, ever-shifting life of the country.”
Some of the tales are, however, on the edge of the repulsive, as the one describing the Indian sun dance—to which, by the bye, it is quite incredible that any decent woman, much less lhe gently bom and bred, should go.
These short stories are strangely suggestive of those which made us free of an almost antipodal segment of the unsleeping empire. In both the British soldier is the inevitable factor: over both darkly broods an inscrutable subject race; bojh are penetrated by. the pathos, too often the tragedy, of expatriation. Indeed, In her treatment, as well as in her situations, Miss Goodloe is rather too , markedly Kiplingesque. .She has written a book commanding the reader’s Interest and whetting his curiosity, but .to do her best work she must shake oft the : obsession of her powerful " control,” and must be frankly herself. We are persuaded That she has tales of the great Northwest better worth the telling, and that she has it in her to tell them better than any In this pioneer volume. .
