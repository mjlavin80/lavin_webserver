Mrs. Stevenson on “ The Bottle Imp.”
Mrs. Stevenson tells in her biographical note to R. L. S.'s " Island Night’s Entertainment," published in the new edition of his works, that " The Bottle Imp ” was the first piece of fiction ever offered in printed form to the Samoans. It was suggested to the author by a melodrama founded on an old Guinean legend. The story was put into the Samoa n language by a missionary, and printed serially in The Sulu under the title " O Le Pangu Aitu.*’ A strong belief remained in the island that the unopened botttte still existed, and was eafely stowed away in Stevenson’s house.
