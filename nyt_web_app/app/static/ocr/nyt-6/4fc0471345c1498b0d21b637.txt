If you were a retired Anglo-Indian offl-cial and a bearded kinsman you had never seen came suddenly upon you and left his daughter in your charge, and If he presently died, leaving the girl a fortune and forbidding- you, the guardian, to tell her (or anybody else) about it—all for fear of fortune hunters—you’d probably be in for a deuce of a time. Especially if the girl were attractive and If you were childless and your wife affected freak women's clubs and dressed to match.
Mr. Korris has assumed all these ifs and others*, and thereupon built the story of the embarrassing orphan. He calls the orphan Elsie, and gives her all the serious womanly qualities—cruelly depriving her of the defense of a light mind and the arts of coquetry to which ?oman is rightly
*	heir. Mr. Norris adds a serious Major, no longer in his first youth, scrupulous to : a degree, and in a situation where the | British conscience expects him to marry a fortune. He adds also a beautiful scheming widow with riches, a cub whose father has made a vast fortune selling ** Billings' Beautiful Boots." and a French gentleman of the old noblesse—a person of polished perfidy—a man whose race horses are said by the fastidious to win when they shouldn't and lose when they should win. The Marquis is Elsie's unde on her mother's side, and has somehow got wind of her fortune. His, naturally, has been
squandered long since. The book concerns Uspif with the following questions: Whether the widow can marry Elsie to the cub, whether the Marquis can marry Elsie 1.0 his spn, (an absorbed geologist, who doesn't want to marry at all;) whether Uncle Ned (the retired Anglo-Indiaij) can marry Elsie to his nephew, the seriouu and scrupulous military gentleman, who is expected to marry a fortune. The widow wants the military gentleman, too. Also, Elsie is in love with him.
The story is ingeniously complicated and amusing, though after all somewhat monotonous, in spite of oualnt touches g£ satiric humor and very pretty centime at -of , the self-mocking Idiid which educated’ vinodemsfind sits-easiest upon-them.	. *
