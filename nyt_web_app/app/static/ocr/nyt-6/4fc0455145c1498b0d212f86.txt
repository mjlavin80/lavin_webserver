MHVIATURES. By Dudley Heatb. Royal 8vo. Pp. 320. niustra.ted. Cloth. 'Decorated, la the Connoisseur's Library. New Tork: G. I*. Putnam' a Sens. $0.75 set. —-*
With the advent of a new volume In the Connoisseur's Library, It may not be Inappropriate to repeat that, as pieces of bcokmaking, these volumes are the product of care and of artistic taste in detail and finish. They are royal octavo In size; the paper Is'a soft, light, English handmade product, with the natural deckle edges. The type Is a modern modification of an excellent Italian model of the eighteenth century, and the plates in photogravure or color are excellent examples of the engraver's art. Typographically and pictorially, ** Miniatures,” by Dudley Heath, Is worthy of Its predecessors.
It is a book of great convenience, and for Its elemental and primary features may be looked upon with indulgence by the connoisseur of miniatures. It Is essentially a book. for the amateur collector who has reached that stage of knowledge and appropriation which teaches him how little he knows about his favorite subject and what a poor assortment of miniatures he has hitherto gathered together. Mr. Heath's monograph adequately bridges the space which divides the enthusiastic but unlearned amateur from the expert in knowledge, judgment, and taste.
At the threshold we_4iave an index to. plates with the subjects reproduced In line drawings. This is followed by an excellent although by no means complete bibliography denoting works principally In French and English. The text opens with a history of the nrt of miniature painting, which develop . i ora the art of Illuminating manuscripts prior to the Invention of printing. If we realize that the true miniature bears the same relation to a life-size portrait that the *' short story ’’ does to the novel, It will be seen that it Is a distinct department of art and is not simply a picture *' in miniature." .-The Greeks and Romans, and the Byzantines as well, made portraits in miniature which were not, correctly speaking, miniatures. The art of illuminating manuscripts with portraits developed an independent method of artistic expression which was destined to be isolated when the printed page took the place of the engrossed sheet. Mr. Heath cites M. Didot on tliis point:
The Invention of printing threatened to deprive the miniaturists of their means of existence; they therefore sought to co-operate with the printers, who were very glad of their assistance and reserved corners in their pages to be filled up by . the artists. For the latter it was an opportunity of escaping from the circle of religious subjects in which they had continually revolved. The ancient authors, were now admirably illustrated by these’ master draughtsmen. They, nevertheless ; could not represent the»costumes of the I ancients, but in spite of these anachro- : nisms—which are venerated by us to-day because they reproduce the costumes of the Middle Ages—tljey have left Imperishable artistic monuments. Their work is chiefly instinct with the love of nature and their beautiful landscapes, are. full of truth and poetry and eloquent of their fondness for clear air and sunlight.- * * * But printing gradually diminished the number of miniaturists, who , began to abandon water color for the study of oil painting.
How loath the miniaturists were to leave the printed page may be gathered from the work of those seven followers of Albrecht DUrer known as. '* the little masters.” They were all engravers,-.draughtsmen, painters, and-Illuminators; and practiced the method of coloring the painted wood blocks. The emancipation- of Ital-iaJT miniaturists from ~£he .printed page was even much slower, as was. also that -of the Frenchman, as may-be seen, re-spectlvely by the manuscripts; illustrated by Glulio Cloyio,and .FouqiieL-Still later did the emancipation coiner; In England, there to be signalized by the work-of’Holbein, From-the latter h&Jf of -the six-' teenth century miniatured painting. in-Flanders, Germany, France,-Italy, Spain, ^nd England developed along the lines of a^disjtlnct and-independent art; \
