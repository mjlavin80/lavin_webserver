They have no particular bearing upon the recent troubles in the insurance world. Obvious, too, is the kind of humor which connects a stock called ** Yam Common ” with Senator Depew, and that defines a broker as one " who assists the investor in going broke gracefully.” Some examples of the quality of the little book follow:
