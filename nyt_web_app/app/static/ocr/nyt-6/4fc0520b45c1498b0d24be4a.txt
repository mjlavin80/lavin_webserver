Great poets are not to be brought into being- by i ■ mourning the loss of them. They must be developed
! by circumstance, but it is hard to say what circumstance. Patriotism has often inspired great poetry, but Mr. Henry Newbolt, an English versifier of distinction, in h*s recently published book called *' The Year of Trafalgar,*’ denies that great wars always produce great poetry. So we may not hope to breed a race of poets merely by going to war, Mr. New-bolt’s theory is that poetry of a high order may spring from the same stirring of national character as leads to war, but that the actual effect of war is rather to check the production of literature than to stimulate it.
