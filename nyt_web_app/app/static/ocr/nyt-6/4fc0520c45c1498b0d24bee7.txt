Centenary of Giuseppe Mazzini—The ILtbics of Biography—Did Shakespeare Read “Don Quixote”?
HE celebration this week of the one-hundredth anniversary of the birth of Giuseppe	Mazzini has been primarily, of
course, a	tribute to a great patriot and
liberator; but the natural bent of Maz-zini’s mind was toward literature, and he left a large volume of writings, in English as well as Italian. Circumstances directed his efforts early in life toward political action, but if he had not been drawn into the Young Italy movement, and thenceforward made the liberation of Italy the one great aim of his life, he might have achieved a. high place in Italian letters. His early essays on life and literature were of a good quality. During his exile in England in the late thirties and early forties, he contributed admirable articles on historical and literary	subjects to The Westminster
Review, The British	and Foreign Review, and The
Monthly Chronicle. His autobiography is a work of rare interest, and he planned a great deal of literary work which he never had time to execute. A few days before his death, in March, 1872, he finished an essay on Renan’s 41 Moral and Intellectual Reform,” which was published in The Fortnightly Review two years later. A man of letters himself, Mazzini also inspired other authors. Clough, Carlyle, Jowett, Morley, Meredith, (in " Vittoria,") and Swinburne have written eloquently of the liberator. The latest number of The Dial of Chicago contains a noteworthy article on the literary side of Mazzini, comparing his character and influence with those of Schiller.
