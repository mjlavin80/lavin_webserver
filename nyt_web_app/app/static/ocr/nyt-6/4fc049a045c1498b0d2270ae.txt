HESE lectures were delivered at Harvard this Spring under the Lane Foundation, an ti .were repeated in .part in other universities. Prof. Sandys Introduces them with
>	a graceful reference to the flame from Emmanuel College, Cambridge, that kindled Harvard’s torch, and that was itself kindled in the very year of the revival of learning in Italy, and by that revival which is the subject of his discourse. He treats it in seven chapters, devoted respectively to “ Petrarch and Boccaccio," "The Age of Discoveries/’ ** The Theoiy and Practice of Education,” The Academies of Florence. Venice, Naples, and Rome/' " The Homes ot Humanism," •* The Historian of Ciceronianlsm.” and “The Study of Greek."
These titles in themselves suggest that the discussion is no dry and detailed enumeration of historical facts. Prof. Sandys has treated of the leading forces in the revival of learning in a way to suggest and make vivid a picture of the way that great movement was set at work. We are not to view It as a single and sudden event; nor are we to exaggerate the darkness of the Middle Ages in order to enhance the brightness of the new era. It was a gradual and protract* ed process* slowly called forth by the prevailing spirit of intellectual freedom, and by the continuous tradition of the _ Latin, the constant witness to the existence of Greek in the region known as Magna Graecia. and by the remains of antique sculpture and architecture. We see, firs^, Petrarch and his friend Boccaccio exploring libraries for hitherto unknown manuscripts of the Latin authors and gradually bringing them to light to their own great delight—Petrarch, the connecting link Between the mediaeval and the modern world, the ” first modern man,” the first to realize the supreme importance of the classical literature and
*	to regard it with a fresh and intelligent interest; Boccaccio, his follower, carrying on the work begun and inspired by him.
It was an age of discoveries of all sorts: geographical, physical, literary; of the discovefy of man and human individuality, of the beauties of nature. Manuscripts of the classics were unearthed from forgotten resting places in large numbers. The story of the zealous Italian explorers in these regions and among the inscriptions of the Rprrian ruins is fascinating: The pictures of the chief actors , in those stirring days that Prof. Sandys . gives are oeiightful Such a one is that of Nlccolb dei Niccoli, the collector, seat' ed at his table with- his antique vases -and his crystal cups gleaming on the
*	spotless linen; or in his'library, with a quiet smile playing about his lips, or walking abroad in a long and handsome robe of roseate hue. He meets a rich
■	youth who. acknowledging that he was devoted only -to pleasure, is reproved by „■ him, and by his account of the beauty of . learning is converted on the spot and becomes a scholar and patron of scholars. A strong influence toward the classical education was' exerted by many other admirable scholars whose efforts and achievements are here described.
Another development, curious and interesting, of the new impulse toward classical learning resulted in the a cade-mies of Florence, Venice/ Naples, and Rome. The first was that of Florence, and Its establishment was due to the influence of one of the Greels envoys to the. Councfl of Florence held in 1439 as an attempt to . unite the Western and* Eastern portions of the Church. Georgios Gemis-tos, instead of attending the "sessions of the Council, gathered a circle of eager Florentines and poured forth-his Platonic lore, prompting Cosimo de* Medici to hall him as a second Plato *and to found an academy which,'after 1,200 years; revived the custom of celebrating the memory-of Plato by a banquet on the Tth pr Novem-' ber. the day of his birth as well asr of his d?ath, There were nine members, and-it ’ was under the patronage ot^-ihe House of ; MeiUcL “	—	■	-	'	.	r-	-. /	.

ciations with the scholars of the past recalled. He traces the influence of Cicero —the creator of the modern classical Latin prose, as Mommsen calls him— through the Middle Ages, and upon the humanists at the Revival of Learning, ! through the influence of Petrarch. Cicero and his style were the avowed models ot most of the Italian scholars; but opposition to Ciceronianism was not lacking, especially to the- exaggerated form of it, and there is an amusing account of the caricature by Longolius of the fanatic Ciceronian who wastes away, pining for I the perfect attainment of a Ciceronian style, and his rigorous discipline to attain it. Furious battles were waged over I the question, in some of which Erasmus took a part. '
One of the most significant features of the revival of learning was the revival of the study of Greek. While Greek had almost laded from the knowledge of northern scholars,, it remained a living language in the south of Italy, where there_were Greek monks even down to the dawn of 1 the Renaissance. It was from one such, indeed, that Petrarch gained his first ' knowledge or Greek, in 1342, and Boccaccio gained similar knowledge from another. who came to Venice in 1353. The influence of Petrarch and Boccaccio lingered in Florence, inciting the literary circle there to greet the accomplished Chrys-oloras, on his arrival in .Venice, as an envoy from Byzantium, and to invite him. to Florence, where, in fact, he taught Greek from liiOC to 1400. ** Half a century before the fall of Constantinople the future destinies of Greek were thtfs assured in Europe.” Gther Byzantines came, zealous Italians visited Constantinople, and many Greek manuscripts were brought to Italy through their efforts. Baasarion, a Greek, was made Cardinal, and during his residence in Rome he was surrounded by learned Greeks, who flocked to Italy both before and after the fall of Constantinople. Thus the opinion, once held, that the fall of the Eastern capital was the causfc^of the revival of Greek learning is seen to be quite unfounded. * Those who' follow proL Sandys will have found that Greek had occupied the attention of zealous Italians for a century before that event. They will have found, too, the cooperation of many forces working toward ine revival of learning; and they mti ; nardly fail to have submitted to something of the charm and inspiration which cnaracterize that most fascinating of pci luiis.
