This Js undoubtedly a useful reference book for merchants and journalists. But it would have been more useful if it had been more carefully edited. It contains many more errors than we have ever noted In the British ** Who’s Who *’ or the ** Who’s Who in America." It has, to be sure, the manifold faults of those publications. Many very unimportant persons (especially some unattached contributors to periodicals) have ■ needlessly detailed biographical sketches. No one but their mothers would be Interested In
such full accounts of their achievements. The statements of the things some of these estimable persons have cone are so nearly complete that one feels that an-pther word would be an indelicate encroachment upon privacy. . On the other hand, the. notices of some prominent personages, like J. P. Morgan, are Inade-. quate. There are too ..many, typographical -errors, especially in dates aim names. The drollest Js probably that which' makes the late Jefferson I>avls a resident of “ Warren County, Mass/*
