I want to protest at the lack of ethics of some writers of so-called M ghost *’ stories, who ruthlessly impose updn the

This magazine prints a short story [ called " The . Patch of Sunshine/* by Churning Pollock, whose previous short fiction 1 have considered excellent. This tale treats of the experience of a most materialistic *‘ newspaper man," who rents a suburban cottage. Upon the floor of a windowless room in this house appears at times a large patch of brilliant sunshine. Its source is an absolute mystery, for thero is no aperture through which the sun could penetrate into thl3 room so as to produce this patch.

Ho takes great pains to~ convince you that there’s nothing - of the mystic about him, and that when he sec3 things they are there. Having thus won your confidence, he rouses the keenest interest as to how such a mlracle; could bo brought 'about li the twentieth.century In'a modern city—the scene Is laid -near .Washington,
