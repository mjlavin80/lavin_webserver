judge Grant's Felicitous Analysis of a Certain “ Smart Set.”*
N HIS latest novel. "The Orchid," Judge Robert Grant continues his dissection of American society. Ke studies this time the .make-up of one of those smart fox-hunting sets concerning whose spectacular doings newspapers keep everybody" more or less well and closely In-fbrmed, but his method of treatment is us. light as his characters are frivolous, and the result Is a book very different in texture and effect from his “ Unleavened Bread *’ or " The Undercurrent." Both of those involved a serious and able discussion of matters vitally affcctlng social standards, and both laid bare in disquieting fashion some extremely unadmirable modern social tendencies, but " The Orchid.” though offering food for thought, is as far as possible from anything savoring of the didactic. It only serves the useful purpose of convincing its readers that ^whatever such minute fractions of the human family as the Westfield Hunt Club may do to make thempel^s olmox--. ious or ridiculous, it has no more serious bearing on the destiny of society as,a-whole than have tlf$ fantastic shapes ot tlie orchids upon the great useful, wholesome crops of the soil.	;	-	.
As a picture of how men and women-can flutter idly along an easy and pleasant pathway of life, nothing could be j better than “The Orchid," told as it is in this accomplished writer’s crispest' and: ; most interesting style. Hunting, golfing, , tennis, teas, dinners, and gossip—especial- ; ly gossip—fill up the days for the members of the Westfield Colony and a very happy, healthy and care-free life they appear to lead, with plenty of money, no labor, and no other visible object in \ lew than a gay, good time. The favored beings who can afford thus to dispose of their one passage through the world are of extremely ordinary mold, mentally and morally, so far as can be judged from anything they say or do or think in this book—a certain careless comprehension and overlooking of one another s faults being about the most active virtue on exhibition among them.
It is to tlie bright, particular flower of womanhood growing in this invigorating soil that Judge Grant has given the suggestive name of “ The Orchid, and he adds to his gallery of social portraits a masterpiece of feminine beauty, cleverness, soullessness, and uselessness. Lydia ■ Arnold is the pet and pride of the Westfield Colony until she becomes an example of their easy-going selfishness and irresponsibility carried to logical conclusions that succeed in shocking even their blunted sensibilities—not so deeply, however. that they do not decide it to be the safer policy to overlook her delinquencies and allow her to live down her scandal among them. There may have been a time when it would have been considered a piece of wild exaggeration for a novelist to represent a woman in civilized society as actually selling her unloved child to her unloved first husband for $2,000,009 in order that she might have the wherewithal to marry a second husband, more to her intellectual and artistic taste, but entirely without the means to continue the
*	luxuries which were the necessities of her life. But the Society, with a big " S," from which Judge Grant has taken his types is commonly held to be so coldblooded in its matrimonial affairs that probably enough he has drawn this most startling incident in Lydia’s career from the annals of real life. Some almost as startling have been recorded elsewhere than in novels.
Even the author of " Unleavened Bread ** never wrote anything more cleverly suggestive of the sophistical processes of the human mind than the conversation in the last chapter of “The Orchid,” where Lydia’s former friends discuss the pros and cons of her reception by them when she shall return with her dearly purchased husband to settle down In Westfield. It is so certain that similarly knotty points of social etiquette and decorum must often arise in the group that styles itself Society that it Is highly amusing to hear a shrewd guess as to just what means they take to settle them. One can sympathize with Mrs. Cole, who remarked that " if the Church would only pass a canon forbidding us to call on women who get divorced in order to marry some one else ’’ it would be easier to take a proper stand; also witi' Mr. Marcy, who was of the opinion thaL * it s very difficult to cut people whom one has known all one’s life, unless they’ve committed murder or embezzled.” But how the poor lad;<-\5 of the Westfield colony did settle It all is told too well by Mr. Grant to be spoiled by quotation. As an observer of American characteristics he has few rivals.
