In this volume are included a number of sketches and stories of the late Rowland E. Robinson, who was blind in his later years, and is known as the author or a number of books and articles relating to out-door life and New England folk. Tbe sketches and tales are prefaced by a brief biographical note of the author, who was born In Vermont in 1SKJ, and died in lt)00. The first or title paper tells of what glimpses (and more than mere glimpses) of wild crcaturcs a man with a gun misses. That and other papers immediately following1 dwell lovingly upon the woods and woods’ creatures—tell of Spring’ in the wilds, of blue birds, grouse with muffled drumbeat, robins, blackbirds, squirrels, frogs^ and ** the biggest woodpecker that lives,” who, '* in less than half an hour " will separate ** the greatest part of the bark from a large pine tree for twenty or thirty feet."
The next papers tell something: about fishing from the supposed point of view of the fish, being1 the memoirs of a bass from his youth up, and the tale of the anglers ho met in mortal combat, or the life story of a pike of venerable years.
Further on In tbe book are stories of rural New Englanders-of the familiar type. You have Landlord Pliineas Dayton, who upon the day befcre Christmas put up his daughter for a prize and sent her two suitors to shoot partridges for his table. The 1 man who brought back the biggest bag was to have the girl. But it wasn’t exactly left to blind fortune, for another girl put her spoke in the wheel of fate. Again, you have another shooting match, for turkeys this time, in which Uncle Ellja (who had fallen dewn and deranged his sights) failed to get a turkey as the prize of his marksmanship; was then sorely tempted to steal one for the proper Christmaslng of his family, but, fleeing from temptation, had hfs reward. For on the way home he brought down a large fat wild goo-se.
You'll find reminiscont talk about "Cleaning Old Guns," a yarn of a Thanksgiving dinner in the woods; a story of a Vermont rattlesnake, ** Winter's talcs ’’ of foxes, weasels, squirrels, mice; of old boats, nnd even a poem called ** Antoine’s Version of Evangeline."
