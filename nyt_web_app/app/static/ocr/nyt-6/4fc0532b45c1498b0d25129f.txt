Irish Mytlis and Legends.
Xcw York Times Boole Hcvicw:
The letter ol George O. Holbrooke under the above caption Is very interesting1, but It must seem quite clear to all students of early Irish history and literature that Mr. Holbrooke has either been grossly misled by the philology upon which he reties or has made new discoveries, in which latter event further elucidation is required in these skeptical times.	*
Mr. Holbrooke undertakes to prove that names of alleged races nnd persons in oarly Irish history and literature bear intrinsic evidence of mythic origin, and that, therefore, all Irish' history, (or tradition,) prior to the time of St. Patrick at least, is pure myth. But even if Mr. Holbrooke proved that these names were
purely fanciful, which he did not. It docs not follow that they were not applied to real races or persons, and much less does it disprove the authenticity of all Irish history of the pro-Christian ages. He might successfully contend that " son of the hound of the sea” could not be eth-nologioally correct, and must therefore be mythical, but that would be far from proving that the Mac Conn Maras (mud-ernly abbreviated MacNainara) are not real human beings, and yet such is the meaning of the name. With two or three exceptions, Mr. Holbrooke's derivations of the numos of the early Irish races and persons do not agree with those of philologists of rocogni2cd authority in this domain. Some of them seem to be as fanciful as he alleges the bearers of the names to be. His equalizing of *4 Ossian ” with “ O’Shane ’* is an instance. Ossfan, i according to Irish annals, lived and wrote 1 in tho third century, but surnames were I not used by the Irish until the eleventh ' century, and there were no " 0*3 " as prefixes to names before then. O’Shane,
I venture to think, has not been used up to the present. There is MacShanc, a modern name, partly English in pronunciation. but meaning '* son of John,” (Mac Seaghan,) and having absolutely nothing to do with Ossian. His rendering of " cuchulain,” the name of the hero of the Red Branch cycle of Irish litera-ttire, as “beauty, flesh"; " colin, col* Icen, darling/' must, In the absence of a better explanation, be placed in the same category. Here Mr. Holbrooke conveniently drops the prefix " cu," moaning " hound,” (the genitive of which is “ conn," as above shown,) which would knock out his translation of the remainder of tho word. Far more plausible would it be to argue that all the old Irish romantic sagas are true in every detail, since they are supported by the nomenclature of the country, as, for instance, the famous duel of Cuchalain just mentioned, and Fcrdia, fought at a place bearing to this day the name of the latter warrior; Ardee, in County Louth, always written in Irish Ath-Fherdia,
" the ford o£ Ferdia.” But such reasoning would not be sound, either, for, as Dr. Douglas Hyde says, "ft would prove too much." .
The truth is that the admittedly romantic Irish literature in which “ gods and fighting men ’* are mixed up in no wise disproves the authenticity of Irish annals. The Irish annalist Tighcrneach, who was nothing If not cautious, writing in the eleventh century, with a mass of the earliest Irish annals, since lost, before him, together with works from foreign sources, such as St. Jerome’s, Bede’s, &c., from which he quotes, affirms his belief in Irish chronology as far back as the third century B. C.t beyond which he could form no judgment. The expulsion of the Desi from Ireland in the third century of our era and the settling of that tribe in South Wales is corroborated, as Dr. Kuno Myer has shown, by Welsh tradition, history, and literature.
And again, natural phenomena, such as eclipses of the sun, &c., carefully recorded in early Irish annals, have by ' modern calculation been’ proved to be | correct to the day. There may be much even in the annals that is fanciful, but this must be culled by scholarship an<T not by predilection or prejudice, particularly as the annals were official and were | subject to scrutiny at the triennial feis, l or festival, and, in respect to the genealo-
gies they contained, were the bases for determining the legal rights of claimants to tribejands.
Mr. Holbrooke’s dating of Irish history and civilization from the coming of Pat- * rick Is very arbitrary, to say the least, seeing that it is in direct conflict with the opinions of tho authorities upon early Irish history and literature, German, French, and Scotch, as well as Irish, and also with the abundant evidence still foi^-tunatoly extant of a high form of pagan civilization in Ireland, stfch as the pre-Christian art, remains. If we accept Patrick, how can we reject Laoghaire, the stanch old pngan high King whom the saint so boldly confronted, and how can we reject Laophaire’s famous father, Niall of the Nine Hostages, or his father, Cormnc Mac Art, the great lawgiver? Nor can we accept " the blaze of scholarship *’ which filled Ireland in the fifth and subsequent centurics, as Mr. Holbrooke is good enough to admit, with his view that the country up to that time was savage or barbarian. That would have be'en a development more miraculous than any of the legendary doings or comings which he rejects.
