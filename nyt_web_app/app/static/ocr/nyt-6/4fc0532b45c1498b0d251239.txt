He is a boM man, tills author, to handle . the theme he has chosen In the way he ; does. That theme is the ruin wrought by j misguided	women—good women and
worldly women—in the lives of their chil- I dren. The society -which is chosen for ex- i pioltation Is that very fascinating and com- ] plex one which; the British, aristocracy has 'evolved and made into a fetich. Very plainly Mr- Sturgis understands a good deal aboot that society; very plainly also j he is a pessimist with regard to it--
The Marquis of Belchamber is a shy youth, lame and bookish, - who. has inherited from a long line of rakish ancestors a constitution much impaired, and from i his Scottish mother a morbid, Calvinistic j conscience. This mother, a grim person of uncompromising evangelical morals, ( has managed the estate-.dnringher \son's ’ minority and ruled .the Jaoy with.-an iron i hand. There Is a younger brother who Is j a healthy young animal* fond of sport, | and by all old-fashioned. British standards j better fitted for a Marquisate. But he ifl ' an unstable youth and'early takes to the I sowing of wild oat3 and the'keeping of j
bad company.____In particular he falls in j
love with a florid young woman in a | chorus- ’tVTjile his mild elder brother is trying to deliver him by diplomacy from this siren the evangelical mother takes a hand in the affair—issuing stern (if hysterical) orders against ** living in sin.” The young man promptly marries the woman. Then the mother sets about getting her eldest bom a wife—not because he has any vocation that way, hut in order that the children of the Babylonish person may not inherit the titles and estates.
Ingenious plans are contrived between the* Dowager and a conscientiously unscrupulous^ social campaigner with a pretty daughter, Cissy, blessed with a specious air of sweet innocence and nothing else. The little lady has already a love affair with a handsome and blackguardly cousin* of Belchamber, but she is persuaded to sell herself. The shy and unsophisticated young Marquis, for his part* is easily entrapped—though Cissy’s prenuptual sulks make him urge her ** in God’s name not to marry him unless she really wants to.’* He is not at all in love —only kindly disposed toward a pretty girl and ready to please his mother and do his duty. In the tragedy which follows the author has drawn mercilessly the hard lines of the real Cissy, who makes it clear on her wedding night that ' the marriage is to be merely nominal. Then she proceeds to enjoy her ill-gotten gains and continue the intrigue with the blackguardly cousin. Presently the young and gay Marchioness of Belchamber is delivered of a son—and the Marquis acknowledges the child as his own after a fearful inward struggle and a conversation with the lady which is on her §ide a marvel of brutal frankness. The husband's reasons are complex, but not impossible of comprehension.
Of course the nxnher neglects the child, and the poor Marctuis finding how it is is moved to take it under his own wing and grow pathetically fond of it. In the I event it dies.	'	I
So the story runs. The course of it to the end seems as you read it as inevitable as any course could be; granted the persons, granted the conditions, it must be what is is. And the persons seem to us very human and the conditions very possible; some of the situations most grimly dramatic. The evil that all do—good and had alike—is, except in the case of the blackguard, done for motives ^either socially approved or morally or humanly appealing. It is, in fact, the tragedy of misguided motives; an eloquent arraignment of the world-old fashion, of trying to make young people something they are not in order to attain results which tradition has consecrated as desirable. As a story the thing holds the reader pretty hard—perhaps by the force of the truth that is in-it. By the way,, there’s a. sort of old-fashioned, touch about some of it, and now and then a suggestion or Thackeray. v. r". •	*	y	-	v
