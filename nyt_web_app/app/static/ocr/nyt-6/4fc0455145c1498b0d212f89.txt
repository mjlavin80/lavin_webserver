Headers of ADv Whitson’s former books 6 win^greet with pleasure a new novel from I . hisp'en. * justiri Wingate, * Ranchman/* Is I fairly brfstUng with Western conditions. | It deals largely -with the political struggle between ranchmen and fanners, and it contains the perilous situation^ of a train hold-up/A prairie fire, a cattle stampede.
It Is. full of vigor and “ go/* packed with -the virile life of the West, and, like ** The Rainbow Chasers/' is a wonderfully vivid presentation of the largeness of Western horizons.
It contains a double romance—perhaps •we may say a triple one. There are the loves, worthy and unworthy, of young men and maidens, and the more unusual story of the love of a deserted husband for a faithless wife who had obtained a divorce from him. Mr. Whitson is'not so happy in his love stories as in his politics and adventure. His young lovers do not engage more than a languid Interest; the devotion of the wise and kind physician to the fair shell of a base nature arouses something very like contempt. The reader has the unusual impulse to “ skip ” the love scenes and to devote himself to the strenuous life.
** Itim ’* Is a novel with the love left out,
if w& remember aright, so, practically, is
*' Lord Jim.’* Why do not more writers
have the courage to follow two such ori-
flammes of fiction? If to make his hero
propose, a writer must fairly put his knee into the reluctant lover’s back, as Barrie declares is his own frequent custom, why not let the young man alone to throw himself into politics, or fight fire, or do any other heroic, unsentimental thing his nature prompts? Mr. Bernard Shaw avers that man’s one desire is to elude pursuing woman on matrimony bent. Suppose our novelists occasionally let him elude, and permit us to see what comcs of it. We are sure Mr. Whitson’s dramatic books and finely typical characters will suffer naught from the elimination of a romantic element in which he is not quite as much at home as he is among the men and af-	I
fairs of the West he knows and loves so	I
well.	I
