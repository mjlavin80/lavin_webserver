I The amazing: frequency of the unfavorable criticisms upon the genius of Shake— speare which of late abound in various newspapers and periodicals is a fair criterion by which to estimate the actual dimensions ot the mind of many a. reader
1 and critic in this prosaic and mercenary
l age. And, if such platitudinous and shallow criticisms will produce any effect at all it musv^of necessity, be a pernicious and demoralizing one, for, aside from the Question proper—the purely literary ques-tion—as to the greatness or inferiority of Shakespeare's genius, moral conduct, &c„ we also are obliged to consider the moral effect of shattering one of humanity’s greatest Idols, a most potent factor in the education and molding of our minds and the inspiration to not a few of the thousands of our writers! ** Hero worship/' whether it takes the form of worshipping those whose heroism is founded upon physical deeds or distinctions, aa those who have distinguished themselves by performing valorous deeds upon the field of battle, or, in a higher state of society, by honoring those who have achieved glory in the domains of science, literature, poetry, or ethical virtue and humanity, is forever an essential adjunct of civilized society and its moral well being, as their greatness and noble examples act as our ever-ready instructors and as our guides and inspirations and their' wreaths of laurel and the universal acclaim with which their various efforts are received and re* warded will instigate us with the desire of emulation, but woe Is to the being who can only show his brilliancy by jeering and scoffing at everything noble and sacred, and who, 'among the great galaxy of all the world’s superior intellects, fails to find one gifted soul which shall spur him on to seek perfection and move him to exclaim, “Behold I have at last found a model in which to cast my unmolded clay I " if we despise the obsequious bowing of the head and the blind worship of unsubstantiated authority we can neither admire the prejudiced and superficial scoffer who jeers at and derides everything that all his fellow-beings have good reason to consider as something that fs possessed of superlative merits, and for the sole and nnly reason that his Soul, accustomed as it is to trifling mediocrities, fails to conceive the superior beauty and grandeur of those works.
The past century, with the help and medium of speculative deduction and sometimes unsubstantiated assertions, has distinguished herself by pulling down and destroying the cherished ideals and beliefs of humanity, and well do we know and feel the pernicious effect it has wrought upon the human mind. So it is time, if we desire that a remnant of reverence and higher intuition be saved to us, to inaugurate an era of constructive criticisms and sciences instead of our present system, which is, mainly, one continuous negative.
