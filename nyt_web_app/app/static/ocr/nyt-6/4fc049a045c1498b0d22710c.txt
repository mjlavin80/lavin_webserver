A large volume of letters is shortly to be 1 issued by the John Lane Company. It contains the '* Memoirs of a Royal Chaplain, 1720-1763," and consists of the correspondence of Edmund Pyle, D. D., Domestic Chaplain to George II., with Sam-ual Kerrich, D. the Vicar of Dorslng-ham and Rector of Wolferton and West Newton- The letters have been annotated and edited by Albert Hartshorne. The memoirs are now brought to light for the first time. Together with the letters they form part of the collection of some 7,000 epistles of the families of Rogerson, Pos-tlethwayt, Gooch, and Kerrich. The editor’s father married the younger daughter of Thomas, the only son of Samuel Kerrich. Mr. Hartshorne writes about the contents in his preface, to which he has appended two'long biographical chapters on Pyle and Kerrich:
A marked feature of the correspondence is the almost continuous reference to controversies that were some of them raging and others dying out, and while one welcomes the vindications by men like Gibson, Waterland, Butler“ War burton, and Sherlock, it is rather a relief to turn from the bewildering contests * * * to quiet scholars like Pearce and Jortln. * * * Turning for a moment to the politicians, it may not be doubted that, making due allowance for his party feeling, public life is truthfully presented by Pyle; and that, glaring and true as is the light he streams upon the Church of the time of George II., that which he sheds upon the State is as just and reliable.
The letters are given exactly as Pyle wrote them, except that contracted words have been extended and some of the numerous capitals discarded.
