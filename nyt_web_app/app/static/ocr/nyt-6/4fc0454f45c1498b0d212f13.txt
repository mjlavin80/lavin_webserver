SS5SJ1R6f. HEN^t- T* jSTEPHEN-SON.in .his bdok on. ’‘ Shakespeare’s London," -has relied. on' Stow*s’ “Survey of Lon-<lon,’’ which dates from Shakespeare*sj timb; but he lias gone to "other sources, and, as he says,*. '* attempted wlth great care to verify *iils facti?	book, as
a resuit, is interesting a\icl' 'apparently correct fri its statements." He. begins by describing the people ~ for whom . Shakespeare wrote—a credulous folk, he calls them, fond of display and fine clothes, of gossip, of good times generally. They were not quarrelsome, hut they, enjoyed fighting, and London of to-day, despite Its greater size, is much Quieter than it •was In Shakespeare’s time. The old London, however, had a clearer atmosphere, though Hs streets were dirtier, because ' householders got rid of garbage by throwing it into the gutters. It was not until thirty years after Shakespeare's death that they were ordcrect not to throw offal into the streets, buf‘to bring It out and lay it in the gutter after ,0 in the night. Undoubtedly this restriction was considered a long step in the direction of reform.
London, largely a city of wood in Shakespeare's time, was remarkable for its many churches and taverns. “ Often," says Mr. Stephenson, “ Stow finishes the description of an unimportant street with the words, ' containing many fair houses and divers taverns:’ " * The city was walled, and its principal streets were only four—Cheapside, frQm Newgate to Ald-gate, east and west; - Blshopsgate Street, from Bishopsgate south to London Bridge; from Ludgate east to the Tower, and Thames Street, parallel with the river from Blackfriars to the Tower. St. Paul’s, the cathedral of London, was a great place of resort—not, however, because of any popular religious feeling, but because it was an exchange for merchants of all kinds. The middle aisle of the n^ve was called " Paul's Walk." an<T there men and women of the middle and lower classes sauntered \ip and down for a couple of hours daily. Jonson> Bobadil was a frequenter of Paul's Walk. At one column lawyers congregated; at another men and boys waited to be hired by those looking for servants; tailors displayed their cloths at a third, and all through the crowd pushed peddlers crying their wares. Services went on, however; but the choir boys would occasionally leave their places to collect “ spur money " from some man .who had passed from th#» walk into the choir with his spurs on his boots. The first lottery on record In England was drawn In the churchyard: and more than one unhappy person was executed just before the door of the church. Popular misinformation made Sir John Beauchamp’s tomb, in a corner of the nave, that of the Good Duke Humphrey of Gloucester; and before it penniless men waited, hoping that some friend might invite them to a meal. When the friend failed, they simply '* dined with Duke Humphrey "—went unfed.
In Shakespeare's tfme, and even for a century afterward, the river was the great thoroughfare for London:	Hun-
dreds of boatmen rowed back and forth with passengers; for the streets were not especially pleasant even for lhe people of the time. "Westward Hoi” cried a person wishing to go up the river toward Westminster; " Eastward Ho! ’* he would call If he wished to go downstream. There were swans on the river, besides boats; and fish in its waters, too. in those days. The principal pageants of the time were water borne—the streets were too narrow to admit of many persons seeing the displays. Even in Pepyss times, fifty yea!rs later, the chief possessions were on the river. All land parades, however, were certain to pass along Cheapside, which was a part of the only thoroughfare across the city."
There was only one bridge across the Thames In Shakespeare’s time and for years afterward—cld London Bridge. Its narrow arches penned the water In, so that when the tide turned there was a fall of several feet on the upper or the lower side of the bridge. This fail was employed to turn water wheels, which forced water into the mains supplying the street pumps. The bridge was covered with houses, in which were shops of many kinds; and first at the north end and later at the Southwark side it was the custom to post the heads of traitors and felons who were decapitated. Sir Thomas More's head was stuck on a pole on the ! bridge, and fell into his daughter's lap as she was being rowed under the arch j above which it hung.
Outside of the city stretched the Strand, leading to Westminster. The houses of the nobles built along the Strand fronted not on the street, buL on the river, and
