As the successive volumes of this revised and enlarged edition of Bryan’s ** Dictionary of Painters and Engravers " has come from the presg^under the direction of Dr. Williamson, we have repeatedly taken occasion to praise the work of the editors in their discrimination in excluding unimportant material, in the care they have shown in selecting new names worthy for incorporation in such a monu-" mental work. Moreover, the scheme of j classification and alphabetical arrangement has strongly appealed to us, and the pictures noted for their selection, number, and the photographic and artistic care with which they have been reproduced in photogravure and half-tone. Since the first edition was published much docu-I mentary evidence has been discovered concerning Dutch, German, and various j Italian painters, so that in many cases the artists and engravers Interested have J been treated afresh in the light of these discoveries. The Russian school has been expanded and the rOles of its members^ judged. .
It may be even repeated here what has been said concerning the mere numerical scope of the work; how 1,200 new biographies have been added, how upward of 4,000 corrections and alterations in names, dates, and other matters of fact have been made by Dr. Williamson and his assistants. We may be pardoned, therefore, in the face of the- fulsome praise already uttered, if we make two ftems of adverse criticism—one is in regard to judgment and the other concerns facts. We are told in the introduction, apropos of American -artists, that »** the names of
H.	Sargent, W* Sartain, James Sharpies.
H.	Stone, W. O. Stone, A. W. Thompson, Edwin L. 'Weeks, R. W. Weir, S. L. Wenban, A. Wright, and E. A. ^illis represent this rapidly growing body of workers," What of Lansel, Fuller, Durand, Inness, Martin, and Wyant?- The biographical sketches attached , to the names actually included in^the volumes are meagre, careless,* and inaccurate. Why did Dr. Williamson and his assistants seek to kill off William Sartain with the legend: “ He died in 1801”? Sartain we believe, has still many years of good work before him.	.
