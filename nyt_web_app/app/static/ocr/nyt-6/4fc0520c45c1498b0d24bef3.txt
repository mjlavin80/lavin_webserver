The only real difference between Mr. I ttoger Pocock's ** Curly *' and the noisy tales of courtiers and cavaliers that nowadays are—or yesterday were~so much to tho popular taste, is, that Mr. Pocock has put in the place of the usual romantic and probably imaginary gallants of the past the very much alive cowboys, miners, robbers, and Sheriffs whose business keeps them in the Arizona desert.
Yet ** Curly," if degraded to the cheapness of paper covers, would almost certainly be called a '* dime novel ** of the most virulent type, while its more aristocratic counterparts in the fiction lino shine as historical novels and take much credit unto themselves tor being both instructive ana elevating.
It would perhaps be a stretch of the imagination to call " Curly" elevating, but it is immensely entertaining, and there are several among the rough characters whose deeds enliven its pages that exhibit the simple, primitive virtues in a manner far from unimpressive. Moreover, although there is a thrill awaiting I the reader at every corner and blood enough flows hi the course of the narrative to make the French Reign of Terror ,seem an extremely tame period in history, the story is a cleart one from cover to cover, as fresh and breezy as the wild, free life which it aims to picture. It is pistols, not swords, that Mr. Pocock’s braves flourish on the slightest of excuses, or even none at all, and they make the most loyal friends and the most savage enemies that it has ever been our pleasure to become acquainted with.
" Curly,1' whose daring recklessness upon all occasions furnishes the most nerve-destroying thrills in the book, is really the daughter of the leader of a band of robbers who finds It convenient to masquerade as his son, and the story is told by one Chalkeye, a Texas rancher, who once started out to find the Pacific Oeean, but somewhere near the edge of Arizona fell in with an Irish lord and his son who needed his help in fighting off a band of bloodthirsty Apache Indians, and there his quest for the " big water ended. Lord Balshannon and the Honorable James du Chesnay put up such a thoroughly British fight against great odds that Chalkeye’s loyalty was won for good, and henceforth his deadly aim and faithful heart were entirely at those gentlemen’s service. They needed them both, as it turned out, for Balshannon was pur- , sued by a former tenant who had suffered eviction at his hands and had sworn In the most melodramatic language thus:
** The time will come when, driven from this, your new home, without a roof to cover you or a crust to eat, your wife and boy turned out in the desert to die, you will plead for ^even so much as a drink, and it will be thrown in your face. I shall not die untij I have seen the end of your accursed house.’*
It became the business of Chalkeye and ■ Curly (who incidentally fell in love with the Honorable Jim) to see that this awful threat of Mr. George Ryan’s was not carried out; but, for the sake of accompanying excitement, it was, almost to the letter, and then vengeance Is wreaked upon Ryan and his son in two battles, that, for sheer dreadfulness of details would seriously alarm any other pen than Mr. Pocock's.
“ My turn first! ” says Crazy Hoss.
*' Take off his ear, Crazy! **”
The shot took Ryan’s right ear: then Spotty fired, lopping off the left. Tho poor brute tried to bolt, but a bullet swung him around. He lifted his hands for mercy, but the next smashed his wrist. He screamed, and a bullet caught his teeth. Curly was yelling now, but nobody noticed, for Ryan was down on his knees and his face was being ripped to pieces.
It sounds unnecessarily savage even for
Arizona outlaws, but Mr. Pocock’s read-
1 ers will agree that Ryan deserved just I
about what he got. So many things hap- I
j pen in this story that there is not much
I room left in which the author may de-
' velop his characters, but at Yeast Balshannon, Chalkeye, and Curly have very distinct individualities, and the softening of Curly’s nature under the influence of her affection for Jim Is indicated willi much skill ancl delicacy. In spite of all the bloodshed things end hopefully enough for all who engage the reader’s sympathies. Mr. Pocock evidently knows what ; the Arizona desert and its denizens are like, and, better still, he has tho ability to convey that knowledge to the world, Chalkeye is worth becoming acquainted with, even as was Pinerty, the sandhouso man, and the peculiar slang or dialect in which he holds forth is simply enchanting.
