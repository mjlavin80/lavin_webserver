Classified List of American Publican tions Prepared by the State Library-
TENTATIVE list of the best books of 1904, numbering 1,000 titles, selected from 8,201 books published in America, was lately prepared by the New York State Library. This list, roughly classified, was submitted to the Librarians or the State, and to other persons for a vote as to which r-0 should be firgt chosen for a village library. The following table of results includes a'j titles, embracing books which received the highest vote in each class, arranged in each group in the order of votes. The former plan of listing the 50 books which actually received the most votes has been far from satisfactory, being often rather an index of popularity than of practical value. The present scheme was adopted in the hope of more useful results. A composite vote on new books, based as it too often is, more on hearsay than on personal acquaintance, and almost certain to show a few widely read novels in the lead, is never satisfactory. Probably no one of the vot-rrs will fully approve the list below, which should not be mistaken Tor the deliberate recommendation of the Librarians of the State. The State Library will issue later its annotated list of 250 books of liX)4 recommended to small libraries. REFERENCE BOOKS.
