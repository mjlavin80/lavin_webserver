Of the two sports, fishing is the more . generally possible to the multitude; therefore its literature is far more extensive than that of the gun. and of the recent idyls upon this theme 1 have chanced across none at once more convincing in narrative and graceful in diction or readable to novice and sportsman alike than An Angler's Hours,” written by H, T. Sheringham, angling editor of The Field, (English.)
In his introduction, in which he artfully declines to apologize for adding another volume to Blbliotheca Piscatoria, on the score that his is such an unpretentious little one, he declares that
I cannot argue. Sir, but fish I must and will, . is a sentiment not unworthy the consideration of most anglers* and it could well be adopted by those of them who are impelled to write of their pastime. In fact. I hereby adopt it, and so an end to this matter of necessity. * * % 1 have not heard or seen it suggested that anglers are yet weary of reading about their sport. * * * Were I to formulate a wish as to Lhe future of these skeubos. it would be that my readers might find in them one tithe of the pleasure that I hai'e had from so many books on angling. There are volumes which I read again and again with never-failing delight, and which are to me an intrinsic part of the contemplative man's recreation. * * * Should some other anglers catch here and there a memory or so, a murmur of streams, a gleam of sunshine, or a thrill of Spring from my rage?, I shall be well satisfied.
No one can read these sketches, bubbling over with the poetry of vitality blended with a subtle humor, without following this angler, at least in spirit, through his fisherman’s paradise and -sharing the wholesome influence of his hours. Let him who seldom if ever sees sunrise read “ At Dawn of Day ” or the man whose daily outlook, and that partly from choice, is the asphalt pavement, enter “The Inviolable Shade" and the pursuit of the ^mythical grayling, or May Day on the Exe, and become at once a convert to Charles Kingsley’s prescription of “ Six weeks every year among crag and heather ” for the city man’s holiday. Such a one will at once begin to study catalogues of fishing tackle and time tables, for with us it is not as with those self-contained islanders whose smallest meandering- stream has both depth and protected angling possibilities. “ A February Pike '* is commended to both lovers and tellers of fish stories. *' So terrible was he. said one, that when he left his lair the river retreated before him, fleeing impetuously over its banks, taking refuge in the water meadows; so ravenous was lie. said another, that moorhens and ducks shunned the spot, herons dared venture no nearer than half a mile, and even an otter had been seen in the gray dawn hastening away

-	fluenza worth while.*’ "	'
Once more I must quote, this time from the last narrative—A Suburban Fishery—a place affected by the fortunate Londoner who would go a-fishing cfn his week-end holiday, the difference between his morning and ^evening attitude, on that day being delightfully portrayed.	1
In the morning the brotherhood is_. brisk and full of hope; it has a long day all its own; it snuffs pure air; it'fits together its rod *wlth 'Speed; care and worry are things unknown, But in the‘everting; tWfe brotherhood lingers and dallies with regret; it has spent its long day with In* -■adequate result; it no longer snuffs the I pure air—it breathes it in -with low sighs’
It, takes’down its rod slowfly, almost sadly; the shadow of .London seems to be’ upo4 it once more. * '* In the case of a 'foxy I tunate brother who Is accompanied by a veteran on his return journey the melan*- j choty subsequent on irrevocable delights Is no doubt sensibly lessened, if not altogether removed; and even for the less successful there is always the consolation of knowing -that next Saturday 'is but a week hence.
SesT^nid this is the best part of all outdoor sport, of all one's struggling with •the earth and sea, wind and wave- Nat-urc, the unconquerable, always gives us ! the everlasting hqpe of " next time " that kept the stone of Sisyphus uprolling.
Francis Hobart Herrick prefaces the, revised edition of his volume "Home Life of Wild Birds " with the phrase,. j " Come, let us live with the birds! " but j with the recollection of some of the methods of so doing as set forth in the orig- | inal edition in mind we are very dubious j as to whether the birds care to be lived, with or whether many of the observations ) made are of any value save the gratifying of curiosity, which docs not count.-The old-time way of watching a bl£d‘ brooding and tending its young, employed by both male and female bij^l students7 Mrs. Olive Thorne Miller being one of tlie pioneers of her sex» was the obliteration of self as nearly as possible, so that the comings and goings of the bird family might be free and untrammeled.
Frank M. Chapman and many others use a color protective tent or shelter of some' sort that represents a tree trunk : or other natural object that does not i arouse suspicion, from which they make ' their observations. Mr. Herrick is not content with this only, but brings within range of, his tent the nest and what he calls " its immediate surroundings, such as a twig, branch, hollow" trunk, stem, or whatever part of a tree the nest may occupy."
From this point on his arguments In favor of the value of observations made after the altered conditions are illogical. He takes an oriole’s nest, swinging in a leafy branch forty feet in the air. cuts off the nesting bough, and sets it up four feet above the ground in a good light, so that the branch and nest shall occupy tlie same relative positions which they did before.
The very fact that Baltimore orioles never build in such close proximity to the ground is quite sufficient to alter the general plan of life, and action observed under the new ■conditions can never be consideied typical, while if any considerable number of amateurs should undertake thffc method of transplanting birds and nests for the purpose of study and photography the destruction of bird life must be taken into account, and after ail is this game ivorth the candle? The article on Tent and Camera, the Tools Of Bird Photography, contains some good advice,
1 ut the author does not evidently fully appreciate the advantage, or rather necessity, of the Graph lex camera in rapid instantaneous work, which alone gives the true portrayal of Lhe living bird, and prefers to force the bird to come to his level and there observe it at leisure.
However, in spite of artificial methods of observation, Mr. Herrick has had many interesting experiences with everyday birds en passant.
The chapter on Life and Instinct, quite the best in the book, is full of good sound advice to the gay and irresponsible throng of faiv weather observers, who draw conclusions either upor. insufficient evidence or mere hearsay.
The numerous illustrations are some-iimes interesting. but fail to develop anything particularly new, and merely as photographs but few rise above medioc- | rity, for nowadays bird photography, as exemplified by Chapman, Job, Dugmore, j and several others, is a fine art, in proof j of which statement one only has to turn tho pngHK of H. K. Job’s " Wild Wings," rich in its pictures, to be convinced.
How different the spirit and conception of this book from that of the volume previously mentioned! Under a spirited picture of Kittiwakes and other sea birds winging above North Bird Rock thatN heads the preface, the author writes:
M The above picture may serve to suggest the feelings which have animated tne in

Then again: ■*' Of all -tne ^various out--dbor recreations which I have tried, when ;It comes to genuine, exciting sport, give me -hunting with the carnerra."
And so he takes us on his hunting trips, ,and by the camera shares the .game with us to our delight and betterment, while the Cities of the Brown Pelican, the Cape Sable * Wilderness,; the Great Cirthbert Rookery, Virginia Bird Homes of "Beach and Marsh, -the Egdist in "Nature 'and in Fashion, Birds of the Sea, and-the Elusive Shore Birds, all * pass before us, and we become friends with them, and finally wc are t^Lk^n into the fastnesses of the forest to hear 0*1 Secrets. As to the picture thoy are a delight alike in their quality as in the fact that they lire usually taken at the crucial moment. Without doubt this book Is a contribution to the -world’s sanity, while at the same time its science is duly respected.
As Mr. Job ends his book with the owl, so R. Bosworth Smith In " Bird Life and Bird Lore" wwlvas.-ois-opeping chapter about the sauie topic, about which he quotes the Soripturcs, the classics, and Shakespeare in addition to much Interesting an£ curious information of his own collecting. In fact, it is the combination of incomparable historic surroundings, the influence of heredity and tradition combine‘3 with conservative personal observation, that make books of this cUlss so readable to those living-^outside the magic circle they describe. -
We love to read of the Took and the raven, and the old thatched rectory and Its birds are inexpressibly charming to those whose houses are considered unthrifty unless frequently painted, which necessitates the pulling" down of vines and clearing away tempting bird nooks.
A feeling of kinrfhip is awakened when the mallard is dwelt upon. He is our. wild duck also, and we revel in the day on a Norfolk mere, and while we do not covet
