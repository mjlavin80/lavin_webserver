If things go by contrasts this undoubtedly should be a boolj for Summer reading; dealing as ft does with the frozen hardships of the north. Most of these ten stories have appeared before in magazine form, but gathered together now in a single volume they make a remarkably strong collection. There is no faint-heart-"" ed mincing of words In them, the pictures they present are sometimes repulsive, but always virile, whether the story they tell be that of a rescue along th& trail, the vengeance of an infuriated enemy* the maraudings of a drunken miner, or the heroism that crons out in the daily lives of these men who ptand always in. the midst of death.	~
In all of the Stories Mr. Beach sounds again and again- the simple note of the loyalty of one man to another, regardless whether that other be friend or foe. The j feuds in th? Klondike run bitter and_ene-mies are implacable. For instance, Bi^ George, the whaler, never forgave Fathey Orloff, the most feared missionary in the I whole breadth of the country, for crip' pUng* in the coM. Between Father Orloff j and Big George had smoldered a f^ud of many years* standing. At last came Father Orloff, hot upon the trail of George, revenge in his heart/ and blood in his eye. But the trail was long antr~the blizzard raged for days, and when Orloff reeled before him George saw the enemy snow blind and in his power. But murder was not the part of the-whaler. Together with his partner they succored Father Orloff tha-t George might fight squarely with
-	*iim when he should be a man again. But a!a$! that day was never to come. They dragged him raving mad to the Mission House and George waited without until
-	the doctor came." '
