3CIOLOGY has been subjected’ to scorn because of the uncertainty and loose limitations of its’ subject matter. Prof. Ross in his introductory chapter cites so many definitions and descriptions of the science as to give some justification for Stills, and to promote jspme uncertainty the mind of the inquiring. There are ^ioany social sciences, but sociology claims --them all for its own, for each is not the : ' exclusive field of action of certain im-‘"pulses, but is reacted on by all the others. Sociology is like a tree, the special social , v sciences being its branches; but it is a -banyan tree, and each of the great '-"branches throws down shoots which take root and give it independent support. ' The solution of the larger social problems demands not only special data, but also the light of general principles; not ' merely facts, but the sympathetic connections that bind one series of phenomena with another. We must also know what has been. Prom this history and these principles may be built up a general social theory. It will be long, however, as Prof-Ross points out, before sociology becomes so cxact that it can ajCflrm of a policy:
*' This is scientific; consider no other." What he hopes for^is that, as the laws of social phenomena come to light, many extreme proposals will be barred from consideration and the intelligent public will centre its attention upon a smaller number of policies. His instances of this are the elimination of autocracy and anarchy as projects of government and of sacrament and contract as theories of the marriage relation. The growth of sociology, he thinks, is likely to confine within narrower limits and focus upon an ever smaller number of measures the discussion relating to family, property, association, education, crime, pauperism, colonization, migration, class relations, race relations, war, and government. _
Here is a large contract for sociology; yet, if it is ever to be anything more than a vague statement of vague ideas, it is just this sort of thing that it ought to look forward to. At present, as Prof. Ross admits, an authoritative body of social theory exists “ as aspiration rather (ban fact.” His style is rather exuberant, but it is picturesque and rapid, and though it sometimes has the aspect of a jargon of his own, it is not unintelligible, and is generally Interesting. In his discussion* of fundamental matters he has scarcely attempted to go further than the laying of foundations, but in this he has opened many promising fields of discussion, Tiius, in speaking of the close relations of economics with sociology, he shows how many things there are that take the economist off his own highway into bypaths of other sciences, all demanding investigation. The truth' is that mankind really behaves in an uneconomic manner. And the collapse of the stuffed
I doll, known to earlier economists as the “ economic man," has vastly increased the questions that ar^ forced upon the student. As the author observes, for one instance, the tame treatment of the consumption of wealth by most economists has been due to a dim perception of many factors which are not economics.
The facade type of expenditure that lavishes on show and luxuries and scrimps on necessaries goes with*, a development that removes old landmarks and stimulates social ambitions. * * * Our buggies and parlor organs, our plated silver and veneered furniture are as eloquent of equality as our corridor car§.
*	* • The desire for parasols, billiard tables.’ and bathrooms descends in a series of cascades from the social superior to the social inferior, and we can distinguish a society in which each class imitates the class just above it, from one in which tho decay of reverence permits tho humblest grades to ape as well as they can the topmost grade, and so produce the sweeping uniformities of democracy.
In interpreting the actions of men there are social laws to be taken Into account as well as economic. But earlier investigators have brought in here an “ objective " statement of the behavior of associated men, and an excessive reliance upon superficial analogies between social facts And ^>thsr facts, both of which must be gotten rid of. Thus Spencer’s demonstration of his law of evolution as applicable to society is subject to criticism that invalidates much of it. There is too much analogy, too little patient digging to get at the specific causes of observed tendencies. Mr. Ross laments that a generation of sociologists spent their time gathering the Dead Sea fruit of analogical and genetic laws, instead of seeking those laws of causation that are the peculiar treasure of a science. Within a few years, however, scholars have thrown themselves into the quest of true causes, and their researches have taken from sociology the reproach of barrenness.
Several of Mr. Ross's chapters arc devoted to an examination of some of the

Another interesting topichjs-- that of ** Mob Mind . the. sharing by. a vast public (owing to our space-annihilating devices) of the same rage, alarm, enthusiasm, or horror; the craze or fad, the, wave of national feeling resulting in, a war fever or a political landslide, a sympathetic strike, booms, panics, and so on. In bis treatment of the ** Properties of Group Units" he shows that^the properties displayed by a social group depend for one thing on the characteristics of the units, but that they are also influenced by the pseudo-personality of the mob; on the way . in which the members of such a group will act, and on the mode of their combination. Large assemblies put an end to thinking; the minds that gather in small assemblages fecundate one another. Crowds destroy, but never build up. Great beneficent forces are organized, and the corporation is the highest in intellectual superiority, though in Its means it is less scrupulous than most other collectivities.
Social evolution, In Prof. Ross’s opinion, is not merely a phase of cosmic evolution, as some would have It. They have neglected the distinction between the factors of a purposed event and the factors
of the volition that brings it about. Thus, the local distribution of immigrants can be expressed in terms of purpose; in going further back to account for their purpose, we comc upon considerations relating to climate, soil, water, timber, and the like. Again there must be distinction between needs and wants; for It is actual desire rather than what they ought to want that controls the behavior of people. The study and classification of these forces have occupied many sociological writers and the interpretation of them occupies Mr. Ross in a rapid but interesting and suggestive survey, from which he concludes that only a knowledge of human wants and a recognition of the great variety of springs that incite men to action can rescue the science from onesided theories. .
The factors of social change, static and dynamic, making for equilibrium and for change—not social evolution or social progress—form the subject of another discussion that touches on innumerable phases of history. The chapter on *' Recent Tendencies in Sociology ” takes the
S	form of an examination, analysis and | criticism of the theories formulated by
sociological students—on -many, aspects' of .the -science. . It leads to a .final state-■ ment of the theoryrot-.social' selections as • bearing .upon tho, dec^dence ofznations, -as j showing hgwthe very .institutions that make a people greataxid happy rnay brins in at last a race decadence,whlch jpres-entiy announces itself ,-in^.a -social.-de-! cline. “ Qualitative reasoning, on . selec- ■ tion has reached its zenith, :however.’* It Is an easy solvent of hard problems, from which fertile minds have gotten out about all there is,;in it.” The .next pressing task is not to hunt for new selective agencies, but to measure the relative importance of those already recognized:	'
. *
We need significant facts—above all, the counting of numerous similar facts—in order to advance further in the appraisal of social Institutions.- There is coming a new Darwin, who will spend half, a lifetime in patiently collecting all facts that throw light on the siftings and screenings of human beings by social agencies.
Such a Darwin's calm exposure of the bearing of policy and institution and or-ganiv-ation on the relative increase of breeds and stocks will determine their vindication or rejection. To all previous standards; , theological, political, ethical, economic, sociological, is added now the biological query: Does it favor the* best breeds? as the final touchstone.
