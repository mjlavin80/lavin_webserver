In his latest novel Mr. Howells, -with hlg own light and brilliant touch, plays a variation upon a theme of which he never tires, the inconsequent womanly. He has faith In the persistence of type, for a distinctly ** new woman/’ a power In the classroom and on the lecture platform, is just as charmingly unreasoning, just as illoglcally subtle, as Is her mid-Victorian aunt. There are but half a dozen actors in the fascinating little drama—the eternally feminine aunt and niece, a thoroughly nice young English lover, (Mr. Howells is no longer rabid in Anglophobia,) one, of those humorous an<T delightful elderly gentlemen whom neither author nor reader could do without; and an unpleasant wedded pair, the husband a mere vacuum, tho wife the most obnoxious woman one could meet in -a Summer's day, but quite essential to Mr. Howells's slender plot, and to the '* inspiration ** of his heroine.
The story belongs to those which we are sure he writes with a twinkle in his eye. We can fancy his whimsical enjoyment of Mrs. Crombie's lucid explanation of her niece’s mental state: “ Well—where was I? Oh, yes! She felt that If she had no doubt about marrying Mr. Craybourne she would have no misgiving about marriage;
or, if she had perfect faith in marriage, she could confidently. trust herself In marrying him. But as she has neither, she can’t.” This is so very like the remarks of " the DuchessM to " Little ! Alice ” that one does not wonder that
“ Grombie rubbed his forehead as If to I clear away a cloud within. * I don't believe I’ve followed you,' he said." In view of a certain much discussed article by our ex-President, it is interesting to note Mr. Howells's allusion to “all the unoccupied human material that goes into women’s clubs.'* The story is full of such deft touches, written in Mr. Howells's happiest mood of gentle irony, and amused tolerance.
None the less, as the publishers state, (publishers do not permit us to find out anything for ourselves nowadays,) is it *' a delicate veiled satire on certain modern ways of doing and thinking.” As in the inimitable ** Reading for a Grandfather,” there is matter enough for serious thought after we have had our laugh at the ways of women, and our delight in the artistry of our dean of letters.
