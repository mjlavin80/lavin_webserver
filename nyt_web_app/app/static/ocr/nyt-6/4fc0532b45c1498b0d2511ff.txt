“ The Pioneer.”
j Now York Times Book Review:
I	recentty read a letter m your columns signed " Bewildered Reader," and making certain criticisms on June Allen, the heroine of Miss Bonner's novel, “ The Pioneer." It struck me that these criticisms were unjust, and I would like to state why I think so.
The " Bewildered Reader '* accuses June Alien of being a woman who is “ bad/' naturally “ immoral or perhaps It is bertter to say unmoral," and one whose “ mental processes are those of a woman who, if fate is kind, may stay on the straight and narrow path, but who, at the first push in the other direction, takes the downward turn."
This seems to me quite unfair, and, In at certain way, untrue. June Alien was a woman capable of a great passion, and women capable of great passions are also capable of great fails. To feel such a love is rarer than the casual observer of life or the casual reader of fiction realizes. Many good women never love, or never love Oil they are wives, and few women of the educated and prosperous classes are ever tempted to fail. The men they love love and respect them, and would as soon think of trying to compass their downfall as of stealing the communion cups from the altar.
But where a woman, capable of a great passion, is unfortunate enough to love a man who courts her pour le mauvals motif, then a struggle takes place where her resistant honor Is staked against the determination of the man's pursuit. This was the tragedy of June Allen. Placing her affections on a base object; she loved to her own misery, and would have Joved to her own damnation if a stroke of fate [ had not saved her. To stigmatize her with the adjective *‘ bad " seems to me
