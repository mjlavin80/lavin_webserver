The very patriotism of the Irish is often its own undoing. Where one Irishman sees that the rules of history are followed on the Emerald Isle as elsewhere, nine of hfs countrymen demand that they shall have been suspended, and that Ireland shall have a history unique and unmatched. One result is that Irish history is generally ignored; that no one but an Irishman ever thinks of it. Yet, stripped of Its heavy dress of tradition, it Is a great history. The history^ just compiled by Charles Johnston and Carita Spencer is an argument in point.
Until the coming of St. Patrick, some time during the fifth century of our era, Irish fiistory is an inextricable tangle of myth, tradition, and fact. Persons who have any claim to write histories of Ireland to-day should recognize that it Is so; It Is not a new idea. Yet Mr. Johnston and Miss Spencer accept the old folklore stories as real, and use them, with only incidental qualification, as II they were verified history. -At the end of the first chapter Is a summary, in which occur these statements: " The golden-haired De Danaans came down from the Baltic Sea and
*	* * proceeded inland. They came into contact with two dark-haired races who already Inhabited Ireland * • * the Fir-bolgs and the Fomormns. * • • To the De Danaans Is attributed the building of the great pyramids along the Boyne. Relics of their art * * * point to a high degree of civilization.” Later we have the story of the success of the Milesians over the De Danaans, " about 1,000 B. C„" the statement that "2,300 years ago Queen Maca built the great fort and-palace of Emain,” the stories of Delrdr£, of the war of Concobar against Medb, Queen of Connaught, of the Servile supremacy from A. D. 50 to A. D. 130, and of the rise of the kingdom of Meath, and finally the statement that " the social life of pre-Christian Ireland was rich and highly developed. Women were highly esteemed; poetry and music were cultivated." There Is a passing suggestion that the *' early history is largely legendary; *’ but the effect of the whole first part of tbe book is that Irish history is quite as well known from B. C. 2,000 to
A.	D. 400 as is that of Greece or Rome after 000 B. C.
It Is unmoral at this age of the world to put such stuff into a book called a history. Fifty years ago the history of Ireland before St. Patrick was recognized as purely legendary; and within a score of years students'have pointed out the mythological character of the legends, how the De Danaans were the powers of light, or the suni conquering the Fomorians and Firbolgs, or powers of darkness; how the great legendary chieftains, Queen Medb, among others, for example, were the gods of the ancient races, personified in later years, and assigned to chronological dates. But the writer of popular Irish history seems to learn nothing and to forget nothing; the consequence is we have the first five chapters ,of Mr. Johnston’s and Miss Spencer’s book—absolutely worthless for any purpose whatever.
The rest of the volume, however, appears to be of some value, at all events in serving as an introductory history of a country which has played an important part in the development of the world, and
seems destined to play a still greater part hereafter. The history of Ireland, painful and troublous as it has been, needs no such factitious additions as are made to H here; It can and should standalone.
