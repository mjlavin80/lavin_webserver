Presidential Elections.
OIR PRESIDENTS AND HOW "WE MAKE THEM. By A. IC. McClure, L.L,. L>. Illustrated. l2mo. Pp. xvl.-fill. New York: Harper & Brothers. $2.
The reissue of Col. McClure’s book in a third edition after five years shows that its value as a collection of historical data, documents, and statistics has been sustained in the scrutiny to which It has been in the meantime subjected. It is considerably more than such ^collection, however, for Col. McClure, out of his half century's experience with National Conventions and acquaintance with the chief actors of both parties in selecting Presidential candidates has gi\en the Inside movements of some of our important National struggles which have not been fully understood by those on the outside. He has told of the inspiration and organization of all the political parties, and has given many personal reminiscences of the political leaders with whom he has come Into contact. His method is to treat each political campaign in chronological order, describing the political situation at the time, the issues involved, the men who were prominent, the menoeuvrings and Incidents of the preliminary and final campaigns. In each case a table of balloting in the conventions is given, and in many cases copious extracts from the platforms are added. From the year of Taylor's nomination, in 1S48, onward. Col. McClure tells of what happened from his own personal observation, and this personal element makes the later half of the volume much more interesting reading than the earlier.
Absolute accuracy in such a work extending over so long a period of time is scarcely to be hoped for. It is not to be won even In the statistical portion. In his preface to the second edition Col. McClure instances the difficulty_Jie had found with the tables of the popular vote in the National elections. The electoral vote in each case is, of course, established beyond question; but the historian says as to the popular vote:
I have at hand a dozen or moro complete popular election tables giving the full votes for Presidents since electors were chosen by a direct vote of the people. No two of them agree, and there is no way in which absolutely accurate election tables may be obtained.
Consequently he has followed Thomas Hudson McKee's tables in his book entitled “ National -Conventions and Platforms.” There are historical facts that run counter to generally accepted beliefs, and even to what the historians have recorded. Thus it has often been' declared that the single electoral vote cast against President Monroe in 1820 was inspired by the sole purpose to make Washington stand alone as< the only -President who was chosen by the unanimous vote of the Electoral College, As a matter of fact, a student friend of the,author's showed him that Gov, Plumer of New Hampshire, who cast that vote, cUd It. as represented by his own declaration, in his son's biography of him, as. a matter of political principle, because he was opposed to what he considered the extravagance of Monroe's Administration and because he"., believed Adams to be the best equipped man Cor President.	...	..
Col. McClure also, on Mark Hanna's own. authority, has changed the Interpretation he put on tkc^a^optlon of.the gold plank in the Republican, platform of ISiic. Instead of being, as'It.seemed on.the face $f it, a defeat for. Senator ^Hanria, it,was a. result, .so Col. McCiure came, to believe, tof Hanna’s^ “ masterly diplomacy in bringing the disputing elements of the
party In to''harmonious action," producing precisely the' Result* he -was seeking to obtain at S£'Ixuils. - :	: -	* . - -	-
