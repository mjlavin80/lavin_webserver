Ntw Yorb Time*:Boot Bate*:
N MR. SHRADYTS remarks on the battle ofShil6h (New 'York Toceb book Review May 6* he speaks of this bat-tie as being a case of South.-era dash vs. Northern pluck and endurance. This Is the first time it has ever been Intimated that the Southern soldier could be credited with " dash" ! alone. However, his prolonged struggle of four years was evidence conclusive that he possessed all the qualifications of the soldier—patience, endurance, heroism, and dash.
OC Shiloh tbe pluck and endurance of Grant's shattered columns had its tangible form in Buell's Army of the Ohio, 21,513 men, which began its arrival at as early an hour as 5 p. M., the first day's engagement, April (See official reports. Union and Confederate Armies, Series L, Vol. X,, Part L, Page 323.) In addition to this Army of the Ohio there was Major
Gef, Ijew Wailace’s division. 7,50* strong, and with such heavy reinforcements as this “ Northern pluck and endurance ** could reasonably expect to recapture their camps. But even without such reinforcements Beauregard would have withdrawn anyhow. He advised It April 5, and even up to the very, hour of the attack, April he was anxious that the army, without striking a blow, should immediately fall back to Corinth, Miss., its starting point. .
Speaking of the result of the first day’s fight Mr. Shrady says: “ They were checked at nightfall, and had failed to crush the enemy," &c.
If capturing four camps out of five can be regarded as anything, then the crushing had been very effective, and in this fifth and last camp of the Federate there had assembled the remnant of the forces which had been driven from one position to another since the first assault on Prentiss and Sherman's camps in the early morning of April 6, and then other camps afterward.
. And why was not the victory complete? Because of the death of Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston, and at the time he . fell the battle was progressing just as he had planned it, aafl every order was "On," as the Federals were being pressed back to the Intersection of the impassable Snake Creek with the Tennessee River, and here, upon this last camp, thp forces of Bragg, Polk. Hardee, and others were moving when baited by order of Gen. Beauregard. And what a grim example of the irony of fate was this, that the man who was defeated before a shot had been fired should become the medium by which the greatest victory of the civil war was rendered void and ineffective, for Trom the official reports of the Confederate Generals who were leading the victorious columns which were marshaling for this final assault, the conclusion is warranted that the remnant of the shattered Army of the Tennessee, here in this last camp, would have been driven into the river or forced to surrender. In either event It would have eliminated Grant and Sherman, who afterward more than all other Generals upheld the destinies of the North.
And of the soldiers who met in the woods and ravines on that memorable 6th and 7th of April, 1SG2: Mr. Shrady, in speaking of the Pederals, Quotes as follows from Gen. Grant's Memoirs:
“ Three of the five divisions were entirely raw, and many of the men had only received their arms on the way from their States to the field. Many of them had arrived but a day or two before, and were hardly able to load their muskets according to the manuaL Their officers were equally ignorant of their duties.”
This raw material and want ot discipline in no way differed-from the Confederate force in this battle, as may be learned from the following, as quoted from a letter of one of the Colonels who commanded a brigade in engagements of tbe 6th and 7th and subsequently was Major General, and after the war became Senator in Congress from his own State.
He says: " You know I was as ignorant of the military art at that time as it was possible for a civilian to be. I had never seen a man fire a musket. I had never heard a lecture or read a line upon the subject. We were all tyros—all the rawest and greenest recruits—Generals, Colonels, Captains, soldiers." (Life Albert Sidney Johnston. Page 5G5.)
And how was their foe armed, that struggled through floods and over miring roads in a three days’ march, in drenching rain storms, and without the shelter of tents, moving out from its rendezvous at Corinth, to beard the lion in his den. to swoop down upon the Army of the Tennessee within its own camp—a camp of woods, ravines, and boggy places, hazardous for the passage of artillery, and difficult even for Infantry; in short, a natural fortress?
Gen. Bragg, who assisted in organizing the army for the advance, tells of the way it was anuet -shotguns, old muskets—anything, In fact, whether from prehistoric times or of a later date, and for ammunition? Well, Gen. Braga’s accounts can only do justice to the subject and of the “ heterogeneous mass ” which in a few weeks was rushed together to fight one of the great battles of history. He says:
*' Within a period of four (4) weeks frrkr-ments of commands from Bowling Green,
Ky., under Hardee; Columbus, Ky., under Polk, and Pensacola, Mobile, and New Orleans under Bragg, with such new levies as could be hastily raised, all bad-
lyanned.and ,equlpped,;;werc>,-unlted.at> . ‘ and near ^Corinth ■ and tor1-the	tliSo-
organized as an army. v;
" It ?. was- a, heterogeneous r mass; Vln;r which .there, was. more enthusiasm- than: discipline, more capacity than knowledge,., and more-valor than Instruction. Rifles,/ rifled and smoothbore—muskets, Bomp-.of; them originally percussion; others ."hastily altered from flintlocks by’ Yankee1 con-' tractors, many still with the old- flint. and steel,\and shotguns; of ail sizes, and patterns, held place in the satae: regiments,	'
II
The task of organizing such a, command in four, (4)/weeks and supplying it,, especially with ammunition suitable for action, was simply appalling/' ;
So, from the foregoing* it is seen that while the boys on the inside of the rcyrnp? were not perfect in the manual of arms, yet they all had muskets, while the boys on the outside had to capture the mas.-. kets first before they could begin tbei study. And, too, this Army of the Tennessee had soldiers that had smelled gunpowder before, _and liad heard bullets whistle at Donelson and Port Henry, | while of the Confederates there were very few of them that had ever been In j a battle.'	’
Upon the Question of strength of ar-mles, Confederate and Federal, Mr. Shrady thinks the South had a method of reports which gave only a part of its | force, in contrast with the Northern method, wliich included everything, from | commanding General to teamsters, cooks, j and stable boys, and that as a conse-.. quence of these several systems, while 1 tbe face of the reports might make it appear that Jhe Federate had the greStest number of men in tint field, the reality was that thejfighting strength of the armies was about'the same. As an example of special pleading this is very ingenious, to say the least of it, but Vhen | subjected to the unromantic exaction of facts it does not show to such great ad- ' vantage, for if Confederate reports had been for only a part of the troops how could the commissary department ever know as to a supply of rations?	i
You can’t feed a, part of an army and turn the rest out to grass, even though It , should be a Confederate Army, although j It must be admitted that they fought a I long array of battles upon a menu that at times consisted largely of fresh air. But as to the report of tfoops the Confederates cannot lay claim to having inaugurated a new system. Theirs was the same as the Federals—the total for duty was the fighting forcb, and the grand total gave the entire command.
So the contention that the Confederate | reports were In reality no reports at aU, I and that the fighting strength ot the armies was the same, it is gratifying to learn that " Southern dash "c fought so as to make it appear that the strength j of its armies was four or five times their real numbers, something like the Sabine j Pass fight in Texas, where a small battery captured two gunboats and dls- I persed an Invading army, and the expe- , dition possibly reported having encount-” ered an overwhelming force, for the gUns were fought as if they were an “ overwhelming force,” and so‘for four years fought the Confederacy.	>
But the question of the heaviest battalions, having the greatest number of men for any given fight, was Gen. Grant’s solution of the problem of success in the art of war, and this and bis bulldog fighting -made" him the great General that he was. And the North could fill up the ranks of Its slain thousands while i the South could not supply its losses, and the wonder was not that its armies were flnanlly worn out, but that the Confederacy could fight Its battles for so long a time against such overwhelming odds, for the world was the recruiting camp of the Federals, with it3 steamers and ships touching at every port to bring in enlistments to swell the ranks of the home force, and with a full Treasury to supply heavy bounties to encourage enlistments both at home and abroad. '
Mr. Shrady says Southern apologists never fail to underestimate Southern forces, and to exaggerate those of the North. Why, my dear Sir, the foreign enlistments above referred to, with the negro troops alone, more than outnumbered the entire Confederate Array. So says Mr. Cassenove G. Lee (a recognized authority on civil war statistics) in his recent publication, and this force went to strengthen the Federal home enlistments of 2,778,304 men.
The foreign enlistments and the negro troops alone outnumbered the Confederate Army. Yes, Mr. Posterity, it is true enough that the negro did become a warrior—186,017 of them tramped to the drum, not of their own volition, for if left to themselves they never would have fought the Southern people, but the “ great apostles of advance civilization ” forced them to kill and apply the torch, which left In ruins the happiest homes they ever knew “ down on the old plantation.”	•
Mr. Shrady in his letter on Capt. Bat-tine’s “ Crisis of the Confederacy" advances the idea that in preparation of the book records should have been more thoroughly examined. The time-honored injunction, “ practico what you preach," is concrete wisdom, and had Mr. Shrady followed its suggestion before essaying the rOle of critic he never would have placed so low an estimate on the Federal Shiloh force as 33.0U0; an examination of United States Government official reports, Union and Confederate Armies, would have shown him his error.
