The Snare of Politics. ^
THE UTjTIIH AT13 PASSION. By rtilllp Verrill Michels. 32nia. New York: Harper & Brothers. ?t.50.
Mr. Philip Verrill Mighels, who will be remembered as the author of “ Bruvver Jim's Baby," has gone far afield in this new story of his. The war between honor and politics, the love of woman and the love of power, wage fiercely in this story, and poor John Hakon is tossed about In the seething current of affairs like a rudderless ship. An absolutely incorruptible Senator; determined to expose the' blackness of the ring of vile politicians that encircled affairs at Washington, John Hakon soon found himself shelved by this same ring because of his non-support of it. . After it had drawn his fangs, it was like it to again seek to place John Hakon high in public favor— for had not his record of five years before been stainless? Therefore insidiously began an undercurrent of gossip and hint of Hakon’s name for the nomination for President at the Chicago Convention.
But John, still high, of ideal and strong of faith, believed by leaguing him.sclf with the devils—in this case Greystone I the mighty and his minions—he mij:ht i learn their own methods wherewith to fight them fairly. Besides, there was that overmastering political ambition implanted deep in John’s nature which made the more thought of the Presidency send his blood dancing madly through his veins. But if Greystone thought to place a figurehead in the Presidential chair, he had also thought of the personal price John was to pay for his high position. , Greystonc's daughter Clara was past thirty and possessed of few charms, but it was her father’s wish to become father-in-law to a President. Since Hakon
eared for no one else the bargain was made.
That TITr. Mighels has improved greatly since the writing of his former story needs scarcely be said. A simple reading of tho dramatic incidents which follow
thick and fast upon John’s indifferent acceptation? of Greystone’s terms, his meeting with Ruth Sherwood, the antithesis of the fpebie-brained Clara, her almost breathless eagerness for the highest political honors for Hakon, the snares and sensuous charms of Mrs. Meshe, one of the strongest tools in the hands of the unscrupulous Greystone, Hakon's scorn of her thereby arousing the sleeping tiger within her to the fury of a woman scorned— all these characters and incidents rushing heedlessly to their several ends combitic to make a brilliant stage-fun Greystone as the imperious magnate, the Czar of corruption in state affairs, yet had his weak spot as other men, and it was there that Hakon was able at last to strike and turn the knife. Yet, it' it was a personal triumph for him in that last hour when he stood before his chief and Mrs. Meshe and denounced them both, at the same time he signed tile death, warrant to all future political aspirations. As for poor Clara. Mr, Mighels seems to have been rather pitiless with her, who, after all, was more fool than knave.	‘
