I. . ' FROM RE ADERS,
An Oasis in lhe Desert.
Xew York Times Booh Review:	.
A distinguished writer has Izicly told an American audience that the. English tongue is In process of deterioration In this country. Curiously enough, he blames the newspapers for this, or as at least a contributing cause. One would naturally think that newspapers ought rather to help the growth, to improve the efficiency, and emphasize the beauty of the language in which they are written. .
And yet, though comparisons are odious, any one coming from the old country cannot help comparing the London newspaper or even tlie better type of English provincial or Irish metropolitan newspaper with the newspaper of New Yorlc, and deciding proudly and not unfairly, as I venture to tiilnk. In favor of his own. But here let me say that The New York Tijies, and especially the Saturday issue, with its book Review, makes a proud bid for equality with the historic London magazines. It is indeed a veritable oasis in the deserU I have Just been reading The book Review of June 10.
I am at present a visitor in New York and have beep looking about me here. You have a reputation for ** bigness" with Old. World people. Over there we believe that you can do things on a grander scale than any people in the world. I have been gating at the sights of New York, and really it is like gazing at the stars.
Figures have a certain fascination for me ever since I first dwelt on the inexorable logic that underlies exact calculation; and I have stood to count the number of windows on one side of the Flat- . iron Building. Even in The New York Times Book Review of June 10 I have seen the biggest sentence that ever I saw before, I think; and I trust Mr. Harold Berman will forgive my impertinence In calling attention to it as a literary curiosity. It occurs fn his criticism of the critics who would belittle Shakespeare.
And here I may say I am In thorough sympathy with him. Who has not felt that has an eye for Intellectual stature that Shakespeare is the great solitary skyscraper among the world's giant writers? I notice that one—sentence In Mr. Bernam's communication contains no less than 39 printed lines, or 259 words. It is certainly, I think* a curiosity in its way.
That Page 378 of the issue of the 10th Inst, is a really wonderful page. Wbat a revelation of learning on the part of your I readers! I was especially proud of the I splendid erudition of my countryman (I 1 presume he is Irish) Mr. Charles John- i ston, pleading for Ireland's ancient Came. ■ It strfkes me as strange that whether Jt j be the select literature of London or New York, Ireland is always worthily I represented; as she has been on many ^another field of talent and of fame.
