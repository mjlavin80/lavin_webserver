HE YENTTS OP CADIS.”- by
. Richard . Fisguill, is sheer v
■ - ’ . ’ ■ ' melodrama treated In tho
manner of farce. The idea is not new, strictly speaking, but anything is new enough that Is good, and' thla 'book Is very good of its kind. The author has his villain, ahd the villain’s foil, a discarded woman who J? too clever to stay discarded; his hero and .heroine, and a Jealous rival of the. hero, and the scenic environment of all these is picturesquely impressive, sometimes awe-inspiring. But the mood of the narrator, from first to last, Js one of playful extravagance, and he fittingly calls his book an " extravaganza.”

Cadiz, Ky., Is the place, and vast caves underlie all the farm lands. In one of these a stalwart young New Yorker has gone into the business of raising mushrooms for the market In talking of his occupation he uses the language of the ! soil in a blunt, free manner that re' minds the reader of X>r. Tobias Smollett,
1 Indeed, this author has a tendency, like 1 some others of this era, to return to the ; freedom of an earlier age. He is doubt! less a lover of nature. He i3 fond of dwelling on the comeliness of the female form. The motto of his book is " Honf | soit qui mal y pense.” This, as of old,
1 refers directly to a garter, an intrusive, superfluous garter, which might as well have been a ring or a breastpin, a handkerchief, or a rose. But the motto applies tolerably well to some other things In the book. Obviously the author has no evil intent. His sense of humor runs away with him onco in a while, but his story Is quite as moral as a tract.
i It Is also a piquant, delightful, and I rather bewildering story. It makes a j point of not beginning at the beginning.
, It ends before it reaches a denouement ! The London Academy has been com-I plaining of a need of novelty in novels.
It urges tho younger writers to look for new forms.
Here is one of the younger writers, as it seems to us, who has the feeling for novelty strong upon him. He is fond of short sentences, short paragraphs, queer phrases, strange words. He calls his book an *' extravaganza,” yet it contains conspiracy, attempted murder, and much bleeding, love, hate, jealousy, revenge,
■	and despair, and one of Its best passages treats of the cruel death of an admirable dog. What is more, too, his book is an extravaganza in fact as well as in name.

Some of us like more of moderation and less of forced fantasy in our fiction; hut few will fail to read *' The Venus of Cadiz ” if they begin to read it, and that, after all, is a good test of a book. Susan, the untrained Venus of Cadiz, sister of , Julia, of whom the family never speaks, (Julia Is another positively tragic note in tho story,) is an animal, to be sure, but a pure-minded, sound-hearted one, and the I reader cannot help sharing some of the I author’s great admiration for her beauty. Miss Wentmore, the preceptress in man' ners, the French Captain, the German Captain, the Kentucky Squire who stammers when he Is sober and talks glibly under the influence of whisky, (where have we encountered him before?—surely not In real life!) are interesting personages. So are Pete, the boy, and his dog, Pup, and the Kentucky horses.
The stalwart, Innocent, modest hero may be a trifle of a bore—to other men. Tho women may like him, and their likes and dislikes count most with tho novelist,
" The Venus of Cadiz *’ Is published by Henry Holt & Co.
