When city folk transplant themselves to the real country they are as babes in the woods; they have troubles which no country folk ever have; conversely they have joys in their surroundings which country folk know not, either. This volume contains in the form of letters—the letter business is the merest form—an account humorous and at the same time enthusiastic of how two pairs of middle-aged persons (or so *tfs written) spent their first season of voluntary exile in the Oregon hills.
The author tells how they went out by sodden roads in the rainy season, and set up housekeeping in a queer old building very different from the Colonial mansion of the tidewater Bast, jyou have the usual story of the putting up of the kitchen range and the stovepipe that smoked; you read again of those men ignorant of the use of the crosscut saw who went out to fell a great tree; of queer experiences with that most ferocious of all beasts, the common or barnyard cow; of amateur milkers ignorant of the persuasive art; of butter that tasted
*	of all the rank weeds of Spring; of variegated dealings with poultry. The tales aijd jests are the old familiar tales, and jests, but they are very pleasantly and cheerfully told.	•
You read of rain and landscapes sodden but beautiful, and, to explain the writer’s enthusiasm, are provided with some wonderful photographs of wooded Oregon in the rainy season, a mountain stream, say, " rollicking and roystering- through a little glen,” a placid sheet of shadowed water with a sailboat and trees overhanging, or a bit of bluff coast with thd foamy tide coming in upon the white beach at the bluff’s foot. Then the author tells you of how the women of Oregon ride, not man fashion, yet without a saddle—only a surcingle with a stirrup, and sometimes a blanket. And in particular she tells of a young woman of those parts who seems very charming, indeed—whom she calls now Di Vernon and now " St* Cecilia the Broncho Buster." Of this paragon it is further related that she was an excellently well-read person, as well as a superlative horsewoman. The author herself quotes variously from writers, ancient anfl modern, especially
scraps of verse—these in the manner of such as do mock heroic (or mock sentimental) " stunts."
