N1LAR THE, SOUTH POLE,
Dr. Nordenskjold’s Story of the Thrilling Experiences of the Swedish Antarctic Expedition.*
Written for Tbb New York Times Book Review by CYRUS C. ADAMS.
OOKS of polar discovery in recent years have often been expanded to two volumes by diluting the narrative to make it fit an excessive number of pages. Prom the reader’s point of view the practice has nothing to commend it, and it is worthy of note that the popular account of his two years in Antarctica, which Dr. NordenskjOld now " offers to the public in one volume, discloses all the merits and advantages to be gained by keeping a book within proportional limits. Few explorers ever had a story to tell more crowded with novel experience and exciting adventure than that of this little band of Swedish men of science; and that the book is marked throughout by fullness of matter and bub-tained interest is due, most of all, to the fact that tt contains no padding,	'
In 1895 the leading geographers of Europe succeeded in stimulating a great revival of interest in south polar discovery. The field had been almost wholly neglected for over fifty years and was now the largest unexplored area in the world. The movement culminated, during the Summer and Autumn of 1901, in the departure from Europe of three expeditions, which attacked the mysterious southern land mass at three points on the coasts of the supposed great frozen continent. The region of Victoria Land, south of the Pacific Ocean, was assigned to the British. The Germans entered the unknown area south of the Indian Ocean. The Swedish field of research was the lands and seas to the south of South America and the Atlantic Ocean. A Scottish expedition somewhat later took part in the Quest to the east of the Swedish field. Thus four expeditions encircled the unknown area, and by this international collatipration, all the parties working in accordance with the same plan, large additions were made to our knowledge of the south polar regions. They settled the question of another continent. There is no longer any doubt that a land mass, probably as large as Australia, surrounds the south pole, and by common consent it has been named Antarctica.
Outfitted in a modest and inexpensive manner, the Swedish party could not hope to vie in completeness of equipment with its richer sister expeditions. It lacked, for example, the series of self-recording instruments with which the Germans and English were provided. They are labor-saving apparatus and automatically record many results such as those which in the Swedish camp had to be specially observed at all hours of the day and night. Other appliances were inferior or lacking; for men of means in Sweden could not richly endow such an enterprise, while in ' England and Germany both private purses and the national Treasuxies conti ibuted even lavishly to supply all the needs of their explorers.	'
But what the Swedes lacked in equipment they were eager to make up in hard work and tireless energy, for they had assumed an important part in this quest for facts. What was this mysterious Graham Land pushing far north toward South America?
It w discovered by accident eighty-six years ago, when Capt. William Smith, with no other intent than Lo outflank the fierce winds around Cape Horn, put his brig on a southerly tack and bumped into this land. Half a dozen explorers had been there since, but failed to discover what Graham Land really is. How far does it extend south? Is it a continuous stretch of country or a group of islands? The Swedes were seeking answers to many such questions as these.
Part of the mystery 5^ still unsolved, but Dr. Nordenskjold cleared iip many points. He revealed the unknown eastern coastline for about 300 miles, ~ discovered that a great land mass which we had called Louis Philippe Land and mapped as an island is really the northern extension of Graham Land, and that other great masses which we thought were a part of the mainland are islands. From our present knowledge it seems probable that Graham Land is an enormous peninsula of the Antarctic Continent narrow in the north and gradually widening in the~ south. The Swedish party corrected the mapping of'

■e lls northwest coast and traced its east to the-south west, through three decrees of latitude, but there is. work'here \TsUil for several expeditions. Only a ^trie ^part of it will ,henceforth be known as Graham Land, for the name West Antarc-,-tica has been applied to the whole mass.
0	The English traveled 1,000 miles due ; south of New Zealand to cross the threshold of their field, but the Swedes fcati z. .short journey. Their two years were spent at the most northern outpost of all .the anthracite lands. Their Winter camp on the little island of Snow Hill was nearer to the equator than Central Norway.
■	They were only four days on the journey ^ from Terra del Fuego to Graham Land,
:	nd yet, so far as we know, polar frost has
no tighter grasp on any other part of the . world than on this region.	•
The complete climatic transformation in a few hundred mites is astonishing. Four days earlier Nordenskjold had seen the humming birds and the evergreen forests of Terra del Fuego, where the natives .go afraost nude in Summer; then he suddenly came upon a coast in the bright early Summer where the snow and ice were deeper than he had ever seen them on the shores of Greenland. Graham Land Js so far north that it is never wrapped in the gloom of the long' polar night. At . Snow Hill camp the sun . was above the
-	horizon at least four hours* every day in Winter, and yet the six explorers who lived there were overwhelmed by the fiercest and longest storm recorded in
•	polar annals. The antarctic has the sternest type of Winter weather we know, and it is felt to the northern confines of this bleakest of all regions.
The explorers were early impressed with the fact that the chart of these wild coasts, made by earlier expeditions, was of little value. It had not many points of resemblance to the reality. They saw before them large islands unmapped; channels laid down where none exist; coast lines whose trend was not that of the charted coasts;- and one of the great geographic results was the discovery of Crown Prince Gustav Channel, about one hundred miles long and ten to twenty miles wide, cutting off into two big islands a part of the land mass that had been mapped as a portion of the mainland. There is nothing surprising in this. It is only a recent illustration of the fact we knew that a new region is rarely well known till a number of explorers have rectif'ed one another’s work.
«
At one place Nordenskjold observed three ntinataks or hills rising above tho ice, and he wondered why Ross had not mentioned them, for he had minuteiy described that very place sixty years before. Could it be possible that they were buried from view when Ross was there, and were now revealed by a diminution in thickncss of the snow and ice cap? It is an interesting coincidence that tl»c British expedition to Victoria Land, south of the Pacific, discovered many evidences that the glaciers and ice cap of that region were formerly much larger than at present, and they came to regard the vast ice formations they saw as the wasting remnants of a former age.
With the advent of March, 1I>02, there were sl^ns of approaching Winter. It was time to suspend the eager and successful quest for unmapped islands ar.3 the rectification of badly charted coastlines and seek some favorable place for a Winter camp further south, near the field of the coming sledge work. This place was found at Snow Hill, now first discovered to be an island instead of a promontory of the mainland. Here supplies were landed for Nordenskjold and five companions, and the Swedish exploring steamer Antarctic sailed away to study the sea further north and east, to winter in South America, and to return In a year to take home the handful of pioneer Winter sojourners In Graham Land. The plan, alas! went the way of many a well-laid scheme that has come to naught amid polar ice and snow.
Men, Instruments, and supplies were scarcely housed when Winter broke loose with Indescribable fury. We haye heard of nothing like It before. For six weeks from May 1, 1002, the south wind blew with almost incessant hurricane force. It was thick with snow dust, and, moving at from thirty to seventy miles an hour, had almost the impelling power of Mont Petee’s blast. At forty-four miles an hour the men could barely stand erect against the impact of millions of Ice crystals; at sixty-two miles they crawled on hands and knees to take their observations at the instruments. Small stones were caught up and hurled out upon the eea ice, the rowboat was carried to a new lodgment on the flank of a mountain, and the cabin and instrument huts, though stoutly built and braced, were badly damaged. The temperatures were not very low for that region, but think of living for six weeks in a hurricane,
with the thermometer ranging from ________22
to —25 Fahrenheit! The mean velocity of the wind for the last two weeks was 41.5 miles an hour.
At the British camp that Winter tho gales were very severe, but they were shorter, and the worst of them came in July. No wonder that Lieut. Royds, the meteorologist of the British expedition, wrote, “ The winds are the worst part of the antarctic regions." The wind at
Snow Hill found every crack in the little cabin, and; Jn spite of the:'stove‘ the interior temperature sometimes: fell several de^jrees below zero. In his sledge journeys NordenskjSld found an* essential difference between the conditions in the arctic and the antarctic, and that is that sledge parties cannot cover in the same time nearly as much ground in the south as in the north for the reason that the low temperatures and prevailing hurricanes of the south compel an expedition to lie still In camp about half the time, so that they not only make less distance, but must also haul a much larger Quantity of'supplies;, to coversame area of exploratory work.	-
In his longest sledge journey to the south, in the antarctic Spring of 1902, Norr denskjold with two companions and a small team of dogs made a round trip of 400 miles, mapping a large extent of coast and making a remarkable discovery. The snow was so deep that it was many days before the party was convinced that it hcrl left the sea ice and was marching over the land. The purpose was to make a correct delineation of the coast, and it was found that in many cases the shore line was miles to the east of its position as laid down on the chart. Many great rocks that had been mapped as islands were really nunataks or mountains lifting their heads above the great Ice cap of the land, and the edge of the land ice was marked for scores of miles by an ice terrace with a precipitous face, so that in most places it was impossible to ascend it, a phenomenon different in some respects * from, that observed along other south polar coasts.	•
The numerous results of the shorter ex* petitions cannot be mentioned here except to indicate the most surprising and Important of them. This was the disbov-ery in many places of- plant and animal fossils, the first ever brought home from tbe antarctic excepting a few. found by the sealer Larsen. They included petrified tree trunks and the well-preserved imprint of leaves belonging to fossil fomi-lies of South America and Europe a^well m specimens of the beech and other trees oi the present day; and numerous forms of mollusca and other sea lire and one land animal^ the whole showing that this was once a land of luxurious vegetation and that at some time much of it was buried under the sea; and here,1 It Is thought, a number of types of plants and animals may have developed and found their way to northern lands. These rich discoveries of fossils are among the most important revelations yet made concerning the south polar lands.
We had supposed that icebergs necessarily had their origin on land, and this seems always to be the case in the arctic regions; but facts discovered by this expedition seem to prove that many of the antarctic icebergs come from the heavy snowfalls on the sea ice, the snow solidifying into ice and layer being added to 'layer till the typical south polar iceberg is produced.
With the approach of the second 'Winter came the dramatic phases of this history, and they give to the latter half of tho book an Interest more absorbing than is often found In works of exploration.
A second Winter in the antarctic had not bten contemplated or provided for; but the nights lengthened, the heavy sea ice, unbroken all Summer, extended everywhere beyond the range of vision, and the conviction deepened that no relief was possible that season. Then came the busy days of killing hundreds of penguins and a few seals to eke out the failing supplies.
Before the Winter storms began Nordenskjold knew that his men would not starve; but he little dreamed that his stanch ship, famous in arctic discovery, had been crushed in the ice and sunk while trying to force her way to his camp, and that the Antarctic’s staff of scientific men and the crew, in two parties, were ashore in most miserable plight, neither knowing the fate of the other. So these three detachments of one expedition spent that terrible Winter within fifty and sixty miles of one another,. six man in a fairly comfortable wood cabin, but three in the second and twenty in the third party sheltered only by rude structures of stone and snow and almost absolutely dependent upon the game' they killed.	.
In its way the story of that Winter, with Its privations, its fight for life, its many ingenious expedients .for making the best of a tragic situation, and mix, if possible, a little comfort with misery, and its sublime hope and pourage, is one of the most thrilling ever penned. Dr. Andersson contributes thirteen chapters and Mr. Skottsberg and Capt. Larsen one each to this part of the history.
The Antarctic had been successful In her deep sea work, hud wintered In Argentina, and went south in due time for the Nordenskjold party. After fighting the ice for weeks, three men were put ashore to make their way by land to Snow HIU camp. They were victims of the inaccurate map; for instead of being on the mainland, as they supposed, they were on an island and, matching south, soon found a channel filled with wide leads of water. Before they could escape Winter came on, and they built their stone .hut. Meanwhile the Antarc-
tic had gone to the. bottom, and the crew .’ sought refu^T on Paulet Island. ■	'.
.a. .acre is no flaggin'-*. of interest in the “chanters that- describe Winter life in ■those camps. We may here mention; only a few facts showing how truly necessity-is the mother of invention. Sealskin with the blubber attached was a very smoky but not bad fuel. There was flour at Snow Hill, but baiting powder had given i out. An organism was discovered under the microscope that resembled a yeast fungus. It was cultivated, actually made dough ferment, and the party -was supplied with properly leavened bread. Effective fish hooks were made out of the bone handle of a knife and shoe buckles. Mixed tea leaves and j snuff were endured, but were voted to be mighty poor smoking tobacco.. One man declared that all he needed to make him happy was " cigars, music, and books.”
In October, 1003, the Spring of the year, Nordenskjold had Just completed his- survey of Crown Prince Gustav Channel,
when he saw one morning three men on the Ice. When they met he found them black as negroes, and did not recognize the three castaways from Vega Island, who were now making their way to his camp. There were joy and despair in that meeting. Cor th'ey had every reason to fear that the Antarctic party was lost. But the red letter day of the Swedish explorers came soon after they reached Snow Hill, for Larsen arrived with good news from the party .on Paulet Island only a* few hours after the whistle of the Argentine gunboat Uruguay announced that relief had come.
The book has been produced in a style worthy of the notable history it records. The maps are excellent and most of the illustrations are from good, clear photographs, together with a few fine reproductions of paintings by the artist Stokes, The detailed scientific results of the work are soon to be published at the cost of the Swedish Government.
