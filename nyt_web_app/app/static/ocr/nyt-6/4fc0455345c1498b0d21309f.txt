This is the story of one Roland Rash-cliffe, told by himself and setting forth a number of goodly adventures and dangerous escapades, knight errantry, and love requited at last. Roland’s father 1 having- met with reverses in fortune through the fickleness of Kings, placed his faith in no man, neither Stuart nor | Cromwell, and reared his only son to this * way of thinking. So that when the Pro! tectorate finally came to Its end and 1 Charles Stuart came back to England amid welcoming shouts, the eider Rash-cliffe wisely shook his head and cautioned his son once more. However, what ■was not to be gained by loyalty might be had by threats, and so, having heard of the existence of a marriage contract between Charles TI. and one Lucy Walters, a girl of surpassing beauty, young Roland was dispatched with all haste in search of this paper, which was to be used by the Rashcliffes, elder and younger, to wrest favors from their King and the King’s brother, James of York.
Naturalfy there are dangers surrounding the securing of this paper. Also the elder Rashcliffe had not counted on the Quixotic spirit of honor which flourished in the breast of young Roland. It was not for self-advancement that he sought these papers, but because he would have justice shown the eleven-yeolr-old son of Lucy Walters. But this youthful enthusiasm was soon to be turned toward an^ other object. To an inn near Bedford, whicli in turn was near Pycroft, the weird old estate where the precious paper was said to be, came Sir Charles Denman and a lady, said to be his wife, and who, In fact, answered to tfte title of Mistress Denman. Roland, seeing the signal oC sorrow and distress in the lady's pale cheeks, swore to protect her even against her will: nearly forgot tlie precious papers in his zeal to keep her from harm, even gave up the chase for the papers altogether; endured imprisonment for two years, and finally rode down the lady's objections and carried her off, a willing captive, to the New World. All this, of course, after it Jiad been proved that neither was she the wife of the wicked Sir Charles Denman nor had she attempted the murder of General Monk afterward the Duke of Albemarle, for which she had been imprisoned.
All these things, of course, lead to complications in plenty. The book presents pictures of Charles n.t his dissolute Court, and his bitter persecution of the Puritans and aU followers of Cromwell, while, besides the Duke of York, afterward James II., John Bunyati, as an earnest preacher and victim of the 7 King’s? wrath, finds -.his way intc^the tale^
