But the truth is the people in. the book, though obviously (and :even professedly) taken mainly iii moments andin aspects and relations; which serve to illustrate economic /and Social principles and conditions—‘both as to conduct and; especially, as to con-versa tion—have (for Utopians) an appeal remarkably human.

Most of the author’s creatures are bel ter than people we know (Including ourselves) are apt to seem to the run of us. In all of them! the general good seems to hold a real interest* and especially they are more willing to listen to reason (even when set forth at great length) and less disposed to tell wise elders and advice givers generally to go to the devil than we have found our fellows to be. Of'all the company only two are judged worthy of ultimate dismissal into outer darkness— and these two are weaklings, inspiring more the author’s pity than his anger. Plainly, therefore, this author is muchTof an optimist. The impulses of lower humanity he dares, to leave largely out of account, seeming to assume a decided trend toward truth and goodness, and charging the barm In men and things chiefly to ignorance. Nevertheless, he endows his women with impulses—the good women with angelic impulses and divine Insight, a sort of holy Intuition of truth.
From all this it follows of necessity that about everybody vitally concerned in the story is of the select company of the enlightened—the highly dowered in ability, position, wealth. As a matter of fact, the characters include several benevolent millionaires, active about the world’s business; a sovereign petty Prince) another millionaire who is the modern robber baron, another who devotes himself to horses and yachts and leads the cotillion, (he is young and his father's son.) two Princesses, and a very rich lady with a past. But it includes also a stoker, a walking delegate, an assassin, a young man of frail honesty who is by way of hanging on to the skirts of society and doing odd jobs for it—losing his soul in the process—and some other plain people.
In a nutshell the author's economic theory is that the workingman (meaning him who soils his hands) is not usually entitled to a larger share of the wealth he helps to produce than he actually gets. For the man who sets the other at . his handiwork, who tells him what to make and when to. make it, not only increases the value of the total product, but, by insuring a stable business, insures also steady employment to the man. with the soiled bands. The increase is his, for he made it—made it not in hurting but in helping the other. If, therefore, he receives millions while his subordinates receive hundreds, it is because he has produced millions while they have produced hundreds. And whether one of them or all of them has worked as hard as the master doesn't matter, since it is not the energy expended, but the practical results of the energy for which each is paid. As a matter of fact the ordinary workingman working for an intelligent " boss ” actually makes (for himself) more than he could make unguided. If the workman can guide he presently becomes himself an employer.
Wherefore, obviously, taking the words in the common sense, labor lias no grievance against capital—which the author figures as intelligence. To be sure, there are cases where an Individual laborer or group of laborers has a grievance against an individual capitalist o.- group of capitalists—but these cases do not affect the principle.	-
However, from the fact that capital is intelligence, which is strength—for this is effective intelligence, not the ornamental kind—it follows that the part of good capl-talists is' to help labor—which is ignorance, weakness. Not that each help is a natural right of labor as ignorance and weakness. Ignorance and weakness hF,ve no natural rights. But it is thus that the rich, able, and wise grow richer, abler, and wiser still, in malting the others richer and abler and wisor, and develop gprftler.and nobler virtues besides. Such is as far" as man may guess the Intent of the powers inscrutable who arranged the world into weak and strong. You see, it is a theory and programme essentially aristocratic, on its intellectual side at
least—a; ben evolent'despotismwhich' as; .sume stha t there a^e vast rua tural dlffer-:encesin >nen|w^cii? niayi'not-

; All of which (though the author is no .reactionary, rather a liberal conservative,)^ is here set forth many times in different ways and words and enforced by parables. The story ia of a big blond young German," half American, a doctor, and a doctor’s son, who loves a Princess of' a reigning house in the fatherland—a house reigning over a very small principality, to be sure. The Princess’s mother, like the young doctor’s, is American, But the Princess's father is German and stands stiffly by his traditions. So young Dr. Carl is denied his Princess and comes to' America with- a distinct impulse against established orders of things and a disposition to sympathize with the fellows at the bottom,
i However, he goes ta school to life, learns many things by experience, and many more by observation, and becomes in a marvelous few years Governor of a Western commonwealth—a reformer, but i a thoughtful and careful one. Some of l his ntatc papers are here presented for your admiration, and the author evidently thinks his Governor Carl is all of the best and noblest In manhood. To us he Beems a bit too calm, too consciously cane, and too solemnly convinced of his pwn seriousness—In short, too German— but the Fflncess thinks he "is the real thing in modern heroism and loves him. The Princess is a’serious girl, too, and i Quite sentimental, but has charming mo-i xrients. She Is not above kissing, and giving a bear hug besides to a very handsome boy (not Carl) whom she* has just refused to marry. This Princess , cornea to New York, and goes about there Incog., for she has a New York grandfather, a marvel of wisdom, who figured in the title of the author's earlier book,
“ Calm ire.” So • you learn a great deal „ about what New York society Is—or, rather, was fifteen years ago. You'll hardly find anywhere, by the way, a fairer or more interesting exposition of the natore of that society, its varieties, Insufficiencies, absurdities; how it evolves and renews Itself; why people want to be in it; how they get in or stay in; how it spoils some, and how in spite of vulgar showfolk and spenders whose names are mostly in the papers, it stands in the aggregate for something of value.
The author evidently believes in societies more or less exclusive, societies of the “ best/’ but it appears he would have tbe rich (these, after all, are ** society ") exchange their horses and "hounds and yachts and palaces at Newport (or some of them) for civic and. benevolent pursuits such as become the elder brothers of the poor. Which very proper view does not, avail to obscure the fact that, as a 'Story, the best of this book lies in the romance which links the idle gentleman who led cotillions* and raced horses and yachts (but he reformed) and the direct and intense but very human and handsome1 daughter of a plain, blunt man,
: who had grown rich in the manufacture of tinware. This plain, blunt man wonderfully well realized, is the real hero of | the novel, and is by the author’s admission intended for the type of the true American builder of his own fortune.
We began by saying the book was long. It covers, in fact, so wide a field that an adequate review (that is, one which will give you a just idea of the whole content) is impossible. It provides glimpses of real men and women and much preaching of real truth and wisdom, along with many curious and acute observations of j life, but the author never gets down i from his hot by. He is always intent to teach you wisdom and demolish economic fallacies.
Nevertheless, If you have a turn for occasional seriousness you will likely (with a little judicious skipping) read
Sturmsee ” (which is Dr. Carl's other name) with as much pleasure as profit.
