ROSADFS BOOK
An Italimi Jurist’s Study of the Trial and Conviction of Jesus.*
ANY persons will consider Giovanni Rosadi's book,
“ The Trial of Jesus.” superfluous and impertinent. Rosadi is an Italian jurist of distinction, however, and he has executed his task in a perfectly reverent spirit and with much skill.	Rosadi holds that the arrest of
Jesus	was	without warrant. Judaic or
Roman, and was carried out without the knowledge of the Roman authorities.
This ^rrest, effected in the night between Thursday and Friday, the last day of the life of Jesus, on Nisan 14, accord- I ins to the Hebrew calendar, was the execution of an illegal and factious resolution of the Sanhedrin. After the triumphant entry of the Nazarene into Jerusalem on the preceding Sunday. Nisan 9, the priests and elders of Jerusalem, who had many times sought to convict Jesus of some flagrant violation of the law, but had not succeeded, or rather had not the courage to seize Him for fear of the people, whose favor He enjoyed, held a meeting on the Wednesday following, Nisan 12, at which they discussed the means of getting hold of Jesus. It was finally decided to arrest Him. even though illegally, and have Him put to death.
What took place before the Sanhedrin Signor Rosadi deducts from Biblical sources. These, however, he endeavors f to illuminate with his knowledge of Hebrew and Roman law. Two charges, he argues, were brought against Jesus, sedition and blasphemy. The court proceeded by elimination, abandoning the first charge in default of proof, and taking the second from the confession of the accused. On this latter point it is proper to emphasize the fact that, although the confession of a prisoner might be used against him. It could never be the independent and exclusive occasion of his guilt. The conduct of Jesus before the Sanhedrin should, according to Signor
I Rosadi, have explained the nature of the dilemma which confronted the judges—
" namely, that the prisoner before them was either a fanatic or should be acquitted as an apostle to whom men should hearken."
. Now, the sentence ascribed to the court was not a judicial sentence; and, after a review of Scriptural ® .v bearing upon the crimes of blasphemy and sedition, the author concludes that, had Jesus been judicially condemned by the Sanhedrin, he would have been stoned. “ The Sanhedrin inflicted upon. Jesus no punishment, and that which he later underwent was not among those which the Sanhedrin was able to apply."
The author gives a biographical sketch of Lucius Pontius Pilate. The conduct of Pilate he sums up as follows:
He refused not only the great gift o£ free will, In a case when a free choice was his absolute duty—he refused a power- which, for him, was the fount of duty and which cost the life o£ a man and the right of an innocent* * * •''And . even as the refusal of Pilate was great, the greatest of all refusals, slo"it was cowardly. He was' convinced of the innocence of Jesus; he calls Him righteous; asks and asks again of His accusers, ** What evil hath he done to you? " He knows that- it is out or envy that they set Him in. his hands;.he thinks .and says, "I find no fault in Him **; he feels that it i3 right and reasonable to set Him free, and yet he sends Him to the cross.
The statement of the prosecufors that Jesus began to preach sedition In Galilee served as an Inspiration to Pilate's diplomatic cunning. It showed him how he might shirk all responsibility in the case by handing Jesus over to the Tetrarch, who had criminal jurisdiction over the subjects of Herod Antipas, who at that time happened to be An Jerusalem to attend the Passover. Now it was Herod's turn to shirk all responsibility, and with a keen sense of irony he had the prisoner clothed in a white toga and returned to the representative of Mighty Rome. On the day of the Passover it was customary- for the Roman- Governor to set at Uberty a prisoner selected by the people.
' And Pilate offered the people this alternative: Barabbas.a rioter and murderer, or
Jesus, which is called Christ/’ He pressed the latter choice upon -them,' no less fearful on -account of*'his wife’s dream than of criticism and' rebuke from Rome. But when the prosecutors turned . his own subterfuges against - him' And boldly charged that'if he release Jesus he was not Caesar's friend, since' the prisoner was alleged to have declared himself • King, Pilate saw-that, -should- he release ■ Jesus, the charge - of aiding a traitor might be- made against * him, 'and so he finally- acquiesced in-- that ■ last "unanimous -and most plerclng.cry of the people,L*«rt Him be crucified^*’ -
The utter isolation of Jesus "at this time is accounted for by Signor Rosadi from the fact that the people had looked fori'a miracle and were disappointed. He •was now-condemned, but.who had con-demned^him? .	**■	-	-j--

word of evidence, sought not a single | proof, weighed not a single pleading, observed not a single form. Were one to forget the place of the proceeding—a Roman tribunal—were one to forget the date, eight centuries after the foundation of the City of Rome, that had no childhood—Rome, the teacher of the law to civilized mankind—one might imagine that one was present at some primitive trial taking place before the curule throne of one of the first Roman Kings xvitbout the slightest guarantee of even'the most grotesque ritual forms.
In order to show what a monstrous miscarriage of justice the trial and conviction of the Nazarene was. the author cites Roman law and procedure as then enforced, and the result is a most damaging arraignment of "Lucius Pontius Pilate, j and the statement the martyrdom of the I prisoner ** will stand fixed forever upon , the crowning summit of injustice, cupidity, and civil falsehood, a symbol of eternal reprobation, and of degeneration without limit." Many contemporary sources, both Hebrew and Roman, have been mad^ to yield their facts; judgments and opinions of evangelists, as well as of German New Testament critics, are considered in the light of law and equity. We doubt, however, if the best English , and American scholarship will regard Signor Rosadi’s work seriously, anil we must admit that the work seems to serve no particularly good purpose.
