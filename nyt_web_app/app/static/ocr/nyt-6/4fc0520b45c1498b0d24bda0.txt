1	An Old Man*s Romance^
, AIM OLD MA.N’S IDYL. By Wolcotr Johnson. lfimo. Chicago:	A. C. McClurc &
:	CO.	*1.
This is a very quiet, pastoral sort of story, depicting the home joys of a man who, having: married late in life, finds his happiness all the sweeter for its tardiness. The simple, unexciting doings of two small girls who sraduaily outgrow baby , tails in the course of the^diary, and before the last chapter arrives take unto themselves stalwart husbands, are the. most important records. *
The home pictures presented by this kindly disposed, quiet, home-loving husband, the gentle womanliness of the sweet-faced wife, the patience of his^“ deaf and blind old mother, the times when the children, had whooping cough, again when Ada, the elder, fell into the , lake and was nearly drowned, still an-■ other day when they all except the old 1 mother visited the State fair, and other I Incidents ot ecfual unimportance are, nev-l erthelcss, dwelt upon so lovingly and tenderly in his diary by the father of this very quiet and happy family that the reader finds an extraordinary restfulness in its pages, especially after the strenuous style of fiction we have - lately been treated to.
This old man’s little " idylft has a peculiarly reminiscent, speculative flavor which now and then recalls Ik Marvel and George William Curtis and others of that school of amiable and dearly beloved dreamers.
