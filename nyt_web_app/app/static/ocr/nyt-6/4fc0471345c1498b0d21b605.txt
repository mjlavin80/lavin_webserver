Fifty Millions in Gold.
THE CiOLDEX FLOOD. By Edwin Ijt'fcvre.
IGnio. New York: McClure, Phllllpa Sc Co.
This is an exceedingly Interesting story of Wall Street, wherein a quiet, amiable-looking metallurgist with gold-rimmed glasses quite succeeds In outwitting two hardened financiers and at the same time mystifying the reader as well.
It was not to be wondered at that Mr. Richard Dawson was somewhat surprised when Mr. George Kitchell Grinnell presented himself at his bank one morning with an Assay Office check for flOJ,-G4S.G7, which he wished to deposit As he had never before been a depositor of the Metropolitan National Bank, it was quite natural that the President should be cautious. This he was, but Mr. Grinnell* s credentials were beyond reproach. The following Thursday, quite as a matter of course, Mr. Grinnell deposited a $151,000 Assay Office check, and so on each week this strange, silent young man doubted his deposits until they amounted to some $10,000,000 a week.
He appeared to have all sorts of strange, impractical views as to finances, was, according to his own evasive admission', a Socialist; was also a metallurgist, maintained (so the bank detectives discovered) a laboratory in his house, and, on the whole, not only frightened the astute bank President Into indiscretions, but also did
the same to Mr. Mellen, the richest man in th® world.	'
To tell -the denouement of the story would he to do not only the author but also the reader an injustice. The book, being small in size and large in print, occupies only a couple of hours in (he reading, and these hours, we have no hesitancy in saying, will be very enter*, tainingly occupied If employed thus. And there will probably be double enjoyment tn store for' those who, knowing the market and its frequenters, think they can Identify the characters of Mr. Lefevre's story.
