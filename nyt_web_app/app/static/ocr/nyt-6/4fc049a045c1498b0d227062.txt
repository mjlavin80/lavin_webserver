The author of this tale has selected his characters from among Dan Chaucer’s Canterbury pilgrims, and constructed for them a nondescript dialect, wherein Chaucerian turns of speech are barbar* ously imbedded. Moreover, though the thing is prose, the poetic license of inversion Is borrowed from Chaucer also.
The story relates the adventures of a son of that Franklin so excellently described In the Prologue, and represents this youth as traveling m France and Italy in the train of Chaucer himself when he was the King's envoy to the Genoese. This youth loved a maid, Cicely, and she him, wherefore her cruel uncle and guardian, objecting to the match, had him crimped—crimped by Chaucer’s very ’* shipman "—and carried abroad to Bordeaux, where he was rolled ashore concealed in a cask among the lees of wine, and so escaped to further adventures. First he watched his yeoman attendant fight a terrible battle with a vagabond free companion—scythe against sword. The stout Englishman slew his enemy by driving his rustic weapon through the ugly follow’s head, and was straightway afterward married to a blackeyed French maid, who has watched the fray and been the prize of it. Then master and man were orf to Italy, where the master meddled somewhat with diplomacy, and still more , with alchemy. In some years' time he returned to France, and, saving the life of Bertrand du Gues-clin, was by that hero dubbed Knight— hence the title. The end. of the story comes with the famous Canterbury pilgrimage, wherein travels lovely Cicely, (faithful all this time.) intent to be made a nun. With Chaucer’s help, the young Knight steals her and carries her away. It cannot be said that the mantle of the old storyteller has descended upon the modern who has sought to beautify his crow with these stray eagle's feathers.
