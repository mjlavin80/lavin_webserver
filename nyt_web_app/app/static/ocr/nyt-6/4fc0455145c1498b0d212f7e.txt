MODERN CIVIC ART; OK, THE CITY MADE BBAVTIFUL. By Charles Mul-rorcl Robinson. Second edition, with illos* tratlons. Svo. Pp. 3S1. Cloth. New York: G- I». Putnam's Sons. $3.	'
This second edition of Air. Robinson’s book on civic art means much more than the mere success of the boolt* It presupposes the success of the cause for which the author has labored. As he points out in his new preface, various local clubs for the development *of architectural art have come Into touch with one another, so that Chicago may \iow leam from iBoston and ' York be brought to realize the ugliness of her skylines as well as the inharmonious contour of her streets.
As far as possible the second—edition realizes the climax ollthc movement which • It was intended to' perpetuate. Here we have Illustrations emphasizing by living examples those points In the text concern-: ing water and land approaches,. administrative centres, ideal business districts, and residential sections; Thesreexafcnples are draym from every quarter. We have pictures of the Thames Embankment, of the Champs^ Elys£es, of the monuments and avenues- of Berlin, and of certain. -artistic American cities, which, while laid out with more utility than art, have nevertheless come down to us-as fine examples .of Colonial culture. There are, too, reproduced pictures representing those artistic. Innovations Which show the result of the* movement not only In -cities like New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, but aJso in those small wealthy towns where the' movement has had free hand and liberal encouragement.
