WRITERS OF ENGLISH.
A Canadian-English Novelist and a New York Publisher on
Their Brotherhood.
IR GILBERT PARKER, M. P.,
' the Canadian-English novelist, and Mr. George Haven Putnam, the New York publisher, have been talking. In answer to questions put by Mr. James Milne, editor of Tbe Book Monthly of London, about ttie brotherhood of writers of English. " A novelist In America, writing of American life and character,” said Sir Gilbert barker, *' starts differently from an English writer, and there must emerge from his observations of life around him a color arid even a form individual and specific.
It must so affect his style and point of view as to inherently differentiate nis thought and its expression from that of his English confrere, But the novelist stands by himself. He seldom influences' thought or style. I cannot see how the two sets of conditions—the English and the American—can really be compared at all.	*	;
** If you go back to the days of Hawthorne, Thoreau, and even of Washington Irving, you will find their style in some sense the same as that of the best English writers. But of late years a more * American ’ feeling pervades all that is produced by good men in America. Choose a- man to-day who, in point of style, is probably the best writer in the- English-speaking world—Gold win Smith. He Is free from preciosity on the one hand or obscurity on the other—clear and fine- Then, if you will, take the work of Mr. W. D. Howells, who is the first of American writers. It has the same lucidity, much the same range, though, of course, his calibre as a thinker less than Goldwin Smith’s. Again, take Mr. John Morley, a master of style, one of the few men in England, since Ruskin and such writers disappeared, who have supreme style. Against him set Henry James. You would not conclude that the one had reacted on the other. On the contrary, they appear to drink from the same fountain of thought, though the style Is so different. * * *
“ Now I suppose the United States and England react upon each other in some sense,, but to my mind the weight of influence, the weight of thought, and the weight of .style, still remain with England. For my part I see nothing definite, so far as the higher literature in England Is' concerned, in any Influence from the other side of the water. I am certain, however, that England still influences the United States. For Instance, I suppose you would call poetry the highest form of literary expression. It does not strike me that any poet of the United States has influenced any great Britlsji poet or British poetry. I think, however, that the -general standard of power and beauty set by English poets certainly has influenced and certainly does influence American verse. I believe, at the same time, that a man like Longfellow, though not a great poet, was quite distinctive, owing little to anybody except, it may be, in a far-off way; to Wordsworth. Emerson and Walt Whitman are nearer te a distinctively American verse, and they cannot be said to have influenced English verse or poetry in the very least, save in the case or W. E. Henley. * * *
"You have to go back fifty years^to find a real American influence upon English literature. You ' must go back to Edgar Allan Poe, and there you had a genius who not only influenced England but France. His fiction practically established the better form of conte in France. And If you go still further back Washington Irving came nearer to influencing English stylo than anybody else
has ever done*’*
Mr. Putnam thinks that the recording .of history tends to become international, always assuming that the affairs concerned date back of modern problems and controversies. •* What is true of history/' he said, " is true, with some similar limitations, of historical biography and of literary biography. ‘ The English Men of Letters Series is just . as valuable for American readers, who claim to have a share in the ownership and usufruct of English literature, as it is for English' readers. I am glad to believe also that the contribution to the Heroes of the, Nations Series, in biography, and to' tlie Stories of the Nations Series, In history, which have been prepared on either side of the Atlantic, are equally .valuable^ for students and readers In both hemispheres.
/' It is my impression-that In fiction^-of which I have less-personal knowledge, because T am not a reader of modem nriv-els—the- tendency is possibly rather to strengthen the local characteristics, the local coloring, and the national point .of view. It is undoubtedly true that fiction of Germany to-day, ‘ as compared yrtth that of "half a century back, Js stronger In its national prejudices. The national -feeling all over the world is finding .part of its expression _ through fiction, .and with us^in America, particularly since;, the*
' civil war, this has been very marked/-Our most successful American fiction—spfeak-' ing In the .commercial sense—has been A thatf;V)fhIc^b^vbi^imo5t:djrfiniteIyv*JtQ0st
distinctly American in its scenes ai.d in Its character studies. But I note that this is the class of fiction which has been very largely claiming the Interest of the new generation of English readers. They seem to be rather pleased to get something a little away from the cathedral town or from Piccadilly society, and they are taking an increasing pleasure in the experiences of real life on the prairie, and in events and people hitherto comparatively unfamiliar to them.
** In these several respects there seems to me to be a closer coming1 together of the literary sympathies and Interests of England, and America. And I may make reference also to the comparatively new and growing literary market which American publishers, like their English brethren, are finding in Australasia. Our ex. perience Is that In Australia particularly there is a noteworthy increase in the demand for represehtative American fiction, and a. steady inquiry for books of American history, biography, and science. There Is a sign of this in the fresh and sympathetic treatment which American books receive in Australian magazines and papers, and it £Lll shows the link of
-	certain experiences and feelings which would naturally be common to a new country like Australia and a comparatively new country like America."
