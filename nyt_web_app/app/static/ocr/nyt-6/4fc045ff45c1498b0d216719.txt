BRITISH MYTHOLOGY.
Charles Squirm’s Book About the Old j Celtic Legends and Superstitions.^ ? ■
R. CHARTJ3S SQUIRE in Ilia " book on the mythology of the' British Isles has not written for- Celtic scholars, and adr mits that he owes to them all that Is In the bock; he addresses himself to readers familiar with the outside of other mythologies in the hop*! of interesting them “ in another and a nearer source of poetry.** His qualifications for his work are a sympathy with his subject, considerable study, and a good style—and without the last the former would oe of little value for his purpose.	■
The mythology of the British Isles is of course Celtic. It has ^Ittle of the “ heavy crudeness that repels one In Teutonic and Scandinavian story," says Mr. Squire; It is as graceful as the " Greek, and Its gods are the “ natural inhabitants of British landscapes, not seeming foreign in & scene where th^re is no vine or olive, but * shading in with' our homefy oak and bracken, gorse and-heath." * In the west of. England, In Wales, and in Scotland, and especially ** in legend-haunted Ireland,” the hills, and dales ** still keep memories of the ancient gods of the ancient "race.” For centuries they lost thpir rule, though they were .still remembered; the GreeK t and the Roman gods usurped their places in English literature. Yet popular fancy rehabilitated them; “ they still lived on in legend as Kings of Britain reigning, in a fabulous past cfcnterior to Julius .Caesar —such were King L.ud~, founder of I^>h-I don; King Lear, whose legend was Immortalized by 'Shakespeare; King Brennius, Who~ conquered Rome. They still lived on as long-dekd saints of the early churches in Ireland and Britain, whose wonderful attributes and adventures are, in many cases, only those of tiieir original name' sakes, the old gods, told afresh. And 1 they still live on in another and yet more 1 potent way. Kyfhs of Arthur and bis cycle" of gods passed into the hands of
■	the Norman storytellers, to reappear :is romances of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table. Thus spread over civilized Europe, their Influence was immense. Their primal poetie impulse is still resonant in our literature: we need only Instance Tennyson and* Swinburne as minds that have come under its sway."
Documents In existence give the stories of these gods and saints, the majority of them dating from a period Jasting, speaking roughly, from the middle of the twelfth to the end of the sixteenth century. These stories are made up of still older legends—Mr. Squire holding with experts that the existence of the Irish and Welsh poems and prose tales,
** in something like their present shape, dates from a period anterior to the seventh century. Bat as a mythology must always be older than che oldest verses and stories that celebrate it, it follows that these legends are of a prehistoric and Immemorial antiquity.
It appears, says Mr. Squire, that the Celtic state worship was solar. Its gods were in two camps; just as the Olympians fought the giants, so among the Gaelic gods was conflict between those of light, day, life, fertility, wisdom, and good, and those of night, darkness, barrenness, and eviL The first were the divine family of Danu, and were called Tuatha de Danann, the Tribe of the Goddess Danu; their opponents were descendants of a goddess Domnu. Their . better known name is " Fomors,” or “ Fomorians.’’ which mpana the gods from under sea, Nuada was -greatest of the Tribe of Danu; and next to him was the Dagda, or Good God. He had several children, of whom Brigit hag been adopted into the Christian roll of saints as St. Bridget. Ogma, a son of the Dag<&, Invented the Ogam letters, according to tradition. Scieace, however, no longer believes this tradition, inasmuch as the Ogam is based on the Roman alphabet.
In the. Gaelic legends dynasty of gods succeeded dynasty. First came gods of the race'of Fartholon,'who landed in Ireland from " the Other World " on May Day, (Beltaine,) sacred to Bil6, God of Death, They warred with the Fomors, and defeated them, but after three hundred years were destroyed by an epidemic. Then came those of the race of Nemed, who likewise suffered from plague; their survivors were terribly oppressed by the Fomors, who finally crushed' them. The third set of gods was that of the Fir-Bolgs, who came, from “ Spain," which Mr. Squire says Is a post-Christian euphemism for hades. The Fir-Bolgs were connected in some way with the Fomors.
At last, enemies to both Fomors and Fir-Bolgs, came the Tuatlia de Danann, who fought with and destroyed the power of the Fomors. Afterward they made peace with the Fomorians. Later, however, war broke out' again, and the TufLtha De Danann warred with the

Their immediate ancestor, * however, wasISenius Farsa of -Scythia whose"1 son* married Scota, daughter -of- -King. Piraraoh . of Egypt. She had a son, ‘Goidel, whose great-grandson was Eber Scot, (all these names, -it may .be noted, .seem to 'be eponymic.) Fenlus and hie family would not persecute the Israelites, and were driven from JEgypt, livlnfe in Africa for. forty-two years w thence they went . to Spain, and finally to Ireland, where they defeated the gods; who retired beneath the surface of the earth. Thereafter the gods became fairies—each god a Fer-SKihe, or Farshee, eaoh goddess a Beau* SIdhe, or Banshee. -Cuchulainn, Conchobar, Finn, and the Fenians are'-all considered by Mr. Squire and students of Gaelic as legendary; they “ move on equal terms - with the gods, fight for them or against them, marry them, and are given to (tnm in marriage.” ■ It was the wise missionaries who made them all real personages. The Christianizers*of Ireland and Scotland and Celtic Britain knew better than to tell their would-be converts ! that all their ancestors and gods were | I condemned to^serdItion; instead of doing so they adopted them into Christianity, St. ‘Patrick going so far as to recall ■Cuchulainn from the dead to testify to the truth of Christianity. His successors carried^ on the euphemeristlc work, .ascribing dates to legendary Kings, and making . Fir-Bolgs, Fomors, Fenians, Dananns real people.

In the Mablnogion, the oldest version of the doings of the British gods, ttfey are still divine; but the oldest Welsh legends show them pretty well stripntfd of their divinity, and the Norman adapters made them quite mortal. It is from Sir TJhomas Mallory’s version of these Norman stories that we to-day get our knowledge of the British gods, who, in the guise bestowed on them by. Tennyson, have no semblance of divinity. Mr. Squire points out survivals in Great Britain and Ireland of the beliefs of the Celtic inhabitants of centuries ago.	‘
The fairy belief of the present day hardly differs at all from tne conception which the Celts had of their deittes. * * • There seems to be no doubt that the Celtic worship centred around the four great days in the year v filch chronicle the rise, progress, and decline of the sun, and, therefore, of the fruits of the earth. The nature of the rites performed upon these .days csn be surmised from their pale survivals. May Day £Beltaine) celebrates the waking of the earlh from her Winter sleep and the rer^gwal of warmth, life, and vegotatlon. This is the meaning of the Maypole?, The opposite of it was Samhain, a sad f?gtivart the beginning of the Celtic year, ar.d omens for the future might be exorted from dark powers by uncanny rites.
This Is All Hallow Eve. with its curious ceremonies and customs. The August festival is not observed much now, and the midsummer festival has lost Its mythological significance ini the ecclesiastical Feast of St. John. The bonfires customary In Britain and Ireland on Chose days are relics of the old sacrificial fires, according to Mr. Squire and his teachers. Another relic is the only re-eently extinct custom of sacrificing cattle to avert the cattle-plague. The most persistent survival, however. Is the worship of water, especiaHy wells, trees, animals, andstones. The Holy Wells of Ireland and ‘Britain are very numerous to this day, changed from what might be compared with th« Greek fountains of the nymphs into wells dedicated to saints, and. exploited under the direction of the Christian Church.
The stories of the gods of Britain ant? Ireland are so confused that to the average reader their study might easily become repellent. Mr. Squire has handled hlB refractory subject very ably, and has made the story of British mythology both lucid and interesting.
