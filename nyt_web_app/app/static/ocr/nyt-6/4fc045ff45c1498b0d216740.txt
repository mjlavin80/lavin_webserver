aridnaturallst,-Idealized the human boy In his “ Bevis,” 'which* has just been republished, v In view of the revival of interest in Jefferies; (New York, Dutton,) much as Kenneth Gra-; hame has done in “The Golden Age?*-In these later years. Bevis is Je_f-ferles himself, in his early boyhood, and • the scenes glorified by his boyish Imagination, the New Sea, with Its tributary rivers, the mountains and forests and the battlefield are the pond and creeks, the thicket and meadows of Coate Farm, near Swindon, in Wiltshire, where Jefferies was born and brought up. The father of Jefferies was a poor farmer. The "Governor*’ of Bevis is obviously well-to-do. There Is no hint of poverty in “Bevis/* but that is only part of the idealization.
Bevis Is a masterful little boy, with a sound body, a vivid, restless imagination, plenty of courage, and a truly boyish contempt for authority, To scorn authority is a recognizable, inborn trait ot healthy boyhood. The boy, who is to be father to the man, objects to be governed, but has a marked disposition to govern. Obedience must be taught. Judging by the typical youth of this hour it is- ineffectively taught in the modern home and the modern school.

The Bevis of Blchard Jefferies J a a delightful little chap, with nothing coarse or mean in his character, and Mark, his companion and lieutenant in battle and adventure, in exploration and shipwreck, is worthy of the association. Pan is a good dog, a real, doglike dog, with none of the preternatural gifts of some dogs in recent literature. The donkey, it seems to us, is a good, reasonable donkey, too. He will run away just when Mark wants to ride him home. One evening, after he has been caught, the lads beat him mercilessly; but they cannot hurt him. Then they lock him In the stable without food or water, but the donkey has been cropping all day long, and his appetite is appeased, while he has just had a. long draught at the brook, and he is no tippler. So he peacefully goes to sleep. A sensible, well-poised donkey.

As an observer of nature, Jefferies was scarcely second to Borrow. The views of nature, as seen through a boy’s eyes, in “ Bevis," are charming. Mr. E. V. Lucas, who has a way of associating his excellent critical and editorial ability with good literature only, writes the Introduction to this new edition. He thinks that, as a book for boys, *' Bevis ” stands alone " in its blend of joy in the open air, sympathetic understanding of boy nature, and most admirable writing.” Mr. Lucas thinks little, however, of the mimic battle of Pharsalia, which is rather well-ordered, and he doubts if any English boys ever played quofts with so much pleasure as Bevis and Mark. But those are small blemishes. “Bevis" is a wholesome and delightful book.

Another book about boys, of quite a different sort, and certainly not delightful In any aspect, is “ A Boy’s Control and SelfExpression,” by Eustace Miles, assistant master at Rugby, and an amateur champion, on both sides of the Atlantic, In tennis and racquets. Mr. Miles's book is long and discursive, but he prides himself on having kept In view all the time a single, central Idea. Mr. Miles knows boys, and, presumably, likes them. But he does not view them poetically, and he has no illusions concerning them. He writes as one bearlng-in mind the fact that there were no boys in the Garden of Eden, and that the first boy (a poor example for other boys) was not born until Satan had secured sway on the earth.
He writes as a schoolmaster who knows the worst about boys, as a physiologist and student of medicine, and his book is not for boys themselves or for promiscuous reading at all. It is not a book to leave on the table in the library, but it is one that may lead to much good if rightly interpreted.
Mr. Miles writes for the sake of the moral and physical welfare of all boys, of their minds as well as their bodies. He is a man of fads himself, but he tries not to impose his fads on others. He eats no , meat and drinks no beer, but we infer that he does not hold that meat and beer necessarily lead to damnation. "We have said enough now about his book, which Is published also by E. F. Dutton & Co.
I It was something of a shocik to pick it up after M Bevis,” but life'is complex, [.and it Is not all poetry by any means* i-more!s the pity.
