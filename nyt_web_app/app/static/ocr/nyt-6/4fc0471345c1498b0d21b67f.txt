[HE name of W. Tuckwell has not resounded very loudly on this side of the Atlantic. But if his own account of his career is to be taken as he gives it. both his name and his words have roused great enthusiasm among* the workingmen and agricultural laborers ot England, whose hearts he has fired and whose affections he has gained in many years of work, apparently more In political agitation and experiments in social reform than in purely religious ministrations. The title that he claims of " radical ” is none too strong. He is a clergyman of tbe Established Church, an Oxford man. and a scholar, who believes in disestablishment, the abolition of the House of Lords, nationalization of the land, Home Kule for Ireland, electoral and other reforms that include, apparently, nearly everything short of out-and-out Socialism. He has cast his lot entirely with the workingmen In advocating this radical programme. His story of his work throws some interesting side lights on some of the recent political history of England and on the temper and aspirations of the lower classes, from a quarter that is not often so engagingly and skillfully represented as he represents it.
For Mr. Tuckwell writes with a vigor and directness, a positive candor, and an intensity of conviction that make interesting reading. He was brought into contact with many of the foremost personalities of the Liberal Party, especially in the election campaign of 18S5. One of his most notable contributions to that campaign was his counsel to laboring voters, that if they had signed or spoken a promise of their votes to any one they Bhould go to the polls and mark their secret ballots for another candidate if they chose; or if they were asked to sign or promise in the future, they should do so. and still consider themselves free to vote untrammeled. Parliament had ordained that all votes should be secret, and signature and promise should go for nothing. An angry controversy arose in the press, in which yhe London Times took part, refusing, by the way, to print his reply, and the casuistical clergyman was severely handled, but he was also ardently defended, and his “ leaflet *’ was circulated in innumerable copies, translated into Welsh, versified, and copied into American and Australian newspapers.
That electoral battle was won by the agricultural laborer; but his promised reforms were swept aside by the unwise and Iniquitous forcing of the Home Rule scheme. It all showed Mr. Gladstone’s hostility to the " new democracy.” The succeeding years brought Mr. Tuckwell into close connection with the Anglo-Irish alliance in the efforts to maintain liberal supremacy. All this, as well as liis distinctively social reform work, showed him the misery of the English laboring classes at close range. It haunted him with a sense of guilt, and he came to understand the Pauline restlessness—** Woe is me if I preach not the Gospel **; the gospel of discontent and refofm. With it all he Is an optimist, though some of the stories he tells are by no means optimistic in their significance. They are all full of an intensely burning seriousness; fortunately not without the grace of humor.
There are Interesting glimpses of prominent political figures. He discloses the somewhat uncertain and mysterious figure of Frank Schnadhorst, the hidden hand of Liberal strategy for many years, as a person grotesquely misrepresented by his opponents. Instead of being a loudmouthed demagogue- Jie was courteous, gentle, retiring; rarely speaking in public, he exerted his Influence ’ through dexterous pei suasiveness, power to convince and educate, wielding a vast, secret knowledge because he was entirely trusted by every one. He was as a friend sympathetic and considerate, and his occasional gloomy manner was due to deafness and his severe headaches; and perhaps to the former was due his curious half whisper. S!r William Harcourt, the btst'of talkers, Mr. Tuckwell shows us telling stories, crisp and scholarly, and correcting his Latin quantity, to which the radical parson replied with a criticism of the Latin on Sir William's grandfather’s tomb in York Minster. Sir "William took the joint to heart, consulted several scholars, and wrote to him long afterward about it. And we arc moved to wonder how -many American political speakers could engage7 foa similar discussion.	^

the kind that-disposes men to Popery. Hutton was never quite at ease with his firebrand contributor, as a contributor, scanning his articles suspiciously, and sometimes mangling them into ortho-,, doxy. Mr. Tuckwell remembers meeting him one day close to the Trafalgar Square lions:
He quoted disapprovingly some words which I had written and he had struck out in a review of Westcott's " Christus Consummator,” and launched forth regardless of passers-by, who turned to stare, propounding in vociferant tones the worthlessness of a historic Christ, unless based on a metaphysical Logos.
It is not strange that Mr. Tuckwell’s radical stand and his persistent political advocacy of radical ideas should cause almost his ostracism by his fellow ** clerks in holy orders.” There are numerous occasions when he tells us of averted looks, ostentatious avoidance, even the industrious circulation of untrue reports, on their part. On his own, he considers that the clergy of the Established Church,
*' whose progress through past history is paved with forfeited opportunities, are wasting this, the most fruitful and perhaps the last opportunity,” that of^fight-ing the battle of the lower orders. A clergy endowed with excluding prerogative and we? 1th us appanages to spiritual leadership of a great nation is bound to justify its monopoly by sagacious intervention, by mediatorial adroitness—if necessary by self-sacrificing leadership. This merciless critic of his own denomination sums it up thus:
I say that the Anglfcan clergy as a body, tried all by these tests, has failed; failed as it failed in the Lollard upheaval of tjie fourteenth century; in the Wesley revival of tlie eighteenth; failed as In the dockers' strike of some years back, in the more recent village movement. If the chance is given again it may come too late to save the Establishment; not too late for the rehabilitation ia good men’s estimate of a penitent and regenerate Church.
