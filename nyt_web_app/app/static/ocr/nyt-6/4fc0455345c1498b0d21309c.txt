MOTORS A.\D MOTORING. By Henry J. Spooner, C. E. Diagrams. One volume. J*p. xili.-IOCl. Svo. New York: Dodd, Afead & Co. 50 cents.	“
Prof. Spooner's book might properly bo called a Primer of Motoring. It does not tell you what car to buy—the agents will tell you that variously; but it undertakes to Instruct you in the elements of present-day motor machinery, to enlighten you as to the different systems used in automobiles, and to 'fit you to battle intelligently with the persuasive salesmen. If reaches its end, too, and if a man who has studied the book intelligently and knows the style of machine he wants, thereafter allows himself to be overpersuaded into buying one he does not [ want, he need blame himself only.
1 As a rule, says Mr. Spooner, a motor car costs—the purchaser—$100 for. each horse power, plus $1 a pound. There are exceptions, he admits, but the rule is a pretty good one to go by. Ninety per cent, of the cars, American and foreign, now on the market are driven by the gasolene explosive engine, and for that reason Mr. Spooner restricts his book to a study of such cars. It Is pleasing to have him say that, while not long ago It was hard to choose a satisfactory American car, it is
not so now. ** Cars more perfect In design, materials, workmanship, construction, finish, and durability are not to be found anywhere in Europe than those which are turned out by our most famous makers.”	.
The book should prove especially useful to persons buying- second-hand cars, who are not benefited by the instruction of the makers' agent.
