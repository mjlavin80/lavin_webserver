In spite of all that has been done for < Mr, Sidney R. Kennedy'? " The Lode- ] star" in the way of handsome printing, attractive Illustrations, and a cover i adorned with 'the neatest and most allurIng little white and preen New England farmhouses, surrounded by a five-barred j fence, the story of how Hamilton King j and Eleanor Hyde met, loved, and mar- ■ ried still persists In being1 something of j a disappointment. The most obvious j reason for this seems to he that the author has chosen to attempt the drawing of several scintillating individuals, and , the result does not bear out quite all his j assertions concerning their intellectual I and humorous attainments. Also, he has assumed to depict the personalities, manners, and amusements of a modern American Croesus and his satellites, but there is not much about his John Brlnton that bears resemblance to a real human being, even of the plutocrat variet5>^whi2e the j house party, described at great length as enjoying his luxurious hospitality for , weeks at a time, hardly seems to be of a j calibre to furnish entertainment to so exacting and pleasure-loving ^ host. In such circumstances one does not wonder j that he had to resort to his private car | now and then for relief from their com- ! t>auionship, or that he made sure that his three car servants were sufficiently trained in vaudeville accomplishments to i earn their salary twice oyer as profea- j sional entertainers when their services were not required in more menial pur- | suits. Even Parmer Hyde and his strangely assorted household are not like anything actually to be found in that much- ! exploited realm, the rural New England so dear to the novelist in seach of decided types and quaint characters.
The " lodestar ” which Mr. Kennedy's hero at last succeeded in fasicnln.j In his own particular sky for good and all was Farmer Hyde’s -niece, and she first dawned upori the impressionable yonng man from the doorstep of a farmhouse Tihere he end a companion b«d stopped to get a refractory "axle greased. Neither of young lady’s visitors was lieicing in audacity; she was a dream of feminine prettiness and	self-possession -unliltc
! some farmers’ nieces—and while they all three hunted for the wagon ** Jack ’* the acquaintance progressed rapidly through the medium of a style of conversation which the author calls " complicated nonsense.” As the supposedly simple Eleanor sustained it with ease, one is.led to suspect that.it Is not so complicated after all. However, Eleanor had attended the most exclusive of fashionable schools, and there had not only imbibed worldly knowledge, but had made the acquaintance of May Brlnton, whose father, was the millionaire previously referred to. Miss BrJntonhad not impressed * Eleanor very favorably at that time, -but her two new fiends hail the discovery of the acquaintance with joy and immediately begin to scheme to have the Brlntons ** take her up "and start her off ’* in the social whirt where they themselves disported.
This having been accomplished, much against Eleanor’s wishes and with some little hesitationvand suspicion on May’s Cart, and~none at all on Mr> Brinton’g/ the- course-of true,. love between the various eligible ' persons ^proceeds ; to run -somewhat" roXigtily/but* never roughly , enough to cause the reader any -anxiety" as to the ultimate disposal of the 4‘ lodestar's” affections. The s^ationa:Of Brinton rin the " starting - off ;*' ’process are so little removed from burlesque that his. repeated, attempts &t tampering;\yjth 'the plot are "never to be, regarded %e-tfously.His; daughter schemes > Htilei but yields -to the irresistible claims of the lady with astronomlcal tendencies, and finally finds the- heart to be extremely generous to'iier rtVal., ^ ,	'
