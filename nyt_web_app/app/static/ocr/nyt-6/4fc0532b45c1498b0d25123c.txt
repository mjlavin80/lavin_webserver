This English translation of the book by J". Maxwell, M. D., Deputy Attorney at the Court of Appeals, Bordeaux, France, contains, besides the preface by Dr. Charles Richet and an Introduction by Sir Oliver Lodge, an additional chapter on “ A Complex Case," by Prof. Richet, and an account of “ Some Recently Observed Phenomena," by the translator, L. I. Pinch.
As Dr. Maxwell points out in the “ Preliminary Remarks ” to his volume, he has " purposely ” refrained from giving a purely scientific aspect to his book. It seemed preferable for him to relate what he had seen, " leaving it to those for whom he writes to believe him or not, as they think fit.” In the course of his preface, Dr. Richet gives some “ advice to the reader
He must take up this book without prejudice. He must fear neither that which is new nor that which is unexpected. In other words, while preserving the most scrupulous respect for the science of to-day, he must be thoroughly convinced that this science, whatever measure of truth it may contain, Is nevertheless terribly Incomplete. * * * There need be no fear that the invasion of a new science into the old will upset acquired data, and contradict what has been established by savants.	*
There are chapters on “ method " in phenomena, ** raps,” “ parakinesis,"' and “telekinesis," M Luminous Phenomena,
“ Psycho-Sensory and Intellectual Phenomena,” and " Fraud and Error.” Accounts of phenomena are given from Dr. Maxwell's notes and the reports of others. In closing his introduction of Dr. Maxwell to the English reader, Sir Oliver Lodge writes;
*	* * I must not be understood as making myself responsible for the contents of the book, nor for the interjected remarks, nor tor the translation. The author and translator must bear their own responsibility. My share In the work is limited to expressing my confidence in the good faith of Dr. Maxwell—in his impartiality and competence-^and while congratulating him on the favorable opportunities for investigation which have fallen to his lot, to thank him, on behalf of English investigators, for the singleminded pertinacity and strenuous devotion with which he has pursued this difficult and nebulous quest.
