R ARTHUR STRINGERS letter in The book Review of June 10 apropos of Mr. Gilder’s noble poem read at the opening of the Albright Art Gallery, In Buffalo, is like a rainbow in the sky that dots indeed make the heart of the lover of
poetry leap up. 'Hie gloomy forecast made by the poets themselves in The Critic’s late symposium on the so-called *' slump *’ in the art divine has been most depressing. To see many Pegasuscs trailing sad wings in the dust made one almost despair, made one fear, in truth, that the bards* ethereal soaring would ultimately become even as the gambols of the ichthyosaurus, a feat of the past. H»*nce it is reassuring to read that Mr. Stringer, who has himself rendered to the muse some service of distinction, feels that not yet need the poets hang their harps upon the willows; that, on the contrary, they may still become of ** civic use,” of " national concern.' '
So optimistic seems Mr. Stringer's view on the reading of Mr. Gilder’s poem as the identification of poetry with actual affairs and actual life, so wise seem his deductions from such an auspicious performance, it is a temptation to ring a few more, changes on the same theme.
In a country where we pride ourselves (justly or unjustly) 011 our patronage of art, where continually some Croesus calls down Europe's chagrin and envy by bringing home a masterpiece, where some attempt is being made to cultivate higher architectural standards, where civic improvement in its aesthetic aspect is becoming a mission in life for many, where we beguile Parsifal from the consecrated halls of Baireuth, is U not inconsistent to let languish this other art of expression, with its grace and elevation, its charm of harmonious syllables and melodious cadences, somehow the most intimate of all the arts, inasmuch as, though some of us never touch brush or chisel, never strike a note of music, we all < howsoever gracclcssly the majority of us) use words, the pigments of poetry, the secret of whose use is sacred, it is true, to the few elect—yet do not the most prosaic of us daily drop into poetry, our own or another man’s, more frequently than we imagine? Surely, while the other arts are being so ardently courted, it is but stupid, capricious neglect to allow the fair muse of poetry to pass into sad and slighted spinsterhood unwooed, unhonored, and unwept.
It is the persuasion of the writer that the trouble is not entirely with a callous, unresponsive public. But if the public is to blame, It could do better, and there are economic reasons for its doing so. Doubtless the poems read at the Olympian games did as much as any other part of the programme to realize the pur-
*	pose of those interesting ancient exercises to foster the national spirit of Greecc. And as it goes in Milton's great sonnet:	j
" the repeated air	{
Of sad Electra's poet had the power To save the Athenian walls from ruin bare.*'
Who knows what powerful influences our poets may become if once they gain deep consciousness of our American life, which not blatant Jingoism alone may name great, throbbing, instinct with elements that could well be a major poet’s inspiration. But perhaps the Nation shoulckdo something definite to stimulate this deep consciousness in the poet who seems to feel himself in unsympathetic atmosphere. A suggestion may be found Hi Mr. R. U. Johnson s contribution to Miss Gilder’s symposium in The Critic, wherein there is a hint that M much could be done institutionally to cultivate here this finest of the fine arts.” The recent account of the excursions into the book world made by the scholar who now occupies the White House proves that Mr. Roosevelt sometimes canters up the. Heliconian Mount—with as much pleasure, we fancy, as he galloped up San Juan Hill.
It will be matter for surprise ff such a lover of letters does not grasp his golden opportunity to Institute some perennial National honor to literature. What more distinguished service could he render? It is time for America to be known otherwise than through her commercial and mechanical achievements. Some public recognition ot the singing robes, not by establishment of any servile laureateship, but in some magnanimous, sagacious way, would give the poets a chance to prove _ their mettle, -would surely vitalize their ast, ennoble It, draw it away from what Mr. Stringer calls ** fragmentary aspirations,” and put it In touch •with life’s wider issues, ideality’s higher phases. Meanwhile we should have no ignominious laments over the decline of the charming art. The poet could address his fellow-c raftsman in Wordsworth’s words: " High Is thy calling, friend.” He might learn to bring to his work that concentration which becomes consecration, to shun delights and live laborious days, or, In fact, rich " brooding years',” as a good poet above named has called them, In the attainment ot-that scholarship which-Is the mark of the great Eng- j llsh poets, In a less degree of tno Amer-lean poets of any achievement With Mr. : Stringer we hope the, coming of this poet, or these poets. Is not far. oJX They are j , due even now—Ix>well had a vision of one of them:-	^	........

His verse shall have a great, commanding motion, ^
Heaving and swelling with a melody
Learned of the sky, the river, and the ocean,
And all the pure majostic things that be.
Awake, then, thou! we pine Tor thy great presence
To make us feel the soul once moro sublime,
We are of far too infinite an essence
To rest contented with the lies of Time.”
