Economic Principles.
Henry Higgs lias edited and written a preface for W. Stanley Jevons’s " Principles of Economics: A Fragment of a Treatise on the Industrial Mechanism of Society, and Other Papers,” which appears through the Macmillan Company. He has given,, in Its entirety, the work of Jevons, with no editorial additions, except bibliographical notes and here and there an explanation. In his preface he describes the contents of the vol-j ume, which Include mostly published ar-tides and two or three hitherto unpub-Us]led ones. The subjects dealt with in-ilude wealth, utility, luxury, value, consumption, science, labor, supply and demand, insurance, classification of trades, production, &c.
It may be doubted whether the fragment now printed contained anything absolutely new at the time It was written; but it says a great deal for the judgment of the author that it is hardly affected by the searching criticisms which have discovered in the last twenty-two years eo many imperfections in the traditional reasoning of English economists. Like all the work of Jevons, it Is fresh and .suggestive, and its point of view is undoubtedly novel.
And, speaking of Jevons and his work, Mr. H*ggs says in his preface:
Among the economists of all time Jevons unquestionably stands in the first rank Alert, original, exact, profound, he brought to the study of economic theory a mind trained in the processes of logic and of mathematical analysis, while his powers of observation and co-ordination were quickened by a large acquaintance with the principles and the details of natural science. Exceptionally familiar with the works of the early English and French economists, a pioneer in pure theory, an authoritative writer upon such practical matters as money and banking * * * he was one of the few professed economists who have in England secured respect alike in Parliament, In the city, and in the closet.	__
Jevons was drowned while bathing in ISSli a few days before his forty-seventh birthday. He had outlined and written son jo parts of ** A Tr^n^ise on the Industrial Mechanism .-ociety," the fragments of which are in the present book.
