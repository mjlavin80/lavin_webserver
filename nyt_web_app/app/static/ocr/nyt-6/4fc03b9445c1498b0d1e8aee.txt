I. . ' FROM RE ADERS,
Disagrees with a Critic.
2\Tctv York Times Book Review:
I have not read ** Hester of the Grants.'* | T have read the criticism thereon In the last issue ot your valuable paper. After reading the criticism I shall ccrtainly read the book. The person who wrote the criticism is evidently one of the few who believe that proper literary taste 1s evidenced by sneering at the historical novel. In the criticism it Is practically stated that " Hester of the Grants " Is a very well written book, and would be worth reading if its subject were not lilstoricaL The author of tiie work; fs advised, by this literary adept, to direct her literary ability into some otfier channej, when she win gain his, the critic’s, commendation. *
It occurred to me, as I read the abovementioned wholesale criticism and coarse denunciation of the entire " triber* of historical novels, how fortunate it was that Sir Walter Scott and Alexandre Dumas passed from earth before this critic
appeared upon the scene, otherwise those two able authors might have been persuaded to direct their literary energies in other channels and thereby have deprived the world of their contributions io the ** tribe ” of historical novels.
