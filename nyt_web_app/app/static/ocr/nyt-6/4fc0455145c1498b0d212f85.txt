Little new can be said of Franklin’s autobiography at this* time. It has been a | classic for nearly a hundred ■ years, even ■ In its altered form as originally pub-.
| lishea, and complete and in Franklin’s | own strong English it has had wide clr-culation. Even in England It has bad i much, the same vogue as here. It is uote-l worthy, however, that .this is the first , complete edition of the autobiography printed in England.	‘
' The edition ’before us is interesting be*
; cause it shows the high esteem in which Franklin is held In England as well as 1 here, and for the. preface and the continu-; ation' of the philosopher's life contributed to the volume by the English editor.
1 Mr. William Macdonald. Mr. Macdonald is a thoroughly grounded admirer^ o7 Franklin; his introduction is •-frritten with enthusiasm, and his “ continuation " 1 is both enthusiastic and temperate.
TheTiook la excellently printed, and, being much cheaper than Mr. Bigelow’s magnum opus, should have a wide circu-latlon, though It	has not,	and does	not
pretend to have,	all that	bis three	vol-
j umes contain In	the' way	of letters	and	1
documents.	.	I
