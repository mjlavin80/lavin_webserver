IBERAL theology £s Just at | present in somewhat ot a , bad way. It has razed -the ■old mansions of tho soul to . the ground; and cleared away ' \nuch theological rubbish, j and. is now, occupied in re- j building : a fair and goodly., habitation. ! Somewhat to its surprise it finds that not alone has it to use very mttch the : same material, but has even had to adopt very much the same architectural plan as that of the building which was demolished, and even after the edifice Is up It reeks of paint and plaster, and there are ho “ cozy comers *’ in which the soul i Can rest. In its - perplexity., theology Is turning with even greater. avidity to
*	what is euphemistically known as scien- j tific research. The study of texts and sources is endless and attractive, and ap- : pears to act as a spiritual anodyne. A ; . man can devote his life to the study of the Clementine epistles without necessarily having to make up his mind as io the transsubstantiality of the elements of the eucharlst. and curiously enough this is a ground Where the extremes of | orthodoxy tend to meet in ultro-ratlon-Ists. Nothing has been more significant i in theological movements of recent ..years -j than the rescript of Leo XIII.. ordering a sort of Biblical Commission to inquire into modern Biblical research. . He recognizes that theological science like all sctcnce can at best be descriptive and c m never explain. It is to the higher interests of the Church to have its facts correct before it begins its explanations5.
The two books now under notice rre chiefly Interesting as indicating there two tendencies of modern liberal theology —its half-hearted attempt at reconstruction in the direction of the old dogmas; its whole-hearted devotion to the research after truth as to the actual facts on which Christian faith is to be directed.
Prof. Dods’s book is in^no sense of the word an introduction to the Bible. Ho does not discuss dates, authenticity, and the like of the separate Biblical books; he has nothing to say of manuscripts ami editions: he discusses rather the various i theological problems that have clustered round th« series of books sacred to all persons deriving their culture from Europe. It is recognized on all hands that in many ways the Bible has lost its hold upon people as compared with the days when its statements were received as final on any question of morals or religion. IT we find in the Bibie a view agreeing wiih that which we hold ourselves we acc^u that as authority; if it happens to di.<--
-	agree with what we believe we immediately proceed to explain away, not our be- j lief, but the Biblical statement, by pointing out the circumstances under which it -was spoken, or the special environment of Eastern life which made it valid for that , time, and so forth and so on. The most j recent attempt at a recovery of interest j in the Bible has been to insist upon it.* ' gr^at literary merits, but here again it j has been difficult to get up enthusiasm for the genealogies of Chronicles, or even for some of the sublime incoherencies of the prophets as represented in modern translations from texts which are often corrupt and still more often obscure.
Prof. Dods has adopted another and more fitting way of bringing out the .superior merits of the Bible. Prof. Max Muller bullded better than he knew tn arranging for the elaborate series of "Sacred Books of the - East," translations of Oriental so-called wisdom. He had very reason for his confidence that the publication of translations -of these would only confirm the superior position given to the Old and New Testament above all the sacred books of the world. The inanities, the longueurs, the utter absence of any connection with the problems of real life found In the Indian, Persian, and Chinese scriptures (the Koran is perhaps to bo excepted) make one recognize the debt we owe to the Jewish* sages who wrote down the Bible.
Prof. Dods begins well by contrasting the Jewish and the other Scriptures. He then goes on to discuss what it is that gives the superiority to our Bible. This leads him to a series of chapters that diF-cuss the canon of scripture, the quality of the revelation made in it, the Inspiration it brings with it, and the infallibility claimed for it. Then come the last two lectures dealing with specfal instances as I regards the Gospels, and especially their miraculous elements.
What strikes one as symptomatic of ‘ Prof. Dods’s treatment in all these topics : is the concession he. makes to the old type of* unbeliever. Thus he allows that revelation is progressive; in other words, its earlier stages' are incom-

He even denies, what he ingeniously calls the .V literal inerrancy of Scripture," and finishes off his chapter on “ Infallibility ** with a quotation from Snell: "Try to treat tho volumes as a flawless chronological or scientific record, -and you will be disappointed. r. Treat it as a mean-3 of. religious edification, and you cannot fail." How would that criterion . work If applied to “pilgrim's Progress ” or " The Little‘Flowers of St. Francis"?	_
Prof. Dods is merely a representative jf a general tendency of which one is curious to know the outcome. What is. peculiar to himself Is the clarity, .of exposition, the brightness of sympathy; the sound sanity and sincerity of his treatment of a subject which more than anything lends itself to exaggeration and Up service. He appeals at all stages of his argument to the effects on human nature of the historic religious consciousness. He makes a fine point of the fact that every actual religion involves the hypothesis of a special revelation;_ we cannot pray—that is, speak to God^uxiiess we believe God speaks to us. If any one wishes to know the attitude of a modern religious thinker toward the Bible he cannot do better than consult Prof. Dods, but one cannot help wondering what Dr. Chalmers—not to speak of John Kriox— would have thought of Prof. Dods's concessions.	‘
If Prof. Dods’s book represents the tendency of liberal theology to concede everything and then proceed to drag in the old creeds as best satisfying the new yearnings. Prof. Harnack's new work on
■	" The Expansion of Christianity" bears j witness to the new tendency of liberal
theology toward exact research into the facts of the religious life.
Harnack’s strength has always been in exact research. His “ History of Christian Dogma ’’ is the text book of this generation as Darner’s was of the preceding one, and he is joint editor with Gebhardt of a remarkable series of texts and memoirs on the earliest records of Christianity, which are at the very height and forefront of church history investigation. When such an authority as this writes upon a topic like the expansion of the church in the first three centuries, all but a dozen men in the oecumenical world have perforce to be silent. That is, when a man like Harnack tells us what we ought to understand as to the facts of 1 Lhe case we have perforce to accept his facts. When he draws conclusions from
■	those facts, each of us has as much right
I	as he	to	test the validity of his deduc-
:	Lions.	The historic problem that he	has
to deal with in this work (the first volume only of which is accessible in English) is why-Christfanity did not at once conquer the world, and why it did conquer the world by the time of Constan-|	Line.	In	short, we have here from	the !
|	hands	of	a believer a problem that	the
skeptic Gibbon attempted to solve with ' , his easy-going Infidelity in the celebrated-j ' fourteenth chapter of his history. The present volume deals with the environ- ^ ment with which the Christian tendencies | had to deal, the diffusion of Judaism, the condition of the ancient world, the mission of Christianity, and the conditions of that mission.	j
Much of this is now “ common form." after the researches of Schiirer, not to speak of the now antiquated work of Dollinger, but Harnack puts his points with less pedantry than the former, and with better equipped scholarship than the latter. Yet much will be new. even to the , expert student. His excursus in the sixth ' chapter on " Christians as a third race ” is somewhat of a novelty. The Jews were regarded by the Romans as a second race with special privileges and characteristics. Harnack brings out for the first time the interesting point that at any rate among the pagan population Christians were regarded as a “ third ' class" of humanity, even more hateful than the Jews. The third book, which is only begun in the present volume, deals with the Christian mission, and is full of the details of daily life derived from the documents of the Church Fathers that make this part of the work an Interesting supplement to the familiar works on classical'antiquities. How the missionaries trayeled, their exchange of letters and literature, the various grades and degrees of their authority—all these topics are dealt with with as much minuteness as similar topics in such a book as Fried-lander’a " Sittengeschichte Roms.” In fact, we have here to deal with the archaeology of the subject, not Its dogmatics, and it is In this sense that Harnack’s book illustrates the tendency, to. which we have above referred, of liberal theology to deal with the matters of fact of Christian life rather than the matters of opinion of Chrlsian metaphysics.
