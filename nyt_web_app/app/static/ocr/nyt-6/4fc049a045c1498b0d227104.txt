In his introduction of “ The Rhymer’s Lexicon,” by Andrew Loring, which E. P. Dutton & Co. arc publishing in this country, Prof. George Salntsbury briefly sets forth what seem to him to be the M-general ’* facta .and laws of English., versification. His conclusions are the result not of any ** antecedent theory,” but of a '* careful and constant reading of as far as may be the whole body of English verse of all ages, since it really became English.” A large number of his statements, he points out in a note, are controversial, and 'there is no support of arguments. What he has to say in this Introduction, he adds, will be embodied In ah “ elaborate ” ** History of English Prosody,” on which he has been working for some time.
The lexicon is divided into three parts— Finals, Penults, and ~Antepenufts. The words have been grouped according to the accented vowel sound and placed in columns in the alphabetical sequence of the letters which follow this sound, and which letters have been set in dark type. Each part of the lexicon has fourteen vospcI divisions, adopted for reference purposes; and the divisions are enumerated in a table of contents, which also includes key words illustrating the vowel sounds. This table has been introduced, the compiler says, ** for the reason that it does for the vowels what the columns of rhymes do for the consonants. It completes the record of the vagaries of English spelling.” “ The Rhymer’s Lexicon " is a handbook not only for the poet and specialist, but also for the ** spelling reformer.” It will, as is shown in *he preface, supply him with " most of his illustrations and provide him with his arguments.” Mr. Loring is the American Consul at Bristol, England.
