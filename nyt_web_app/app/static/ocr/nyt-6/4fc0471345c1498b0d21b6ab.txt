In the address of the Trustees of Shakespeare's birthplace to the Royal Academy of Spain, touching the Madrid' celebration of the tercentenary of " Don Quixote,” which we print on another page, the most striking passage is the statement, signed by such men as Sidney Lee, Sir Henry Irving, and Sir Theodore Martin, that " there Is good “reason to believe ** Shakespeare himself read " Don Quixote." Whal good reason? every one who reads this statement must ask. The Spaniards, in replying, avoid all such preludes of controversy. *' Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra," they exclaim, “ and William Shakespeare are two supreme geniuses who symbolize In the loftiest degree the power and splendor of the literatures of the nations of which they were the glorious ornaments.” That is all eloquent, appropriate, and safe.
