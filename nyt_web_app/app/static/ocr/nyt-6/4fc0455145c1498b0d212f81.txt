The wayfaring- man is always very curious to 'know the unofficial truth behind the official' explanations of international crimes and scandals. Mr. Vance Thompson's hook professes to reveal this truth In several celebrated instances. More, the revelations are presented with an air of authority which ms Ires them read like the truth. Therefore the hook is rather fascinating reading, in spite o£ the circumstance that the real truth Is probably as different from Mr. Thompson’s version as ' Mr. ^Thompson's version is from official history.	,
The particular mysteries of which the veil is supposed to be rent away in this case include that of the madness of Ludwig of Bavaria. Ludwig the unfortunate, according to Mr. Thompson, was not mad at all. He was a man by nature no less sensible than most men, the victim of others, including Wagner (of whom, in a moral sense, the author has a very mean opinion) and Bismarck. As for Bismarck, he is Mr. Thompson’s head devil, for blackness and bloody machinations beyond comparison among the sons of men. He Inspired the sta tec raftsmen of Bavaria to ruin Ludwig; he, with deep plotting and Prussian gold, tempted the ill-fated Rudolph, hope of the Hapsburgs,
1 to his reckless dealings in wild- oats and , to his ugly doom in the forest lodge of ( Meyerling. The woman who perished
there with the Prince was, says Mr. Thompson, Bismarck’s agent, and he hints that the Iron Chancellor’s net for the rivals of the house of HohenzoJ-lern has slain all the other Hapsburgs who have In later years perished by violence—even the Empress Elizabeth.
Another story purports to relate what really happened when the powers took a hand in Crete and gave that island autonomy—In particular, how the French Admiral Pottler checkmated the dark schemes of the Sultan and William of Germany, his secret ally, and actually arrested the War Lord himself coming into Crete " in disguise.” Yet other stories pretend to tell what really happened during that delightful comedy wherein the Crown Prince of Germany gave his grandmother Victoria’s ring to Miss Gladys Deacon; yet others are of how President Faure ot France came to his end, and how the-present great war between Japan and Russlar with “nil its surprises ;was made
