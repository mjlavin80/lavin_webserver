ATRINA TRASK haS in the June Arena five vigorous _ stanzas of iambic pentameters entitled •• Rise/ Mighty Anglo-Saxons.** This is an appeal to -the men ot the English-speaking races to cease fighting.
Sv./Pfekty Anglo-Saxons! You assert With conscious pride the kingship ot your race.
So the poet begins "her appeal, and goes on to urge the races to rise and break their swords and disband their armies. „	“ The	revolu-

have ** brought eons of God a few steps nearer God.*’ Man regenerate should see further than the boundaries of his own state, “and brotherhood should circle round the world.” Mrs. Trask’s most striking stanza follows:
You cannot serve Him and deny 'Him Doth. ■
§eiih2nest’ Anglo-Saxons! And be true! fun down your minsters; hush the swelling hymn;
Throw to the winds the sacramental bread—
The holy bread of life and brotherhood—
wr. with a. common human honesty.
Cease to shed blood; and cease to teach your sons
The code of battle and the code of death, wjilie—dressed Jn your ensanguined livery—
They wait the opportunity to kill;
Cease to build battleships and death's grim enginery;
Ce^e to pay tribute to the god of war; And cease—-O Pharisees!— to pray '* Thy kingdom come,”
While you are voting means to make a hell	—
In some vain-boasted cause of righteousness.
I irresponsible? As a matter ot fact, it is not. Would any one accuse Shakespeare t of irresponsibility, or Milton, or (to come i to our own times) Browning?
I Instances abound on the other side, It I Is true, and as one's eye flies down the ! files of time it alights on many a Shel-I ley; and poetasters follow'in the wake of poets. Perhaps It Is even harder to be i responsible with a little talent. And history is full of young lives wrecked, one 1 would think needlessly.—Marriott Watson i in The London Daily Mail*
The latest Ht-rary
Where Was problem is:	Where
Mr**. Browning was Elizabeth Bar-Born r	„
rett Browning born?
The '* Encyclopaedia Britannica " says she was born In London; the "Dictionary of National Biography ” assigns Bum Hall, Durham, as her birthplace. Sume biographers have preferred Hope End, Herefordshire, while Mr. Ingram, in his life ot the poetess, says that The
Tyne Mercury of March 34, 1S09, announces for the 4th of March: “In London the wife of Edward M. Barrett, Esq., of a daughter.” Mr. Browning, however, challenged this statement by asserting that his wire was born on March 6, at Carlton Hall, Durham, the residence of her father's brother. But Carlton Hall is in Yorkshire, and Mr. Ingram declares that it did not come into the possession of Mr. Moulton Barrett till after 1810. Finally, there Is the entry in the parish .register of Kelloe Church, which is as follows:	"	Elizabeth Barrett Moulton
Barrett, daughter «nd first child of Edward Barrett Moulton Barrett of Coxhoe Hall, native of St. James's, Jamaica, by Mary, late Clarke, native of Newcastle-on-Tync. March 0, ISOS.” Somebody certainly ought to offer a prize for the solution of so Intricate a puzle.—London Academy.
Lord Lyndhurst once BJosrrapZtfes remarked that Lord
Campbell had added a " new terror to death by bis Lives of the Chancellors.” Lord Campbell, protesting that he would not be cheated by the trick of longevity, left behind him his biographies of Lyndhurst and Brougham, who both survived him. But the vengeance even of Lord Campbell was posthumous. Mr. Barnett Smith was one of the first to choose his victims from the ranks of the living in the persons of Gladstone and Bright. His books are meritorious compilations, but tjhe Home Rule biir'of-lSSO, which he could not be expected to foresee, destroyed much of their value. 'The late Mr. Traill, not a bookmaker, but a brilliant scholar and journalist, added Lord Salisbury In his lifetime to a series ot the Queen’s Prfme Ministers, and Mr. George Htissell did the same for Mr. Gladstone. These, however, were rare exceptions to the sound, rule of de viventibusnil nisi publicum. The privilege of eminence is now extended to notoriety; the biographer competes with Tussaud; and not/to have had a book written* about one - is becoming almost as great a distinction as not to have written a book.
