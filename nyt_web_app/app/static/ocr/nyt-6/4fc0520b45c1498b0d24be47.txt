While Anne Warner is In Europe, Messrs. Little, Brown & Co. arc preparing her “ Tho Rejuvenation of Aunt Mary " for Autumn publication^ it has undergone a- process too often omitted In stories originally intended for use In serial form* and has been rewritten, but Aunt Mary and her student friends remain the same as ever, and her nephew Jack still rightly appreciates his good fortune in introducing her to New York.

Messrs. H. M. Caldwell & Co. will present Mr, James Clarence Harvey’s " In Bohemia/* as a small book with very wide margins and a little square of text, or a Mucha design, a symbol, a joke, or a sprightly vignette, in the centre. The greater part of_the book Is prose, but it contains some gay verses, including the remarkable true story of the separation of Adam and Eve,

Matt. Stan, Kemp, A, M., whose " Andy Trembath" is announced by the C. M. Clark Publishing Company for early Autumn, is known to his parishioners In'the Alpha Lutheran Church in Turtle Creek, a suburb of Pittsburg, as the Kev. Matthew Stanley Kemp, but, being only twenty-eight years of age, he Is still boyish enough to prefer the abbreviated form fop-secular use. He is the son of a Cornish miner, who. after some experience In mining for Michigan copper and Colorado silver, settled in the anthracite region while Mr. Kemp was still a boy* so that he is familiar with not only the working, but also the domestic aspects of a miner’s life, and fully understands the “ company store." Two or three serious mishaps in I the mine kept his father idle for a long „ time, so that his family felt the touch ; of poverty, but his son was able to accompany him on a long visit to England, and became acquainted with places which hla father had described to him. After his father's death, his mother and sister sent him to the high school and to Gettysburg College, whence he went to the Gettysburg Theological Seminary. He was pastor of two churches before he was Installed at Turtle Creek. He is a bachelor, chiefly, he declares, because his heart still belongs to the sister who aided him during his college course, assisted his brother through the law school, and made her own way through the Boston Conservatory of Music. Naturally she formed his Ideals of womanly excellence, as his father shaped his conception of a workingman.	^ ^
, While busying herself with the great number of serious drawings which she has made In France and England during the last two years, Mrs. Mansfield (Blanch McManus) has become much interested in the childrerj of both countries, and has sho'iTO the beauty of one and the pretty courtesy and occasional amazing naughtiness of the other in the^plctures of two small books to appear in the Autumn in the Little Cousin Series as " Our Little French Cousin" and *'Our Little English Cowsln.”

Compared wjth “ Quincy Adams Sawyer/' Mr. Charles Felton Pidgin's " Stephen Holton ” might be said to have had no advertising, but a preache r-hero and temperance as a subject are always attractive to readers who prefer sober fiction, and the seventh printing is announced by Messrs. L. C. Page & Co. itfanwhile the author's name is almost unanimously mispronounced by his fellow townsmen, who persist on styling it Pigeon, as if It were the Anglicized form Of the Irish Columan instead of being allied to Pitkin.

Messrs. Page & Co. will also issue a book especially interesting to boys. Mr. Burton E. Stevenson’s “The Young Section Hand." the story of a youngster who dares to take the place of a discharged man, and suffers as might be expected, but emerges triumphant from all his troubles and quarrels.	.

Tho late Dr. Qeorge E. Street’S "'Mount j: Desert," which Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin ’ & Co." are Issuing this month,- has been carefully edited by Mr. Samuel A, Eliot.
