j Tbe Bookman of this city publishes a batch of letters received by the editors of ** a certain magazine " from would-be contributors within a year. They are all very droll letters, some with a conscious drollery which, perhaps, strengthens by contrast the underlying- tragedy of the rejected. Some are from impudent persons, some from the obviously feebleminded, but most from ignorant, well-meaning folks whom the widespread influence of the printing press has inspired with the desire for literary expression. The vast army of the rejected seems to grow in numbers from year to year, and also in grotesqueness. But the blunders and ignorance of the rejected are | not to be wondered at when we contemplate the mistakes of the elect.

Certainly not all of the publishers set the standard very high, and only they and their readers know what stuff they have to reject.
