Study of the Novel.
DEVELOPMENT OP THE ENGLISH NOVEL. By Wilbur L. Cross. 12mo. Pp. xvlu-329. New York; The MacmUlttn Company. ¥1,50-
Prof. Cross's little book, a useful and attractive one, was published more than five years ago, and has attested its usefulness by being called for in several reissues since. A few minor corrections are made in this new edition of it, which otherwise stands as It was first printed. The author indulges in a word of self-congratulations on the accuracy of his prophecy* in which he looked forward to the future development of the novel, though it may be that five years are scarcely enough to prove decisive. “ The novel will conform to the moods of human nature as they vary from epoch to epoch **; “at one time will prevail realism/* at another idealism. The short story has “ found its own beautiful art," but it " can never hope to become a universal type, for it gives scant room/’ Only in his. estimate of Kipling does Prof, Cross now fear that he was perhaps too enthusiastic, in considering' that, gathering to. himself present-day tendencies, he may be pointing the way to the 'novel of the future. ,	T	i
