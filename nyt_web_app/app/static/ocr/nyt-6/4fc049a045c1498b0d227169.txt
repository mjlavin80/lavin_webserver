The Trustees of Shakespeare’s birthplace, Stratford-on-Avon, sent the following- address lately to La Real Academia Espanola. The address is signed by Sidney Lee, Chairman; G. M. Bird, Mayor of Stratford; Archibald Flower, Theodore Martin, Henry Irving, and Richard Sai'ag-e.
We, the Trustees and guardians of Shakespeare’s birthplace, at Stratford-upon-Avon, desire to offer through your Excellency to the Spanish people our congratulations on the occasion of the three hundredth anniversary of the publication of the first part of " Don Quixote,” the immortal novel of Shakespeare's | contemporary Miguel Cervantes Saavedra.
The duty has been imposed on us by act of Parliament of preserving and protecting, on behalf of the British nation, the surviving memorials ot the greatest of English poets and dramatists in his native town of Stratford-upon-Avon.
In your illustrious fellow-countryman Miguel Cervantes Saavedra, the creator 1 of the Knigrht of La Mancha, we recognize a spirit of exuberant fancy and an | insight into human nature which command the springs of pathos no less than ! the springs of humor. That rare spirit ! and insight, which make universal appeal j to the mind and heart, give Cervantes in our eyes kinship with Shakespeare, the transcendent interpreter in poetry and drama of human life.
The history of “ Don Quixote ** of La Mancha, very soon after the publication of the first part at Madrid in 1B05, achieved Ih .England, mainly through translation, a popularity which has steadily grown through the centuries and shows no sign of-diminution at the present day. It is a satisfaction to us to be able to point out to your Excellency that there is good reason to believe that Shakespeare, who died at Stratford-upon-Avon on April 23, (old style,) 1G1U, within ten days of Cervantes himself, was among the earliest English readers of this noble romance..
The greatest efforts in literature know little of the limits of nationality. They make their appeal to all mankind. None the less, the fame which the highest literary genius confers on the nation that gave it birth is undying. Therefore we felicitate you and your fellow-countrymen on the endless renown which the genius of Miguel Cervantes Saavedra has helped to confer on the name of Spaniard.
The President and Directors of the Spanish Royal Academy replied as follows:
The Royal Academy of Spain acknowledges with cordial thanks the message of congratulation which, on the tercentenary of the publication of the first part of “ El Ingenioso Hidalgo D. Quijote de la Mancha,*’ you (as Chairman of the committee of the Trustees appointed by the Parliament ot England to protect the glorious memorials of the illustrious dramatic poet William Shakespeare, preserved in the place of his birth, Stratford-upon-Avon) have been pleased to forward to me.
Among the numerous expressions of affectionate admiration which the Spanish nation has received on the occasion of this glorious anniversary, few have been received with such sympathetic enthusiasm as that which your committee has, through you, addressed to the Royal Academy of Spain.
Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra and William Shakespeare are two supreme geniuses who symbolize in the loftiest degree the power and splendor of the literatures of the nations of which they were the glorious ornaments. If Cervantes has no equal in the fiction of the novel, Shakespeare Is unique and incomparable in the art of the drama. By the force of their imagnation, by the brilliancy of their style, by the vigor of their language, both will confer eternal honor on their respective literatures. The glory of the two writers will be .the object of the most lively, sincere, and universal admiration.
Tour message is evidence and proof of that admiration.
In gratefully acknowledging this message from the Trustees of the memorials ot Shakespeare the Royal Academy of Spain, the Trustees, of the memorials" of Cervantes, rejoices to acknowledge the numberless testimonies ot affectionate' sympathy which has at all times been accorded by workers in the field of English literature, and more especially by Englishmen working in the field of the literary history of Spain, who by their labors, which they have pursued with unflinching thoroughness, have illustrated, diffused, and extolled the works of the incomparable Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra.
The Royal Academy, in response to your address, requests you to make known to all the members ot the committee of which you ‘ are the. honored President the sentiment of affectionate regard 'which I have the honor of expressing to you.
