" A Chapter In the History of Annotation,*’ which forms Volume XU. of Aristophanes's "Scholia," with commentary by "William G. Rutherford, is about to be issued by the Macmillan Company. Rutherford believes that too much commentary is the reason why the student cannot put his mind " close to the Greek thought." He says of the " Scholia
It was a mistake, I can * now see, to break the * Scholia' up as they arc broken up In the two earlier volumes. But time has gone by since then, In which the
*	Scholia * have had to shift for themselves, yet have always run up and down in my head. So by rumination a vice in method has been turned into a pfecc of good luck- For the * Scholia ’ analyzed and ■ dissected have revealed gradually their veritable nature. * * * Meanwhile, as comments they have lost little; nay, have, rather gained on the whole by the trenchant surgrery. * * * It is very rare for these tedious annotators to throw any light at least directly upon textual disorders; their literary cHticism Is recre-mental, and in the information they furnish there is very little that is at once useful and unsuspect. But the morbid process revealed by the operator’s knife is most instructive, and deserves to be studied by everybody who has much to do with education.
The comments are not only explained by
Dr. Rutherford, but have also been
amended and arranged and translated by him. He will be remembered as the author of “ The Key to Knowledge," a transla-! tinn of “ St. Paul’s Epistle to the Ro-man.V* and editor of Macmillan’s Greek | Course, for which he has also written several volumes.
