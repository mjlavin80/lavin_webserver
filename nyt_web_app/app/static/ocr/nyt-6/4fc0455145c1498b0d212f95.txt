Ireland’s Story-'
Neio York Times Booh Review:
The authors of *' Ireland's Story " have to thank you for the review of that work and for certain appreciative things therein. It was impossible. In a work so brief, to give exhaustive references or to support by argument many positions, taken only after much thought and study; so that your reviewer is to he pardoned for making somewhat sweeping statements about the earlier chapters.
Did space permit, I should hope to be able to show that, so far from being the weak critics your reviewer supposes them to he, the authors of “ Ireland's Story ” have in reality availed themselves of all available sources of Information, ethnological, archaeological, and linguistic, and have fortified themselves carefully with the best German and French as well as English and Irish authorities. The ethnical work we regard as being particularly sound.
Your reviewer speaks of Irish history before St. Patrick as being '* an inextricable tangle of myth, tradition, and fact"; a tangle, perhaps, but far from inextricable, The life of Columba by Adamnan, who died in the second half of the seventh century, and the Confessio of St. Patrick, embodied In the Book of Armagh, copied in 807, give us a sound starting point, from which we can feel our way backward. Columba, as well as his biographer, was descended from Conall Gul-ban, brother of tlie King Laegalre who ruled at Tara when Patrick came, and as the clan system prevailed in the early monastic establishments, genealogies were there kept, which enable us to bridge over the space between Christian and pagan times. We can get back with considerable certainty to the reign of'Niall of the Nine Hostages, who reigned toward the close of the fourth century. Both the life of Columba and the Confessio contain hundreds of historical and legal allusions which enable us to construct a picture of the Ireland of that time, and we find It in perfect harmony with the Gaelic traditions preserved In the ancient law books and the historical narratives of the Book of Leinster and the like. The two traditions, the Latin and the Gaelic, correspond accurately, and as the Latin Is admittedly historical, being supported by astronomical observations as early as the year 495, i t is by no means rash to regard the Gaelic narratives as equally trustworthy.
Immediately behind the Patrician period we have the period of Cormac, Find, and Ossian, the so-called " Leinster cycle.” Its social condition is exactly what we should expect, from a close study of the Patrician period, its laws and manners, and in the Leinster cycle there is a perfect consistency of names, places, and persons, such as would never be found In a concocted tale.
Immediately behind this stands the “ Ulster cycle,” dating only some nineteen. hundred years ago and therefore easily within the memory of tbe bardic and heraldic classes, whom we know to have been well trained and organized. Further, the picture of life preserved In the Ulster cycle is consistently cruder, rougher, and more primitive than that of the later Leinster cycle, and the persons of the two are never for a moment confused in the Gaelic records. Finally, we have archaeological evidence of the highest value for the chief points in the Ulster cycle; the fort of Emaln, some two miles west of Armagh, is still there to bear testimony (see Murray’s Handbook for Ireland, Page 133) and corresponds as accurately to the descriptions given in the stories of Cuculaind as does the fort of Tara to the narratives of Cormac. Emaln lost all political importance early in the fourth century, and we can hardly imagine the romancers of later date going over j the ground, tracing out the ancient earth-j works, and fabricating their tales accord-| ingly. The same is true of Tara and of i Cruacan, capital of Connacht and famed as the home of Queen Medb. Further, the weapons, ornaments, gold torques, and so forth, described in these narratives i are exactly of the forms we are familiar with in the collections of the Irish Academy. From the abundant archaeological evidence the entire form of life in djtfer-ent periods can be reconstructed, and we find It in close correspondence with the traditional narratives, which therefore gradually win their way in our esteem as sound historical material.
Max Muller asks us to believe that the thousand hymns of the Rig Veda were handed down for many centuries, with practically no verbal changes, before writing was known in Indi^.; it Is not too much to. believe that the Gaelic traditions, many ;'o£ which have the form of memorial . ^verses, could haye. beep fn Ufcer manner *

Tour reviewer speaks particularly of our treatment of the legendary races, and says' that “ within a score of years students -have pointed out tho mythological char- v ; acter of . the: legends, how the De Dananns :
. were the powers of light, the Fomorlans •/ the p6wers[ot darkness,” and so forth. A score of years ago the solar myth was still, in the 'land of the Uvlng, and Max ,
•	Muller was a great authority In the realm "' Of language generally/ What wonder, .
•	then, if his since discredited vagaries were - . adopted by the somewhat diffident* ‘students of Celtic tradition, who ventured; *■
. with'out "a particle of sound evidence, to : turn the early races of Ireland into myths ? Do myths build pyramids of from °ne ip two hundred thousand tons, of storte, such as' the pyramid at New Grange? The truth is, on the contrary, that the Gaelic tradition of the archaic races coincides in a remarkable way with, the best work of men like Broca, De Qua-terfages, Virchow, Poesche, Dlefenbach, or De Belloquet, as well as of scholars like Greenweli, Elton, Dawkins, and Isaac Taylor. They give substantially the same , .succession of races, with substantially the same ethnic traits, and Skene and Elton take much the same view of the De Dan-anns aa we do^
We have certain defined ethnic stocks I in Ireland whose -kindred hold definite places on the Continent, going back as far as neolithic and even paleolithic times. These stocks are well described in the Gaelic traditions and certain classes of monuments are ascribed to each. The monuments are there to this day. Some one must have built them. Are we to follow a now discredited philological hy-= pothesls and turn these traditional races Into solar myths of the Max Muller j school, or are we to follow sound ethnical | fecience. bringing archaeology to our aid, I examining the filiations of the races with- I in and without Ireland, and tracing each I to its probable source? The authors of "Ireland's Story” have followed the latter course and are confident that a more extended acquaintance with ethnological methods and conclusions will enable your reviewer to accept our conclusions. Our tmly regret -is that we were unable In the space at our disposal to give them the evidential and argumentative support they deserve and which is so abundantly available.	CHARLES	JOHNSTON.
