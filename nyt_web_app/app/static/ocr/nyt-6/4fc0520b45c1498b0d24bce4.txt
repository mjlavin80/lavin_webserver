The author of these essays has something—never anything pressingiy Important— to say about a number of interesting personages whose habitat before, during, and just after the civil war was Vie Massachusetts town of Cambridge. l$:;s per* haps somewhat a pity * that this Cambridge is not hy name distinguished from time Major Stearns, for Gov. Andrew, had about filled the dusky ranks of the nowadays somewhat-historical Fifty-fourth and Fifty-fifth Massachusetts Regiments. A Southern negro has recently devoted many pages of his book on the race question to
the older English university town, but such confusions are numerous. The men Mr. Stearns writes about are Francis J. Child, Longfellow, Lowell, Dr. Holmes, Charles Sumner, Dr. Samuel Grldley Howe, Frank Bird of the famous “ Bird Club,” John A. Andrew, known'always as '* the great war Governor," with
C.	F. Cranch and T. G; Appleton and •George L. Stearns, who gathered negroes In Ohio for Gov. Andrew’s two celebrated '* black regiments."
It appears that the Massachusetts black men were setting excellent: wages and declined to volunteer. - Therefore tho recruiting officers went West. In due course the Governor of Ohio objected to having Massachusetts black troops drawn from among Ohi£ negroes—but by that
the gallantry of these regiments and their officers. Mr. Stearns. °f course, Is not concerned with the performances of the negroes on the field of battle.
The' author has several pleasant personal-reminiscences of Longfellow and Holmes, the old Greek professor at Harvard, Sophocles, and about the other men already named; he tells how unpopular Abolitionists were at Harvard up to the very edge of the war, and in general serves to remind his readers of a number of things which this transformations of sentiment worked by the great civil conflict have served to. relegate to obscurity. Unfortunately, the book is overweighted with some critical literary generalities which are out of its modest scope and do not add to Its readablenfess.
