CAROLINE/AND P1LRGAMI
Prof. Graziano Paolo Glerici's Book About the Residence in Italy of the Wife of George IV.*
Written for The New York Times Book Review by
PROF. C. L. SPERANZA-
ROF. G. P. CLERICI of the University of | Parma endeavors to bring new light on that royal scandal which in the nineteenth century for a while seemed to threaten the stability of the United Kingdom. In his recent work on the life and trial of Caroline, Princess of Wales and wife of George IV., the author draws from Italian sources (some of which are produced for the first time) in an attempt to give us a true picture of the protagonist of that drama.
In studying the evidence produced at the celebrated trial of Caroline of Wales before the House of Lords, it is well-nigh impossible to reach an unprejudiced and fair opinion owing to the all-pervading eloquence of Lord Brougham. Even in reading the cc-ld type of the acts of Parliament which record the case, the subtle power of that wonderful advocate Influences our critical examination of the facts. Even less trustworthy must be the opinion we can form of many of the witnesses that testified at the
trial, if our only source of information is the testimony adduced be'fore the House of Lords. The popular odium against the witnesses for the royal accused rose to fury in the ease of the witnesses of foreign blood, and this popular opposition, shared in a measure even by the Judges, is undoubtedly reflected on the trial as we have it in the Acts of Parliament.	.
Prof. Clerict therefore has done a useful service In constructing for us a picture of Caroline and her entourage during her sojourn in Italy, (1S14-1820,) drawing his material largely from unpublished public and private documents. The author follows her step by step from the day she leaves England to the day cf her return thither; He wisely warns the reader that " before running after this swallow without a nest which for many years will fly from city to city in Europe, Africa, and Asia,” it should be stated that it is not his intention “ to follow Uer with minutely learned examination, but with that wise discretion of an observer who wishes to make his work not merely exact, but readable."
Caroline received a warm welcome when she first , went to Milan, where the people Imagined they might read in her presence the possibility of English assistance in tlieir cherished plans of independence. It was during her stay there that, through the interest 1 i of Gen. Pino, she added to her-following the notorious Bartolomeo Pergami, who later was to be the central figure in the trial of the Queen for infidelity.
It is worth while to translate the description of lier first meeting him, for we see there. *in embryo, that mixture of romantic vulgarity and calculating gallantry that were to weave a spell around the heart of a far from strong Princess.
' The* next day a tall, handsome man. dressed in the uniform of the Italian Hussars, went to the hotel where Caroline was stopping to present his letter of introduction. In the anteroom there was no one to whom the hussar could turn. Stepping forward, he sa^v a lady who seemed troubled in disengaging His train of her gown, which had been caught in the furniture.	-
. -The.hussar quickly bent and by a dexterous move --extricated, tho lady in distress, politely asking her if thc .Princess were there. -
" . 4, I amshe,” was her reply, given with evident pleasure. .	:	’
Thereupon our gallant liussar knelt before her, and with the grace of -\yhlch he was a master, presented his credentials. ^	■	:
Thus‘.began that romance which six years later : had its. epilogue in the House of Lords^ in London. The author’s study, .of -this pictures due advent- / _urer, as he follows him,through the vicissltudes ot fortune,^must be of. special interest to the English ■ -reader. For this-man.

. This Is an admirable synthesis both of . the man and of his relations witty the 1 Princess of Wales. A soldier of fortune, of uncertain antecedents, he l^ecame first her courier; then, having v 'fully grasped the temperament qf hia . royal employer, skillfully played his cards. Prom his almost menial position he arose successively in rank in the Princess's household until, under hJs able direction, she " restored ” him to that nobility from which circumstances had forced him and made him Grand Master of the Order"“Of fit. Caroline at Jerusalem, which she founded fpr his special benefit.
Whether Caroline was in fact guilty of what she was charged in her relations with Pergami Is not the question here. But nothing that was brought out at the trial before Parliament against her, in criminating as it certainly is, has the tremendous persuasive force of her life in Italy as described by Prof. Clericl. Such persuasiveness comes from the fact that here no attempt is made to prove one or more specific acts of misconduct, but that the author simply unfolds the character of the Princess in all its unevenness, and the character of the man, who, though never thrusting himself forward, is always evl dent as the great force behind the drama. The author holds up before us these two personages and makes us see wherein they moved as their contemporaries who came In touch with them saw them* He does not seek to draw aside the veil so that we can point our fingers to the sin. But, given the protagonists and the occasions, the conclusion is irresistible and is more con vincing than all the evidence before the House of Lords.
There is a great deal more in the book which however adds nothing to the his tory of this celebrated scandal. The au thor thinks it impossible even to-day to formulate a just opinion of the character of Caroline of Brunswick. He says that no one has succeeded and no one can sue ceed In either judging or defining her. because the " explanation of her lies on the edge of a razor which divides the morbid physiologic element from the moral element."
It Is not because the aspects under which she appears are many and diverse; not because the contrast between the reason and a mobile talent has been constant; but because she was always the same, always incoherent between what she thought and what she did.
As the most striking incongruity of her character the author gives It as his opinion that such a woman carried with her to the grave a terrible secret, which she could have used as the means to a great political upheaval. On this score the author attempts to break through the darkness of the conjugal relations of George IV. when as Prince of Wales he married Caroline of Brunswick. Who was the guilty party then? Wfc need not follow Prof. Clerici in his consideration of this question, which, however novel and ingenious, can throw no light on what had better remain a mystery.
The private letters which form the appendix, including two letters in fac simile of the Princess, (showing her slovenly penmanship and more slovenly spelling,) are interesting reading. They show us England in the time of the Georges as seen through Continental eyes and as described with the freedom used In letters not meant for public reading. An extract from a letter from Antonio Panizzi, Director of the British Museum, to his friend Giacomo Blanchon of Parma, In which he compares the oratory of Brougham and Canning, will give an idea of these letters;
Brougham, who supports the Ministry, will be assigned to pulverize the poor fools of the Opposition with his terrible, irresistible eloquence »*nd his violence. Do you know one of these who was speaking against him in the House In his absence, on seeing him enter, was so frightened that he could not speak connectedly again.
Brougham's eloquence for such a purpose is incomparable: when excited, he surpasses Canning. Y**t he is neither so fine a speaker nor as correct, nor as polished in his phrases; he is more terrible and fearsome from his thrusts and the splendor of some of his images. He is the only man from whom I have ^eard bursts of real and sublime eloquence, of that eloquence which maxes you Jump to your feet and shout bravo!	C,	V.	S,
