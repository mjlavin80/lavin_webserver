I. . ' FROM RE ADERS,
- The. Long: “ S.V
Ncto York Times Book Review:
As a further contribution to a subject mentioned by two of your correspondents, namely, the disuse of the long “ s," and to i>rove that the years 1S02 to 1807 must have been the transition period with writers and printers in this country regarding the use of that letter, let me state that I have in my possession a family Bible, purchased by my grandfather at the time of his marriage in 1807, in which the letter “ s,” long- and
short, is used without regard to rule or custom. The New Testament bears the imprint of Matthew Carey, 1X8 Market Street, Philadelphia, 1S02, and the Old Testament that of the same publisher, at 122 Market Street, Philadelphia, 1S07, showing that this Bible, like Godwin’s once-fa-mous two-volume story of “ Caleb Williams," was printed backward. Godwin’s story, you know, was written if not printed backward. In the New Testament part of my old Bible the printer ha3 used both the long and short letters, regardless of rule, as Jl Jefus *' and “ Jesus," " Chrift *’ and " Christ," bleffed *’ and *' blessed." In the Old Testament the long- and short letters are used arbitrarily in the Book	of	Genesis	and most
of the other books.	In	Exodus,	xxvi.,	20,
the word “ shall"	la	spelled	with	the
short ** s,” while in verse 25 it has the long letter. In First	Kings	only	the
short ** s/* double or single. Is used, as " blessed " and “ Israel,** while Second Kings has tlie long “ s," as ** Ifrael ** and “ meffenger," excepting at the ends of words. The same la true of First and I Second Chronicles. In other books the long and short letters are used with no | regard for uniformity. Following the New Testament is a Concordance by the 1 Rev. John Brown, with the ’ imprint of Collins, Perkins & Co., 189 Pearl Street,
1 New York; T. Kirk, printer, Brooklyn, ISOG, In this Concordance the short ** s ** is used correctly only at the ends of words, according to the old-time custom.
