Louis XYH. of France.
PRI1VCE OH CREOLE. The Mystery of Louis XVII. By Publius V. Lawson, author of “ Bravest of the Brave, Capt. Charles de Langlade.” and " Family Gpne-alosx.*' Portraits and illustrations. One volume. Pp. 310. 8vo, cloth. Menaaha, Wls.: The George Banta Publishing Company. $1.50.
Publius V. Lawson, a lawyer of Mena-' sha, Wis., has written a book to prove j that the late Rev. Eleazar Williams was ; really Louis XVII. of France—the Dauphin whom history has declared was i starved and ill-treated to death in the Temple prison in Paris, in 1795. Publhis Lawson is not the first to espouse the ! cause of the old missionary to the In- : dians. The Rev. John Hanson, D. D., (generally called by Mr. Lawson " the Rev. Hanson ”) undertook to pn^ve that Williams was the Dauphin; and others ^as well have tried to do so. Mr. Lawson, however, says that his book “ Is intended " as the real verified history and complete biography of the Lost Little King, uncrowned Louis XVII., of France; the thrilling story of a real Hfe, that Beems almost unreal enough for a romance. It has been a sad tale of two continents for a century.” In preparing his case, Mr. Lawson says that he has read hundreds of published articles and works.
As a fact, Mr. Lawson fails in his enthusiastic attempt. He .has not marshaled his evidences; his brief is a i hodge podge; his statements, made with much Gclat, are unsubstantiated by references. “ Hanson,” “ Latimer,” " Hanson do.,” “Latimer do.,” Is his way of referring, rot to authorities but to persons who have written on the subject earlier. The book, too, is so carelessly printed that one cannot be quite certain what Mr. Lawson actually intends to say, excepts that he Insists that Williams was Louis XVII. The* general character of his argument much suggests that of the Bellman in Lewis Carroll’s ** Hunting of the Snark,” who, it will be remembered, declared: “What I tell you three times is true.”
The fact that students of history have declared for a century that the Dauphin was starved to death In prison does not prejudice us against Mr. Publius Lawson’s attempt to identify Williams with him. The matter has not yet been treated as Funck-Brentano has treated the fa-' mous mystery of tho Man in the Iron Mask; and until it has been, the average historians to the contrary notwithstanding, It Is still an 3]pen question. Mr. Lawson, however, has not solved it. He has not g'one to the sources, but has worked at second or third hand; his arguments are merely repetitions, his evidences merely statements. He has not even the grace of styre to make his book interesting. Mrs. Catherwood’s novel " Lazarre ” Is quite as worthy of acceptance as Publius V. Lawson’s " Prince or Creole,” and vastly better reading.
