, where he lived, says M. Paul /Sabatier in his little preface to this book, which was undertaken at the Suggestion of the great student of the life ■and spirit of St Qpancls. . It is not a question of geographical knowledge, hut
-	of something more intimate, and it is in . .that frame of mind that Miss de Selin-;cqprt has taken her journey through the ; scenes of the saSnt*a life. Her^ccount : ;of It Is thus in the way of being an inter-ip ret a tion of it through the natural environment that so largely modified. its current. So, she thinks, we shall best un-.derstand his personality.^She says:
' Nothing is more striking in the early records of the Franciscan community than the specification of the scenes in . which some of tbe most vital of their spiritual experiences took place. It was in meditation amid natural scenery—
^ among the most beajrtifw in Italy—that they fought out their spiritual battles and won the assurance of peace.	„
Assisi naturally claims' her first attention, and it Is characteristic of our author’s attitude to declare It a place possessed in pre-eminent degree of a power of attraction that kindles blood and spirit, moving men by an almost human spell of personality. Assisi Is now a goal of pil-•grlmage as the guardian of some of the first fruits of the Renaissance, as the Church of San Francesco, by which the master’s desire for self-abasement and lowfy poverty was nullified, after his death. More In his spirit Is the little convent of San Damiano, unchanged in form since his time, and the little town of Spello beyond. With this Is associated the tradition of the Subasio shepherds, that Is little known but true to the Fran-
•	clscan spirit of St. Francis and St Clare. They were traveling together and stopped at the Inn for food, where tho people talked .unpleasantly about their companionship, thinking it a scandal. Francis humbly asked them for something to eat.
Now. it was a Friday: and the people of the house, willing to put him to shame, set before him a fowl. So Francis was set "between two rules—the rule of the Church, which forbade him to eat flesh on Friday, and the rule of his order, which forbade him to refuse anything which was set before him. And while the people of the house were enjoying his	Francis
made the	of	the cross above the fowl,
and Immediately it flew away and a fish took Its place.
And having left the place Francis and Clare talked together of what had happened and decided thaC they must not Journey together.
Another contrast In Assisi with the humble spirit of the saint is the groat cl lurch of Santa Maria degli' Angell, strange landmark among the fields and vineyards of the *' Portiuneula" settlement where the Lady Poverty found the brethren at home In their peaceful exiguity. Many of the wayside churches visited by Francis remain, and the accuracy of the topographical indications in the neighborhood of Assisi contained in the " Speculum Perfectionis " has been noted by the students.
The Franciscan dwellings on the borders of Umbria and Tuscany, with Lake Thrasymene as a central point, yield another chapter especially connected with the ministrations of Brother Giles, whose zeal in the service of poverty equaled I Francis's own. He had his cell and garden on Monte Ripldo, near Perugia, reached by a steep tlied way overgrown with daisies. There occurred that meeting of St. Louis, King of France, and the Franciscan brother, In which, clasped in each other’s close embrace, neither spoke a word. Several of the most characteristic primitive Franciscan " places ” are in the Valley of Rieti, through which the River Velino rushes, and extending as far as Poggio Bustonc. high above the valley under the mountain. This mountain village is filled with a hardy people who have “ caught something oZ the wildness of their inhosrHtabtc mountainside,” still eager for a religion made vital by a personality.
Tlie isolated marches over toward the eastern coast were the scene of Francis’s first missionary journey, where he found support in the visionary March Brothers; and this was in a peculiar sense the Fianciscan province. Yet now in the March of Fermo, divided by a twofold carrier of mountains from Central Italy, and unbrckcn by railv ays, the convents are converted into municipal buildings, and “ the general attitude of the people rccms to be one of indifference toward local sain tship.” The main stream of civilization has made Utile impression there, and their isolation makes them of special interest, though history and legend have little to say of Francis's relations there.
Finally, there is the Convent of La Verna, on a mountain peak of the Apen-
-nines, ..betweenih eyArno‘; and :the^Tiber,\ jioWf.no longer -owned^by . the .order, but . continued on- sufferaiiceby theprescnt owner, 'and eagerly ;weicorn|ng- and aheI-terin y i si tors. Bii t; the mbuntainltself was given to^St. Francls by Messer Orlando,* and It was. regarded as tho crown and glory of,'the 'Franciscan heritage. There the birds welcomed -him; by}singing; and flapping of wings and perching oh his head and • shoulders and " feet; showing great gladness. There he received'1 some of his most intense and Intimate* experiences, visions of ecstacy, the Impression of the stigmata. -	.
The author has described thes* places with love and with a^ sympathy-’Doth-for' their natural beauty' and their holy associations. She has amply Illustrated w them with quotations of events with which they are connected from : the "Speculum" and the “ Little Flowers'* and other records of the .saint’s life. Many of them are pictured in uncommonly good half-tone plates. And so the volume will be prized by those who love to read of the saint, and If any shall try.
1 to explore for themselves the Italian country where he lived and wrought It will be a suggestive and helpful guide for them.
