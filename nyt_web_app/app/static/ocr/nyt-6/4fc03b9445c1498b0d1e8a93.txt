Zenda, season wilh :i fine mystery sauce of your own fancy. and make a good story. That's a simple enough recipe, but it takes the story teller's magic touch to get satisfactory results from so crude a^ formula. Which is what Mr. Oppenheim' has done in this " Master Mummer.” Not that there's iinythiiig extraordinary or remarkable or great or strong or wise or literary about it—it’s jusl a good story. You pick it up, and, having read one page, keep on reading more pages to the end— simply because you like the people an'1 want to know what happens to 'em next.
And a number of things do happen. You are introduced in the beginning to three young men dwelling together, not in a studio in the Latin Quarter, but in chambers in London. There's Arnold, who Is a popular short story writer, and Allan, who is Scottish and a painter, and Arthur, who is younger than these two and has something professional to do . with motors. Arnold (who is weary of 1 pink tea creations) goes at Arthur's sug- , gestion to Charing Cross Station in . search of a real human plot. And he finds j a little girl of (say) fourteen years with j big frightened eyes. A rather tragic episode in a caf£ ensues, and novfl the little girl is installed in the chambers of the three men under the care of a most respectable housekeeper—for it is London, remember. She is a charming little girl and grows older and charminger every day, and all the men love her. Moreover, It promptly appears that she is a person of the very greatest Importance.
Plots are always being hatched to get her away from the three men. and decorated German Barons, and even Archduchesses, are concerned in these plots. And there fs the Zenda element. For the little girl is nothing loss than a Princess and the granddaughter of the King of some little two by four German kingdpm. Because her mother has created horrid scandal by running away with a great actor—the Master Mummer of the title—
It Is judged best to conceal the glrl's^cx-istence. The Master Mummer plays his part, too, as prompter and providence, and- there's a very stern lay sister who is head of a convent—yawning for the i Princess—and -a \’ery worldly, jealous,
. designing British lady of great social i eminence. Also a Teutonic diplomat who 1 offers bribes in tJie clumsies: fashion and tries to capturc the -?rlncess from the | three by night—coming with armed ruf- , flans—and carry her off in a motor. | j Moreover, A there's another Princess who is a very nice girl, indeed, and some fur-I ther exciting passages with’ special trains *and motor cars, besides very pretty l housekeeping scenes and some very fine heroics of stern self-denial, j It would not be fair to the author to ’ tell any more of the story.
