Hrecfricai Insulation.
The treatise 'on " The Insulation of Electric Machines,’' by Harry Win-throp Turner and Henry Metcalf Hobart, author of " Electric Motors—Induction Motors and Continuous-Current Motors," &c„ which is apnearins with the Macmillan Company imprint, is the result of twenty years of practical work with insulating materials and of careful study 1 of their Insulating properties. The i authors write in the introductory ctiap-ter:
Five years ago, one of the ablest au-thorfties on the subject of insulation made the following statement:	“ I have
no hesitation in saying that there are not more than one or two companies In the United States whose insulations are -worth more than so much bare cotton cloth after two years’ service.*! The remark applied more especially to the varnishes with which tapes, cloths, and1 papers were impregnated. Progress in the manufacture of electrical machinery, especially with relation to the Insulating materials employed, has during recent years been rapid; nevertheless, there still appears to be much more groping* In the dark In this matter than should longer be necessary, and Jt is the pur-tose of the writers of this treatise tor.set orth in serviceable form the information-and experience which they: have accumulated on the subject. In the cfise of one of them, this experience has been very thorough and of a decidedly practical character, having been gained during the last twenty years In winding and insulab? Ing. and in designing - and supervising the winding and Insulating processes in the largest electric factories In England, America,-and Germany.^ .	.	.	;
