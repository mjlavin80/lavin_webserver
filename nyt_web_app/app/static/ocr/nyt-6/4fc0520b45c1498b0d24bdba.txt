"New York Times Book Review:
Notwithstanding1 a great amount of deep thought on the matter, after careful reading of your correspondent’s letter, I have been unable to decide whether E. M. Gardner is very young, or, what practically maintains the same conditions, is some Prince Fortunatus who has been able to retain a youthful idealization of what people ought to be, and sees them through this idealism, instead of through the glasses of actual experience.
No one with a grain of other than an ABC knowledge of human nature would call Major Trescott wooden; the fact that he does not draw his sword continually like some of our Mousquetairish heroes is a good proof of his unmanlkinness. /Has E. M. -Gardner never met any of those men of finer quality who are able to judge and act calmly and sanely while every nerve is tensed to its very limit? Such men appear, no doubt, to the unthinking as apathetic, wooden men; but to the clearer and more searching mind they are examples of strength and reserve, men who have existed, even though ! they may not have been met with.
And Greyhurst! Though the very an-Ktithesls of Trescott, is he not. natural? Is he also made of wood? Your correspondent must tiiink so, for he says, " with the possible exception of Susan/' What can be brought against him? From beginning to end he cannot fail of interest, and could a wooden man create interest? Are not every one of his acts natural—the trial, the chivalric temperament beneath the unrestrained natural quickness of the man, his quick perception at the end of what would please most his unnatural enemy, his end? How would your correspondent change him and improve him? ■	.	*
And. Constance? -■ ■ Bfeca'use 's'he fa" not.
