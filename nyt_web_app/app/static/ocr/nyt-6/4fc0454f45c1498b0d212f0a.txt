That leads to the account of the Goebel i campaign and the events which followed— an account which may not be gone Into here. It is, however, a personal state- | ment of one side, at least, of a most singular affair. And on the whole it is I done temperately, even complacently, in j
spite of the tragic nature of the circumstances for the author. Indeed. Mr. | Powers takes much pleasure in recalling ; his speech before the jury at his lacc trial, and throughout exhibits a harmless vanity which goes far to create a presumption of innocence. They say, however, that he is a brave man and a shrewd one.
The book contains as appendices various documents relating to the trials, especially Powers’s speech in hl.3 own defense, whieh runs to 174 pages, and occupied over a day In delivery.

MY OWN STORY. An Account of the Conditions in Kentucky Leading to the Assassination of William Goebel. Who Was Declared Governor df the State, and My Indlctnent and Conviction on the Charge of Complicity In His Murder. By Caleb Powers. Illustrated from Photographs. 12mo. Pp. 490. Indianapolis: The Bobbs-Merrill Company.
The fashion of writing books In Jail is not entirely modem, but modern ways with prisoners have certainly made the fashion easier to follow. Now Mr. Caleb Powers, some time Secretary of'State of Kentucky, thrice convicted of complicity in the murder of the celebrated William Goebel, and once sentenced to be hanged upon that aocount, has written his book. He has been in jail five years, and after all his experience with the courts and prison houses of his native State he i9 still—on a third appeal—awaiting trial. Technically, at least, he is assumed not guilty. I£any people think he la the victim of political persecution. You, reading the story as he writes it, will be very apt to incline to that opinion. Yet it is certain that there are many people in Kentucky who are perfectly convinced of his guilt.	"
This matter apart, Mr. Powers’s story of his life, especially of his boyhood and school days In the mountains, is not a little entertaining. That much of his book certainly (we may say this without falling into contempt of any court) bears the stamp of truth.
