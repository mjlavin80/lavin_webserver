In depth of refinement and aversion to the free and easy love-making of the Irish swains, she also stands apart. Her ugliness has been impressed upon her from childhood and the thoughtless twitting of her sisters has entered like Iron into her soul. She haJ; never heard any one call her pretty, and when, a few years later, Sir Mortimer, who has returned from Oxford to his Irish estates, meets Julia in the ruined Abbey and unguardedly calls her prettier than the flowers, her girlish Joy rfses superior to everything else, and In ecstasy Bhe'nafvely asks If he means to call her pretty?
