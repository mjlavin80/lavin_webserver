New York Times Boob Review:
It seems to me that all *' problem '* stories construct their problems so as to reduce them to guessing matches. But are not the ‘* problems ’* in " The Bishop’s Niece” and in “The Lady or the Tiger? ” identical in type, in that they withhold information on the essential point which would have given a foundation to problemize on? If the Princess in Mr. Stockton's story had been of the type of woman of the true mother in the baby trial before Solomon, the Lady’s door would have opened; had she been of the false mother’s kind the tiger would have been let out. So toss up a copper /for which type she was, and the *' problem ’’ Is solved. Curiously enough, all the solvers of the problem, in a late number of The Grand, have gone on the idea that all women were of one type or the other, and certainly that has not been my observation of womankind.
