Mr.. Henry Tempest, a respeetabic British stockbroker, finding his head af dinted with that ferocious aliment, hay fever,^ dosed himself by the advice of a friend with an Oriental drug—being no other than " the stuff they make hasheesh of." The light-minded after proceedings of Mr. Tempest provide material for this book, whereof the humor, though partaking in some degree of the nature of that which transfuses " The Wrong Box " with cynic and fantastic glee, is distinctly British humor. First, Mr. Tempest flirts impishly with a lady client, (given to extravagant hats,) wife of an estimable Egyptologist. Tills lady's dabblings in stocks are unknown to her husband, who, nevertheless. just at this moment appears by appointment.
Mr. Tempest whisks the lady behind a etirtain, where her husband discovers her. Then, leaving his faithful confidential clerk to handle the situation, he slips grneefully away, assumes the part of a detective, disguises himself as " a retired Anglo-Indian official,and proceeds to the Egyptologist's own house to investigate an alleged robbery there. Mr. Tempest’s remarkable methods for discoving the offender are interrupted by the appearance of the real detective, and the imitation, after having the original (who has concealed himself in a mummy case) cast into the duckpond, escapes on a bicycle. He Is pursued by the original on a motor engineered by the Egyptologist’s ■* shover,’’ an obliging man who has been bribed to make haste with all imaginable slowness.' For Sit George (who gave the broker the hasheesh) Is present, and has a shrewd suspicion of the identity of the bicyclist. Mr..Temple, by the wny, continually fortifies himself with further nips at the bottle which contains the drug and so maintains his spirits at the proper level of levity and irresponsibility.
There are present in the book also two young people sentimentally inclined toward each other—playing in fact the parts of turtle doves. The girl exhibits that uncanny cleverness so distressingly common among pretty girls nowadays both in and out of books. The | young man for his part is less sharp, but 1 most willing and agreeable. So it’s ail rather pleasant and funny after its fashion.
