They are, in a ^general way, obvious enough,\:l>ut tho ;Vdefinite_ b Istorical account, with abundant .quotation of Incidents and authorities,'is i a useful contribution to an understanding of it.
r ■- The most-Important part of the book V' is; of course, the consideration of the ^ .present-day conditions in the South, and -./in this Mr. Cutler has endeavored to prer ’j sent more definite information and draw r- juore accurately grounded conclusions
-	than has hitherto been possible. It may truly be said that he has taken up the matter in a candid and impartial spirit, with a desire to arrive only at facts, and
C to be governed by an appreciation of the y real state.of affairs in the South. At the a "Same time he does not hesitate to expose some mistaken assumptions that are too : often put forward as the excuse for law-\ lessness.
:	The word “lynching ” has engaged the
; attention of lexicographers and others a ■' good deal, and various explanations of it have been put forward. Mr. Cutler con! siders it his duty to clear this matter up i before he proceeds. It seems to .be cer-' tain that the name originated in this
-	country, and that there is no reason to reach back to any Anglo-Saxon ** Ifnch“"
'for its derivation. Various Colonels, Judges, and lesser local lights named Lynch bave been put forward as sponsors
-	for the name. Mr. Cutler seems disposed £ to believe that It came from a Col. Charles >- Lynch of Virginia, and finds that the verb
had become a localism in Virginia between [V 1780 and 3817, and spread westward, but, £ no evidence is forthcdming to show why ri -this particular CoL Lynch was identified with the summary procedure bearing his
iz name.
!/-■ -*
v=- .Early instances of this procedure are X J^aturally common in _ihe history of the colonists dealing with tbe Indians, and ^ early frontier conditions also led to the £ - more systematic and organized form of if extra judicial rule known as " regulat-% ins.’* The term’ appears first in a news ,i item of The New York Gazette in. 1752,
[ where the appearance of "an odd Sect % of People in EUzabeth-Town who go un-c der the Denomination of Regulars" is [ chronicled; these went In disguise to piin-j ish wife beaters. And " regulating ” in ! ‘ other parts of the country became not uncommon. Tarring and feathering was ! * also not infrequently indulged in as a i measure of popular discipline, ana especially against Tories in Revolutionary times.
r In many cases of the action of 4* The 7, Regulators ” in frontier towns it is diffi-. cult to say that a culprit was not to all ; intents and purposes legally punished,
-• when his punishment came from a com. mittee of citizens organized and carrying , on its proceedings in an orderly and def-' inite manner. Such lynch law is scarcely ? more than a step removed from genuine j law. Indeed, the Legislature of Virginia as earjly as 1779 passed an act declaring ; that such measures though “ not strictly ! . .warranted by law” may be justified by M immediate urgency and imminence of | danger.” And the subsequent history of |- lynch Jaw Mr. Cutler declares to be but the working out of this principle under varying conditions.
.The anti-slavery agitation was accompanied by a revival of lynch law In the South, and not only insurrections of slaves but also the advocacy of abolition ideas by white people were visited with extra legal punishment, and at the same time such punishment was more and more often applied for other offenses py an irritated community. .* *
The period of reconstruction brought with it the rise of the Ku-Klux-Klan, and Mr. Cutler devotes a chapter to its' much discussed activities. Started in sport, it was natural that it should grow and spread In the disorganized state of .tho Southern country, when the members found that they had in their - grotesque and mysterious doings the most powerful

V	-*	' '	• *
With all that has been written-there-has been a lack* of-definite and accurate information. This Mr.-Cutler has attempted to supply by'gathering statistics from the most available sources—chiefly newspa-- pers—correcting and controlling them by such means as could be devised, and presenting them In such coherent'shape as to permit of generalization.. The Chicago Tribune’s list of. lynchings. which has been kept up for fwenty-two ^year^. and the reports of The-New York Times and a few, other journals are the chief sources of information. His results he has' embodied in charts, representing them graphically. Ferhapjs the most significant of all .these is one showfng-that' but 34 per cent of the negro lynchings'.were for the crime of rape. Another fact shown Is that the proportion between the white and-colored elements In the population has no effect upon the prevalence - of lynching—it is only the proportion of whites lynched to negroes lynched that seems to bear any relation to the proportion between white and* colored elements in the population. Nor is the percentage of Illiteracy correlated with the number of lynchings—in other words, lynching is not confined to backwoods communities. Mr. Cutler’s facts also seem to show that, as the practice of lynchings continues; the punishments inflicted tend to Increase in. severity, as by burning at the stake, Mid that victims are tortured more and more before death. —	’
In his final chapters on the justification of lynching and the remedies for .it, Mr. Cutler shows a spirit remarkable for its fairness and an appreciation of the force of circumstances and the historical facts of the situation. Slavery had acted in a way as a school and a restraint of the negroes; emancipation removed all this restraint, and, its effects not having been fully foreseen and no adequate legal provision made for the restraint of the freed-men, the worst instincts of the negroes came to the front. The actual legal system had no basis in the existing order of society. Racial prejudice is a fact, in some respects unreasoning, but with a basis of reality; and it is not likely to disappear for generations to come. It must be taken into account in the consideration of all remedies proposed. As a matter of fact, the crim^ of rape hy negroes is no new one. It hag increased In frequency, but under the old r£gfme the law was allowed to take its course against tue' guilty. This is considered by the author to go far toward refuting the argument i that lynching is necessary to repress crime among the Southern negroes today. The fact seems to be that, so far from acting as a deterrent of this particular crime, lynching has' directly stimulated its perpetration. If a justification for It can be found, it'Is only on the ground that thg law as formulated and administered has proved inadequate:
Not that guilty negroes frequently escape conviction'in the Southern courts, or that they fail to receive punishment. to the full fextent of the law, but rather that the law and its administration seem utterly unsuited to the function of dealing with negro criminals. A judicial system adapted to a highly civilized and cultured race is not equally applicable to a race of Inferior civilization, and the failure to realize this fact and act upon ft by mak-' ing special provision for the control of the negro population in the Southern States since slavery was abolished, is a fundamental reason for the disrepute into which legal procedure has fallen as regu-gards negroes accused of offenses against the whites.
Yet in the last analysis lynch law in this country he recognizes to be without any justification whatever. The chapter on remedies Is little more than a summary of the laws that have been enacted against lynching by several States, Northern as well as Southern. Mr. Custer has no suggestions except to recognize that the ultimate remedy is a strong public sentiment against it. . . Sol Tong as Coroners! juries :r^ideriverdi[ctsi^'of^deaik^fiatiUthe^£ hands
