A- COURIER OF FORTUSfE. By Arthur W. Marchmont. Illustrated. 12 mo. New York:	F.	A_.	Stokes Company. $1.50.
This Is the most exciting of exciting « romances. It begins with love and leads through paths choked with Intrigue, rushes headlong into battles, plunges precipitately back into love, swerves sharply at the corners of villainy, tells of loyalty and sacrifice, and finally emerges with dripping swords,^ bwt unfurling the banners of peace at last.
The Duke de Rochelle, Governor of Morvaix, but called by the peoj^le the Tiger, fixed his fierce fancy on Gabriel le 1 de Malkicourt and, because there was already a Duchess de Rochelle, decided, with the aid of Gabrlelle’s uncle. Monsieur de ProbaJIe, a wicked libertine masquerading as a virtuous gentleman, to marry the beautiful Gabrielle to the profligate ©erard de Cobalt in order to mask his own wicked intentions. And Gerard, having lately murdered a man at Cambrai, entered quite willingly into the diabolical schemes upon the promise of full pardon for the affair at Cambrai.
Meanwhile the Tiger of Morvaix, filled with personal greed, oppressed the people heavily with food taxes until Gabrielle, a friend of the poor,** secretly dispatched word to the Duke de Bourbon, Suzerain : of the ^province, to investigate the misrule of~the Governor.
In response to this call came young Gerard de Bourbon, son of the Suzerain,
: at the head of his troops—but in order to better investigate tbe crimes of the Governor he came masquerading as another— and, as luck would have it, chose, without knowing Its Import, the name of Gerard de Cobalt. As neither the Duke nor de Proballe had ever met de Cobalt the disguise was not only effective, but led the unwitting de Bourbon into a very hot bed of intrigue in which lying spies, paid villains, and masquerading soldiers added to the excitement. Having once seen Gabrielle and discovered the plot
-	against her fair fame and name, do Bourbon found other and weightier reasons for maintaining the disguise than the mere desire to investigate the oppressions . of the people.
Through three hundred and sixty pages the reader follows breathless at the heels of adventure, and in the end has the satisfaction of seeing all the bad people tn the story punished as they deserve and the good one's similarly rewarded.
