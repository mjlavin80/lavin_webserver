HE announcement: that James Barnes will be the editor of Appleton's Booklovers Mag-v azine has significance foi*
; othersthan those who may be acquainted with his ro-
-	mances and tales * of the ocean, and his authoritative biographical and historical works - concerning ;certaln heroes of the United States * Navy and their achievements.

" Bertha Stuart, who has been making initial letters,- border designs, and flyleaf symbols for Mrs. Hugh Fraser's ** A Maid of Japan," published this week, has brought to her work an enthusiasm for Japanese art which has enabled her to present before Occidental eyes a beautiful illusion of Oriental characteristics. Even the cover of the book* bound in sea-green Japanese doth, with its simple label, is most characteristic. The story deals with the adventures of Bim§, a little shell gatherer, the offspring of an international marriage, which, in various so-called Japanese rcm—nces has already been treated of from the point of view of the Western husband. We now have it from the point of view of the Japanese wife and mother.
