Love Versus Money.
MRS. DARRELL,. By FoxcroCt Davis. II- ■ lusti'ated. 12mo. New York: Tbe Macmillan Company. fl.SO.
Mr. Foxcroft Davis has a manner of writing that leaves verv little to the Imagination. Not only does he reveal the actions of his characters, but also the train** of thoughts that lead up to those actions. Nevertheless ** Mrs. Darrell" is a book full of interest. Beginning with the arrival of the two young Englishmen, Darrell and Pelham, officers visiting Washington, he introduces th©
! readers to society at the capital fifteen I or twenty years ago, when the mushroom growth of wealth had not become so j widespread. Elizabeth Brandon, daugh-I ter of a long line of gentle ancestors and whose father was a member of that fast disappearing type of simple-hearted Virginian, met theBe two men at the Charity BaJJ, to which all Washington society ! flocked. Both young men rell in love with her. It was for Darrell, however, to win her; but after he had carried his bride to India, accompanied by his devoted friend Pelham, It was, unconsciously to Pelham that she turned always for Intellectual companionship. For Darrell, though an honorable, gallant gentleman, was not the Intellectual peer of his cousin, Hugh Pelham.
Even after she realized her mistake in marrying Darrell instead of Pelham she never faltered in her duty to her husband, nor did Pelham prove false to the trust of his friend. It was only after Darrell had inherited the fortune of a distant relative, soon after which he died, that Elizabeth suddenly found herself face to face with misfortune. For Pelham, meanwhile, had gone to Africa and had not learned of Darrell's death. And the property to which Darrell had fallen heir was entailed and descended to Pelham as next of kin. • Poor Elizabeth found herself in the hands of a canny Scotch attorney who thought he was acting wisely for his client, Mr. ,Pelham, and so, without consulting that gentleman in Africa, pressed her sadly to the wall In the winding up or affairs.
Back to Washington came Elizabeth at last, her faith shaken In Pelham, and through him In all mankind. In this state of depression she fell easily into the net of Clavering, the wealthy Senator from . the West living opposite her, Clavering was a - man used to getting what he wanted, and so when he decided to marry Elizabeth, after divorcing his wife, *e all but carried out his plans. ■ There is another love story in the book besides the tortuous one of -Elizabeth's./ .Anne Clavering, the Senator’s daughter, has herself a rough road to travel -maintaining a social position in Washington in face of the flaunting wickedness of her father and the frank indiscretions of her two sisters. That all the love-stories turn"out happily, however, goes without saying.
Mr. Dayis has made all 'his characters very human. As has already been said,Gen. Brandon, with, his simple/code of honor, is a most lovable old man. Sara Luttrel, tho irrepressible'old lady, whose happiest moment was when she was employed in taking the wind out of the sails of some upstart nouveau riche, or was beixig bullied by her handsome-nephew-ln-law; that nephew-in-law himself, devoted to the white haired old lady, In ’ove with. Anne Clavering. fighting Janies Clavering-tooth and nail for tbe right;, poor old Mrs. Clavering, with her bad 'grammar and kind heart, cowed and frightened under-the weight of her husband's millions; James Clavering himself, arch-villian, y*et handsome, courageous, and a fighter—all of. these- with Pelham, in his strength, and Elizabeth, in her weakness, are characters who live and breathe sufficiently to enlist attention. Interest. scorn, or hatred, according to the deserts of each.
