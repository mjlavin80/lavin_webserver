Under the title, “John Knox, A Criticism and an Appreciation/' John Glasse, M. A., IX D.. of Edinburgh, has expanded a lecture on John Knox, which the Macmillan Company is about to send out in this country. The writer has taken tho story of the Scotch Reformation as told by others* especially by Knox himself. He writes in his preface:
X have endeavored as far as possible to represent the man in relation to his environment; and, while confessing that to some extent he was the creature of circumstances, to describe him as a powerful personality who exercised a vital and beneficent influence on his age. It Is well that we should remember the fourth centenary of his birth, but not so well if we suppose that Knox, with his Intellectual vigor and popular sympathies, should be identified with the ideas of the sixteenth century He was a reformer then, and we are entitled to believe that he would be a reformer now. Protestantism has always stood for progress, and I regard Knox, with all hfs defects, as one of its most earnest and strenuous champions. Those with the welfare ot the world at heart must honor such men.
Another biography of this hero of the Reforqiatfon has been recently published by G. P. Putnam’s Sons. The author is Henry Cowan, D. D. There Is also Andrew Lang's ** John Knox and the Reformation,” published by Longmans, Green & Co.
