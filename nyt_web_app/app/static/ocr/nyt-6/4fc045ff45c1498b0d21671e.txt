' INDIA5A:	A	REDEMPTION FROM
SLAVERY, (American Commonwealths.) By J. JF\ Dunn, Jr. New and enlarged edition. 12mo. Pp. xll.-OOO. Boston and New fork: Houghton, Mifflin & Co. $1.25.
_ This new edition oJ^Mr. Dunn's history of Indiana in the American Commonwealths series nas been enlarged by the addition of a chapter presenting in outline the more important features of the history of the State since its admission to the Union, where the original edition ended. But in the fifteen years since that ! edition first .appeared new light has been thrown on a certain few points in the early history of the State. Mr. Dunn ha3 called attention to these in his preface, and has not deemed it necessary to change the text where they are discussed. He adds, not without a touch- of pride, that, in his opinion, the original text, except for the points he has named, has " withstood the fire of criticism and the test of more recent and extended research.”
They are not points that essentially modify history as it has been written. Thus the most important relates to the date of the settlement of Post Vincennes. It was previously not definitely known, but conjeeturally put between 1724 and 1731. Documents In the French archives at Paris, among them two letters from the Sieur de Vincennes, fix the date as 1731. The statement is also corrected that “ up to 1800 the western lands were not sold in tracts of less than' 4:000 acres.*’ . It was based on an old political document, without veriflcatipn, and is proved to be false.
One of the distinctive features of Mr.
•
Dunn’s history is its treatment of slavery 'in Indiana. He has examined this question more thoroughly than it had been examined before him; and so important does it seem that he has suggested it in his sub-title. The historical fact, never before him hinted at, Is that the local slavery question was the paramount political Question In Indiana up to the time of the organization of the State Government, The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 provided in terms that there should be no slavery In the territory northwest of the Ohio; hut other portions of the document assume. Inconsistently, the existence of slavery, though not naming the peculiar institution. Early court decisions reaffirmed they plain words of the ordinance. Later decisions treated it as an existing institution, whose legality went unchallenged. Gbv. St. Clair construed the ordinance as having no effect on slaves already in the territory, and as being merely a declaration of a principle J to govern the Legislature and the courts In cases subsequent to the date of the ordinance.
Efforts were early made to secure a repeal of the slavery proviso of the ord-
■	nance, and there was an abundance of pro-slavery^sentlment in Indiana. It is not a little curious to learn that the majority of settlements and citizens in the early days were French, and that ft was 'they who were most eager for a change in the law. The Legislature of 1S03 enacted a law for the introduction of slavery by indenture, and slaves were held under it long after Indiana became a State in 1816. It was never overthrown by the courts, and indeed no case was ever brought under it, yet it aroused vary energetic dissatisfaction among the minority. This law was repealed In '1810, ..but the slavery question was not settled, and slaves were still held in Indiana with apparent sanation of the authorities, tiU the State was admitted " free,** but even then there was no definitive step to declare slavery at an end, until a test case was made and decided that under the Constitution slavery was prohibited In the State. Yet the immediate effect was not marked. People continued to hold slaves for many years thereafter. In 1830 there were thirty-two slaves in Vincennes, four more than there were in all Indiana In 1800! The National census of 1840 also credits Indiana with three slaves—an extraordinary state of affairs that simply Implied a plahi violation of the law.
The account here given ol slavery In the State Is of remarkable interest, and It ! fellQ57S that hQre as 6lsewhoro ela-yerj bad
