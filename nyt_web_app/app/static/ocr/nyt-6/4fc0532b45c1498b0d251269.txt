KOSMO WILKltfSON nas i written a book that Is neither pure history nor pure gossip, and yet comcs near to fcsing bo th. He propc&sj to show how the peers of-England, ' from being an estate oT the realm, grew into an independent parlla-ntentary assembly; how tVe hereditary assembly became the parent of elective chamber and established the House ] of Commons, and then discovered In the., lower house a rival and 'foe. The plan thus outlined points toward a history; but he hastens to add thiJi lUo inquiry.! will be conducted ** less in tho spirit of a constitutional historian'than from the point of view most likely to find acceptance with those who read to be interested ;is well as to be informed-** This opens the way for gossip; and there is, throughout a good, part. of the book, at least a suggestion of that. But only a suggestion; Mr. Wilkinson admires the | Lords too much to write real gossip. He only makes one think how much more might have been said. His admiration ; for the House is complete, yet~sometimes he ventures on strictures, and even criti- 1 cism. He is not wholly a Jenkins, in spite of the following:
Since 1SS0 the Peers have only cared to insist on their dissent from the Commons when they could 'point to some I evidence of national opinion being in sympathy with themselves- For the most part, they are content to show their activity and statesmanship within limits, m which the Commons readily aequiescc
*	* * The undoubted tendency of the j times is to exalt and enlarge the popular | estimate of both the monarchy and the , peerage. Thus, a parliamentary cham- i ber has been transformed into a real representation of all that is most brilliant or noble in the national Hf-se So real a house ot notables, if adequately tained, must be to the living what Westminster Abbey is to the dead.
In spite of the fact that there was an Interval of several hundred years between tlie Roman Counts of the palace and the Counts of the Saxon shore, and of Britain, and the English Earls. Mr. Wilkinson would have us believe that the latter were the succesirors of the former in more than merely time, and .that the English Dukes are the direct descendants of the Roman Dukes who led the Emperors’ , armies and kept the peace of Rome. He also provides a ** parliament " convened by the Kins in 1081. which. V contained purely English Archbishops, Baris, and Barons.’* We think that Mr. Wilkinson's ciesrre to interest as well as Inform is gratified. It must have grieved Mr. Wllkinsonto have to write this paragraph:
Great-men in English^ history, have, sometimes on.their death fojmd their representatives in their younger, ratherthan in their eldest,-sons.:-The second William Pitt, and Charles James Fox, a second and a third son, respectively*, were both, more distinguished ‘than those , who wore the paternal titles. In more recent-times, a great leader of the Peers, the third Lord Salisbury, was a second sun.
When Mr, Wilkinson gets away from history—we* mean.. when he gets to the gossipy side of his story—he becomes more interesting in a sketchy sort or way. His later chapters deal rather with the personalities'of the principal met of the House of Lords than with the politics of their time, and, though lie never tells much about any one of them, he suggests more than he says. Here are some stories . 9f notables of the peerage:
Edward Herbert went to Oxford at the age of twelve. He brought with him to the university when fifteen “ a wife just six years older than himself."
At Oxford Lady Herbert Cshe was Mistress Herbert, really, at the time.) remained with her lord while he' was going through his schools. At tlie coronation of James. I.. Herbert was knighted. The oath to redress the wrongs of all ladies and gentlemen was with him . no mere verbal pledge, but formed a solemn committal to.adventures which made Herbert the Don Quixote of the nation. The newly dubbed knight found a young lady just despoiled of a. treasure . by a French cavalier. Sir Edward Herbert not only regained the treasure, but waited ten years to chastise thejhlef. .* * * In 1610, having Joined~the English troops under Sir Edward Cecil besieging St. Jyliers. Herbert relates how a French- officer ’ * dared * him. In a moment the -two had sprung together out of ■ the trenches;
■„ thence they rushed to the opposite bulwark. Herbert was the first of the two „ to fight his way into the beleamiered city;
‘ the last to leave it. .
He died as Lord Herbert #>f Cherbury. -
Thomas Egerton, afterward Lord Ellesr mere, first made-lils mark in a -case whose particulars have been preserved. Three -graziers had deposited a - sum’ of money -with-a Smithfiela woman, to b* accounted for by her on the'ir collectively demanding it. Shortly afterward one ot them returned, and on the plea of being cftmmis^ sioned by his partners to obtain the money, got the cash. Upon this the other two men brought an action against her. Egerton, happening to be. in court, received the Judge’s permission to spea^£ as amicus curiae. His deliverance was to this effect- “ It was not disputed that the money was not to-be given up by the woman until demanded by the three men. Then let the trio, and not two members of it, make the demand. Till the two gentlemen now in court bring the third r ~.*ty, the woman, I apprehend, is entitled to remain the custodian of the deposit.” The Ingenuity of this defense pleased the

' Bishop Burnet in William III/s time

I bi 11 ty being, however, 'that in his time , Bishops did not wear gaiters, but rather , the usual knee breeches, stockings, and*-buckled shoes of the day. The ** Proud Duke” of Somerset, who ".would not let his children sit in his presence, was Master of the Horse to George I.; angered because his son-in-law was sent to the Tower, he ordered his servants to take ' off the royal.livery and put'on again that of his own family.
He then proceeded to put all the badges Of his office in a heap in his courtyard. The insignia of office with other refuse were then thrown into’ a common dust cart; the Duke superintended the shooting of the rubbish into the yard of St. James's Palace, and returned perfectly satisfied to his own house.	'
Despite the fondness of Englishmen for classical allusions. Mr. Wilkinson notes that the famous Horse of Troy has been trotted out in Parliament only twice— once by Lord Cowper, the grand uncle of the poet, and again in the debates over the Reform bill of 1867, when Robert Lowe turned the animal out to grass forever, as he said he hoped.
The mere name of Chesterfield suggests associations of grace, elegance, symmetry, and polish. With these nothing can be-in loss attractive contrast than the personal reality of the man. The trunk of a giant on the legs of a dwarf, limbs so III-shapen as narrowly to escape deformity, a countenance only redeemable from, unsightliness by the play of an intellectual expression over the unlovely features: such In the flesh seems to. have been the man who w;is the cynosure of his own Ken oration, in whom posterity has agreed to see the glass of fashion and the mold of form for all time.	'
It was Chesterfield who heard a stranger ask an old man in the House . of Lords:	“	Pray,	Sir,	.	have	you -been
here- lately? ” and receive the answer:	“Not since I sat in that-ohair/’.

HI., expressed lo the King his sorrow at the blunders -made, and gavo-the assurance that on the next-occasion everything would be found in. proper order. This Earl xeslgned his ■commission in the army-rather than bear arms against .America, and called his house - Boston- Castie because no tea was allowed within its walls.	.
. Lord. Bute-. “ was among -the best-looking : men .of his. day; his legs especially were the theme of general admiration; he used, it was .Said, to devote -hours daily to admiring * them in the looking glass and studying how to show them off to fresh advantage. * * * The matter of his speeches was always
-	poor. His Blow and pompous delivery, especially in the debate on the cider tax, won him the name of ; lhe Minute Gun.’ ”
In Lord Rockingham Mr. Wilkinson finds

’ Mr. Wilkinsoii notes that tord Salisbury ’ complained' that he had- to Klve up .going to the Athenaeum Club because the Bish-"DpsIhere used to take his new1 umbrellas;’ Lord Melbourne; however, was never troubled by live Bishops, but complained that*they used-to'die just ^to spite him because' he had' to fill their places.
The Duke of Cumberland ~was'famous for his whiskers and his language. He called on Archbishop Howley once to get him'to oppose a certain bill, and on his return told his friends': "It's all right my lords; I’ve seen the Archbishop, and lie '’says he’ll be d—d'to eternity if he doesn’t see the bill in h—.*’____ 	•
.The House of Lord's is how practidily_ perfect, according to Mr. Wilkinson. -It has -become the meeting ground of men • belonging to all classes and schools of thought—14 qualified for admission to It," ho adds, cautiously.	-
