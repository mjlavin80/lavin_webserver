Prof. Mohaffy, who has written such a vast number of books on the several aspects of Greek Hfe, and who has devoted himself especially to the period be-ginnfng with Alexander the Great, the period of diffused, and in a measure diluted Greek culture, called specifically Hellenism, presents in this little volume a sort of summary of the results of his lifetime of study. The six chapters which compose it were originally six lectures delivered at tho University of Chicago In the Summer of 100-i. Their content is a rapid survey of the three Macedonian kingdoms into which the empire of Alexander resolved itself at the conqueror’s death—Maccdon proper, Egypt, and Syria —with a tracing of what tho Greek civilization did for the peoples of those regions, none of them Cfreeks to. start with.
Macedonia served chiefly to pass Hellenism along—as a centre of Hellenistic influence it ceased to exist with the Roman conquest. In Egypt the immemorial civilization of the oldest of lands was too strong for it in the end, but meanwhile It furnished Alexandria the university of the Hellenistic world. It was in Syria—a name which includes in this case most of Asia Minor. Judea, and ^lesoxiotamia— that the Hellenization of the various peoples was most widespread and complete. And it was here that Greek ideas encountered Jewish ideas and Buddhist doctrines coming from India. All three, Dr. Mahaffy somewhat cautiously suggests, contributed to the making of Christianity as we know it, but he does not suggest (as so many do) that this making was purely human and evolutionary.
