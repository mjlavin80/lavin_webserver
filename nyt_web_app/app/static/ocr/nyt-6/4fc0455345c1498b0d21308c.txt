1 deals and Argument.
A TWENTIETH CENTURY IDEALIST. By
Henry	12nio. Pp. 303. New York:
The Grafton Press.
i . I You must suspect this author of being |
! more or Jess haunted by the ghost of
! Henry James. The story involves, of
course, the loves of two young people, and
the effect upon one of them at least of
ancestry and environment. These young 1
I people are Introduced to you at a musical I
entertainment, and the girl is given a
j professor for a father and the suggestive
surname of Cultus.
A party consisting: of the girl, the | girl’s father and mother, another girl,
I who is literary; the young man, and a l doctor all go upon what may be a Cook's voyage. At all events, it leads them over I the Atlantic, to Gibraltar, to Italy, the Isles of Greece, and to India. Upon the I way they do a deal of talking, and engage , In argument against various kinds of quackery, especially of the faith cure j kind. Four lady professors of such arts are aboard the ship. The girl is a vory I serious person, and argues in a manner which evidently impresses the author as superior. The hero leaps into tho sea i to save a man with " hysterical legs,” who falls overboard. The doctor emanates always a curious, mellow, mystic wisdom. and the end of U ail comes In the highest Himalayas, where the girl and ; the man are married.
The story Is one which Is clearer in the
author's mind than it is In the written
pages. The writer is deeply impressed
with the very obvious fact that there are
mysteries beneath the everyday surlaco
of life, and dwells much upon the mystic quality of ideuis. Naturally the book U u. very amateurish affair.
