'Xt does not begin where that ;left off, but covers discursively all the ^years’-of his life, -and describes many i/jOfVthc prominent people with whom he S;<^mein contact. He was for .all /those
V	lyears .a - “ chartered disturber of * the un-

■v hquired. He .was a Chartist, and was !m-;prisoned as an atheist V and,-Indeed, there rfeeems to have been scarcely any -agi-' station "for radical reform in which he has .'cot bfeen an active participant.	^
•?..*-/ It is as an aavocaie of co-operation ^ihat he lias been chiefly known; but 4in all these reforms-he has b&eh brought -'‘’into contact with many prominent men /'and -women- He has retained through all I these years of strife a -remarkable good
-	ihrtmor and a remarkable spirit of toler-iance for those who have been in opposi-
>	vtion to him. Thus he has not enough to 7fsay ot the misunderstanding and grround-.Icss opposition that Thomas Hughes and VV Canon Kingsley manifested toward the , :ldnd of Chartism that he represented in 18*3, though they themselves were ; M Church Chartists,” and "meant well to ;the people in a theological, not a political .way.” But his regard for and under-
V	standing of these men is unchanged.
t Kingsley’s sympathy with the lot of ' working people as expressed in "Alton J.~Locke ” Mr. Hoiyoake thinks very gen-serous; but his idea was paternal government by friendly churchmen rather than
-	self-government, which was what tlie " r%al Chartists ” were after. Kingsley Jived, be thinks, " in a refracting medium
'*tn which the straightest facts appeared ^bent when placed In it.’* Thomas Hughes
•	'likewise -saw everything “ in the light
-	of theology. He saw nothipig else by it- .self.*’ As Mr. Hoiyoake observed the ' Chartist movement, ^it was most peace--.able. He has only derision for the terrors : ;of .the Ministry ifbd its supporters, and
;considers the episode to be 'the subject ’ t of “ an extraordinary hallucination that
*	-passes as authentic,” of which Kingsley >was the " chief Illusionist.” Nobody >was armed or drilled, no war organization
existed, there was no intention of rising. /Jtlie Government knew this through Its
-	.spies. "There w&e absolutely nothing in -the field against the Duke of Welling--ton except^ a wagon on which a monster petition was piled.** Politically speaking,
-"London has seen no tamer day than the
-	“tenth of April, 1848, and never did the
craziest despotic Government in Europe engage in such a political imposture, as that of the Duke. But we must cease to wonder at him when a man like Hushes :could say:	” It is only by. an effort that
one can realize the .strain tc which the nation was subjected.”
Mr. HolyoaKe was out on the'lftth of April. The-night before he had addressed a meeting and told the people, ** beware of the police,” and not to strike again jf they were struck. It was agreed that _ if any were killed in the procession their comrades should move Quietly on. The Government made ostentatious provocation by filling London with soldiers:
The conclusion to which the Chartist leaders, came was -that, the government wanted to create a conflict, shooi down a number of the people, and then proclaim to Europe that it had " saved society” by murder.
One of Mr. Holyoake’s experiences was to be sued by the Government for publishing a newspaper in 1855'on unstamped pjCper. As the unstamped issues numbered 30,000 copies, he was liable in penalties for about £G00,000, but fortunately ^ for his purse the duty was soon thereafter repealed, and nothing more came .of^it. In those days his house and of--fice were liable to be entered 'by the revenue officials, his books seized, his presses broketi up, his type destroyed, anh everybody on the premises arrested, and for many weejcs he'made daily prepa-.rations for such a visitation. At another time he was summoned for the payment of tithes by a "predatory vicar.” After . twb or three seizures he sect the -vicar '-payment “ in «kind ” in. the old way—the cbfef product of hfs FSeet Street farm ^consisting of boqnd volumes of his jour-

His friendship with Herbert Spencer dated "from 'the 'days 'when^Spence^ wajr-a writer on The,Xieader. At. that- time \e had a half rustic^ look. He was rudcly -and “'gave the Irnpression of b6iVig a , young country gentleman of - the sporting farmer type.” Yet- he - had -a con- j stitutional fear as to his health, which never left his • mind all his, life. Mr. Hoiyoake hence **-learned neveS:;’to. srefet him tn terms xrhlch IrppUed thattie was- or ever could be well.” Though he.wair a friend and In a way a colaborer, Spencer rejected the - suggestion that" when they were both coming to America, they should come on the same ship, lest their being' together might cause the interviewers to confuse the opinions they represented. Hoiyoake respected these scruples, ahd called at his hotel only once on a special errand. That was at Niagara Falls," which he thought was ** a curious sp.ot (the noisiest In Canada) to choose for one whose need was quietude,” and who would take an entire flat in a hotel that he-'might be undisturbed at night. A characteristic touch is given in bis letter responding to the octogenarian Holy-oake's congratulations on his birthday.
*	Thanks for your congratulations, but I should ''have liked better your condolences on my longevity.”
Holyoake’s impressions of Gladstone a^e those of an admire^ of that manysided man.	-
. It seemed when you were talking to /him that you were talking no mankind, so diversified and plentiful were the persons living/in his memory and who, as it ’ were, stepped out In his conversation before you. The individuality, the environment of persons, all came into light. His conversation was like an oration in miniature.
His open-mindedness and noble personal courtesy toward Holyoake’s own radicalism, as pell as his “passion for con-' science," seem _to have Impressed deeply one who was so far removed from him ; In many of his beliefs. There are Interesting chapters on Mazzini, with whom his relations were close, and of whose lofty character and unde via ting pursuit of a patriotic calling he gives a striking picture. Garibaldi and the British Legion •that sailed to Italy to help him in- the guise of “excursionists” pass through ^his pages; and even George Francis Train, who was interested in the legion, took convenient opportunity to explain to Mr. Hoyoake his “theory that to obtain recognition by the world was to ' make a good recognition or yourself,
" Ail it gave to him was notoriety, uni der which was hidden from public re! spect his great natural ability and per. sonal kindness of heart.” These pages ! and people are all interesting; and thbugh | Mr. Hoiyoake never omits an opportunity to put forward fils radical^ point of view as to people aiid opinions, br religious and social philosophy, it is all so engagingly candid and sincere that it is scarder-ly likely to give offense. A strong personality and jbl kindly heart are felt through the bogk. .	.
