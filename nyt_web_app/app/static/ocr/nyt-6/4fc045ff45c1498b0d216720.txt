This is a little story printed^on^h^Vy paper and in large type; It Jpve'rs-150 pages.andsoit is a book. The sentiment in it is very pretty, and Mr. Booth Tark-ington -never' writes other thah gracefully. An Impoverished. Neapolitan reduced to almost starvation and with the care <i£ two little nieces dependent upon him. was forced to became a living advertisement for ono. of :the music halls of Paris. The work was light, the pay heavy.. All that was necessary, was to don rthe most exquisitely made suit of‘clothes, sit all day at a small table sipping coffee^ (in the morning hot. in .the afternoon iced,) at the CafS de la Pair, at the comer of the Place de .la! OpGra. His thick crop of black hair was shaved and* on the bald place thus left was printed in large black letters these words:	.

Frlntemps Tous les Soirs!

And poor Raf-faele, with his shaved head bowed low on his breast, remembered through all that day and later through all the years the kind, pitying words of the beautiful lady. For she was beautiful he knew, although he had not seen her face.
Afterward, when, (by means of a lie, It Is true,) Raffaele Ansollni seeures the honorable position of. companion to young Rufus Poor, Jr., he meets the beautiful lady, and finds that he was quite right in his surmise. And 'quite- unconsciously by

means of that same shaved pate in the Cafe de la Paix he'heTps young Poor, Jr', who was her companion on that tragic day,* to win her for his own, and at the same time gets even with the wicked Antonio, Prince Caravacloli. And Raffaele! He Is quite happy, for has he not always the memory of her soft, pitying voice, her beautiful face, and her gray pongee skirt I
