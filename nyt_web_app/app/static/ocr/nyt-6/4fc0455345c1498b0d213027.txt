I The publication in London ot "The Book of the Spiritual Life," by the late Lady Dilke, ^with an introduction by Sir Charles EHlke, has been almost coincidental with that of the third volume of Taine’s correspondence, which we lately noticed. Taine, sojourning in Oxford, during the reign of the Commune, (1871,) met Mrs. Mark Pattison, whom he described as a young woman of twenty-six, (she was a few years older,) well versed in tbe history of painting, especially modern French painting, devoted to all ** occupations of the spirit,’* pretty and charming, a hard worker, and the “ leading mind ” of feminine society in Oxford in the domain of literature and art. Mark Pattison was the rector of Lincoln College, The essays of Lady Dilke in this new. volume, we understand, are somewhat in the nature of mystical discourses. Sir Charles’s biographical sketch occupies a large part of the volume. He married the wldtxv of Mark Pattison (Emilia Francis Strong) in 1SS5.
