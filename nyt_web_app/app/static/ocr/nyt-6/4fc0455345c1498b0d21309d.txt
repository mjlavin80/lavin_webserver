A new volume by Ramsden Balmforth, author of ** Some Social and Political Pioneers," “ The Old Testament from the Standpoint of the Higher Criticism," &c., entitled " The New Testament In the Light of the Higher Criticism,’' is shortly to appear here through E. P. Dutton & Co. The hook forms a sequel to the writer’s previous work on the Old Testament. It deals, he writes, v with questions of faith and doctrine which lie nearer to our modem thought and life, and which therefore arouse deeper feelings and emotions than do the questions which arise out of the criticism and interpretation of the Old Testament.”
There are chapters on " The True Basis of Religious Union,'* ** How the New Testament Was Compiled,” ** The Birth Legends," ** The Religion of Jesus," " The Ethics of Jesus,” *' Paul’s Life and Work and Teachings," *' The Epistles,** &c. Concerning hfs chapter on *' The Relation Of New Testament Teachings to Modem Thought and Life,’* Mr. Balmforth writes in his preface:
An attempt is there made to deal with the vexed question of theological terminology. On such a question little can he said in the course of a few pages, and that little is liable to misinterpretation. Yet it is just here that we need to have clear and tolerant views if we desire to promote, in however small a degree, the religious unity of mankind, or perhaps I should say the religious unity of those who are religiously minded. I believe that in the religious experience of a Jesus and a Sakya Mount there are, essentially, more similarities than differences.
*	• * So, too, in our modern life. * * * Sometimes, indeed, the impersonal term Will express more than the personal. On this point I am glad to find. myself in agreement with Dr. Moberly in his work on ** Atonement and Personality.”
