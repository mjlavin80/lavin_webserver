Think of classing the late Laurence Hutton as a •• yellow journalist ”! Yet that is just what the editor of The London Academy unblushingly does, though he does not use the precise expression, which is not in the vocabulary of English reviewers. What The Academy actually calls Mr. Hutton is an “ up-to-date journalist,** which Is an equivalent. In the editor’s mind, for something very reprehensible. “ Born in better times/’ says this editor, " Mr. Laurence Hutton would have done credit to the profession of letters." But he turned out to be nothing better than “ really one of the most reputable representatives of modern journalism.’* As a matter of fact, Mr. Hutton’s connection with journalism was very brief. He wrote little for newspapers many of the later years of his life. He cared little for them, too. He was a contributor to magazines and a writer of books, who had little to do with the cush and bustle of modern life. He retired early to his Sabine farm. The Academy’s remarks were inspired by the fact that Mr. Hutton’s posthumous book, *' Talks in a Library,*' edited by Miss Isabel Moore, is full of bright gossip and entertaining anecdote, that it reflects many of the actual views of a sane, healthy literary man who was no poser. The statement that Mr. Hutton was “ oblivious of ail that is really great in literature ” is preposterous. * His fondness for collecting autographs and death-masks may have been an amiable weakness, but that does not prove

that he was a “ yellow journalist.*'
