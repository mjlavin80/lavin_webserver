The illustrations given with the extracts from Latrobe’s journal, (La-trobo, it will be recalled, was the tirst architect of the Capitol,) and with Dr. Evans’s story of his visit to the French Emperor are particularly well made and interesting; but more especially will the attention be fixed upon the reproductions of pictures and documents which accompany " The Personal Appearance of John Paul Jones/' Here we have a fac simile of the first commission held by Jones in the navy of *' The United States of North America, Fitted Out for the Defense of American Liberty.’* The format of the magazine is what it was when published under the auspices or The Booklovers Library. It is quite likely that important changes in pictorial and typographical effects may be expected from iritmth to month.
