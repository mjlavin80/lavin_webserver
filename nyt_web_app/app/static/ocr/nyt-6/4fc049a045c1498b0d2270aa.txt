Alberto Pisa*s Paintings, with Text by M. A- R. Tuker and Hope • Malleson.*
HIS book is composed of pictures of Rome, seventy in number, and twelve chapters on Rome, which have nothing to do with the pictures. Yet the result Is homogeneous— as much so as is the case often when an illustrator has drawn pictures for an article, or a writer has prepared the text to describe an existing illustration. The pictures are extremely interesting and often very beautiful. They are reproduced in color, with much success. A painting of the Coliseum in a storm is notable, and while the regular views are reproduced—the gardens of the Villa Borghese and those of the villa d'Este, for example—there are many others of places less familiar.
But it is the text of the book which provides the greatest interest. This is by two Englishmen who have lived long In the Eternal City. An earlier work by them, in three volumes, “ A Handbook to Christian and Ecclesiastical Rome,** !h one of the best guide books to Catholic Rome extant. Their new volume is equally good in its different wny.
A chapter on the Roman manage is enlightening. The custom in Rome is to 1 live in flats, which vary in size from three to four rooms to suites of thirty or. forty, and even in the most princely of I palaces apartments can usually be leased. The janitor is as much in evidence as the Parisian concierge.
A middle-class fnmilv is not yerv no-pronchable fn the mominT. Although extreme! v enrly risers—no hour seems ton early in Rome for peor>le to bn up about—the house remains en deshabille till the afternoon. At first sight a'l the rooms aonear to be bedrooms, which are used indifferently to sit it*. Nevertheless, one room, generally the smallest and least attractive* fs set aside as the V re~ ception room/’ The family never sit In it. and n»ver enter it except to receive their visitors. A jute-covered sofa of the most uncomfortable pattern, with a strip of carnet before it. Is de rigueur. and a visitor would consider herself slierhtod if not ushered to this seat of honor. IF ther** hann^ns to be a chimney it is considered unwholesome and blocked up.
Romans hate rain, and every one carries an umbrella. Brigands only, so it Is popularly believed* carry no umbrellas, and by this you may know them. The Romans* cheerful acquiescence In what we should call hardships is admirable. They have no adequate means of warming their homes, though frosts and even snow are by no means unknown. But they are gourmets, so far as they can be, and devote much time to their meals, both in preparing and in eating them. All cooking . aud_ eating utensils are kept scrupulously clean, and the dirtiest peasant will wipe out his glass- carefully before lie uses it. The Italians, are also fastidious about their beds—a fact that Settlement workers and nurses here have
-	commented on with surprise; but there the standard of cleanliness fails. Floors, are never washed. An Italian servant
-	“ will never clean a floor on her own initiative, and is quite capable-of giving notice should you excect her to.-
It takes the foreign resident some time to grasp the idiosyncrasies of Roman shops. A linen draper looks at you with kindly pity if you ask him for ribbons .or haberdashery, which can only be obtained at a mercer's devoted to this trade. Your fishmonger will sell only fish; your butcher closes between 12 and 5, and will seldom sell mutton and never lamb, which; must be sought at a poulterer’s. _tJniess the legend *' fixed- prices *’ appears Tn the window, the shopman will expect you to bargain over every .purchase. The foreigner who pays unquestionlngly what he is asked is a poor-spirited creature not worth fleecing:	,
Compared with iron-L«atIn peoples.
I writes one of our authors, the lines ot Italian development have beenJ intellect- > ual rather than on the side of character j and conduct; You never meet in' Italy ] the wall of thick-headed, self-righteous j prejudice which tho Englishman never fails to brandish (sic) when confronted wifh a new idea.'* The Italian is p.. dem- , Ocrat.

taste, art, delicacies of sentiment, for the great creations oT' the intellect, the spirit and the imagination—Rome is the ancient mistress dT the world; and the rtile, the influence, and the function of Rome must all be viewed in relation to her gift of infallible criterion, of world dominance. The Roman to-day not only lives in the city of the Roman who gave laws to the known world; he thinks his thoughts and to a great extent lives his life-'* He and his fellows to-day are tho same people as the Romans of the great epoch—but with a difference: with the energy sapped out, with the power of self-sacrifice for a public good gone, and with it the power to impose themselves on the nations, on the rest of Italy.
" The pride of the Roman is his chief characteristic; It keeps him from some of the pettinesses of his neighbors, and is occasionally the Idol to which self-interest is sacrificed. But the same people who are too proud to work are not too proud to beg. The Roman pride Is a disease; It clamors for Its own- license, and respects no one else's liberty; it plays iriW the hands of Latin lawlessness, and the Roman spirit of revolt has tormented the Popes ever since Constantine- deserted tin? capital of the West." But he has the good qualities of his pride; he 44 has no
*	jesuitry,’ and will not say behind your back what he dares not say to your face. In contrast to other Italians Is his roughness. The Romans are, perhaps, tlie best-hearted people in. Italy; and a dear old Roman friend usedito declare that the Romans and the English were the kindest-hearted people In the world.** Nothing and nobody have ever escaped the Roman satire—Pope and peasant alike have suffered from it.
Did the Romans welcome or reprobate the* entry of “ the Italians in 1S70? Their feelings were mixed. A large part of themt-had helped prepare for the d6-nouemenj: others had tried faithfully to Induce Pius IX. to institute necessary reforms, The priests, papal functionaries, and their dependents, the papal nobility, and the poor were “ for the Pope.” -But the great middle class wished for the Italians.	-
The writer gives some strange Instances of the contradictions of the Papal Government. In the time of Gregory XVI. tl831-46) lioine was ** the paradise of artists, who did what seemed good in their own eyes, no man hindering them. The curious traveler of family and fortune enjoyed every liberty under the Papal Government save* only the liberty to speak or write about politics and religion, and suffered nothing save the Occasional loss of a newspaper or book which the--paternal Government stopped at the frontier as likely to imperil the peace of mind of the Romans." Yet a non-smoker was sentenced to twenty years’ Imprisonment because he got Into a row with a smoker—because not to smoke was to protest against the Papacy at the expense of its tobacco monopoly.
“ The people were not taxed; and neither were they taught. Some subjects were altogether taboo; modem .history was one of them^. Girls were taught to read that they might read their prayers; but they did not Iearn^to write, lest they should indite love letters. -This was typical of the papal system. * * * But it will he said: These people were at least taught their religion. They were taught their religion^ os they were taught everything else—that is, not at all.’* They were superstitious; and superstition, as Outda says, is a parody of religion.	f
The authors write interestingly of the Papal imprisonment:.	'
When* we speak of the present servitude of the Pope we forget that Catholic Princes have always found themselves obliged to restrain the Papal arm. Thus the disciplinary canons of Trent were not published and never accepted, in many Catholic States. There is a covered way from the Vatican to-Castel Sant' Angelo which is itself a parable of the history of the Roman-Popes. It' wivs constructed asa means of fleeing in sfecttecy and safety from the-Vatican when the turbulent Romans or foreign Invaders made the Pope’s .life insecure. .	..	-... .
