^ For anything hut its size Mrs. Marie .Robinson Wr*ght’s bo ole "The Republic ot Chile *' is to he commended. Its publishers have made it a quarto on heavy calendered paper, and bound it in sleazy cloth with cheap stamped and gilded " ornaments." It is worthy of a more reputable, less centre-table form.
Mrs. Wright has spent five years in South America, two of them in Chile, *• in serious study,** and her book, In spite of its vulgar appearance, (for which she can-/ not be held responsible,} is a credit to her and a valuable contribution to our knowledge of the chief country in South America, She tells, only too briefly* the story of the conquest by Cortez, of the Spanish rule, and of the war of independence, and then describes the country, its cities, gov- , eminent, trade, and industries.
Our knowledge of American history is not much greater, as a factr^han that of the average Englishman. We study English history, that of-Greece and Home, and that of the United States; only of late years have our schools paid as much attention to our own history as to that of the Greeks and the Romans. Of the history of Central and South Atn erica our children know nothing and we little more. Of Mexico and Peru some of us have read " In Prescott’s histories; hut those, ended their accounts a few years after the arrival of the Conquistadores. We know nothing of the wars waged by the Arau-canians of South America against the Spaniards, of ’* the Indian .Knight ” Lau-taro, of Caupolican; the only War of Independence we know is our own; we have no idea why one Chilean warship should be called the Cochrane and another the O’Higgins. Yet It is all good history, tbe fctory of 'irtLve efforts of brave men to be free We should know more of it than we . do. Mrs. 'JVright might well turn her attention to the subject.
The book before us tells an interesting and hopeful story. Chile has “ found herself." She is the'-most important nation -in South America; and even what we are pleased to call her insolence—wherein we are wont to compare her to England—is but a sign of the “ survival of the fittest."
. Is it because she is so little Latin in her make-up that she is so strong? Her nearest rival, Argentina, is likewise less Spanish than German and English.^ Mrs. Wright says that the English language s " very generally spoken in Valparaiso ”; so it Is in Buenos Ayres.
An Interesting and unexpected chapter in the book is on Chilean painting and sculpture. The Portuguese art exhibit at St. Louis won a gold medal for its completeness, and surprised every one who . saw it. So, 'too, might the paining and sculpture of the Chileans. It is barely fifty years since an academy of art . was founded in Santiago. French influence is marked, perhaps too much 'so, as the. pictures reproduced in Mrs. Wright’s book might be of Parisian origin as well as of Chilean. Buf" it is evident that there is a strong and healthy art development far south of us.
Another unexpected industry of Chile is that of wine growing. Millions havfe been invested in Chilean vineyards, says Mrs. Wright; schools of viticulture have been established, and at all agricultural schools tbe pupils study the subject Chilean brandy and wines won gold medals at our Buffalo Exposition in 1000. Vve are apt to apologize if we give a guest American wine, but the Chilean apologizes If he_ offers French wine! This may be.conceit, but it is a conceit that helps to Improve the native wines.
Mrs. Wright's book owes absolutely nothing to its publishers except clear printing. They have provided neither‘map. nor Index.	•
