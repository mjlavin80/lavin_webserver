Another volume for Rosa Newmarch’s series, Living- Masters of Music, brought out by the John Lane Comjjany at The Bodley Head, is being prepared by J. A. Fuller Maitland. It 'will deal with “Joseph Joachim.’* Besides giving1 a sketch of the career of the vidlinist and composer, the author writes critically about his work— his violin playing, his teaching, his influence, and his compositions.
When Joachim was three or four years old he was taught the rudiments of violin playing by a medical student who was very fond of the instrument. The latter induced the boy’s parents to put him under a tutor. He made his first public appearance in 1839. Then he went-to Vienna to study with Miska Hauser and Hellmes- | | berger the elder. Later he studied with Bohm. In 1843 he met Mendelssohn in ! Leipsic, and through him obtained private instruction from Hering and Moritz Hauptmann, occasionally being advised by David and Mendelssohn. The following year he played in London. Later^ in his capacity as leader of the Weimar Orchestra, he came in contact with Liszt, von Bulow, and Raff. In 1853 Joachim started his fifteen-year engagement in Hanover as “ Concertmelster,” and in that city his intimate friendship with Brahms began. In 1869, six years after his marriage to the celebrated singer Amalie Weiss, he became Direktor in der konig-Uchen Hocbschule fur Musik In Berlin, which post he still holds to-day.
Tho present volume will be fully illustrated with portraits of Joachim at different periods of his life and views and autograph reproductions of some of his compositions.
