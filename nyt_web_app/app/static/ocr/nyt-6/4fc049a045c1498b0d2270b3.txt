!	/' The Hampshire Grants in- particular,
| a country, unpeopled and almost unknown in the last war, now abounds tn the most active and most rebellious race of the Continent, and hangs like a gathering storm on my left.” Thus wrote Gen. Burgoyne, and his words prefacing “ Hester of the Grants ’* indicate the scene, the time, and the characters of yet another Revolutionary novel. All of its Icind have certain unfailing ingredients— sundry galvanized historical personages, of whom Jn the book before us Sthan Allen is chief; a heroine who enslaves friend and foe alike; lovers of combative temperament; a lowly and hopeless worshipper, who usually saves the life of the successful suitor; perilous ‘situations for-the leading lady; thrilling and heroic adventures for the hero; hairbreadth escapes; subtle strategems—the whole well mixed with ** battle, murder, t\nd sudden death.** ^
We come upon all these too familiar elements In '** Hester of the Grants," but they are really very well combined, with a spice"—of originality, and a vigorous, dramatic presentation. If this were but the tenth, or the twentieth, or even the hundredth of its tribe, we might find much to say in commendation of the ingenuity of its plot and of its unusually excellent style; but it Is heavily handicapped by Its period. Would that our novel writers, especially the feminine ones, could drink of the waters of Lethef Having offered one historical* novel upoD ‘the altar of the Time Spirit, we hope Miss Peck will turn her powfers of observation and delineation upon the world of which she Is herself a part. We are persuaded that she has it in her to write a book well worth the reading, which, despite : its merits. “ Hester of the Grants " is not.
