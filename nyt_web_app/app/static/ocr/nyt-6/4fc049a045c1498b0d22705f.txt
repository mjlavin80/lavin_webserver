A new volume by Ralph Curtis Ring-waft, A, B., LL. B., member of the New York bar, joint editor of '* Briefs for Debate," &c., is published this week by Longmans, Grsen & Co. It is entitled “ Briefs on Public Questions,” and contains a series of .argumentative briefs and lists of references on twenty-five of i the moat important public questions of ^e day. For greater precision In the rgument each brief baa been prefaced | with a concise proposition, stating the question for discussion- In some short paragraphs an explanation Is given on ! the importance of the subject, what facts tnaterialto it are generally conceded by both sides, and what are the principal ; points at issue. The brief proper comes next, followed- by a discussion of these issues from the* affirmative and the negative points of view. Each division is preceded by a list of references. Mr. ftingwalt writes of his work:	‘
In the briefs 1 have attempted little beyond an analysis and arrangement. of v the more important arguments put forward by those who have written on the same topics. Lnrgrely because of tbe limitation ot space, only the main, lines ot an argument have been given; no especial effort has. been made to invent new or original arguments; and whenever a writer's wording of his point ,haa seemed to be particularly effective I have riot hesitated to use It. • • * I have tried to give the most important books on each topic, and especially references to available books—those which are, or ought to be, in every lavge library.
Briefs are given on politics, economics, and sociology—naturalization, woman suffrage, negro suffrage, Chinese immigration*. the Monroe Doctrine; protection and i free trade, trusts, “shipping subsidies, a postal telegraph, a federal divorce law, the single tax, government by injunction,
: and so on.
