“Shorter's' bold statement rwill ; jstartle;; .not a: few of us who reflect that the author of *' Huckleberry Finn ” arid'
.V Life on the Mississippi/*tlie- author of ">Annie Kllburn " and “ The Rise of Silas Lapham,” and the author of “ Daisy Miller1' -and "The Golden Bowl ” are still livings American men of letters, not to mention the sponsors of B’rer Rabbit and Little Orphant Annie, whose contributions to literature, we firmly believe, will prove as nearly permanent as Mr. Cable’s.	_
Indeed, Mr. "Whitcomb Riley's inimitable Indiana lyrics and Mr. Joel Chandler Harris’s folklore tales of the Southern darky have excited no such hostile eritlclsm in their own environment as have Mr. Cable’s picturesque tales of life in the old town of New Orleans. while Mr. Riley and Mr. Harris are prophets honored each in his own particular country, (the land of the Hoosier farmer -and the land of the emancipated slave,) Mr. Cable’s interesting stories are praised most highly by people who, like Mr. Shorter, we presume, know the least about the actual conditions of existence tn New Orleans.
This fact, however, may be taken for what it Is worth, with no prejudice to the artistic quality of Mr. Cable’s work, which is indisputably of a high order. Moreover, one can easily understand Mr. Shorter’s mood. He has lately met Mr. Cable in London and has been " reading up ” In Cable In honor of the event; That is but a commonplace author whose books are not frequently described by sympathetic" and responsive readers as " the best.” Mr. Cable’s books are quite good enough to be called “ the best,” when one is emotionally under their influence. But a statement, made in cold print, on a page of literary criticism, is another matter.
MR - CABLE.
A definite statement of the comparative merit of a living author is always Interesting and is often important, if true. Ms. Will Morton Payne’s statement, for instance, that Mr. William Vaughan Moody and Mr. George E. Wood berry are the two best poets now living (to which we gave much consideration at the time it was made,) seemed to clear the air very much. Now Mr. Clement Shorter, an English critic with a mind of his own, boldly asserts in The Sphere of London that Mr. George W. Cable, in “ Old Creole Days ’* and ** Madame Delphine," ** has probably made more permanent contributions to literature than any living American man of letters.”
We are all very proud of Mr. Cab Jeon this side of the Atlantic, but Mr,
