Old -Quebec is -a favorite city of refuge * for contemporary story writers. .Here is one who " has made another tale of treason and love with the city -of Wol*e and Montcalm for a setting. And he has been liberal of 'tho incidents which ar«> t the stock of his trade. First there s a 'scene aboard ship, a card sharper nobly denounced -in the cabin, and hard upon that a ’Crash upon a sunken *TOck, shipwreck, and- the rescue of a .pretty maid -by a well-set-up young gentleman _ fresh from the field, of Kontenoy, where '&S*?has -covered hisffself with glory.
That’s the curtain raiser. Then comes the play proper fn Quebec, as aforesaid. There the card sharper, who with tho hero and heroine is permitted to escape a watery grave, hatches the most elaborate and diabolical plot to ruin the hero— a plot in which he has as ally a wicked lady, who is. not only beautiful, but a mistress of that black art which is now (pseudo-scientiflcally) known as hypnotism. Beaided which (like tho siren of “ The Three .Musketeers *’) she has done things for which she had been branded upon.the soft white flesh with the royal fleur-de-lis.
On the other hand is the' lovely good . girl who was saved from the sinking ship. Sho plays with the sharper and the she-devil for the soul and body of the late soldier of Fontenoy, who is quite enslaved by the acts already mentioned, and is on the strength of them very near being hanged or shot for a traitor. You may guess if any self-respecting romantfer would permit a good girl to lose in a game like the one we have mentioned, and you may imagine brocaded ballroom scenes and oathful gambling scenes, drinking bouts with songs, the setting of traps, the sneers of the wicked, the noble attitudes of the hero, the wild night ride of the heroine, and the last great fight in which the villain is served as he merits and safely skewered to the doorpost of bi» own house.
