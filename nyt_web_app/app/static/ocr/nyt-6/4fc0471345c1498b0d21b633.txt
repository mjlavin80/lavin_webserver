Lucas's new ** Life of Lamb,” and the Hatzfeldt letters,

Among the new works promised for the early Fall are stories by Stanley Weyman, Jerome K, Jerome, Richard Whiteing, and Ellen Thorneycroft Fowler, which are all on the Hutchin-sons’ list.
In Herbert Paul’s forthcoming biography of James Anthony Froude he will have something to say, I understand, of the historian's relations with Carlyle. But it is not proclaimed that he will “ throw new light ” on the pitiful subject.
George Bell & Sons will publish in the Autumn “ Beautiful Wopien in History and Art ” by Mrs. Stewart Brs-kine. It will contain adequate stories of the lives of many beautiful and distinguished women, with authentic portraits.

J. M. Dent & Co. announce a new ** Life of Michael Bruce,’* the Scotch poet, with a vindication of his author--ship of the poems and hymns claimed by James Logan. James Mackenzie is the author of this new book, which will revive a famous old literary controversy. It is believed that he has discovered new evidence of Bruce’s authorship.
Messrs. Jack & Co., in partnership with a Canadian publishing house, are engaged on a series of twenty volumes entitled " The Makers of Canada.” Twenty-tour lives will be reviewed in this work by Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Lady Edgar, Prof. Adam Short, and others.
