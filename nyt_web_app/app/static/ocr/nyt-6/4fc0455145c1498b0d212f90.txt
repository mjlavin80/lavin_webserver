NOTEWORTHY new book of the week is ** Richard Wagner to Mathllde Wesen-donck,” a remarkable collection of letters written by the great composer to the woman who most strongly influenced him in his work,. translated and edited by William Ashton Ellis. A portrait of Frau Wesendonck, prefacing the volume, from a painting by C. Dorner in I860, shows a comely lady with a reflective brow and eyes wide apart, a Minerva, perhaps, but certainly not a Venus. She died in 1902, and although her platonic relationship to Wagner had previously been much talked about because of the outspoken objections of Wagner’s first wife, the letters which make up the body of this book have not been published until now. Indeed, this is a new revelation of Wagner's character and ambition. Frau Wesendonck left- the letters in careful order, and willed' their publication. Mr. Ellis assumes that she intended to write an introduction herself. Wagner and Mathilde met in 1852, four years after her marriage. The correspondence continued, though fitfully and briefly toward the close, until 1871, the year after his second marriage. Frau Coslma had him well in hand then. The chief interest in the letters now, of course, is their intimate record of the artistic development of Wagner.

One of our reviewers this week, writing of John Whitson's spirited pictures of' far Western life' in Justin Wingate, Ranchman/' expresses a regretthat so few novelists dare ,. to omi t -ah . equivalent for; romantic love from'their books, even when they lack; the skill atjd sympathy to make love stories inter-;, esting. “ Kim ” and “ Lord Jim " are instanced^as notable works'of fiction Jn which the’ lp vie of' women plays no part,;Bui;^ Miy:
•are.writers of gifts;far blit of the
individual writer than Kipling would have been sent back in manuscript for a 11 love Interest ” to be written in, but then a less individual writer would never have written a ** Kim." The convention of a ** love interest ’’ is strongly fixed in the publishing mind, and rightly so, from, the purely commercial point of view, though, to be sure, ■a love story of languid interest seems worse than no love story at all. To be sure, admirable works of fiction have been written without a hint of the theme of love. Mr. T. A. Janvier's “ The Aztec Treasure House *' is one of them, and is one of the most fascinating tales ever written, But it was published as long ago as 1890, and we have never heard a demand for a new edition. This is probably a case in which both the reviewer and the publisher are right, from their respective points of view.
Our Boston correspondent confirms the report that the hitherto anonymous author of "A Publisher's Confessions *’ is Mr. Walter H. Page. Both The Dial and The Critic have belated articles on this book, and both emphasize the fact that this publisher confesses nothing at all. The sins and shortcomings he sets forth are those of others. The greedy author, (actually striving to gain a decent livelihood by writing,) the reviewer, the professional “ readers "—these are his game. He admits no faults of his own. The Critic, which is the property of a great book-publishing house, thinks the book would be much more lively if /the publisher really confessed something. "Publishers/* says The Critic, "know a lot they can't tell/’ Indeed, they must. But, alas! as we read further in The Critic’s brief comments, we find that the things publishers know and cannot tell are chiefly about authors. " The public would stand aghast if it knew how tricky are some of the authors whom it holds in the highest esteem.” Now, we fancy that " A Publisher's Confessions " abuses the authors quite enough for one book, and that one written by an avowed publisher.
The Summer Reading Number of The New York Times Book Review will be published one week hence, June 17. It will contain succinct descriptive notices of one hundred new books in many departments of literature. Fiction predominates. Inevitably, in such a list, but there are good books of all sorts for the man or woman who desires to devote some part of a Summer's leisure to “ reading up/’ Biography, criticism of life and letters, books on outdoor life and gardening, science, finance, trade, travel and adventure will all be reasonably well represented in this list. Of course, every single number of The New York Times Book Review, at this time of year is a Summer reading number which nobody who desires to keep abreast with current literature can do without. Many books welt worth reading, and as suitable for reading in Summer as any other time, are described impartially, for instance, in this very number. But .the- special pumb-r. with Its list specifying so many good books already published or about to appear, is designed as* a convenience for persons who depart, about now, for retreats far from book. shops, and is particularly prized for that reason by them and by the booksellers. .
