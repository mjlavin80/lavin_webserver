RS. WHARTON'S story In Scribner's, " The House of Mirth." continues to excite more discussion, from Installment to installment, than any other serial of the present hour. A cynical dramatist of the last generation once declared, that the exhibition of a woman's moral and social degradation, step by step, was always a subject sure of the popular applause. We do not mean to intimate that the author of " The Valley of Decision" has been governed, in writing her newest novel, by any purpose so Ignoble as that. Indeed, we are hoping that, as the serial is still in “ Book I.,*’ the heroine, whose natural vanity and extravagance, developed in a baffTnvironment, have involved her in a web of evil, may yet find a way out to her regeneration. What strikes us most strongly, in these earlier chapters, however, is the unloveliness of Miss Bart's character. Her beauty and taste in dress, and her mental superiority to most of - her set, must count for nothing, it seems to us. with the mpst sympathetic reader, so pitilessly does the chronicler of her' doingB lay bare .the faults of her character. She Is lifelike, however, pathetically lifelike; and so, also, in a smaller degree are all her friends and acquaintances, excepting Lawrence Selden, who seems,but a. modem variant of the ; morose „ sentimentalist of countless ladies' novels. , . -	. .; . -	- .
