Mr. Connolly is not given to moralizing, but It is a fine contrast that he draws between the determined, honest fashion In ywhlch Charlton and Gray uphold their . rights, and the sneaking meanness of their rivals, while from the results^of the
two methods of conducting business one may draw his own conclusions as to their respective values. Just thei way in which they manage the crazy little tug with which they have to accomplish the transportation 'of the lumber is a lesson in all the manly virtues—courage, patience, perseverance, ingenuity, and the.disposition to .make the best o£ even the most dis-couiVjgJng circumstances. The "Ripple," nicknamed the “ Cripple," on account of her inclination to go to the bottom on the least possible excuse, was doubtless a wretched craft in which to navigate, but the attending difficulties are highly amusing to read about, especially as there is never much danger that her two venturesome young owners will suffer drowning at her hands.. When she finally received her deathblow—a very light one at that—from a schooner’s bowsprit,

It would seem to be a far cry. from " The Seiners,” with its roaring gales, deep-water fishermen, and dare-devil boat-racing, to the comparatively quiet environs of Savannah Harbor and the doings of some engineers and contractors employed there in building Government jetties, but Mr. James B. Connolly has managed to cram almost as much exclte-mcnt into M On Tybee Knoll ” as distin-1 g-uished his story of how Gloucester fish-i ermen get fun out of their hard and ! dangerous lives.
|	“ On Tybee Knoll ” boasts one pros-
pective heroine, two heroes, three most villainous villains, and innumerable adventures of a more or less hazardous character, but the interest Is not at. all of a sentimental kind. Mr. Tom Charlton, whose nerve, ingenuity, bodily strength, and ready wit carry through almost all of the very ticklish situations,. is very distinctly a boyish hero and his achievements are of the daringly reckless sort that arc the delight of boy readers. He and his p’artner, Gray, who is a little older, but no mote afraid of risking life
