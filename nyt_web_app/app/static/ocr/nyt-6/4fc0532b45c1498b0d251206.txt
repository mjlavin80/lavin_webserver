YUKr-Kb. WESTERNIZED,
THE BREATH OF THE GODS. By Std-nr-y McCall. 12mo. 1*0. J31. Boston: brittle. Brown & Co. §1.50.
! It might be well to be forewarned by one of the Japanese characters in this
, r-ew work by'the author of ** Truth Dexter ” that “ America is an ’ honorably highly civilized country, and Nippon merely a divine, half-civilized country.*’ With' that in riiind, one rpay read with 'a great deal more . interest what happens when a Japanese girl, 'educated in the "honorably highly’civilized country," returns to the merely " divine, half-civilized country.”	'	'
-	Yukl-ko is the girl. Pierre is the foreign sweetheart, whom she'iearned to love In Washington while a friend of Senator Todd, afterward American Minister to Japan, and Ills family. When Yukl-ko returns to Japan after having, given a pledge of her faith to Pierre, the fact that the latter Is half French, half Russian provokes a situation that can be imagined qufeker than it can be described; Prince Hagane. the “ War God of Japan," fancies the girl himself, but in justice before making a request, which, in Japan’, amounts to the claim of one of his rank, he points out to the girl, that her duty at this time of. national conflict is not to her own desires, nor his, but to Nippon and the gods. Yuki-ko, in whose blood runs fiercely and fervidly the old Samurai spirit, yields, although her heart is torn in this sacrifice of love to duty.
Later she is compromised by Pierre, who, while half delirious, from fever, enters the "garden of Yuki, now Princess Hagane. In order to aid him and at the same time protect herself she hides him and gives him a sleeping draught/ She seeks lo tell her husband Utrfore he finds it out for himself, but the war god is so busy with a proposed alliance between the friendly powers through their respective Ministers that ho does not bend his " augustly honorable ear." After the conference of the powers while Yukl is try- I Ing to tell him something apparently of heartrending import, Pierre, still half delirious, snatches a document of International value from the Prince’s hand and jumps through the window. Hagane immediately suspects his wife of alliance with this foreign sweetheart and spurns her. He goes to the French Embassy where Pierre has gone with the document and there a terrible drama of diplomacy and domestic unhappiness is enacted. Finally Hagane barters with Pierre for the return of the document unread, the price to be paid being Yuki. The price Is paid at an appointed hour, Hagane brings Yuki in a rickshaw, receives the paper, and waves his hand to the woman in white in the light vehicle. The Yuki-ko Pierre takes in his arms Is dead, she having stabbed herself to the heart, believing in her simple faith that in this manner only could she atone to the gods for her sin. The sin upon which she harped is nothing more than that, through her, a paper valuable to Japan was stolen, when her innocence In all other respects is established.
“The Breath of-the Gods” is worthy of the author of ** Truth Dexter." it is a good story, but the thread of narrative is like a ride of a Summer morning, it is not the ride; it is the atmosphere and the scenery around. '
