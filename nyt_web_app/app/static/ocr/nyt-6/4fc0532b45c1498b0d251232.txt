Foreign Railway Systems.
An attempt is made in " Railways and Their Rates,” by Edwin A. Pratt, author of " American Railways," “The Organization of Agriculture,” &c., to “ set before traders and general readers the actual position of British railways with regard to (1) the complaints advanced from time to time on the subject of rates and charges, and (2) the origin, operation, and circumstances of our own railways, as compared with those of railways abroad, ' and especially on the Continent of Europe.” An idea of the scope of the book is given by the author in his preface:
I have presented many more facts than arguments, hoping thereby that those to whom my hook Js specially addressed will thus be placed in a position to form definite, intelligent, and unprejudiced conclusions of their own. *	*	• They will
learn from my various chapters far more than probably most of them have had the opportunity of learning before as to tbe i origin, legislative control, and financial position of British railways; the anoma-loua circumstances that necessarily influence their rates and charges, and the I conditions under which the general goods and mineral traffic, and also the traffic , in certain specified commodities, are conducted. They will further learn what are I the leading conditions of foreign railway traffic, and they will find comprehensive sketches of various Continental railway systems, and the operation thereof, affording much information not otherwise available, but absolutely essential to a really fair comparison vrith British conditions.
In the appendix is a discussion of the British canal problem. E. P. Dutton & Co. are the American publishers.
