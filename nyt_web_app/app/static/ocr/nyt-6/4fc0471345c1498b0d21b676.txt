James Logan, the father of the object of the Honorable John Smith’s affections, was a wealthy ana educated gentleman of Scotch parentage. Hannah, his fourth child, is described as possessing great loveliness. John Smith was of Quaker origin. ~SThe diary was begun when he was a lad of •fourteen, and was continued with but few interruptions for fourteen years, but it is chiefly the record of the last nine years that Mr. Albert Cook Myers has -retained in his present edition. It depicts the daily life of a refined and educated gentleman, deeply religious, wealthy enough to take his ease, interested in the business and political life of his day, and very much in love. He was also socially inclined, since nearly every entry is punctuated by an account of some pleasant visit to dinner or tea. Now and then he records an “ agreeable conversation ”—as. for instance, a “ dispute upon inoculation for smallpox," or, again, he speaks fervently of his faults as:
A\ meeting. T was. r.s at many other times, favored with a sight of my weakness and the vileness of my natural disposition, which, with tha,_,remembrance of the tender mercies I have rtpeatooly ■received, bowed me very low and made me abhor myself. Oh, may the same sense always keep me in a humble frame of sou)! Drank tea at S. Samson's. Read Pope’s Miscellany. ‘
On the 20t’a of November wc find the item, “ Bot a Red Bird for 5s* & brot home," while on the 20th we read the tragic sequel—“ Read in the Spectator, Tatlers, &c. My Red Bird dyed." The following day, referring to certain affairs at Monthly Meeting, he chides himself thus, " I prated too much, which forwardness often occasions me uneasiness.”
His affections for the fair Hannah, for no particular reasons, seem not always to have run smoothly. He 0nds her first gladly welcoming his advances, then frowning darkly upon his suit. He writes her long *' religious letters," repeatedly declares himself unworthy of so “ lovely a creature," and on one occasion followed her to Burlington, whither she went on her way from the yearly meeting at Shrewsbury. At this time he was ** in a most uneasy disposition of mind, * • • having an eager inclination * * * to go to Burlington. *	•»	«■ was afraid to
do it. Least it should disoblige my dearest Hannah. * * • These different passions contested so Long that they Actually made me sick. However, Love prevailed, and I privately went. *	*	* I met H.
at my Brother's. Had but little of her Company; thought she did not like my coming. O Racking thought! "
On another occasion, despairing of his success, he “used the utmost efforts-to conquer ’* his passion, and “ thought the likeliest way to do it was to seek another object.” At length, however, he was able to persuade the fair Hannah that her -wisest choice lay with him, and thereafter we find him writing wlUi no small pride items concerning his ** dear spouse."
Hi' w;is fond of reading, taking great p!cast:;c in the “reading (of) Paradise Lost, particularly so with the conversation of Adam and Eve in Paradise,’* or again he pores over the work of Shakespeare, Cervantes, Fielding, Th^, Spectator, and Dr. Sherlock’s “ Treitise on Death.”
As tlie medium of presenting an excellent picture of Colonial home life the book also has value.
