Iowa as a Territory.
IOWA, THE FIRST FREE STATE IN THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE. FROM ITS DISCOVERY TO THE ADMISSION OF THE STATE INTO THE UNION, 1G73-1S40. By 'William. Salter. Illustrations and plans. One volume. PP. 289. Chicago:	A.	C.	McClurg &■ Co.
Mr. - William Salter, who has lived in Iowa for more than sixty years, has produced a very agreeable book. It is not, he insists, a history of Iowa after its admission as a State, but simply a record of the Incidents that made it " the first Free State in the Louisiana Purchase/' He has recorded those events with fullness, but without prolixItj\
Iowa certainly had a varied career, which is strikingly shown by its place-names. Marquette and Joliet were the first whites to behold its shores on June 17, 1673; Hennepin and Du Luth explored It slightly. The Sioux, the Foxes, and the Sacs were the chief Indian tribes with whom the French came into contact. Mr. Salter quotes a French Captain as describing a battle between these tribes and the Illinois Indians. The Captain wtote:
" I was a tpectator^of the slaughter, and had an opportunity of saving the life of a girl, who came to bring me strawberries. The sav:iges did not venture to shoot at her for fear of hitting me." Jonathan j Carver of Connecticut was “ the first American " In ^Towa. He went there in i 1T6U.. In 17GS a Spanish Governor re-_ placed the French commander, and Iowa came under the rule of Spain.
Julien Dubuque came to Iowa under the Spaniards, though he was a French Canadian by birth. He was a man of parts,
“ cunning, adroit* a charmer of rattlesnakes,’’ and secured tbe confidence of the Indians, and made the first settle-I ment In Iowa. In 1S04 the present State y?as turned over to the French, and by 1 them the next day transferred to the | United States. Capt. Amos Stoddard, United States Army, represented Napoleon on March 0 and Jefferson on -March 10, 3804. For the first seven years Iowa , remained in the Territory of Louisiana,
I then for nine years it formed part of Mis; souri Territory. For thirteen years after ' Missouri became a State, Iowa was part
■	of the unorganized territory, remaining so 1 until 1834. During this period occurred the Black Hawk war. Then for two years, from 1834 to 1836, .the Territory of Michigan claimed Iowa; for a like period, from 183G to 1838, Wisconsin Territory included the present State. At last, In 1838, the country was organized a^ the Territory of Iowa.
For eight years its people discussed the question of Statehood. In October, 1844, a convention prepared a Constitution, but Congress narrowed the boundaries proposed by the Iowans, who refused to accept Statehood under the new conditions. They waited until the end of December, 184S, before they compromised with Congress and saw their home become a State of the Union. They sent two representatives to Congress at once, but for two years, because of factional quarrels, could not agree on Senators.
John Plumbe of Dubuque, as far back as 1837, began to advocate a railroad across the continent, and Asa Whitney was the first to explore the route for such a road. Iowa was as progressive then as now. .
