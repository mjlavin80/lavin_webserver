The stage lends something, of its -gia- , mour to this story of irrelevant - title. It . begins, In fact, with a doctor hurriedly summoned from his club and his dinner to attend upon a chorus girl who has got hurt somehow behind the scenes and been sacrilegiously carried to the star’s dressing room. The poor chorus girl doesn t matter—she serves merely to introduce the star and the star's daughter, ospe-daily the daughter, 'who Is the heroine.
It is this young lady (not herself an cct-ress) who has dared to put the star s. dressing room to uses of common humanity. The story relates that she is the daughter of an Ill-advised match between her mother and a rich and respectable young New Yorker. Of course the two are separated.
You are permitted, first, to see something of the life of mother and daughter at home and in studios and such places. You accompany the mother while she exceeds the speed limit in motor cars—herself playing chauffeur; you see the two at fencing lessons together, and observe that the elder is Jealous of the yoanger’s charms when men are about. Then a golden-voiced Polish gentleman belonging to grand opera makes love to the girl—sings to her and has her sing to him—writes her horrid high-flown dreary letters. The star, however, frowns and says such a marriage is quite unsuitable —eighteen and forty, Pole and American. She cites her own case, where the incompatibilities were not nearly so great. So the Polish songbird departs sighing profoundly and bowing to match.
Then you see the girl translated to a place among her father's people, and made much of by them, loved and lovable, sad within because of the departed Pole, learning, the ways of the Four Hundred, going to" college, actually becoming a Doctor of Philosophy, then yachting and traveling abroad in Italy, where she meets the Pole again.
It's rather a dim, inconclusive sort of story, the heroine being particularly dim. However, the star—her province is society , plays—seems rather -like the real thing. -It*s a pity .the author has seen fit to kill her in an automobile accident about nuaway of the book.	-
