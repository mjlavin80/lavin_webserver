RUSSIA IN LIT1LRATUBJL
Three Important New Books on the History of the Czar’s Umpire and Its Social ari3~~ Political Problems.*
Written for The New York Times Book Review by WOLF VON SCHJERBRAND.
HE three books here under discussion are, each in its own way, well worth perusal. In matter, but still far more^*1 manner of treatment, they differ greats one from the others. The book by C£rl Joubert Is that of a fanatical Russ^' phobe, a man who condemns not only Russia and t&e Russians in toto, but also the Servians, Bulgarians, and Armenians, as ** cutthroats,** utterly worthless, and not deserving of any sympathy. The book of Mr? Perris, on the other hand, is more moderate aruf reasonable in tone; but It is the book of an ultiji.-radical in politics, one-sided, and conveying also wrong impression of Russia. However, it abounds-in facts, many of which are hard to find elsewhece-and which to a discriminating mind will do much to help understand certain phases of the great Russian problem, while leaving quite untouched many others. Lastly, the third hook, that of" Mr. Bain, dealing with the history of the early Romanoffs,' is of an entirely different quality. It is of permanent worth for the student of history, being based on first-hand sources, handled throughout with skill and palpably frank and informing in its statements of facts, but suffering from the one great fault -of being made to serve a preconceived idea—namely,
** that Russia owes everything to the Czars—her prosperity, her greatness, her empire, her very existence," as the author proclaims in his introduction. " No other European dynasty has so conscientiously, and, on the whole, so successfully, done its duty,’* Mr. Bain goes on to say. In its tendency, therefore, this book is an apology of Czardom and the Czars, and the whole argument runs that way; but in its facts It is eminently fair, cogent, and interesting, and the reader is thus enabled to draw his own conclusions from the same data, conclusions which may—or may not—coincide with those of the author.	^
Carl Joubert, in his “ Russia as It Really Iij,” though his private notions may be faulty and ovgr-" strained, gives, nevertheless, quite a number of 13o- -lated facts of import. There are also anecdotes ajid stories, some of them quite amusing. Here are a few:
A Jewish peddler of Grodno dealt in pirrogs, (meat pies,) and two hungry muzhiks traveling in ; the third-class railroad car with him were so overpowered by the appetizing odor of his wares that, not having money to buy them, they slew the Jew without further ado, and threw the body out of the window. They were apprehended, and to the astonIshment of the pristav (Police Sergeant) the whole supply of pies was found intact. “ Why did you not eat the pirrogs and throw the basket away?" asked ! the pristav. "Tou forget," said one of the muzhiks,
'* that to-day is Friday, and it is not allowed to eat meat.”
While traveling in Siberia the author, at Tomsk, had his passport run out. and its renewal cost him . much delay and bother. " In my country,’’ said he, (Mr. Joubert is an Englishman,) "it is only the dogs who are required to have passports.” “ They are all dogs in Russia,” the official answered.
At a great dinner in St- Petersburg, attended by high officials and nobles, an old General seriously requested the author: ** Now, young man, ahow- us -how the soldiers march in your country! *• Later on, the conversation drifting to foreign manners, they asked him: " Have you really no icons in your country? ” Toward the end the entertainment became a . bacchanalian feast, and a high official, to save, time, -with one 3erk pulled tablecloth and everything. off the table, ordering new bottles,	*
Speaking of the personal lack of cleanliness and instancing a troop of Orthodox priests he met in th& country, the author says; “ The plague of lice, like the plague of darkness, seems to have traveled to...; Russia and taken up its abode there. Ninety per '•! cent, of the population are verminous, and they can make no secret of it; for the particular parasite from which they suffer gives them no rest.'*	,	•

l.j^|a.3r ln Russia,; or subsequently, during fvilHiVcLs in the empire. Here is one of, this: v-l^ftdof item: " In the year 1S3§ a .party,1 I- ofrj^io prisoners left the Moscow prison : «ft>r*Siberia. Only 72 arrived at their des-vv^nsition, .Some were murdered by their pJtiMWfls, some by infectious diseases, some ^ by f. starvation, and some because they I ^Wiahted to be murdered."	-	‘
rhis preface the author denounces ■i mitet of the boots that have of late ap- * •’ pe&red in English on Russia as ridiculous . 'fabrications. " They purported to describe " jRiissia—it might almost as well have been , Tiinbuctoo/’ he says. And there Is no de-' nytngthat much of what Dr. Joubert here ’ records Is his own visual and oral impresT siqns.
r 11 But the book, in its MUe and its preface, '•purports to describe Russia. And this it 5 ;^oes not It devotes a few pages each to such huge subjects as " The Army," *' The Holy Czar," "The Moujik,*’ &c,, which •contain nearly altogether gross generalities;* devoid of any kind o£ proof, or at-f tempts at proof. In places, as shown f *above, 'these brief chapters are amusing,
: but they certainly do not give even a general outline of their subjects.
^ The real value of this book—and by far i ttsffiarger half in volume—lies in the story
•	<Sf!*feow the author planned and executed 1 ‘ th^’escape of his friend, Dr. Alexander
Bogdanov itch, and two of his fellow-exiles j inrSiberia, That, though told in a cold' blooded, matter-of-fact way, without even I . a$?^itteinpt at literary finish, is a thrilling; recital. This is the way o.ur author jtjriljed the Sergeant of the rota, (prison-«rs’j convoy:)
■	It We sat down side by side at the edge
■	of the forest* "Tell me. Sergeant," I said, "if I were to place a fifty-ruble note on your eye could you see?” ** No, doctor, I should not be able to see with that eye, but* I could see out of the other/’ ’JOh, you could! Well, then, fifty rubles on your other eye would make you totally
, blind?" "Yes, docior, I should.be blind for ^ life. There are so many colors in . JC hundred-ruble note that it is impossible t^> see through- it, I am told." *	*	*'
"^Now let us come to an understanding.
£ place a fifty-ruble note on each of ypur eyes and you are blind. Now supposing -that 1 place another upon your niouth, would you lose your power of
•	speech?" ** A man cannot speak with h$s mouth full of paper, gospodin. You dte:;a doctor who knows well the medicine to prescribe for every disease."
Very good,” I said. “ Now when you are blind and speechless what are you- going to do?" "You may leave
*	that to me, doctor. All I want to know is which’ are the birds and how many are-to be turned into the woods? You shall nave as many as you wish; but ybulmust remember that we have only a
-	little more than 000 of them, and there-fiorev gospodin, you will not ask for 700
*	birds/* ** Good heavens, no! I only want f^ur or five at the outside," I exclaimed, astounded by the potency of the medicine I had prescribed. “Only five!" said the. Sergeant, “ then you can take off fifty rubles."
But the doctor wouldn’t take back any of his medicine, and eventually added another fifty, so the Sergeant got 200 rublhs and soon after left the service and ^started a pothouse In Moscow on the pro<®eds, while Dr. Joubert, after a rather hard time of it, finally.got his fugitives safe)y across the whole of Siberia and £Sus&a and met them beyond the German ficoirtier and later on in England.
“ Russia in devolution M is also a some-tfhat misleading titA, fof1 this book. For it: gives both more and less than the title would imply. Mr. Perris, an English writer who has turned out several previous books on Russian topics, and who knows Russia by having traveled in it, has relied : for the material used in this latent work, as he acknowledges in the preface, principally on Information furnished him by his Russian exile friends in London, men like the late Stepniak"and Col. Lavrov, Yolkhovsky, Tahaykovsky, and Dr. Soskice, as well as on the files of such Russian revolutionary publications as Free Russia and La Tribune Russe. In this way, too, he ’ has obtained photographs, &c., of most of ,thii Russian revolutionists of the last thirty .five years, which are reproduced In this booj . making a rather pathetic showing.
The earlier part o'f the book forms a sOrt of exposition of that curious jumble, the Russian governmental machine, and the exposition is none too clear. While Dr. Joubert holds the Czar personally responsible for all of the fearful misrule in his domains, Mr. Perris contends for the Czar's practical irresponsibility, he being ruled (as wefi as Russia) by an " oligarchy/' He calls attention too, to the fact that the present-day revolutionists of Russia despise the Czar as a mere too? and scorn to throw any more of their bombs at him, reserving their ammunition for *' oligarchs " like Plebve or the Grand Duke Sergius. However, here and there the author himself furnishes clear proof that the present autocrat is not a mere toot Thus, on Page 265 he gives, from an official report of Minister of Justice Muraviefl for 1894-1003, a full list of prosecutions, sentences, &c., for political offenses. From this list, as Muravieff himself points out, (though without comment either way,) it becomes plain that since the advent of Nicholas ir. to the throne cases of such prosecution " authorized by personal oracr of the Czar " have; increased from an annual 5G to £533, or 27 times; and these are the'^much-detested " administrative sentences " to exile In Siberia, &c., sentences,
that is,,inflictedJ wjuiutjariy; judicial': ^Protjess whatever,crften qhrthe/mercsl suspicion, -The' number;r of ^persons thus, " administratively punished!. ■'TbT'^pDlitical. offenses at the personal, instance-'oTthe Czar was 0,405 for 1003 alope. There is. much additional evidence of the same . kind in this book, tending to show that of the personal responsibility for the-outrageous misgovemment in Russia tfie present Czar bears his full share, a far larger share, even, than fell to the “score of cither his father, Alexander in., or his grandfather, the assassinated " Czar- I Liberator/* Alexander II.	*	'•	' 1 j
The book as a whole is a far saner and much more -informing one than that by J Dr. Joubert, but it suffers from the one serious defect of being based too largely,
, on the views of such extremists as Step-niak, Alexander Hertzen, and others. They, too,' have imbued the author with a number of their erroneous and unhistoric-al ideas. $uch, for example, is his contention that the mir, the Russian village communism, is a blessing;to the-muzhik and tbe nation, an advanced social condition; whereas* in reality, this vicious sys-1 tem of communal ownership is perhaps the greatest single hindrance, preventing the muzhik from rising to the level oft the Western peasantry. The mlr certainly is1 not, as he says, " an example of democratic rationalism even to the lands of the Reformation." That is one of the exploded fallacies of the earlier Russian radicals. Again, nothing could be further from the. truth than when he says: " The more enlightened [sic!] peasant is either an open non-conformist or conforms only outwardly and for convenience." An " enlightened " Russian peasant is at this writing a non-existent being, and their religious fanaticism Is still the main pillar on whch unprogressive Russian orthodoxy and the Holy Synod rely.
The chief value of this book, however, lies in the personal (and frequently pitiful) records and brief autobiographies of the martyrs in the cause of Russian political liberty, and also .Jn the miscellaneous data on topics which are not contained in Russian Government reports.
Thus he does away, once for all, with the lying pretense of the Russian Government that " Siberian exile has been abolished." He gives abundant proof of this falsehood from the Russian Government's own undisputed records. The exiles are to-dayr merely sent, thousands every year, to far remoter and Inhospitable districts of Siberia, regions like Kolymsk, and still further north, wfciere death soon releases the victims. But, of course, thousands of other exiles are also sent to Sakhalien, only that is even worse than Siberia. The chapters giving full details of the punitive system in vogue in that God-forsaken island are particularly instructive.
In the concluding chapter the author discusses the “ prospects of the Revolution." These he deems good, and believes that shortly, perhaps a few years hence, perhaps within a generation, but not Immediately,- at any rate, the revolution will be triumphant in Russia. He backs up his opinion with a formidable array of reasons, although he is altogether too well acquainted with Russia and the Russians to overlook a number of strong reasons telling in the other direction. Above all he has no hope that by whatever means a modification of the present autocracy is possible in such a way as to give Russia the blessings of freedom and an orderly l Government.
While “ The First Romanovs" professes to be an 'apology for this very autocracy, and of the part in it taken bjr"the ruling dynasty there, it is really some-| thing much better than that. It is a conscientious, weil-balanced history of that i, remarkable century which, step by step,
| loosened the bonds that held the Muscovites to the Orient pure and simple and taught them first to make a polite salaam to Western Europe. The whole story is well and interestingly told in fluent and often pictorial English; liberally strewed with those human touches we call anecdotes, and which, often as i not, first give us a sensible idea of f strange and far-away men and events.
I There are bits of clever character draw-j Ing, descriptions of curious customs and I manners that bring those early Musco-i vite savages quite close to us. In short,
‘ this last volume has the racy flavor t which Mr. Bain’s previous books on Rus! sla also had. Similarly he seems to have chosen his material with much diligence and greater care, very largely, indeed, from hitherto neglected sources—original documents in Russian, Polish, Dutch, Danish, German. With all his pains he has not, indeed, been able to tell us j, much that is new about cither Czar Michael, the first Romanoff; his son Alexius, or even Peter the Great; but we I see these personages quite generally j under a different light or from another ! angle. And that is quite natural. For the facts about the great Peter have i been brought out rather fully as to most of his doings, and about his two predecessors mere is not a great deal to tell.
It is in the atmosphere mostly that the Improvement over previous accounts has ; been made. .	■	-
Very interesting is the author’s account /of the curious duel between the Patriarch' Nikon and the father of Peter the Great,
"»JCor^yws ^had;’ "been- the intimate and'radbred iriend>'of" ‘the -pious v ruler; in - his letters to \ N ikon; ;th,e Czar used to. sign himself^ as " your-vJittle-j^inworthy brother," and Nikon he habitually referred to -as the " Great* .Shining Sun/’- He.causedNikon’s election afr Patriarch, and then there began ‘a slow ^devious fight between the two for supremacy. In encyclicals Nikon subscribed him-
■	self as " Great Gossiidar," a title hitherto reserved exclusively for the Czar hfmself, and that was what finally broke his neck. The Czar, faithful son of Mother Church'as he was,- finally wearied of the vaulting.arrogance of-the priest, and sent, him into, banishment to .a distant monastery.. There Nikon; after one’more des-. perate attempt to recover his position and-power, died. The proud priest at last was so humbled that'he frequently in his letters begged-the Czar for dainties, such as grapes, melons^ pears.
.This same Nikon was the reformer of the Russian Orthodox Church, causing thereby'the internal schism which has persisted to this day. ’ The great standard bearer, of the schismatics was a man still more remarkable than Nikon, the protopope Awakum. ‘ The main controversy between the "Old Believers" and the new wsf§ as to whether it was right to cross' themselves with two fingers or thr$e. Awakura and his partisans taught that to use three fingers for the purpose sent a person straight to hell, and for this doctrine the man himself finally went to the stake. Though extremely narrow and fanatical in his views, Avvakum enjoys the distinction of having first used the. Russian language as a literary vehicle, and his writings are even to-day held models of clearness, and to possess a quaint racial flavor.
What interests the average reader most, though, is the last half of the book, dealing with the reign of Peter, 1075-1725. In the main there Is nothing here upsetting older notions. That man of mystery -and. destiny stands before us much as we have been taught to regard him— half creative genius, half monster. But Mr. Bain tells a very succinct and intelligible story of those fifty years, and it is enlivened by many clever and characteristic Petr ’ne tales, and anecdotes.
Peter once took Peter Tolstoy, ancestor of the great writer of to-dayjocularly by the head, and with grim pleasantry said to him: " Oh, head, head, you would not have been on your shoulders now if you had not been so very, very clever! ” The autocrat referred to Tolstoy's one-time partisanship of Sophia, the Czar’s intriguing sister. This Tolstoy was a peculiar man, to say the least. While holdIng the post of the first regular Russian Ambassador in Stamboul he wrote in one of his letters to his master about the apostasy of some of his suite, and, instancing the case of his Secretary, the Greek Timotheus, coolly mentioned that he had sent him a cup qf‘ wine, ** whereupon he soon died, so God preserved him from, that calamity/’ And It was this same Tolstoy who subsequently kidnapped the. Czarevitch Alexius In Naples and brought him home to Russia to be tortured to death.	.	.
Speaking of the capture of NSteborg (subsequently renamed Schlusselburg) he wrote to his sister: " Truly a most evil nest, but, thank God, we have smashed it at last/-. And writing to his only loyal sister, Natalia, from the siege of Azov;
" I don’t get in the way of the bullets; it is the bullets that get in my way. You had better tell them to keep away."
" Am I not right in always drinking to the health of this enterprising fellow? " he wrote to Admiral Apraxine, speaking of one of the follies of Charles XII.
If his successor, the present Czar, had but listened .to Peter the Grea!t! Hearing of the large and prosperous settlement of the raskolniki (dissenters) in the province of Olonets, Peter inquired;
" What sort of traders are these dissenters? Are they honest and diligent? ’’J " Yes, gossudar, they are both honest and diligent.’* " Then let them believe what they'likel If it is impossible to convert them by argument, fire and sword will not do it."
Here are a couple of his pithy sayings, picked from autograph letters; " Time wasted is as irrevocable as death.” ** Far better foreign merit than one’s own rub-* bish."
The terrible story of Alexius, Peter’s only son and heir, who was knouted and tortured to death at the command of his own father on the mere suspicion of intriguing against him* is here set forth plainly, and on first-hand evidence, mostly the murderous father’s own statements.
