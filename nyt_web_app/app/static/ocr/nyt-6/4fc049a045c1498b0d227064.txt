Lady, Peterborough, to be sure, is! the manoeuvring dowager again, but she dif- | fers from the -type. She has a goddaughter, too, instead of her own daughter, to dispose of..She does.not favorably consider the possibility of Katherine’s morganatic marriage with a royal personage until after-Katherine's own folly has caused a great deal of chatter. Moreover, when she learns actually how evil the royal personage can be, she bravely saves Katherine from disaster, and dies without so much as boasting of her deed. A kindly, worldly, disillusionized old woman is Lady Peterborough, contemptuous of the proud poor and of all the low-born, but with traits that distinguish her from others of her kind in fiction. Her gentle, i missal-hunting husband is a less effective figure; so are the opium-eating Captain, tbe young guardsman, the clgarette-smok-Ing matron. All of these, with the servants and trained nurses, are well enough sketched, and the royal personage himself, a German Prince, with the perfection of bad manners and without a scrap of morality, is a rather pleasing figure, especially as he is doomed to disappointment, as the Impressible reader desires him to be from the first.	8

Katherine Dereham, the heroine, and the ogre doctor, Garth Vincent, however, concentrate most of the reader’s attention. Katherine is a beautiful girl, who falls desperately in love with a. Prince, who cannot marry her, (until long after she wants to marry him,) and wastes much of her youth in a harmful thralldom to a fancy. After her escape from her passion for tlie Prince, burdened with a serious Illness, she becomes the thrall of the ogre doctor, described as " the man with the dark lantern face.” She had briefly flirted with this man years before and then snubbed him. For whatever suffering she may have caused him he
