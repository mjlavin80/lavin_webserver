'Among the memorable pieces of French literature produced on this continent, two of the most Important are the “ Me-molres ” and “ Les Anciens Canadlens '* of Philippe Aubert de Gasp£, Seigneur du St Jean-Port-Joli, lhe latter written in 1S61, at the age of seventy-fiver the former occupying his leisure for the nest fo,ur years. Growing up -among those whose hearts and minds were full of memories of New France, he could describe not only tlie sufferings of all classes at the time of the conquest, but also the manners and customs of an earlier day, and thus he could make his books, as he said in the preface of his novel, " Canadian through and through." The English title given by Mr. C. G. D. Roberts to his translation of this book is ** Cameron of Lochiel,*’ the name and style of the Scottish hero. Exiled Immediately after his father's death at Cullo-den, and reared in the family of a French seigneur, this yonth sees and hears the Canadians of that time, and those of former days are shown to him in stories ingeniously introduced, and his own adventures suffice for the rest. It must be owned that he is a very French Scot, but excess of chivalry is not a bad fault. The fortunes of one of the characters reflect those of the author, who thus Intertwined his history with that of his beloved Canada.
Mr. Roberts's new book for the holidays la to be called “ The Story of Red Fox,*' and will afford a new opportunity to contrast his methods with those of Mr. Thompson and Mr. Kipling, for he describes a fox's life from babyhood to the day when he triumphs over all the devices of dogs and men. The fifty illustrations and the cover design will be the work of. Mr. C. L. Bull, and both of these books will bear the Imprint of Messrs. L.
C.	Page & Co., Mr. Roberts'o American publishers.	_

The American-Peace Society is-sending out a circular devised with much of the >■ wisdom of lhe serpent to secure the attendance of Americans at the fourteenth International Peace Congress, to open at Lucerne Sept. 10. The attractions of the . place and’the activity of the Swiss advocates of peace in preparing for visitors are duly set forth, and it is urged that if Europe sent 100 delegates to the Boston Congress of 1904, the United States, with r a territory as large as all Europe except Russia, should seiid at least that number to Lucerne. The congress will probably discuss the reduction of military and naval forces and the establishment of a ' stated international congress for the con-side&a&on of all international matters, a species of parliament of man. As usual, the circular comes from the indefatigable iftr. E. C. Ginn,
