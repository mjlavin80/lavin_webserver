E.	W. Naylor, Mus. D., author of " Shakespeare and Music.” &c,t organist and lecturer of Emmanuel Colley. Cambridge, England, in his " critical essay ’* on the contents of the Virginal Book In the FItzwilUam Museum at Cambridge. “An Elizabethan Virginal Book," gives a careful study of nearly 300 pieoes of the Tudor period which are almost entirely unknown. The contents of the book are 1H0 dances, 17 organ pieces, 4G arrangements 6f forty different songs, 9 arrangements of madrigals, 22 fantasias or ricercare by nine^composers, 7 fancy pieces, descriptive or otherwise, by four composers, 19 preludes by six writers, including 6 by anonymous composers, and
6	exercises on the hexachord by 4 different authors. " It is not going too far to say," writes Mr. Naylor. " that if all other remains of the period were destroyed It would be possible to rewrite the history of music from 1550 to 1G20 on the material which we have in the Fitz-william book alone." In his chapter on the “ Fitzwilliam Virginal Book as a historical document," he writes:
The collection is most interesting to the student of musical history, containing, as it '"does, so many examples of every kind of music that was current during the Tudor period in England. Wo have here nearly 300 pieces of music by over thirty composers of that period. Thus the collection is more correctly regarded as a library than as a mere book, for it contains more direct evidence of the musical practice of the Tudor times than most of us' have of the music of our own century, as any reader may prove to himself by honestly enumerating the composers of the nineteenth century whose names he knows, and such of their works as he can call to his mind.
Illustrations consist of musical selections from the different pieces for the different Instruments strictly contemporary with Shakespearean times. The frontispiece Is colored, and shows Queen Elizabeth’s virginal. E. P. Dutton & Co. are the American publishers.
