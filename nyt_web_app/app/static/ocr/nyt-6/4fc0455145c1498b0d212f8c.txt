■	is no problem—there is nobody to complain t about or complain to. For' the .agnostic there Is also none; he must give it up. But if we believe In God, then’ " somehow, somewhere, sezne-when, things must be tight. That Is what believing v in God means.” * Or. Savhge’s discussion takes him back to the answers to the question that have been given in the pastfr There was the old Hebrew idea:	"The Lrord
knowcth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish/* The Psalmist has not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread;,and the story of Job Is an extended showing that this is the principle that In the end prevails. Dr. Ravage, however, makes short work of it: look around us, he says, and see that it is not so.
The theological answer of Paul and those who follow him refers it all to the fall of ‘Adam: but this must be put aside as an answer, for it is hideously unjust and immoral- A God chastens his children with suffering: but such a conception in, ter feres with any clear or rational or moral account of things. There is moral universe, an orderly universe, and all that happens in it is the result of a preceding cause. "We know that the universe is in a process of evolution; that things are not i finished, that they are only in process. Hence we have no right to pronounce judgment on this scheme of human life, with the sorrow and trouble it Contains In apparently Ill-balanced distribution, until we are Sure it'is rinished. We have a right to trust faithfully the wisdom and the love Of God in the working of this perfectly ordered universe in which we have found ourselves, and we haVe no right to pronounce judgment here until we are sure it is complete.
The fact that we criticise, we question,
I we want things explained. Implies that there is a reason somewhere, and that : thfngs are capable of explanation, if only : we were wise enough for the task. If God exists, If there is wisdom and love ;
1 in the universe dominant over all that I we call physical, then that carries with I It the absolute assurance that there is an outcome which shall Justify the process I through which we are passing; We have no claim on the universe for any definite amount of beauty or power, of brilliancy^ or happiness or anything else. What we have was an outright bestowal, and we have no-rlghtf'to complain because more has been given to another. How much pain In the world is chargeable, not against God, but against our own disobedience of the laws of God? The fact that Our lives ar£ Incomplete, that our ideals are unattained, means that the world is unfolding, and that the forces of creation are as fresh to-day as on any Imagined morning when the morning stars sans together. There is no such thing as essential evil, or evil as a thing, in the world; there is mothing in map that Is essentially wrong. Evil is a process, a phage of development; It ccaseB I to be one of life's dark problems if we ; regard it so, and because perfectly consistent with a loving trust in the wisdom and goodness of God	.
Such are tho conclusions at which Dr. Eavage arrives from the general assumptions he makes In the beginning. It is no very deep reasoning that he applies in arriving at them. His premises have nothing in common with those upon whloh the orthodox foundations have been built. The theological subtleties o* other times are not for him. It may be that weak-| cess in the chain of his logic might be i found more easily^ than In the links forged in the older school. He seeks for 1 nothing beyond human experience and 1 liyman ^reasoning in support of' h5s he- , liefs,.'but he is led irresistibly toward con- .
