Eight Maids of Arcady.'
{OLE!. By Robert vv_ Chambers*’ 12nio. TI— lustrated. New York; D. Appleton Sc. Co. $1.25.
" Art," said the poet, opening his heavy lids with a large, sweet smile, "Art 19 above Art,-* but Art Is never below Art. Art. to be Art, must be artless. That Is a very precious thought—very, very precious. Thank you'for understanding me— thank you."
And the poet -himself, continually plucking atoms and molecules from the atmosphere, examining and gently releasing them from hfs large, soft, fat, white fingers, was seemingly artless to the ex-tremest degree of art. He sought to get near to nature, and so established for himself a little workshop which he called Rose Cross.	1	*
The station master thu3 described the place to Mr. Briggs, who came down to foreclose a mortgage on the poet’s property:
He set up his shop and hired bookbinders from York. Then he set up another shop and hired some of us ’round here to go and make them big slabby art-chairs. All his shops were called .“At the Sign of ** something *r other. Bales of vellum arrived for to bind little dinky books; art • rocking chairs were shipped out of here by the carload. Meanwhile Guilford (the poet) he done poetry on the side and run a magazine. *	*	* Well,
Sir, the whole thing bust. •	•	* I
guess the public .kinder siekened o’ them art rockers and dinky books without much printin' into >them. Guilford he stuck to it noble, but the shops closed one by one.	*
But the poet continued to live near -to Nature.- He raised his eight blooming daughters in ignorance of conventions and customs. He taught them to roam about the fields in pink pajamas and sunbonnets. with their golden hair looped up In beautiful disorder, and these guile-* less maidens, fresh as sea nymphs, clean limbed, fair, young, and spirited, plucked daisies, or gathered strawberries or mingled their breath with that of the wild rose; they jested playfully with each other in Greek or Arabic, (Guilford was a ** corker on culture **) and they played the harp and the piano and the organ and the violin and other Instruments. And as for tennis and chess I No man could beat (hem. And tiieir names and ages were Chlorippe, twelve; Philodice, thirteen; Dione, fourteen; Aphrodite, fifteen; Cybele, sixteen; Lissa, seventeen; Iole, eighteen, and Vanessa, nineteen.
" No wonder poor Brings found it impossible to foreclose the mortgage, and when George Wayne, “ a turtle-fed, claret-flushed. Idle, and rich young man,” In whose favor the mortgage was to be foreclosed, came up to personally conduct his affairs in face of Briggs’s mutiny, (Briggs had already fixed his fancy on Vanessa, nineteen,) he suddenly found himself powerless before the saccharine sweetness of the poet and the alluring loveliness of Iole, eighteen. He quite forgot the mortgage foreclosure, and under the numbing influence of Guilford’s cloying smile he could remember nothing but the witchery of Iole's lovely simplicity. So completely did he lose his equilibrium that one evening in his den, where Guilford carried out his Idea of the beauty of simplicity—" a single blossom against a background ot nothing at all ’’—the poet destroyed, with his fat, white fingers. the complex mortgage papers, and, at the same time, Briggs arid Wayne became the infatuated husbands of Vanessa, nineteen, and Iole, eighteen.
After that the other six goddesses discarded their pajamas and sunbonnets and came to the city to live with Iole In Wayne’s large and commodious house. The poet as an exponent of " L’arr Noovo ’’ took once more to the creation of | dinky books and slab furniture patched with stain-glass windows. His lovely daughters no longer roamed at will through Elysian fields. But he was the thoughtful parent still. In spite of the fact that his plans were slightly frustrated, Lissa. seventeen, and Cybele, sixteen, made very good matches.
However, It was left for Aphrodite, fifteen, to look out for herself; Aphrodite, whose young soul chafed at the soft lights and graceful imes of " L’arr Noovo, " who panted for fresh air and the broad sweep of natural things, and who
alone and unaided found " that most honorable miracle, that sane and wholesome wonder," thiCt trinity! Lover, artist, man!
After reading the story Mr. Chambers's preface becomes quite clear.
