William C. Doub, ex-Superlntendent of Schools for Ivem County, California, author ot ** lSducatiooal Questions,” '* Topical Discussion of Geography,” '* Pupil’s Outline or American History,” &c., has compiled ar^^History of tlie United States.’* It Is believed that it will supply a. Ionf?-feJt want to tho teachers of history and civics. The author points out that he ha a used the topical treatment without any reserve whatever. The history of the United States Is divided into its natural periods, and the discussion of every topic in each period is continuous and complete. Special attention has been paid to the different sets of ques~ tions, and to the arrangement of topics. Mr. Doub has so arrangrcd his book as to make separate text books on civics unnecessary. This subject has been made a real part o£ the history work. Besides treating carefully of the institution of government he has also- dealt with ini dust rial and social conditions, religion,
: and education. The book is up to dale, and contains portraits, scenes of te.ttles,
views* fac similes of documents, &o_, be-I sides many maps in colors. There are : no foot notes. The Macmillan Company j is about to publish -the history.
