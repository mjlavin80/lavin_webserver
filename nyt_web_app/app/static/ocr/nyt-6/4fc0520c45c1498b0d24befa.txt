New York Times Booh Ucvicio:
In her otherwise very excellent story, “ The Breath of the Gods/’ why doe3 Sidney McCall introduce such impossible characters as Mr. and Mrs. Cyrus C. Todd and Mrs. Stunt? She has caught the very bmath of the Japanese spirit, so far, at least, as we can yet pomprehend it! And to do this she must have a fine discrimination. Then why the uncultivated Todds? If we send such crude specimens to represent America, since when have we done so? The story is of even date, and such calumny as accusing our present Ambassadors of such total lack of manners and breeding is almost malicious. Besides tills falsifying as to the facts, the Todds are a discord iri the harmony of the book. They certainly Injure it, as all untruth injures.
