A reviewer of The London Times raises a curious question in his remarks on Mrs. Russell Barrington's newly published “ Reminiscences of G. F. Watts," which is a book, it seems; of positive value, as it contains new information about Watts’s methods of painting, his experiments with pigments, his

fondness for old brushes and the like. Mrs. Barrington tells how Watts contrived to get a bloom of atmosphere ” Into his pictures, and how he frequently spoiled good work by not letting 'well enough alone. She also reveals some facts of Importance to collectors regarding copies of some of Watts’s works made by his assistant, Cecil Schott— facts which have already set the reviewers wondering. Wherefore, Mrs. Russell Barrington's book, which contains, also, a great deal of agreeable gossip, and is the result of a long acquaintance between the painter and the author's family, seems to be one well worth writing. But the reviewer of The London Times is puzzled to decide, in his own excellent mind, whether Mrs. Russell Barrington should not have handed over her notes to • the authorized biographer who has been deputed by Mrs. Watts to write the life of her husband. This, It seems to us, Is a point in literary ethics almost too fine and shadowy for consideration. Doubtless many unauthorized biographies are shallow, valueless things and soon forgotten. Doubtless the “ authorized biography," even when Itls a bit heavy, deserves the distinction generally accorded It. But, in this case, with a vast mass of material to select from, the authorized biographer could scarcely have ( been expected to look at Mrs. Barrington's notes from her own Interesting point of view, and to incorporate all of them in his book. There seems to be plenty of room for her book, for which we bespeak a cordial welcome when it is published In America.
