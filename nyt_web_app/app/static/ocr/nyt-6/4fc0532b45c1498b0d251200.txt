Probably. thie most remarkable biography of one’s brother-in-law Is that by Anthony Hamilton, son of Sir George Hamilton, containing “ The Memoirs of Count Grammont,” who married the author’s sister, Elizabeth. The best edition of this famous book has come down to us with many .fine illustrations by C. Delort and edited by Sir Walter Scott, who supplied- the notes; A cheap but excellent reprint of this edition is now to appear in this country through E. P, Dutton & Co. It will include a portrait of Anthony Hamilton, and eleven other etchings by ' L. Bolsson, after the original designs, by Delort. In tlie biographical sketch of Hamilton the writer speaks as follows of the present volume:
The History of Grammont (the name is Spelled thus “ for uniformity’s salte,” the spelling,of'Hamilton being followed,) may be considered as unique; there is nothing like it in arty: language. 'For drollery, knowledge -o£_ the world, various satire, general- utility;."unlted with great vivacity of composition,'Gil Bias is unrivaled; but.; as a.merely agreeable book,-the Ue-moips of Grammont: perhaps deserve, that character more'than any which wafe ever written; it is ...pleasantry throughout, and pleasantry, of?. the^'best sort, unforced, graceful,-.and- engaging^ Some French critic . has * jystIyi:obsei*ved->that, if any book were, to be' rselectetl-as. frffording the truest spefclmen. of'^perfect French gayety,
“ The -Meindivs ;of Grammont ” would be selected in'preference to'All others. .
As Scott relates, the adventures of the Count, as recorded by Hamilton, were related by the.’fornier to the latter.. who, however, is Tesponsibie for' the referfemfes to the dain^a&the:Court: of-'Ghaxl^ t£.
