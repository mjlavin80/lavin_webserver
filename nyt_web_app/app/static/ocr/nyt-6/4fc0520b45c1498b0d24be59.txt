In the City of Tyre, in the reign of that Hiram whose name is mentioned In Hory Writ with that of David, the Psalmist, many wonderful things no doubt came to pass. The present author has imagined some lurid characters for that setting, and made a cruel tune for them to dance to. By his invention Merodach is an Assyrian, a descendant of Kings, who, when he has been cast down from his height as Captain of horse in the Assyrian Army, remains in Tyre for the sake of u slave girl^of the Jews called Miriam. Alirinm, it appears, is the cousin of David, (not yet King In Judah,) but there is a beautiful siren of the Phoenicians, Miriam’s mistress, who takes a fancy to Merodach, and with feline charms ensnares him. The lady has a neat way with a dagger—she throws her soft white arms about the neck of her victim, creeps with her roseleaf, caressing hands to his throat, or heart, and drives home the knife with a smile and a will_even as her beautiful lips cling to his. That Sybarite end comes very near being the fate of Merodach, the Assyrian, but he Is f. stark man and of godlike beauty, an£ the lady hasn’t the nerve to slay him.
The story tells of wild orgies In honor of Baal and Ashtoreth. of mothers dancing about a' mechanical Moloch Into whose red-hot brazen throat the priests feed their children, of men who rend their own flesh In frenzy, and maids who tear off their garments to clothe these bleeding fantastics. However, the author avoids some of the more suggestive details in the scene. At such a festival Merodach goes dancing along with the daggerlsh siren until they meet Miriam, and the reproach of her eyes brings the Assyrian to his senses. Him, then, Hiram the King sends away beyond the pillars (later called of Hercules) to discover the route to Britain. the land of tin. Upon that Journey Merodach suffers hardships and adventures. Naturally the eiren, left behind in Tyre, burns with love and Jealousy, and locks Miriam up in a. living tomb. You may r^ad of the dreadful things which happened when the hero returned, how with his well-drilled men he mowed down a mob of Tyrians, and how the great-brazen Moloch got a new victim—one who walked with Satanic pride Into the god’3 red-hot arms rather than face the scorn of men.
It Is the kind of story .which is intended to produce excitement of & rather unwholesome character; This one has isome effective scenes, with long wastes of dull-| ness.	s
