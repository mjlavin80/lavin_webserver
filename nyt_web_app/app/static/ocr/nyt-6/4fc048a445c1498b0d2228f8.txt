Mr. George Waldo Browne has produced ! a book of the obvious In his “ St. Lawrence River, Historical, Legendary, Picturesque.” Everything that any one could find for himself is in it, but little else;
! the regular pictures, the usual and timeworn stories, are trotted out and paraded on heavy paper for our delectation. We admit, however, that we find no mention of Maria Monk, the patron saint of the St. Lawrence steamboats; and we are glad that Mr. Browne left her out. As lie has put in so many other usual things the omission must be deliberate.	i
It seems evident that Mi*. Browne was writing (or collecting) against space; for his book is largely padding. He begins with a chnpter entitled " From Lake to Gulf," in which, he carries the reader from Lake Ontario to Quebec, not to the Gulf really. He moralizes a little on the value of rivers, and we can commend the first three and the last paragraphs of thla chapter to any schoolboy writing a composition on " rivers.” After this come thirteen other chapters devoted to the history of Lower Canada, and then Mr. Browne drags the reader up against the current, not from the Gulf, but from Tadousac. It is plainly evident that his knowledge is that of a guide book tourist, who stays an hour or two at Tadousac. M does ” the Saguenay, and shoots the rapids at Lachine. Why does he start his upward trip at Tadousac? Evidently because he has never been below Tadousac, and the other guide books practically start there.
The regular time-dishonored appreciations ” of the "mysterious” Saguenay are warmed up. It is about tfme that even the guide books dug up something new about that guiltless stream, or. .at all, events, threw out what they have about it. A river on which steamboats, steam yachts, possibly autoboats, cruise all Summer, can hardly be called mysterious. People would appreciate the beauties of the Saguenay much more If i they were not told that it was ** mysterious," “ terrible," ** gloomy/’ •* awful.”
Mr. Browne’s knowledge of the river is purely superficial. He gives a wrong name to at least one high hill at Murray Bay; he knows nothing of the exist-fng seigneuries along the river, the lords of which still possess in theory the right of administering the " high, middle, and low justice”; he does not know that at Malbale, for example, American prisoners of war were interned during the Revolution—or was it in the war of 1S12? We are not writing a guide book; If we were we should verify our dates. Why does he not show a picture of Bale St. Paul* most curious landing in America, with its lighthouse, to which the steamer makes fast; its ferryboat to shore; Its row of caieches drawn up two miles away along;
the water's edge; Its church spires and house roofs a mile further inland? We begia to doubt if Mr. Browne, .has been on the St. Lawrence, except to cross it by the Victoria Bridge. Biit he has been elsewhere, as he tells U3 nonchalantly:
" Cape Diamond, which, by tho ' way, somewhat reminds us of anotherpromon-tory by that name in Thld-Paclfic,” la what he says' of Cap Diamond, Quebec. Wo wonder If he enjoyed his voyage. On the south shore opposite , Quebec is a house, said to be the oldest civilized building in America, dating from 1607 or thereabout. If we should make a guide book of the St; 'Lawrence we would note such a building as that, but it was not' obvious enough to Mr. Browne’s predecessors in~ making guide books to Canada.
Of course, .in a book of 305 pages there are some good things; the index; for example, so far as it goes, is one iof-them.
