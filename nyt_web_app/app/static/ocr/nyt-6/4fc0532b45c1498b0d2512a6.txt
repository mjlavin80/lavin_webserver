Xc'-c York Times Book Review:
Both your editorial and tlie letter by Mr. Clow about the decline oC poetry have interested' me a great deal. You arc right that we will not got poets by crying for them. We had better profit by the good, natural work of to-day, and be sure that when we need poets wc will have enough. We will then be the poets j ourselves. If wc spend our time raising I hothouse roses all Winter we are likely to miss some ot the freshness of the 1 snow.
! No one can point to any man of to-day and call him a great poet. Some of us may write • very good sugar-candy and wedding-cake verses; but none of us is loved ljy a nation, as a great poot must be, or waited for to speak a new message I and a promise, to bring bread and meat for the spirit.
I do not believe that poetry has been replaced by " trolley cars and breakfast foods.” Yet there is the stern and sug-, gestive fact that trolley cars and break* j fast foods, automobiles and steam on-ginos, ships full of huddled immigrants,
I Western prairies, monstrous haying ma-chinos, and skyscrapers that swallow hun-drrris of lives In the building are not j subjects that can live in a Clot hie structure of verses. They will break through | and crush it. Whatever will express our modern life, our troiley cars, and breakfast foods, that wr must write. Our literature is so unsettled, we arc all watching with intense Interest to see what shape the chaos will take. The publishers are like a Vesuvius that pours burning lava in all directions, and U. is not till the streams have cooled that we can tell which is the deepest, widest flow. When Dryden and Pope tried to regenerate poetry they probably did not sus-pcct that they were molding the prose of the future. Who can tell what future poetry we to-day prepare?
We all love to be prophets, more or less. Though so many novels and short stories are published, they are not the grQAtest, even of their Kind. Something else must follow. Already there is a reaction, and the best people read fewer and fewer stories. Our life is too intense and large, too full of numberless complicated dramas, for us to care for the thin current of a modern novel. Wc want something freer than poetic forms can contain, something larger than the narrative. Whatever it is, we will get it. From the past comes the voice of Walt Whitman, not as a poet, but as a thinker and seer, prophesying by his poetry what our future prose must be. He is the root, I believe, cf whatever great Individual and American literature we are to have, and though the root may not be lovely! the flowers and fruitage, however changed, will 'remain true to the same law. We must have a literature a noble and serious literature, that can embody and glorify the street car and the automobile, the great crowds, the evolution of races, and the headstrong, unrellgious faith of a new people. That which is to be great to-day and forever must be a sincere, free, and earnest expression in prose, poetry, or jargon, of the warm'lire we are living to-day.
