gpHE AMERICAN HUMORBT.
’@We have been surprised this week, ^/rather agreeably than otherwise, by J^the assertion in The Book Buyer* a ^periodical published by the house of
:: ^cribTiert that Mr. Oliver Herford is
: '.v- ^	.
r‘^the humorist of the day.” We had ■f lotig' suspected that Mr. Herford was a “.humorist of the day*” but had not •'' been prepared, to believe that humor of a quality 80 fanciful and delicate as yhis would appeal to a sufficiently large number of persons to entitle him to so
-	..great a distinction. That the represen-
tative American humorist should be ^typically American, like Mark Twain, who by the way Is still at work occa-. .
v sionally in- the field of humor, though he has grown overserious of late, and 1 . Artemus Ward, seems indisputable, and " we have never thought of Mr. Herford, who is English by birth, and half Bos-toman by training, as an American in : ■r the sense In which Mr. George Ade,
•	I
for instance, is American. We confess, however, to a decided preference
-	for Mr. Herford’s style of humor. The author of ** The Bashful Earthquake ”
v and “ The Rubaiyat of a Persian Kit-_ ten ” is certainly a man of parts, and if not quite worthy, as Mr. Andrew Lang lately suggested, to have his name associated in letters with that of Edward FitzGerald, (Mr. Lang- likes that Persian kitten very much, and does not mind a dash of hyperbole,) is, nevertheless, both useful and ornamental in the literary world.
But his title to the first place among contemporary humorists, leaving Mark Twain out of the question, has not been established. What of Finley Peter Dunne and the author of “ The Idiot at the Breakfast Table ”? Is John Kendrick Bas.gs to be pushed aside thus Inconsiderately?
Yet The Book Buyer reminds us that so competent an appraiser of American humor as Col. George Harvey, in a recent address to graduates of Vassar, solemnly expressed the thought that “ Oliver Herford is about our only humorist." Josephine Daskam, however, was a Smith College girl. Yet we should like to ask Col. Harvey if he really thinks the humor of Oliver Herford is richer or more profitable or more distinctively American than that of Mrs. Bacon or that of Carolyn Wells ? And why did Col. Harvey ignore the considerable claims to a first place in American humor of the author of " The House Boat on the Styx,*’ one of his predecessors as editor of Harper’s Weekly, and the writer also of a rich series of comic books which the firm of “Harper & Brothers was glad to publish. We have an idea that the comic sayings of Mr. Bangs are better understood by the multitude, and therefore better liked, than the more elusive and perhaps more piquant drolleries of Mr. Herford. While we hold no brief for the editor of Puck, it does not seem fair to thus award supremacy in the field of current American humor without something of a formal and duly advertised round-up. There must be a consensus of opinion in this | matter. There always is a workable consensus, if you will only take the ^ trouble to look for it, and we are will- i ing to give space and time to a gen- ; era! consideration of this subject, if ^ Jour . riders r will	*.we.
