Miss Vida D. Scudder, Associate Professor of English Literature at Wellesley College, and author of '* An Introduction to the Study of English Literature,” "The Witness of Denial," The Life of the Spirit in the Modern English Poets,” &c., has translated the letters of St. Catherine of Siena. The volume, which will shortly be published by E. P. Dutton & Co., in this"country, is also supplied with an introduction by Miss Scudder, in the course of which she writes:
Catherine Benincasa was probably the most remarkable woman of the fourteenth century, and her letters are the precious personal record of her inner life as of her outer life. With all their transparent simplicity and mediaeval quaintness, with all the occasional plebeian crudity of their phrasing. they veveal a nature at once so many sided and so exalted that the sensitive reader can hut echo the judgment of her countrymen, who see in the dyer’s daughter of Siena one of the most significant authors of a great age. * * * Some of her letters, indeed, are elaborate religious or political treatises, and seem at first sight to have little personal coloring. * * * The society of the fourteenth century passes in review as we turn the pages,
St. Catherine was the daughter of a
dyer who lived near the Fonte-Brancha
at Siena., From her eighth year on she
led a religious life. Her refusal to marry
j caused her many physical sufferings
through her parents, which ended when
| her father saw her at prayer with a white
dove on her hair, of which she seemed to
! be unconscious. She assumed the habit of the Dominican Order, imt was not a professed nuxi. She committed numerous miracles, had* a great many visions, and did much for the poor. Her fame spread to Milan and Naples, and she became known as La Santa. She dictated the peace terms between Florence and Pope Gregory XI., was the friend of his harsh successor, Urban VI., and knew many other celebrities of the time, in ail walks of life.
