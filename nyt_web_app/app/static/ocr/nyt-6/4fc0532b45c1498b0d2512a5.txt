GHOSTS AND ROSES.
THE HOUSE OP CARDS. A Record. By Jol.n He!gh. 12mo. New York:	The	Macmillan Company. $1.00,	'
This story Is supposed to have been written by one John Heigh, a garrulous bachelor, sometime Major in tbe late civil war, friend, admirer, and critic of Xjinsey Cards, and a stanch supporter of high ideals and civic purity. The tale he tells, now in the form of a diary of happenings and events of some forty years ago, now running into the present time, and again dipping on into the future with Its hint of prophecy Is one of interest in spite of, or perhaps because of, that very streak of garrulity which gives it a certain human flavor. One realizes that John Heigh is no fool; one feels for him In his uncertain position between a desire to justify the new school and its ethical code even while he Is unable to br<y^k loose from the old. Who JcQm Heigh really is, after all, matters very little, since cleariy the story’s the thing.
Unsey Cards, financier and many times millionaire, has built his house on the honored corpses of many of these fine traditions. Yet Linsey Cards Is a gentleman highly respected, fair In his dealings, honest and gracious. The blackness of political barter, the ugliness of certain existing evils, are things to which he finds it not only useful but wise to shut his eyes. It was as Mr. Malstren the railroad magnate, put it—the old theory of roses and manure.
We talk about the roses in polite conversation; we don’t talk about the i manure.. Personally I don't investigate j the manure; I pay for it and my men I buy it. The roses won't grow without it.
, It costs a great deal. In the early Spring | it makes a bad’smell—Isn’t at all pleasant for a while; but at last we have the roses. At college you call that an allegory. Try to raise your roses Without - a fertilizer— if you like; run your business without regarding politics—if you like. Then see where you come out.
And this to young Waltham Eliot, fresh from law school, eager for high reform and clean politics! Waltham Eliot was the nephew oi that other Waltham Eliot, also of Boston, something of a young prig in his youth, but all of a man when the crisis of war tore at the heart of the Nation.	'
And_<£uaintly mixing the affairs of this young reformer with those of his dead uncle—one of the ghosts that haunt the high house of Cards—contrasting the times I as he goes, telling a love story of the old days, hinting at one of the present, suggesting rather than drawing the characters of the actors in his little romance, John Heigh has performed his task well.
There was, for instance, Kriemhild Cards the cider, beautiful and stately, for all her white hair and quiet manner. She it was who as young Kriemhild West held in the hollow of her small hand the hearts of the four men—boys then—most interested in th? working out of the story—Walt-ham Eliot, Linsey Cards, George Clayton, and John Heigh himself. It was because ’ of her that Eliot and Heigh arranged their historic duel, which might have terminated badly but for Cards’s prompt publicity of the secret. For her, too, Cards tracked and hounded to death George Clayton, be-eause In tho fortunes of war his had been the hand raised against Eliot Waltham, Kriemhild’s husband of a day.
