THE S T O R_ Y OF ART.
With the steady and even in some quarters rapid extension of instruction in art in our country, the question of a relatively succinct and well-proportioned history of art becomes constantly more interesting. It is hardly less so to the amateur—in the old, the etymologic, sense—to the student who desires, with no hope of attaining a mastery of the difficult subject, to acquire a reasonably intelligent notion of the evolution of art in its different branches and throughout its long existence. To these latter especially the use of the more elaborate histories is difficult on account of the time required, and, still more, on account of the labor of comparison and adjustment which is left to his too often vain efforts. He a$Jcs for a conveniently brief history which will help him to understand with a fair degree of accuracy the continuity and dependence of the successive periods i: art and to classify with general correctness the works with which he can make himself familiar by inspection or by the study of reproductions now so accessible.
It is precisely this sort of a history of art that M. Salomon Reinach undertook a couple of years since in a course of twenty-five lectures at the School of the Louvre. These have been published by the house of Hachette & Cie., Paris, under the fortunate title “ Apollo,’* " a pendant,” says the author, " to * Minerva,’ an introduction to the Greek ; and Latin classics, published in 1889.” An English translation by Florence Simmonds, with a few additions approved by M. Reinach, is published by j Charles Scribner’s Sons, under the title of ** The Story of Art Throughout the Ages, an Illustrated Record.” The original and the translation have each some GOO illustrations, chiefly half-tom reproductions, of unequal interest and value, but especially useful in the illustration of the work of the earlier and more simple periods. Though those who can enjoy it should not miss the charm of M. Reinach’s singularly clear and delicate style in French, the translation is unusually careful and successful, and '■’’the reader of it loses nothing of the practiral utility of the work. *
The distinguishing trait of M. Reinach is h.5s combination of poise and alertness. He is not a partisan, and especially, with a rare gift of generalization, he is not a partisan of his own theories. He is naturally and constant-
ly alive to the-existence, the; necessary existence, of change and/ generally, of progress. To* ah allusion to ; Phidias’ .. whose glory it wastobe" the highest: expression of the tradition ot his time,”
" as the genius - of Raphael was the most complete expression of the Renaissance,” fie adds;'“The evolution of art is never finished; to speak of the perfection of art Is a dangerous error, since it condemns it logically forever to reproduce the**same models, to~glve up progress. Much rather Is it the function of artists of genius to prepare the way for new tendencies by giving a form adequate and definitive to those of their own time.** And the purpose of M. Reinach is to examine the ten-%
dencies of each period and each region, and so far as possible to trace the effect of each upon the succeeding period, the adjacent region. The, element of time is always present In his mind, and by reference to it he weaves the chain, that bind's his work in a fascinating unity. How long the chain Is Is indicated by the fact that the first of the illustrations in the French edition is the reproduction of an engraved bone from a I>ordogne cavern, the last is a reproduction of St. Gaudens’s exquisite and noble memorial to Mrs. Henry Adams in the cemetery of ‘Washington.
Combined with the talent for grouping and connecting, in a word, for synthesis, M. Reinach has an unusual gift for apt and sententious characterization which must have contributed

largely to the charm of his lectures" for audiences reported to have been large and enthusiastic, and, curiously, composed in great part of women. It is not easy to imagine a more delightful or a more profitable occupation than attendance on these lectures, with such a rich and varied collection of examples of the works discussed near at hand for actual study. What, for instance, could be more interesting than to pass from the lecture room to the Salon Carrfi, In the Louvre, to reflect in the presence of the masterpiece, on the following passage relating to the Venus of Milo?
While the majority of archaeologists to-day date this statue about 100 B. C.,
I am convinced that it is nearly three centuries older; I even believe that it represents not Venus, but the Goddess of the Sea, Amphitrite, holding a trident in her extended left arm. and that it is a. masterpiece of the school of Phidias. For one reason, it discloses all that makes the genius of Phidias and nothing foreign to it. The Venus of Milo is not elegant, or dreamy, or impassioned: she is strong and serene. Her beauty is fashioned of noble simplicity and calm dignity, as is that of the Parthenon and its sculptures. Is it not for this that she became and remains so popular, despite the much-discussed mystery 6f her attitude? Troubled and fevered generations see in her the highest expression of the quality they most lack, the serenity which is not apathetic indifference, but health of body and . health of mind.
It may be added that M. Reinach has supplied an admirable and full bibliography at the close of each lecture which will enable a student to carry his reading as far as he may choose.
