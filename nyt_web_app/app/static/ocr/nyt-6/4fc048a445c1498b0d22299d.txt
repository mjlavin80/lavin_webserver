ifE Rev. Napier Malcolm has written & very interesting book descriptive of a certain part of Persia. He declares that it is not a book of tiav-el. " Stopping five years in one place is not traveling* and the experience of such a slay is not a traveler's experience,*' is his modest disclaimer. But, though his book is about Yezd, in the very centre of Persia, it is not unlikely that his descriptions fit other Persian cities more or less clusely. Even if they do not, but refer w.holly and exclusively to Yezd, they show a place with manners and customs so different from our own that they are interesting even in the narrower limits of their applicability, Mr. Malcolm is a missionary, and he is also a fair-minded man, who rinds some good in everything, like a veritable Banished Duke. Of Islam and Christianity he remarks in hi3 preface:
There are really not many resemblances to note. An officer of Indian troops replied to a Mussulman s suggestion that there were resemblances between the two religions: “There is hardly a single practical point where Mussulmans and Christians are not entirely at issue "; whereupon the Mussulman saiu.
** Sahib, you have read your Bible, ana have also read the Quran. I a 1 ways_ make that remark to Christians. 1 made ll to a padre the other day, and they almost always say. ‘ Very true; Mohammedanism has a great'deal in common with Clins*: tianity.’ Well, Sahib, when they say that,
I know that they have not read Ithe Quran and that they have not read their Bibles.
Persia is mostly desert, but desert in Persia is of many kinds. The ordinary desert is good soil, and where it can be watered is extremely fertile. Generally it has a hard but rather gravelly surface. The oases are not really very different in character from the desert, however. Mr. Malcolm says. Water is brought from the mountains in a most curious manner. Jt is found near the hills at depths varying from CO to 100 yards below the surface.
From the hills to the centrc of the plain there is a considerable though very gradual declivity. So when the original shaft has been sunk and water found, perhaps at 300 feet below the surface, a long line of similar shafts is sunk toward the centre of the plain at distances varying from 20 to 40 yards, the line sometimes stretching for more than 40 miles, until a point of desert has been reached that lies as deep down as the original water level. Then all. the shafts are connected at the bottom by burrows just big enough to afford passage to a man: the water is let in. and appears in an open ditch in the centre of the desert.
These aqueducts are called qun'ats. The cost of making one ought to compare not unfavorably with the cost Qf our own new Croton aqueduct. The Yczdis use their streets much more than we do, according to Mr, Malcolm. The streets are bordered by brick walls, the tops of which are generally in bad repair, and pieces of mud and sun-dried bricks lie in the street. Where the surface has not been taken up by bricks, which are left to bake, in the sun in the middle of the road, it is generally used for drying manure that has been kneaded with a modicum,of earth. The dyers also use the street for hanging up their cloths to dry, and also for arranging their skeins of silk, which they twist around wooden pegs stuck into the walls about forty yards apart. The road surface is a little irregular, and occasionally it is made/more interesting by a shaft leading Into a qun’at.
The Yezdi house is of mud, with a porch,
‘ often covered with a dome. Back of this are two or three courts, in the larger of which the family lives. In the courts will be found a tank and flower beds. The house consists of two sets of buildings, with perhaps some upper rooms; these, however, do not form a real second story, being built oyer the lowest of the ground-floor rooms, so that the roof is on one level. There is a Summer portico! opening to the north, with an air shaft. For five months of the year this Summer portico anfr the room below it are the only habitable rooms in a Persian house.
Houses that are not very new arc always more or less tumble-down; but no Yezdi wants his house to last forever. " Nobody can realize the damage that can be done in a town like Yezd by a really wet day. Some while ago we had twenty-four hours of rain, which destroyed, I believe, about a couple of hundred roofs, and, what is worse, caused the older qun’at pits to fall in, blocking the water supply in some parts of the town for three months. Is there any other town in the world where a little extra rain causes a three months* drought? There is a story in Teheran about a Dutch Ambassador, who was so afraid of the roof falling that
in wet weather he invariably slept under
the table. However, he was a very tall man, and when the catastrophe happened he got his foot crushed.”
The houses are built only for protection against heat; in Winter the Yczdis " grin and bear it/* the merchants close their

offices and stay at home, and only-thc smaller tradesmen and artisans go to the bazars. The heating arrangement consists of a wooden stool, under which a charcoal brazier is placed; over stool and brazier a heap of rugs and'quilts is placed, and the family tuck their legs under the wraps* squatting on the floor.
Yezd, with about 30,000 inhabitants, is insular beyond the insularity of islands. When you send a letter To Isfahan, if your friend writes by return mail you may get an answer in a month. It is a great pity that they have got rid of the native telegraph line. The poles were rough sticks, like what a washerwoman uses in England to prop her clothesline.
I suppose, taking: the good line with the bad. there was on tho average about one insulator to every three poles—this is without counting the insulators which hung midway between the poles, apparently by way of ornament. In a good many places the lirie lay on the ground; at others it crossed the road about the level of a horseman’s chin. One day In Yezd a European wanted to send, a ’telegram, and sent to ask when the line would be up. They sent him a polite message that the line was always down—that was not the trouble; but a camel had stepped on it.	‘
The insularity of the town, and the atmosphere of the place, remind Mr. Malcolm of a preparatory school for little boys. The so-callcd fanaticism of the Yezdi he diagnoses as two-thirds non-religious. “ There was an element of tur-bulency, a real religious element; and an clement of insularity, utterly unconnected with creed and doctrine.” In a chapter on Islam in Persia, Mr. Malcolm says:
As for the favorable views of Islam
lately brought forward by Europeans, I can only pass on the story told me of an educated' Mussulman in India who had been shown a book on the subject. " This gentleman, Sahib," he said, as he handed back the volume, " appears to know very little about his own religion, and absolutely nothing about ours." In Zoroastrianism (Parsiism) it is not unteaching but teaching that is required to lead the people to Christ; but in Mohammedanism, ,in spite of its greater pretensions, almost every apparent truth crumbles into mere truism or actual falsity the moment you try to make it the basis of anything practical. * * * I firmly believe that the difficulties in the Islam of to-day are due rather to the essential wrongness of tho system than to its corruption by the masses.
.	r
The religion of the Mussulman Yezd is largely superstition now. The most popular edition of the Quran is a very minute round one in two parts, absolutely illegible, and only suitable for wearing in a sewn-up case. The mullas, or priests, will divine in the mosques with the Quran— for a fee. “ The commoner form is with a
■	rosary, rather on the plan of * Two, four, six, eight, Mary at the cottage gate,’ Persians will consult the beads as to whether to send for the doctor, and after he has come, to see if they shall buy the medicine he has prescribed, and finally, after buying it, to see if the patient shall take a dose." On the subject of lying, Mr. Malcolm says, among other things:
Never forget that the jokes of W. S. Gilbert arc the facts of Persia. In the Yezd bazaars, probably not less than one-third of the speeches made by Mussulmans are falsehoods. * * * One day a cook of a European went to the bazaar, and after the usual haggling, fixed the price of some meat at 12 krans for thirteen pounds. , " But,*' said the cook, " you've got your j thumb on tho scales." " Did you think," retorted the butcher, '* that I would give j you meat -at thirteen pounds lor a krans unless I kept my thumb on the scales? "
* * * We had a neighbor who was considered a fairly respectable man, whose sole business was the forging of seals.
* But the fact is that every class, from the highest to the lowest, is thoroughly permeated by the leaven of dishonesty. A Mohammedan assured me .that truthspeaking and honesty had nothing to do with religion, but were purely a matter of climate. ** In that case," said I, “ tho people of Persia ought to speak the truth very well, for one of the Greek historians who lived before the Mohammedan era, declared that the Persians were famous for speaking the truth." " But who does not know," replied the Mohammedan,
" that the climate of a country changes entirely every 2,000 years? *\
Mr. Malcolm thinks that the language is responsible for the Yezdi*s inaccuracy of ideas, and one may, well agree with him. He says:
The words one uses In a letter are almost entirely different from those used conversationally, and those in an ordinary
•	prose history are again different. Then it is almost impossible to distinguish the tenses; and lastly the adjective is generally .indistinguishable from the substantive, and the link between an adjective and the term which It qualifies [a the same as the sign of the possessive. For instance, the text. " This is My beloved Son," may be read in the Persian Bible, “This is the Son of My beloved,” without the slightest violence to the grammar.
Mr. Malcolm's book. It la evident, affords an interestlng_and novel plcthre of a ,curious country. He tries to be fair to the people, among whom he jworked for five years, and we think he succeeds, Hig chapters on the Islam of Yezd are detailed and analytical; his book should be read by any one who intends -to visit Persia, and will prove interesting to those who do not intend to do so. The colored pictures, by a Persian artist, are not the least attractive part of an unusually pleasing book.	.
