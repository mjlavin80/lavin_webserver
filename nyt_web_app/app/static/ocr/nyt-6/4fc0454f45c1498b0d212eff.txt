A “ Life of Schubert/' by Edmondstoune . Duncan is about to be added by E. P. Dutton & Co. to The Blaster Musicians Series, edited by Frederick J. Crowley, author of " The Great Tone Poets,” &c. The book was written to supply the *' want ” of a full and up-to-date biography o£ the originator of modem song, and provides, the author says, not ** a mere mention " of the names of his works, but ** the full and complete life work " of the ■ composer. The first part of the volume is biographical, the second Is given up to a consideration of Schubert the man, after which there is a Chapter on Schubert as a musician. The appendices contain a bibliography of the composer, a list of his works founded on Breltkopf and Haertel's complete edition, the principal-Incidents In the life ef Schubert, and Schubert personalia and memoranda. Mr. Duncan sums up Schubert's life and work In the following passage from Thomas Carlyle’s *' Essay on the Life.of Heine
Let no man doubt the omnipotence ef nature; doubt rthe .majesty of.jnan’s soul; let no unfriended son of genius despair: If he have the will, the right will.-then the power also- has not been denied him. «It Is but the artichoke that t?IU not grow except In gardens. The acorn Is cast carelessly-abroad; into *the wilderness, yet It rises to .be an oak;- on the wild soil It -nourishes itself,’:it defies the tempest, and .lives for a thousand years. v "
