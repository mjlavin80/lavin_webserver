BARRETT "W" END EL I—
Some time ago we had and embraced 'the opportunity of paying our disre-\ spects to Prof. Barrett Wendell’s book . on “ The Temper of the Seventeenth : Century in English Literature.” Since then the professor has been giving 4< conferences " on English literature in Paris and in French provincial towns,
, and. has stimulated the students of at least one “ lyc£e " to give an English play in the original.
But, in the language of Daniel Webster, “ there is an enemy that still exists to check the glory of these triumphs.” Our old friend and enemy The London Saturday Review, apparently by the pen of some old-fashioned scholar whom flaunting sciolism makes impatient, has fallen foul of the book of which we fell afoul, and which, as some of our readers may remember, was a collection of lectures delivered at the English Cambridge. His conclusion is the same to which we came, that Prof. Wendell is much better fitted to address (in the English language) lectures on English literature to French than to English audiences, especially to English university audiences.
The Saturday does make it appear, quite in the old-time Saturday way, that a certain degree of self-confidence was required to embolden a man of Prof. Wendell's endowment and attainment to lecture at Cambridge on English literature. We said this generally. The Saturday says it with specification and circumstance. There are professors at Harvard, at least there have been, \vho could go to old Cambridge and talk about English literature of any period to the edification of their hearers. But The Saturday makes it exceeding plain that Prof. Wendell is not one of them. “ The author,” observes the critic. *' seems wholly destitute of any pretensions to critical discernment.” The critic hunts him through three columns to all his fastnesses, and shows up his incompe-
>	tency	to the task	he has undertaken,
I	which	supposedly	is to tell people already	fairly well	read in the Englibn
literature of the	seventeenth century
something that they do not already know. He has done nothing of the kind.
W^ have not space to follow the cruel critic through his demonstration. The main trouble with a professor of literature of the Wendellian variety is that it Is so difficult to elicit from him a plain statement or proposition to which it is possible to pin him. For a reviewer this difficulty is serious. It is really work for a cross-examiner, fro Eli whom the—\vitness would have no legal refuge except in refusing to answer
*
upon the ground that his answers would incriminate or degrade him- CoL Bartlett of the New York bar had that opportunity not long ago in a case in which Prof. Oscar Triggs of the University of Chicago. From the examination it appeared that while Prof. Triggs had announced himself as a lecturer | upon " Romeo and Juliet,” he did not j know in what Italian city the scene of the play was laid, or what were the names of the two families between whom the feud existed which is the motive of the play. The unhappy witness was in much the same position as the applicant £or a schoolxnastership
wlio. was asked , of what country. Vi-' enna was the capital, and who, after:;
. fen cing with the- question to the best" of his ability^ was reduced' to explain-Jng: ** I know of what country Vienna
Is the capital probably as well as you
^ - _ i *
do. But, you see, I haven't the flow of language, to express It.”
To read Prof. Wendell is to wish that he were subjected to the same ordeal through which Prof. Triggs had to pass, and to be convinced that he would not come out of it much better. A critic not having the advantage of being a cross-examiner with legal powers of inquisition must '* deduce by collection ” out of Prof, Wendell the measure of'hft competency, which was elicited directly from Prof. Triggs. But this The Saturday Reviewer does with much skill and complete success. And he winds up his accumulation of evi— dence by protesting against the enter-talnment of this professor as an authority on English literature at the University of Cambridge, where there are persons who really do know about English literature. The old philological pedantry,” concludes the reviewer,
“ would be infinitely preferable to a
*	\
pretentious and slushy dilettante! sm.” Pretentious and slushy dilettanteism— we thank thee. Review, for teaching us that word. The fact that what it denotes is so extensively diffused among American professors of English literature indicates that there is something seriously amiss with the teaching of English literature at more than one American university.	.
