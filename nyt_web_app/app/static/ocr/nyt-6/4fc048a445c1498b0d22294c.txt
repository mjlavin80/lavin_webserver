Amerlca.ii History la Mendacious Brag,
len finds much to praise In the -book, but something to blame. " It is," he declares, “ a record of which any nation should be proud, if only it were not marred by what seems to be an incurable habit among United States historians; brag, even absolute and well-informed mendacity. And this is all the more regrettable .because it is unnecessary. The
achievements of these splendid New Englanders were so high, in the scale of successful human endeavor, that it is surely a grave error to represent them as demigods, invincible, incapable of a mistake, and to exaggerate continually the undoubted faults of England, as if maliciously bent on impressing upon the world that the nation from which these superhuman heroes derived their origin was entirely peopled by cowards, fools, and rogues. But as this, despite the general talk of * hands across the sea,’ &c„ seems to be the keynote of United States history usually, it is surely waste of time to dwell over long upon it.*'

Georsc Meredith’s Too Frcqnenl Revision of If In Best Work.
Henry M. Trollope Has Been Author and Fnblisher.
Hugh Chisholm contributes t o The London" Academy an art 1 c 1 e entitled "Mr. Meredith's Revision of ‘Richard Feverel.* ” He says:	" Even among
those who find him too * difficult,* I take it that Mr. George Meredith has been accepted as the greatest English novelist now living, a literary artist, indeed, in a class by himself. This much has at least been effected by the younger generation of critics, who have insisted on his modem pre-eminence, and his assured place among the immortals. But the very tardiness of this recognition of a novelist whoso miisterpieces were contemporary
with those of George Eliot has had one unfortunate result, if we are to attribute Mr. Meredith’s repeated changes in the text of his earlier novels to a sense of the want of appreciation shown for them by the public. In the article on Mr. Meredith in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, I have already said that *^l will be the duty of future editors to restore " Richard Feverel ’* and ’* Evan Harrington " (and these are not the only ones in question) to their earliest versions*: and it may be interesting to indicate for the benefit of 1 Meredithians ’ generally what is involved in the former of these two instances. It would appear to be none the Jess necessary because, in spite of a fairly full exposure in 1S!>7 of the drastic revision which had taken place in the new edition then published by Messrs. Constable, a London literary paper recently printed an editorial paragraph naively inquiring what were tho alterations which 'rumor had it ’ that Mr. Meredith had made.
" I do not propose to discuss here the changes in ' Richard Feverel ’ that characterised the 1S97 edition. Lovers of Mr. Meredith’s novels are pretty well agreed,
I fancy, in declining with all respect to consider that latest ‘authorized version’ prefersble to what may ^ be called the textus receptus. previously fSmillar in the single-volume edition issued by Messrs. Chapman & Hall. But this latter edition itself represented a considerable revision, compared with the original three-volume edition of lST»n. Of all the novels, 4 Richard Feverel ’ was the greatest sufferer by-this earls* revision. I look forward to a time when the 3859 version will be restored to the market in a reprint, instead of its being, as now, a rare ' find * for the collector.”	-

Cornhill Magazine Mr. Alexander Innes Shand ^contributes a Remarkable paper entitled ** Gastronomic Divagations.”	Such a glorifi-
cation of game and fish, black-faced Scotch mutton and the brown trout of the Highland streams and lochs, of col-lops of venison, of sauce vert at Ledoy-en’s in the Champs Elysfies, of cock-a-leekie and haggis, of brandered grouse and Spanish hams, seems to belong to a larger and richer age than this era of dyspepsia and “ breakfast foods.” Mr. Shand has lived well and long, and this gastronomic essay is likely to form a chapter in his forthcoming volume of reminiscences entitled r' Days of the Past: A Medley of Memories.'’ Mr. Shand was long a contributor to The London Times. He was a friend of Kinglake; Hamley, Hayward, Chenery, and others of the famous Athenaeum Club coterie. He has written the biography of Sir Edward Hamley, various volumes on sport, travel, and war, and he is the author of two or three novels.
Mistral the Last of the Provencal Writers.
With the death of
M. Alphonse Tavan,
Mistral is now the
sole survivor, as he
has always been the
most famous, of the seven young men
who set themselves to revive Provencal
literature. Ffilix Gras became known a
few yeai-s ago in England by the English
version of " The Reds of the Midi.” But
the^ rest hav« little honor save in* their own country. M. Tavan held a post in a railway company. He was the author of two volumes of verse, “ Amour et Plour ” and Vivo Viaants,” as well as of a comedy, ** L«e Masc,*' first played* in a coach house in 185*1, in the very early days of the Felibrige.—London Gkbe
