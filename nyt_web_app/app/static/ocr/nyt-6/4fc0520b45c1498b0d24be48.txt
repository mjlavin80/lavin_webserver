The chapters in Capt* A. D. R. Glas-furd’s volume, ** Rifle and Romance in the Indian Jungle,” which the John Lane Company will soon bring out, are of varying character. Some deal with the real, others idealistic, and one or two entirely fanciful. They have been written, the author points out in his preface, from time to time during a residence-in India of some fourteen years, mostly spent In jungly places. A large part of the book has been written in the jungles themselves; some of the stories in the hunting tent; others on the hillside while resting, and several on moonlight nights spent in lonely **"machans.” He Indicates the purpose of the volume in the course of his remarks:
Its aim is * • * to present an old though still engrossing subject in what is perhaps a novel manner; to carry the reaxter into more direct contact with the surroundings of the Indian sportsman and naturalist, and, while avoiding as much as possible the recital of personal experience with its stereotyped accompaniments, to lead him into the jungle, with all its fascinating variety of scene and season, hill and plain, where in spirit he | may make acquaintance or renew an ini timacy with its shy denizens and their' j habits. -*	'
