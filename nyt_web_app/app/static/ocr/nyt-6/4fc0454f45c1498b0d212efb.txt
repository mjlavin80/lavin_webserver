• ■ r»
satisfactory to them upon a subject •which they felt to be theirs and not his, so,'and in the same way, Mr. Brandes's treatment will' seem to them to fall : short.	■
. It is true that Taine was a Frenchman, which should mean tha't his sensibility had been cultivated to the extreme. It is true also that Mr. Brandes is not a German. The fact is so far in his favor that he, as a Dane, does not' partake that mania for generalization and systematization and classification which has made many a plain man rub the eyes of wonder at reading German views of things which it seemed to him that hs knew innately.
*	But there is a tendency to treat works of art as typical and Illustrative rather than on their individual merits as human expressions, which the systematic historian of literature cannot escape. „In the next, if not in the first, place there is that liability on the part of the most gifted and the most accomplished foreigner who has acquired a language not his own to miss the precise point of the value of words which the native has by nature. Every 1-inguage is thus a dialect, in the sense that -the man not born to it never acquires the discrimination in it which the man born to it possesses without any credit to himself and of course without ary consciousness of acquisition. To read foreigners on English pDetry is to understand why Scotchmen tell us that it is vain j for us to try to understand the Scottish | poems of Burns. When one sees what the most accomplished foreigners make of the most English poets, how that which is precisely the most poetical of its poetry eludes them, one has to admit that, after all, the M world poets ” may not be the most poetical poets, and that the foreigner, meaning this time himself, may miss the point of what Is most poetical even in the world poets not of his own race and lineage. And the matter is not In the least mended by the production of the foreigner’s linguistic credentials. There is no reason to suppose that Mezzofanti was especially sensitive to the charms of poetry in any one of the tongues which he knew, for other purposes, “ like a dem’d native." There is even reason to suppose that some of the special sensibility with which he may have started for the nuances of his own language, the appreciation of which is the

that‘they fail to bring to mm the nicer^ appreciation of the‘^ foreigner._ .Mr-Brandes is German enough to be the victim of “ tendenzi*’ again like- Taine.: but more so. He does not pretend to-be chiefly interested. in poetry as poetry, but for itsr*social and political illuminations. Hence the dismissal of Keats as the exponent, rather as the victim, of “ all-embracing sensuousness." Of course, as Matthew, Arnold has admitted, Keats “ had that, too.
But no native lover of English poetry will he in the least ready to'a'aihitithat .that was all he had.. But this is, no greater failure on. one sidethanon the other Is the. solemnity with which the claims of Tom Moore to a high place in the poetical ■ pantheon of‘ his time^are "canvassed and admitted. ■ '	.	;
It would not be fair to dismiss Mr. Brandes’s volume as .if its shortcomings' of appreciation'were all there were in it. There is much more, much more than we have space here. to. set forth. It is as candid as the “ tendene ” will allow, very, well informed, highly en-tertainlng, frequently striking, and I even useful. But it has the shortcomings it had to have, and ihesfe will prevent it from having the authority it ought to have with readers who have by nature that appreciation which the 'author could not possibly acquire. A curious reflection concerning the collapses of foreigners in attempting to appreciate the poetry of a living language not their own is the wonder whether any living man’s appreciation of the poetry of a dead language, even Mr. Swinburne*s own, Is worth much more. Is Mr. Brandes more an antique Roman than a Dane? How can we make sure that Matthew Arnold on Homer or Myers on Virgil would not be as much in the air, as irrelevant, to a Greek who really natally and prenatally knew his Homer or a Roman who similarly knew his Virgil, as the remarks on English poetry of a German professor, or even of a Taine or a Brandes, are to readers to whom the appreciation of English poetry is not an acquisition but a birthright?
