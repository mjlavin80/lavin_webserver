Yorh TJmes Booli Review: .	I
A woman must perforce regard her sex I In the light of a higher moral standard 1 after reading the story of ■■ Two Practical Heroines.” While A. C. Grey in Thh BQPk Review of May 20 appears indignant because of- Viola's irreproachable virtue, it is nevertheless true, in the : oplnioirof the writer, that we should applaud a-course of reasoning and of con-i duct tending to place our sex upon a filler Plane. The development of woman m the way of a higher moral life ought 1 i ,a cat£? of general congratulation. Viola is a shining exemplification of this development.
" Duty preconceived becomes a soluble" quantity under the ardent, forcerul pressure of a nature attuned to love," wrote the correspondent named. The thought does not appeal to one who thinks rightly,
I conceive.
. If a woman is not self-sufficient, where . will she look for the strength she lacks? The true woman, '.he " real" woman, should be strong In the highest moral sense, able to combat successfully every evil that may confront her. W. O. H.
