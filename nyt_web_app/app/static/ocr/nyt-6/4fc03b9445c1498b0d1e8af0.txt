The life that it is here proposed to depict was a life singularly devoid of incident. It was the career of a lonely, secluded, fastidious, and affectionate man; it was a life not rich in results, not fruitful in example. It is the history of a few great friendships, much quiet benevolence, tender loyalty, wistful enjoyment. The tangible results are a single small volume of imperishable quality, some accomplished translations of no great literary importance, a little piece of delicate prose writing, and many beautiful letters. But over the whole is the indefinable charm of temperament and personality. The background is so minute, so uneventful that it is only possible to diaw a Dutch picture, so to speak, of the scene, not slurring over details nor discarding homely _ touches, but depicting with careful fidelity the trivial round of little incidents and pleasures in which FitzGerald was more or less content to live.
The foregoing opens Arthur Christopher Benson’s biography of M Edward FitzGerald/’ which the Macmillan Company is publishing in the English Men of Letters Series, edited by John Morley. There is an abundance of extracts from letters by the translator of " Omar Khayyam,” which the author has chosen to insert because, he says, " I believe that it is the ! only true method of giving an impression of a character that, in spite of eccentricity, Ustlessness, and melancholy, possessed a rich and subtle attractiveness that is sometimes denied to figures of a more vital force and more supreme achievement.” Mr. Benson goes through FitzGerald’s early years, his middle life, and later years; writes about his frlenJs, bis habits, and character, criticisms of 'aim, bi3 plays, letters, and writings. In discussing the last he begins with the translation of the Oriental poets.
