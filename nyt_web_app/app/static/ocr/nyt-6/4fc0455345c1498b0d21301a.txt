The textbook on physics, by J. A. Culler, Professor of Physics in Miami University, has just been issuecl by the J. B. Lippln-cott Company. It is an elementary book intended for the higher grammar grades or the early part of the high school course. It seems to Prof. Culler that the difficulty in teaching physics in the high school arises from the fact that more new ideas and new methods of thought and expression are thrust upon the student at one time than in any other branch. The present book is intended to remedy this difficulty by the gradual introduction of the knowledge of physics in earlier years in the high sctiool course.
