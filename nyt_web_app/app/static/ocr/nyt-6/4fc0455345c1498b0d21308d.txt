BEAUTY IJM ART.
A Suggestive Work by Ettrel Puffer on Its “ Psychology/’ Involving a New Philosophical Theory.*
ISS PUFFER has attempted to make a synthesis ot the many facts that psychology has acquired in the study of beauty, that shall make intelligible a philosophical theory of beauty. Slio does not claim that her work is exhaustive, but that it is a more or less consistent and complete aesthetic theory. It is sympathetic and suggestive, full of appreciation on the less tangible side of art and artistic feeling and perception, and marshaling a serried array of facts to tho consideration of the scientific side. And it is clearly reasoned and judicious from the point of view of the author. She plunges into the midst of disputation at once in her preliminary chapter on criticism and aesthetics, in which she considers the two opposing methods and ideals of criticism, those of the impressionistic and of the scientific schools.
She maintains that the former, resulting in '* appreciation,” in interpretation," can justify themselves only as the crowning touches of a detailed aesthetic analysis. The present body of criticism consists rather of preliminaries and_ supplements to what should be its real accomplishment. The true ideal of criticism, she concludes, is that of the scientific school; a judgment of a work of art on the basis of the laws of beauty. The establishment of such laws is the task of aesthetics—a task much needing fulfillment in the existing dearth of knowledge of and interest in the elements of beauty in the arts.
** Aesthetics ’’ is no new word in the literature of philosophy, and what it represents has occupied the attention of a good many; yet, clearly, not to the attainment of the end. for Miss Puffer tells us that the science is now only in the beginning. How much further toward" the end does the book take us? It is not, we may confess, an easy road, nor is her preliminary step, a discussion of " The Nature of Beauty," one to make it easier, with its philosophical and psychological analysis. Beauty, we learn, is to bring unity and self-completeness into the personality. The discussion of the means by which it does this is for psychology. “ The diffusion of stimulation, the equilibrium of impulses, life enhancement through repose *’ is the aesthetic experience of beauty. A picture or a statue may be understood; the drama, novel, or symphony may be likened to a circle, returning upon itself—the end is contained in the beginning, hence its “ inevitableness,'* This cyclic movement Is, in the end, static, of the nature of equilibrium. “ It is only in the wideness of the sweep that the dynamic repose of poetry and music differs from the static activity o£ picture and statue/' In fine, we are told;
Thus the nature of Beauty is in the re-latlon of means to an end: the means, the possibilities of stimulation in the motor, visual, auditory, and purely ideal fields; the end, a moment of perfection, of self-complete unity of experience, of favorable stimulation with repose.	-
Still more difficult Is the chapter on " The Aesthetic Repose,” the point of view from which we enjoy works of art— the momentary self-annihilation made possible by the fact that " all incitements to motor impulse—except those which belong to the indissoluble ring of the object itself—have been shut tfut by the perfection of unity to which the aesthetic object belongs." Now may come the consideration of different manifestations of beauty in the fine arts, music, literature. Miss Puffer gives us an analysis of color effects, the reasons for sensations of certain sorts, for instance, as the ejfc planatlon or justification of various schools of painting. Such is the explanation of the methods and results of impressionism. In another direction there is the systematic analysis of " space composition " among the old masters, based on examination of a thousand pictures, with an analysis of certain examples.
In music Miss Puffer's method is somewhat similar. She analyzes from a psychological point of view the nature of rhythm, of tone and tonal relations, and of melody. Melody is “an everhindered striving for a goal, ruled by the sense of potential and coming integration,*' with varied answers to the demands of the ear as felt at cach successive point. This view of musical logic, cuts away the ground, from under the feet of those who hold by the " natural language" argument of the origin and nature of music, as Spencer. Music is not “heightened speech,'* for the occasion of an aesthetic phenomenon is never its cause. Tbe emotional means which music has at its command are expressive* first, by association,, as In the imitation of "other sounds, or of the cadence of the voice In pleading,
. laughter, love; or, second, by induction. That is, emotion Is aroused by activities which themselves form -part of the 'emo* tions in question—thus/ the' differences 1zl tempo call up the gaycty, sadness, hesi-
tation. firmness, haste, growing excitement, &c., of which whole experiences these movement types form a part. Expectation. the sense of coming integration, is the ultimate source of pleasure In music. *The more beautiful, that is, the more inevitably, irresistibly right the music, the more powerful Lhe influence toward the illusion of the triumphant will; and that illusion is the only intimate. Immediate, intrinsic emotion of music.
In literature the same criterion of beauty, the perfect moment of unity and selfcompleteness, prevails. Language is identical with thoughts, the " dialect of life." But the “ sense of life " is not the beauty of literature; nor. is criticism of life, but rather the appreciation of life, the full savor of life in its entirety. The final definition of literature as it is here presented is the art of experience. It Js ** literally false ” that It does not matter what a man says, but only how he says it; what he says is all that matters, for it will not be great thought without some greatness in the saying.
Art for art’s sake in literature is art for life’s sake:
Prose and poetry, drama, and novel, have each their own special excellences, springing from the respective situations they had and have to meet. Yet these but add elements to the one great power to give the perfect experience of life In its fullness and vividness and in its identity with the central meanings of exlst-ence—unity and self-complcteness together—in a form which offers to our mental functions the perfect moment of stimulation and repose.
The whole field of beauty is brought under discussion on these general lines. How far this philosophical treatment explains the qualities of excellence in art may depend very much on the temper of the recipient. But that a science ot aesthetics, ever so substantially grounded, will ever be in a position to determine irrevocably and beyond peradventure what is and is not excellent, that many will doubt. If there caja be a science of the beautiful, then there can be an objective judgment on the basis of the laws of the beautiful, and it is Miss Puffer’s intention to show that there can be.	'
