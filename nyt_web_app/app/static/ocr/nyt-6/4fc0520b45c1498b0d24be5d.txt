In this newest story of his, Gen. King ^ has put his army officer hero through a ' good many various paces. First, you have j him at West Point as instructor there and i devoted attendant upon a pretty girl; then j you have him lorn * away from that de-lightlul scene and sent out to fight In- j dians In Arizona, to. make a gallant res- i cue, get a bad wound, .and be cruelly ^ .wronged In the report of his commanding | officer, a political Major of the vintage of i the early sixties, who appears to be a scoundrel and a poltroon of the uttermost.
Next the young officer is assigned as Instructor In military drill to one of those colleges-aided by the General Government, upon the understanding that a school of the soldier is to be maintained. The authorities of the college" think the drill Is a nuisance and neglect it. The young officer thinks the contract with the Government should be kept, and insists upon the drill. So there’s a dreadful time of it, between a polite President, a conscientious drill ^master, and shirking students. Besides, the beautiful girl of the West Point episode is at the same, college teaching French, and for mysterious reasons will have nothing to do with her old admirer. And it presently appears that the rascally commanding officer of the Arizona post has his finger in the pie—he and a saloon keeping boss in the neighboring town who has vast political influence and a young cur of a son at college. This hopeful, of course, will not drill.
Things get very complicated. The young officer has tiffs with the Presr-dent. He gets assaulted by roughs, murder is done, and he is accused of it, and clapped into jail. Mysterious lights are seen at night, the “ Adjutant’s call ” is tapped upon th^ window pane, notes are found beneath the window of the pretty French teacher, a fire is started in a gin-mill, and an^ unexplained wounded man rescued from a cellar. Of course everything clears up and the drill becomes the saving feature of the college, alnd the drill master the ipost popular of instructors. Then there’s another Indian war and more gallant fighting for the young officer, and—at last—exactly what should happen at the endbin all romances of love and war and teaching.
