New York Times Book Review:
At this time, with all eyes turned upon her ana many books written about her, comes to us another story of Japan. I, like many others; perhaps, am always afraid' of stories on such a subject at such a critical time, fearing; as I have a, right to from past experience, that they will be poor and appear only for mercenary purposes. But it has been many a day since I have been thrilled and moved by any book as I have been by ** The Breath of the Gods/’ by Sidney McCall, the author of "Truth Dexter." It is a true picture of Japanese people, customs, and country. And coupled with it is as charming a story, with as lovely a heroine. as could be found. Onda Yukl, with every advantage that American education could give her, proves true to her earlier training; making a story that Is, both different and prettier than the majority of new books contain. The author seems so familiar with the subject that you move with- the book through all the scenes and live in the very air of the Orient There are, .above everything else, some passages and descriptions that can be read and reread many times with pleasure. The description of the painting- of the Ked God, Aizen Bosatsu, and the story connected with it, commencing on Page 148, should be read at once by every one who enjoys art, and particularly Japanese art. The meeting between Hagane, Yuki, and her father and mother, commencing on Pago 226, would surely make a strong scene In a piny, as also would the death of Yukl.
It Is Indeed a pleasure to recommend such a book.	-*	F.	T.	-
