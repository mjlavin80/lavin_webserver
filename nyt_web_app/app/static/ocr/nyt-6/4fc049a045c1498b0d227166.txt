The "Written History of the American -Civil War—Capt. Battinc’s Boofc.
7*Tctc York Times Book Review:
HE Impression conveyed by tbe answers of Mr. E. Els-worth and the gentleman signing himself " Guidon '/ to my contribution oC May 6 in The New York Times
-	Book Review is that they both speak ftom the partisan standpoint. My own view is simply that of an American, with a desire to see the history of our civil war written with due regard for the true facts, and if possible without partiality to either side.
I do not agree with Mr. Elsworth in his opinion of the comparative accuracy and Impartiality of accounts o£ the great struggle between the North and the South, written by foreign critics, for the reason that foreigners generally, and Bnglishmen in particular, are still influenced by the sentiment that prevailed in their respective countries toward the Union cause in 1801-5.
Great Britain's attitude at the time Is well remembered, and It is too soon to expect the taint of such pronounced feeling to be entirely eliminated. Up to the present moment there has probably r.ot been written a more accui*ate or Impartial account of many of the battles of the civil war than that contained in the " Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant," from which I
quoted in my recent communCSUion to The New York Times book Review.
From start to finish one is impressed with the idea that Gen. Grant wished merely to tell tlie story in a plain, straight forward manner, without any embellishments, or any desire to influence tho reader one way or the other. I have frequently heard veterans of both the Northern and Southern armies, men who were competent to judge, express the same opinion.
The alleged superiority in numbers of the Federal over the Confederate forces has always been and probably will continue to be a much disputed question, it has been claimed that the Federate outnumbered the Confederates two to one, and thaiT their successes in battle were due to overwhelming numbers. Mr. Elsworth, friend " Guidon," and a British hussar Captain seem to be laboring under some such delusion, but I am perfectly willing to accept Gen. Grant’s explanation as the correct one,
Capt. Battine of the English Army also claims that tlie Federal commander at Shiloh was " careless,” that he was “ surprised " on the first day* April C, &c. Now, the fact is, there was no carelessness shown, and there was no surprise. Gen. Grant was aware of the presence ot the Confederates as early as April 1, and momentarily expected an attack. It appears that considerable delay was caused by a disagreement between Gens. Johnston and Beauregard, The former wanted to give battle and the latter did not think it advisable. Several councils of war were consequently held in tho Confederate camp, the last being on the morning of. the (Jth, when the Federate started the ball by opening fire.
On Page Vol. I., of Grant’s “Memoirs ’’ I find the following statement:
“ During this last consultation and before a decision had been reached, the bat-tie began by the National Lroops opening fire on the enemy. This seamed to settle the question as to whether there was to be any battle of Shiloh. It also seems to me to settle the question as to whether there was a surprise.*’
“ Guidon" lays great stress upon the 1 fact that Gens. Bueil and Wallace arrived with reinforcements on the afternoon of April t>. Jt so happened that neither of these Generals arrived in time lo take part in the fight, as the battle was over for tho day. It had been a desperate struggle between .'£{,<>00 Federals on one side and 40,lUiT> Confederates (Gen, Beauregard's figures) on the other. The Fed-erals had lost their camps and had been driven back, hut finally i-Ticcesded in checking the advance of their foes by planting batteries on a bluff overlooking ■ the position. In the two days’ fight the Foderals lost 13,047 in killed, wounded, an<i m/ss-rng. Of these only 2,103 belonged , io Buell’ *'Jorce. showing that the Army I of the Tennessee (.'L’l.OOO strong) bore the , brunt of the fight. Gen. Wallace had ’ 5,1)00 men instead of 7,MU, as claimed by ** Guidon."
' In speaking of the capture of the Federal camps on April (» ** Guidon " concludes by saying:	”	And why was not
the victory complete? Because oT the death of Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston,” &c.	*
It is a question whether Gen. Johnston could have succeeded p.ny better than Gen. Beauregard, who took bis place.
Gen. Grant’s estimate of Gen. Johnston. which may be of some interest, is as follows: ** I had known Johnston slightly in the Mexican war and later as an officer in the regular army. He was a man of high character and ability.
*	• * I once wrote that nothing occurred in his brief command of an army to prove or disprove the high estimate that had been placed upon his military ability; but after studying the orders and dispatches of Johnston I am compelled to materially modify my views nf that officer's qualifications as a soldier. Hv judgment now is that he was vasci Hating and undecided In his actions. *	*	* Gen.
Beauregard was next in rank to Johnston and succeeded to the command, which he , retained to the close of the battle. * * * 1 His tactics have been severely criticised ,
iby Confederate^writers,rbut :I; do hotber; lleveliis fallen chief could have/done any better under the circumstances.' Some of these critics claim that'Shiloh was‘won when Johnston fell, and that HT he had not fallen the army under me would have been annihilated or captured.	*
Commanding Generals are liable to be killed during engagements; and-the fact that when he was shot Johnston was. leading a brigade to induce it to make a charge which, had been repeatedly ordered: Is evidence that there was neither ’ tlie universal demoralization on our side tior the unbounded confidence on theirs which has been claimed. There was, In fact, no hour during the day when I doubted the eventual defeat of the enemy. * * * The Confederate troop3 fouglit well and deserve commendation enough for their bravery and endurance on the Gth of April, without detracting from their antagonists or claiming anything more than their just dues, * * * 'phe troops on both sides were American [“ Guidon" claims that the Federal army was partly foreign) and united they need not tear any foe."
** Guidon •* speaks of the Confederate army at Shiloh as a ** heterogeneous mass,” And claims that the men were armed with ** shotguns, old muskets— anything. In fact, whether from prehistoric times or of a later date,” &c. If this is a fact there is no earthly reason why they should have been anything hut well organized, weli drilled, and well armed. It is a matter of history that the South was much better prepared for war than the North. Months previous to the outbreak of hostilities the whole South Was a vast military camp, West Point graduates were engaged in drilling rccruita, arms and ammunition were being quietly removed .from Northern arsenals to supply Southern forts, &c.
On the other hand, the Northern people had fallen into a deep sleep, from which they did not awaken until they heard the thunder of Confederate cannons at their very doors.
As an illustration of the preparedness of the South and the unpreparedness of Lhe NorLh William O. Stoddard says:
** The Confederate Congress had voted its I‘resident also a nearly unlimited army, and he was fast assembling It. He had a good start of Mr. Lincoln, as to time at least, in all preparation and equipment. Some advantages had also* been provided for him by Mr. Floyd, President Buchanan's Secretary of War, in transferring quantities of arms from United States arsenals at the North to similar places of deposit within what were now the Confederate army lines. * * * In every Southern State the work of organizing and drilling soldiers had been pushed with feverish cnergjr"7or months before Mr. Lincoln was inaugurated. He (Lincoln) knew very well how great a disadvantage his raw levies would be under In a collision with better disciplined troops.
*	* * The entire country did not contain enough of serviceable muskets, all patterns counted, to put one in the hands of each man already enlisted. There were not sabres or carbines or pistols for the cavalry; nor guns or caissons or ammunition or suitable harness for tlie artillery,
*	* * Clothing was so difficult to obtain that even when the following Winter came the system for its full supply had not yet been perfected,”
In speaking of the seizure of United States property by Floyd, William Cullen Bryant says: “ He had recently sent lo the South from Pittsburg 120 heavy guns, and from Springfield and other arsenals more than 100,000 of the best muskets the Government owned."
I once heard the late Christopher Pullman say: “At Bull Run my regiment was armed with old Harper's Ferry mus* lccts, shooting * buck and ball.’ At close range good execution could be done with these weapons, but at 100 yards we couldn’t hit a flock of barns. On the other hand, the Confederate rifles reached us nvery time.”
It soe.ns that the Federal troops were not only armed with Inferior weapons at the beginning of the war, but as late as ISfiJf.
In speaking of the surrender of Vicks* burg Gen. Grant says: "At Vicksburg Itl.ooo prisoners were surrendered, together with 17- cannon, about G0.000 mus-k*»ls. &c. * * * The small arms of the enemy were far superior to the bulk ot ours. Up to this time our troops at the West had been limited to the old United States flintlock muskets changed'into percussion, or the Belgian musket imported early in the war—almost • as dangerous to the person firing it as to the one aimed at. * * * These were of many different calibres, a fact that caused much trouble In distributing ammunition during an en- ' gagement. The enemy had generally new arms, which had run the blockade, and were of uniform calibre. After the sur-„ render I authorized all Ctrionels whose regiments were armed with inferior muskets to place them in the stack of capt-ureil arms and replace them with the latter. A large number of arms turned in to Ordnance Department as captured were thus arms that had really been used by lhe Union army in the capture Of Vicksburg."
” Guidon ” says that the negroes be-cami* warriors " not of their own volition, fur if left to themselves they never w-uild have fought the Southern people*’;
*	*;■ t f they were ** forced to kill and apply the torch, which left in ruins the happiest homos they ever knew," &c.
According to Gen. David Hunter, i.n his jvpori to Secretary Stanton in 1862, the 1 colored slaves of the South joined the federal army voluntarily. No “ forcing ” was required. As lor applying torches to the *' happiest homes they ever knew,” I don’t believe a word of it. I have never y;*t cinne across anything In history to verify that statement. If ** Guidon ” can prove it 1 am perfectly willing to admit that 1 am in error.	•
