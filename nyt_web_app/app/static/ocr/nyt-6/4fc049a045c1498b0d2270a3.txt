Arthur Stringer .Writes About the ' i Poet and Artist’s Place in Civic Progress.
York Times Book Review:
'RELY it should not be lovers of poetry alone who will take an uncommonly keen' delight not only In Mr. Richard Watson Gilder’s poem read at the opening of the Gallery in Buffalo, but also
in the fact that one of our living poetS,
i - •
and one of our most dignified and schol-
*
atrly living poets, should actually be asked to participate In any such public service. Timely, too, as was the theme of Mr. Gilder’s dedicatory ode, and sturdily beautiful as were many of his lines,, the primary delight that lies in the poem Itself is altogether overshadowed, with many, by that secondary pleasure which
lurks in the long-abandoned belief that tho poet of to-day can, for even a moment, make himself o£ any possible civic Use or of any 'possible National concern! Especially must we feel this way in America, swept as our'Republic now Is by its " Big Stick ’’ and its turgid, anaesthetizing tides of material prosperity— against which the inopportune minor versifiers have hitherto cheeped only thinly 4nd plaintively from unread magazine page ends and from uncut author’s editions. The poet, we all thought, was a good- deal like a herinit-thrush lost among the shafts and pulleys of a shoe factory or an armor-plate foundry. He Was pretty enough, in his place and in his way. but he had nothing to do with life or with the things that really counted.
So even this momentary Identification or what was once held the divinest of the arts with actual affairs and actual life carries with It some poignantly muffled touch of promise. It has a microscopic tinge of something Homeric about it, recalling older and nobler traditions. It shows that poetry, after all, is not as obsolete as antimacassars. It also serves to ** democratize " an art which, at first sight, appears to have been usurped and carried off (and well-nigh strangled) by idle-handled aesthetes and self-immured dilettantes. It wrests this art, hallowed by timeless traditions, from the hands of febrile erotomaniacs and verbal crochet-workers. It tends to give a wider meaning and a stamp of national dignity to a sadly unremunerative calling that has, of late, seemed emasculated with plnk-teaed preciosity and tainted with studio-life attitudinizing. And poetry, In this aestheti-phobiac land and century of ours, sadly needs something like this. England—rich to-day in her younger generation of poets of no mean promise and accomplishment, while we, alas, can count our Thomas Bailey Aldriches and our William Vaughan Moodys on our finger tips—has her academically recognized Newdigrate and her officially sanctioned Laureate-ship. But on this continent, where the queen bee of the hive ' of . beauty must “grub for herself," any latter-day recognition of the maker of songs Is to be hungrily welcomed, in the hope that some day it will be more openly commended, ft is, on the other hand, equally to the advantage-, of the poet, now that the commercialized magazine Is no longer an outlet1 for anything but his shallowest and most fragmentary aspirations, to identify himself, in no matter how desperate a manner, with some scattered few of the wider issues of life. THat alone can keep bim vital. For remarkable indeed is the aloofness of our overbusy, professional man of letters—so timid is he of entering fnto any active sympathy with or any open discussion of all public movements and affairs. He seems to suffer more and more from a sort of ingrowing self-interest; he becomes more and more self-immured, self-satisfied, and self-sustaining. With it, too, he becomes more and more odiously *' stoppy.** He seems under the shadow of that sad fate which has already befallen his brother and sister of the stage, where everything not of the footlights and the make-up ' box is alien and uninviting and unresponded to.
Such being the case. I venture to re- I peat that it seems highly significant that , in a representative American city ten j thousand representative American citi- i zens gathered together to witness the ded- ' ication of a ^public building should not j only listen to but vigorously applaud a poem serious in note and exalted in thought, written by an American poet of the twentieth century. If such things continue it may even come about that we shall no longer have to seek out a French St. Gaudens to make our municipal statuary for us and an English Stephen Phillips to write our successful tragedies for us. There Is a market or two, and a market or two almost worth while, which we, with all our fiercely aggressive American energy* have not yet quite captured.
