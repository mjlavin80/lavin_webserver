Writing to Theodore Marburg* M. A., who has translated his “ Elements of Political Economy.” Emile Levasseur says of this book:
I believe that It contains sound views of essential principles, and that the ideas are expressed in a clear and didactic , form. My lectures are not confined to this little volume: they change according to the times and the needs of the moment. I have never given the same course two years In succession. But I have remained true to the fundamental principles of economic science, and it is precisely these principles which form the basis of this book.	*
The book, it is explained in the translator's preface, tells the reader and the student just what is valuable and -what is invaluable in the theories of political ecdnomy. Levasseur, he writes, is well fitted for his task through his long career as a student and teacher of political economy and his constant contact with the best minds in France.
In the introduction the author explains the object, purposes, and definition of political economy, its relation to other . sciences, the principal divisions, productive forces, &c. Then, in five sections, he treats of “ The Production of Wealth/* ** The Distribution of Wealth,” “ The Circulation of Wealth/’ “ Consumption/’ and " Finance." Portions of the treatise were written by M. I^evasseur for the translator; other additions and changes were made by the translator with the author's approval. The Macmillan Company is publishing the volume to-day.
