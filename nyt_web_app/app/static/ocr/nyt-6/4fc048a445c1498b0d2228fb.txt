British Trade Policy.
Miss Constance H. M* Archibald has translated Prof. Carl Johannes Fuchs’s ** The Trade Policy of Great Britain and her Colonies Since 1860.” The volume includes a preface by the Rt. Hon. J. Parker Smith, M. A.r M. P., at one time Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, it first appeared in Leipzig twelve years ago as the first publication issued by the Vereln fxir Sozlalpolitik on the trade policy of the different countries. It is an example of German methods of thought upon economic questions and German methods of treatment ot the problems which underlie the trade policy of a nation; it is, as Mr. Smith writes in his preface, " a sample of a large body of literature existing in Germany dealing with the trade policy of foreign States from a scientific point of view.” Prof. Fuchs writes in his prefatory note concerning the " Commercial Union ” of the British Empire:	‘
If the commercial union ot the British Empire is to eome at all, it will certainly, in the United Kingdom at least, be carried through mainly on political and not on economic grounds. And, in my opinion, it will not result in giving the mother country a higher commercial or Industrial position than she now holds, but simply in maintaining that which she has. Its economic effects, therefore, on Germany will not, to my mind, be so ! important and dangerous as I myself ; thought in 1803, since the union would, I under present circumstances, be primarily ! aimed at the United States, whose com- j petition is in fact, at the present time, 1 a much greater danger to the United . Kingdom than is that of German'*. • * * 1 A powerful British Empire, standing shoulder to shoulder with a powerful I German Empire, each with sufficient possessions oyer sea for her surplus popu- 1 lation and capital, might rule the world, and even yet succeed in saving it from < the g: owing predominance of 41 AmericanIsm an ihrem Wesen soil die Welt genesen!	.	.
