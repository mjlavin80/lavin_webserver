Literary Decadencc
yicir. Tori; Time* Booh Review:
X appreciate and respect Mr, Hairs evident sincerity. ■ It is no wonder, cither* that' with such sincerity he- should, be “unable to. perceive the; insincerity in those he defends. Turgehieff has'best'expressed the Idea that we see most readily in others the faults we have ourselves. A' surgeon who goes to the dissecting or operating table without earnestness is a monster; I claim Mr. Hall's dissectors alt do. That is sufficient answer to all his 'two columns.	:	.
But to defend myself against the hor-rlble accusations launched at me, caused.
I believe, by reading and answering my poor letter “ on the run,” permit , me-to mention a few of the authors whom'I consider more than merely clever who are manly, sincere, and beneficent, though, also, in my .opinion, immeasurably more clever than any of those jack o' lanterns before discussed. (The German ** Irr-Ilchter " describes them better.) In doing so. I may be again accused* of inconsistency, Inasmuch as these are also Europeans, but they are exceptions, and not Europeans in the sense I have meant. The term is used in Europe in a.sense few Americans are perhaps aware of.
Joseph Conrad's “ Lord Jim ’* and “ Typhoon ” seem to me most excellent dissecting work, but also most superior for character building. So also with nearly all his other books. George Gls~ sing was eminently sincere, ‘hnd'his “ Our Friend the Charlatan”- and *\Nether World ”-I consider two of the best novels of the last quarter century. ■
Above all. Pastor Charles Wagner's books, while religious, are *as lively, entertaining, and clever as any novels, and It is a curious popular mistake, started,
I believe, by a jack o* lantern reviewer, to place his *' Simple Life ’* in contrast to our strenuous life. His simple, life is the same as our strenuous life, only under somewhat different conditions. The same reviewer spoke of "The Better Way" as Wagner’s .second book, while It was about his twentieth book In French, and about his fourth or fifth translated into English.
I leave it to others better qualified than I am to enter the lists for American literature. I am too new to it. But my best argument may perhaps bo suggested in this little incident: One of my first American friends was a chubby little girl of five. She said to me one day, innocently and impressively:	'«	Mr.	C, you
told an untruth! M I exclaimed in surprise: *' No? ’■ ** Yes,” she sturdily maintained. “you promised you would do so and so. I argued against her lamely:
“ That was breaking a promise. One , cannot tell an untruth about the future."
! My logic might be sound, but I could not convince her. On the- contrary, she converted me, and to-day I, like her, regard a lightly broken promise as an untruth or at least as equally odious. I believe the great majority of even well-bred Euro. pean children do not learn that. Meeting [ young people from Europe to-day, I ! observe the same thing them: They make promises lightly, which they never | think of keeping. Therein lies the chief difference between the great mass of Americans and the great mass of Europeans. I may be wrong. This may be a cause of changa which has pleased, that I have simply fallen in with, and for the time fallen in love with the New England conscience!	COSMOPOLITAN.
