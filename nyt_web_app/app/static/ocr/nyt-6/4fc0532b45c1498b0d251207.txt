There are some annuals that_ have made themselves absolutely Indispensable—not a large number, possibly half a dozen— and one of them is The Statesman’s Tear Book, the forty-second annual number of which Is now out, under the editorship of Mr. J. Scott Keltie, who has sur pervised its preparatFbn for more than a dozen years.
In Grimm’s ..Tales was^a story of a maidev who became daUy^ipore beautiful. To some amateurs of ifiobght It was a question' hoW:tbeautlful :c(&ict-she become. It is much" the same wayJwitK^ilhe States-man^s ;Year Book; it-.has "£l^ays been good, it grows belter each'Vear; v^hen will Its improvement cease, . because "further betterment. is "impossible?	\
The.changes in. the Y,ear''Bopit J.his year are as usual . In matters .of--Retail. - The r Australian'Common wealth is^.tVcated more tfiatl formerly as an.enUty,'jtsr,frade re' port .being given, as -a.’, wholfr fii^6&ad of divided among', the yariojas .State'Sj^more space has'b^en givei} to permany- and less to the ;little Stia"tes%wJiich^Srovide Princes and Princesses* for ‘^aVrlage to those greater States; 'the; Chinese army reform is recorded—somewhat prematurely. It might seem; Cuba, of course, Is treated a J an independent State, but—
, a proof that tlie Year Bopk is not yet . so beautiful as it is to be—Mr. Keltie has not yet heard of the details of its Con-stitullon.'	.
1 The maps given in the Year Book are unusus&y interns ting.* The first of them shows the now military commands in the United Kingdom— commands seemingly formed on tlie lines of our own new divisions and departments; the second shows the new naval commands, by which the principal part of the British Navy will be around the .British .coasts Instead of scattered over the world. More important, however, is a series of maps showing where the United Kingdom gets its meat supply, its wheat, and its cotton. The last named shows the “ experimental areas ” now under cultivation, with the hope that In no long time Great Britain may be able to- raise her cotton in her own colonies, and not have to depend on us, on South America, and on China.	■ •	'
In ten years tlie size of The Statesman’s Year Book has increased by 275 pages, nearly one-fifth. Not a page of the book is unnecessary or can be spared.
