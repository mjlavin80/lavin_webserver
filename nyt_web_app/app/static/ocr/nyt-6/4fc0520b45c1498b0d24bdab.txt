lstrajive :8y^tem "has been written in -the1 well-founded Relief that, insplteof the many^books on theGovernment and con-sUtutionaV hlstoryf/'Vthere seems to,he a' j place for aeeneralsurveyofthe whole ficlfl of National admdnisti^tlon.” It is , concern^; solely" with the administrative aspects of the: Federal Goyenmxent;.that is,, with the executive department. The j powers of the Senate as an executive council-and the control of the House over the Administration are subjects which 1 properly fall within the scope of the work. . The Senate*-by its'control over treaties : and appointments, and the House, by its I general legislative arid financial .control, j are really participating in the work of ad- 1 mil15 strati on, and have to be considered, I but only from this point of view.
The greater*Tpart of the book deals with the administrative powers of the President, and shows how the work in the | various departments is carried, pn. The t chapter on the Cabinet describes the ex--tra legal-character of that body, which, composed of the heads of departments, is merely consultative and advisory, without | any political* responsibility for the acts j of the President. So far as there la any legal warrant for the existence of the | body we call the Cabinet* IMs to he found j in the Constitution, Article H„ Section 2, -! Paragraph 1. where- it is provided that the President ** may require the * opinion in writing of the principal officer in each of the executive departments, upon ^ny subject relating to the duties of their respective offices.*’ In its collective capacity it is without constitutional authorisation.
The Secretary of State ranks first among the Cabinet officers, and by the present law stands next to the Vice President in the succession to the Presidency. He is generally the strongest man in the Cabinet, and has not infrequently beer the most prominent rival for the nomination in the party nominating convention. His position, in the main, is to be compared with that of the' European Foreign Secretary,‘though he also performs “duties somewhat analogous to those of a Home Secretary and-Keeper of the Seals*
The powers and functions of the principal officers in the Treasury are discussed and an exposition of the Customs and Internal Revenue Services given, all brief, but verv much to the point.
In connection with the War Department, the work of ex-Secretary Root is referred to, and the recent development of civil administration for the territorial possessions of tlie United States, under the supervision of the department, is explained.
Tlie Bureau of Insular Affairs, which considers matters relating to the civil government of the Philippines, Is presided | over by an army officer, hut the Secre- ; tan' of War gives important matters his personal consideration.
The remaining departments of the Navy, Justice, the Post Office, the Interior, Agriculture, and Commerce and Labor arc admirably discusseJ.' and -there is a concluding chapter on “ Detached Bureaus," including the Inter-State Commerce Commission, the Civil Service Commission, | and the Library of Congress.
Kor the sake of those who desire to make a more complete study of the subject of National administration, a series of select bibliographies, in the form of chapter references, is furnished.
