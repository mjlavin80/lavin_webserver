HE preface of Prof. James H. HysJop’s “ Sfience and a 1 Future Life,” to be published j immediately by Messrs. Her- ; bert	B. Turner	& Co., begins I
with	a lament	that the very ,
members of the Society for Psychical Research do not read the long and elaborate reports which lie summarizes, and he declares, with some heat, that It is high time that such investigations as	the	society's	should be	endowed. A
complete	history	of the Piper case, with
incidents from the first English report, both of Dr. Hodgson’s reports and an account of Prof. Hyslop’s own experiments occupy a third of the book; they are followed by a consideration of the telepathic and " spiritistic ” hypotheses, the difficul-lies, objections, and special conditions af- I focting1 the *' communicants,” and everything is summed up in a chapter entitled Ethical Meanings and Results.” The car$. taken to eliminate any possibility of fraud and the character of the persons having-charge of the investigations justify the author's refusal to consider this aspect of the question, and he fatthfully records failures, and the unfavorable decisions of certain inquirers, and makes very little attempt to influence the reader.
With this book John Camden's " The Hundredth Acre ” will appear, and will be found to vary the monotony of ordinary stories of mysterious murder, for it describes a case in w.hich the circumstantial evidence against nearly all the characters is strong enough to convince many a Massachusetts jury. Both books are printed and bound with the care and taste characteristic of this firm.

It Is twenty-one years since Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. published Mr. Richard Grant White’s “ The Fate of Mansfield Humphreys,” with Us delightful imitation-"of Whitman, reprinted from The Atlantic, and now they are issuing " The Chief Poets of America," edited by Mr. Curtis'Hidden Page, and lo! Walt Whitman’s name follows all the rest— Bryant, Emerson, Longfellow, Whittier. Holmes, Lowell, and Poe. The contents of the volume are prescribed by the requirements of theAmertcan college course, and as all the poems, long or short, are printed without excision.
