HE,’first performance; oil any . stage1 cif Miss- Josephine Peabody's tragedy,-; “ Marlowe,**'' ^ whiclv toolc place at Cambridge this 'week, was an event-riot merely of local interest but of universal literary significance. Miss.Peabody is acknowledged to toe, If not the first, aUleast Vn the front rank of American poets. But the most enthusiastic admirers of. her poetry as such have been anxious to see one of her plays given the test of an- actual1 performance before predicting her future as a dramatist.
It Is now nearly four years since “ Marlowe,** her second play, was published, and although there have been several suggestions for a dramatic pr6S* entation, It has remained for ftadcllffe College to have the honor of ** setting this dramatic jewel.
It was eminently appropriate,. Miss Peabody berself being a former Rad-cllffe student, that her play should have been chosen to dedicate the new college stage and auditorium. But it is more significant that the choice was the suggestion ot Prof. George P. Balter of Harvard, one of the heads in the English department of the university, and a noted connoisseur Of the drama; moreover, that Prof. Baker should enthusiastically have assumed the part of Marlowe, while two other Harvard professors were prominent
in the distribution of rfiles. .
The play was beautifully set and admirably acted, and' its cordial reception by a sympathetic and cultured audience was assured. But taicen solely on Its own merits, “ Marlowe ” was a brilliant surprise to every one, even to those who knew it best, between pasteboard covers. Th© careful stagecraft—acquired intuitively It would seem, since Miss Peabody can know little of the actual stage the glowing situations and clever “ business/' the steady growth of interest and powerful climax produced a thrilling effect. It Is not, as some have prophesied, a mere olever psychologic study exquisitely phrased and dramatic only In form. It Is a strong and vital play, based upon deep human interest and showing much insight into character, moving with virile force to the Inevitable end.
Where the simple little Boston maid should have acquired the wide range of human knowledge from which this play Is drawn is a mystery. Kay, it is your greatest mystery—1Genius, which is acquainted with neither time nor place nor experience. The production of “Marlowe '* has proved that the outlook of poetic drama for the twentieth century Is safe. "While we have one such poet among us we need not despair.
" Marlowe ” is a flve-act tragedy, In six scenes, and is very long—too long for practical professional use. To shorten it some of the most effective scenes would have to be cut, some of the most beautiful lines lost. But it might be done without, at least, injuring the dramatic effectiveness; probably to the contrary, especially in the first and second acts. These same acts .contain some of tile loveliest poetry In the play, as well as one of the most telling scenes, that in which Alison, the sweet and simple little country maid, is enchanted by her first glimpse of life and poesie and love in the player’s verse, as he sings for her tbe famous madrigal—
** Come, live with me and be my love.”
The scenes of the reveling playwrights and the clever characterization of each are remarkable bits of reconstruction, while the subtle and delicate humor here, as throughout the play, shows Miss Peabody’s versatility, and like all else gains in the actual presentation.
The third act, with Its wonderful variety of tone and temper, has one of the finest dramatic episodes, coming unexpectedly, yet naturally evolved from previous “ business **; that in which Marlowe the denier is jestingly accused of being plague-infected, and Is scored with the sacred? sign, which is also the-warnings

-	West, west.

Ay, Summer moon!
The last act, tense and rapid, as tast ■ acts should be, is-psychologically perhaps the least convincing of the five; but the closing lines, the keynote of the drama, are very moving. The whole plot, original . and fresh In theme and treatment, Is also -wonderfully ingenious, embodying as It does the few historic facts of Marlowe s short and obscure life; his probable friends; his verse; his enemy and tra~ ducer Bame; the formal accusation of atheism; his obscure, tragic death in a low tavern brawl. Around such a slender trellis Miss Peabody has twined the flowers of her fancy and her faith, making a brave and beautiful showing of her art.
'Marlowe, the roistering Elizabethan poet and blasphemer, a shadowy figure of long ago, bas been revivified and reinterpreted by a young modern play-: .wright. And those at least who saw him live and move In the touching scenes of this drama must feel convinced that now at least they know the secret motive, the whole truth about
that glorious madman,
Born to consume (himself) anon in ashes, And vise again to Immortality.
