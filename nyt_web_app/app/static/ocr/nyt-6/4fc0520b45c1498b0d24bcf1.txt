ERE is an authoritative and complete account of the Royal Academy, an institution that has played an important part in the last hundred years of British art. The statement of what that part has boon would differ very widely from different authorities on the subject. But there is no -need of taking up a controversial attitude in considering this book. The authors have avoided any such attitude* and the book is onp intended chiefly to convey facts drawn from original sources —the only one of the kind, in fact, since Sandby's book, which appeared in 1SG2. The history is not brought down later than lXiO, so there is no dangerous ground to tread upon, but the statistical information contained in the appendices is practically complete to the beginning of the present year.
There is an account of the foundation of the Academy, preceded by a review of the condition of art In England at that time, and then follow chapters devoted to the successive Presidents, the first executive officers and professors, and notices of the several academicians elected down to the end of Sir Thomas Lawrence’s Presidency, with brief discussions of their works. The appendix gives the text of the document called “The Instrument," under which, as approved by George HI., the academy was founded; lists of academicians, with the date of their birth, election as associates and as academicians, and their death: of associates who have not become academicians; of officers, professors, and honorary members; of diploma works, and other works; of students, who have obtained gold medals and traveling scholarships, and of works bought under the Chantrey Bequest.
The introductory chapter on early art In England makes it seem clear that art in England down to the beginning of the eighteenth century was in much the same case as snakes_ in Ireland. Such art as there was was talked of, but it was considered exclusively an Italian product, and as late as the middle of that century Horace Walpole could write that England owed all it possessed In art to Holbein and Vandyke. It may be said to have been permanently established when George I. came to the throne, but it was a graft and not a native product. The first school for teaching art was set up by a certain Sir James Thornhill, with whom Hogarth had worked, and with whose daughter. It may be observed, he eloped, these two facts being his only title to remembrance. Then In 1734 Hogarth himself started a school for the study of the nude, whtcH flourished thirty years. In the next succeeding years there was an agitation for a Royal Academy, for a considerable time fruitless. The germ of the Academy was a charitable exhibition of pictures which was attended by such a throng as to suggest to the painters of London the idea of holding an annual exhibition of their works and charging an admission fee. The hundred pounds that resulted " revealed a new source of wealth, a money-making power hitherto unknown-" That was in 1760; the following year that happened which has so often happened since—the artists came to loggerheads and there was a split. One of the two parties soon vanished from history; the other, the Society of Artists, was finally absorbed into the Academy, which was itself the product of a secession: for In 1768 we find a number of the most eminent members of the society withdrawing and petitioning the King to found a Royal Academy. There were trouble and delay—Reynolds's aloofness being the chief cause of them. But Benjamin West was sent to wrestle with him, and when he returned to the meeting with Reynolds in tow the assembled artists rose in a body and hailed him " President." The signing by the King of the " Instrument," still the charter of the Academy, launched It, and in January, 1769, the first Academy exhibition was held.
The Academy is bound by the Instrument. In return for the royal patronage, which consists In supplying it with rooms and paying all deficiencies, to give free instruction in painting, sculpture, and architecture; to endow professorships, give prizes and certain charltablo benefactions, the funds to be provided out of the profits of the annual exhibition. Tho professorships are of anatomy, architect* urc, painting, perspective, and geometry, to which have later been added ancient literature, ancient history, and chemistry, but only six lectures a year are required from each. The Instrument also solemnly provides for a porter of the Royal Academy and a sweeper of the Royal Academy and fixes their salaries. .
The early history of the Academy Is not without its amusing episodes; as, for instance, the doings of tho incorrigible
Nathaniel Hone, -who sent a satirical picture caricaturing two mdnks carousing, and was desired on account of religious scruples to alter the crucifix therein represented, which resulted in some sharp correspondence. The same painter also sent, another year, a caricature of Reynolds—so it was supposed to be—representing him as an old man performing incantations by which a number of prints and sketches from which Reynolds, it was insinuated, had plagiarized, were made to float around his head. Among the sketches was a nude female figure, which, it was suggested, was intended for Angelica Kauffmaa. Reynolds was willing to pass over his share in t*he satire, but the outraged lady wrote that her own pictures must be sent home if that was exhibited. Hone disavowed the intention charged against him, and offered to put a beard on the offending figure, but even this failed to convince Miss Kauffman,
There was another pretty quarrel with Gainsborough, who sent a picture of the royal family with a written hint that " if it is hung above the line he never more while he breathes will send another picture to the Exhibition. This he swears by God." The committee hung it as he desired, but when next yeu.r he sent another with a similar demand the committee sent it back. And he never exhibited again. Most exciting of all is the controversy with Reynolds, resulting in his temporary withdrawal from the Academy —a controversy that has been thoroughly exploited in the biographies. Of the artists who pass afterward through the records of the society the most Interesting are West, Flaxman, Turner, Wilkie, Copley, and Washington Allston. It must be confessed that there is a pretty dreary record of mediojprlty In the notices of most of the painters who had the right to sign R- A. or A R. A after their names. But as a record of the most important institution of British art, even If not of the most potent artistic influence in Britain, this record has much that Is valuable and interesting.
