For some .years past occasional articles on military hygiene and related subjects have been appearing: in the more important medical journals over the signature of Charles^ E. Woodruff, and the comparatively few "unprofessional readers to whose attention they came have noted that these articles possessed an originality of thought, a willingness to follow observed facts wherever they led, without regard to accepted theories, and an energy and lucidity of diction that set the author apart as a mftn likely some day to make an important contribution to the literature of science.
“ The Effects of Tropical Light on White Men," which has recently been published by the Rebman Company of this city, more than justifies the highest of these expectations. Whether it is a great book, or even a true book, is a question not to be decided hastily—except, perhaps, by the specialists in anthropology and medicine whose very axioms it audaciously attacks, and what their Instant judgment will be is not hard to guess—but undoubtedly it is a book full of interest, the product of much intelligent thought, and sure, if It can only get the attention it deserves, to start all over the world a discussion which can hardly fail to have, one way or another, results of the most important kind.
Maior Woodruff, who is a surgeon in the United States Army with much practical experience in Cuba, the Philippines, and in our own West and South, began the collection of material for this book with the modest intention of laying down better rules for protecting the health of our soldiers in garrison and camp, especially when in the tropics. This task he has accomplished—to his own convincing, however it may bp as to that »*f ihv officials of ono son or	npon

From observation - of . present phenomena and study of those recorded in history—recorded, he' says, by men; who had not even* a suspicion of what the phenomena meant—he has reached the conclusion that the really and safely habitable portion the earth for any-race of men is narrowly limited by the adaptation of the color of .their skins, effected by the slow elimination of the unfit, to the energy with which that ♦
portion of the earth is bombarded by short-length or actinic light waves. Only the negro, he declares, Is at home in the tropics, the brown races thrive a little further north* and south, the brunettes are the natural inhabitants of most of the zone called temperate, and the true blonds will always invite ultimate extermination when they remove from the cold and cloudy regions, like the Baltic provinces and Northwestern America, with .which their derma] pigmentation—or lack of It—is in harmony. His illustrations of this theory are many and impressive. They include those whom we know as the Greeks and Homans, the long procession of alien rulers in Kgypt and India, and, most immediately interesting to us, the influence of our own climate on immigrants from Northern and Southern Europe. Major Woodruff does not deny—he asserts—the possibility of white men governing the tropics in the future, as in the past, but he says that they cannot ever become " acclimated " there, cannot ever perpetuate their kind there for more than a few generations, and must be content with short periods of service, with longer periods for rest and recuperation In their natural home.
This is only an outline—hardly more than a hint—of Major Woodruff's accomplishment, as distinguished from j the purpose indicated by the title of his ! hook. In a letter which The New York d^iMEs printed the other day he seemed , disposed to insist that the title was a ! good one, but it would have been vastly Improved if he had crossed out of it i the words " Tropica] M and •* White/*
