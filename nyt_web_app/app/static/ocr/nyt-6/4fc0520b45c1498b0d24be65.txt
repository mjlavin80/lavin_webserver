series of sonnets from ^ J* Which Mr. Bradford has drawn the title for his new collection of poems la devoted chiefly to the commemoration of writers and cities ^oC the mighty past, thus communicating to- the reader a pleasing sense oi familiarity with great names. His choice is catholic; we have j not only Greek and Roman worthies, but saints and Fathers of the Church, paint- | ers. poets, and philosophers, and. even critics as the subjects of his discrimina- j ling verse. Although he occasionally j sinks into such banality as is indicated j by the opening lini of the sonnet to Theocritus, " The country life of poets Is so sweet," his muse'is on the whole sturdy eind self-respecting. The lines to Menander sufficiently express the best hopes of a later age than his, and with a felicitous manipulation of the sonnet form:
The mighty days were gone and the mere lees	'
Of poetry snd song alone were left. Athens, of glory and high place bereft, , ForgdT her Phidias and her Sophocles.
Yet thou, content with lesser palm than these
Didst frame with careful grace thy comic w€ft*
With easy raiilery and conduct deft At once couldst charm the sage, the vulgar please.
A mellow wisdom through thy pages
Not shaking laughter, holding both his
siaes
But such sweet wit as meditation guides,	. . .
Just tempered with the pause of him wno knows	.	.	„„
That human life and 2ova are light as
Till weighted with the leaden thought of death.
The critic, no doubt, should be grateful for even so cold a reception by the creative mind as that accorded him in the sonnet of &ainte-Beuve, the octave of which is admirable in sentiment and expression. For the answer to the sestet’s question
Yet, after all, how much can knowledge give!	,

we respectfully refer the solicitous in-ciuirer to Mutthew Arnold’s “ Essay on Criticism,’* to the essay by Mr. James on the ^ime rich subject, and to Mr. Worley’s ’‘Macaulay*’;
The final sonnet on the sonnet deserves to rank with Rossetti's ‘*A Moments Monumenu” and even with Wordsworth s incomparable	—
“ Nuns fret not at their convent’s narrow

not fov perfection of form or wealth and appropriateness of metaphor, but for the Meredithian tribute to “ the star of laughter and the star of love."
•	The inspiration of Miss Twiggs is altogether different from that of Mr. Bradford. Although she owes an indebtedness to Horace In her free and lyrical “ Ad Magistrum" and in a charming paraphrase, “ Simplicity," and apostrophizes of all honeyed painters the artful Greuze, her nmse belong frankly to Ireland. The hills, the sea, the bogs, the sunset and dawn, she celebrates in verse that is sincere and frequently moving. She omits the popuiar impassioned protest against present conditions and the political past, she omits the legends and the myths, and sings only the earthly charms of the green island. The sky and the soil breathe beatitudes for her, and she beholds the flowers and cliffs and fields through an atmosphere trf golden sentiment. Canon Sheehan, who vrrites the introduction, complains with a bitter note of the continual exodus in Ireland from the country to the city. " The Celt,” he says, 41 who could not spon^a day on the mountain heather, or beside a silver stream, or on the ramparts of Aran overlooking the eternal sea, is no longer a Celt. And the aversion to country life, the dislike of its peace, the impatience of its innocence, and the ignorance of its blessings and attractions, is the evil and bitter thing that lies at the root of ail those sad alterations in tbe*i>pirit of our people, that are burthen-ing with much pain and foreboding the clearest and deepest thinkers of the times.” He welcomes any voice that will call these recalcitrant children of Erin back to their long lonely fields and mysterious hills, and in the verse of Miss Twiggs he recognizes such a voice—a recognition not certainly unjustified by the appealing melodies in her little volume. The “ Song of a Bog " is characteristic not only of her spirit but of the simplicity of her technical effort:
The hills are bare and the bogs are brown The chilly rain comes falling down,

But sweeter than lark in a Summer , sky -To me is the curlew's cry!. ...	'	.v
So, kisses cool of the western wind'
A wonderful joy in you I findi -To others so cold, to me so kind, „
O	breath or tho brown bog wind! .
Bogs and rain and the chilling; wind All o’ the world I’d leave behind, '
All o' the world with willing mind To follow the wand’ring wind!
For I am one with the curlews wild,
And weary am I of manners mild,
And I'm coming forever to rest,, your child,	,
In the heart of the bogland wild In my'home on the bQgland.wild:
Miss Twiggs regrets her inability to send forth these songs of . Ireland in the Irish tongue, a regret that will,be shared by but few of her readers. In this day of imitative verse and scant originality we cannot afford to lose the influence of one whose note is her own, whose Joy and whose sorrow are so obviously felt as experience and not as ** copy."
It is not, however, in Ireland alone that exodus from country to town and the still more demoralizing exodus from town to country is made the subject of vehement remonstrance. • A London writer of “ vers de society" elngs a vociferous ditty on , the various characteristics of a complicated modern civilization, especially enjoying his playful but far from trifling tribute to the genius of publicity and the science of r6clan». Together with a good deal of claptrap, slang, and metrical vulgarity, is displayed a sufficiently acute observation supported by a less highly ; developed talent for satire. The lines entitled " A Look Ahead ” refer to the opinion held by certain philosophers that England’s future will be social rather than industrial; that culture, gayety, and luxury will abound, and that Great Britain will be In Lord Rosebery’s words “ the playground and the pleasaunce of the plutocrats of all nations/’ Reflecting on this possibility, the poet depicts the attractions of the new era, to turn from them with this final melodious wail of renunciation:
I cannot but divine With sorrow The ruial England of to-morrow,
When, deserts all the fields and downs,
The laborers huddle in the towns;
No sturdy yeoman plows the land,
' Or gathers in the new-mown hay;
His sons have sought some foreign strand. His farm is falling to decay,
And in the Squire’s old easy chair Reclines the new-fledged millionaire.
The scanty remnants Jf the peasants Nor sheep ncr cattle rear, but pheasants;* Flunkies, in place of rustic Hodges,
Tenant Lhe cottages and lodges;
The chauffeur with his motor car.
And well-armed guardians of the game-Of Midas all dependents are;
And, If the little street-bred folk Contented wear his easy yoke.
Why Who shall say they are to blame?
In countryside, upon the shore.
Rise pleasure centres by the score,
And love of bustle, change, and noise The love of hearth and home expels;
We live in scorn of rural joys, •
A nomad life in big hotels.
Some of us, nevertheless, who would most unwillingly own to a scorn of rural joys, have a modicum of sympathy with the cockney spirit and vibrate more or less to the attractions of town pictures. Miss Anna Hempstead Branch is extremely fortunate in her descriptions of life In studios and courts, and strikes a deeply poetic note in her unpretentious drama of the time of Watteau which she calls " The Shoes That Danced." It is tempting to exaggerate her qualities as a poet, so haunting are the pictures she makes of sad and gay humanfty and the fleeting pleasures of the world in which dreams and gold continually wrestle wiLh one another. In a poem- called flic Riders ’’ she manages to accomplish the miracle of recalling mediaeval French poetry without suggesting Browning or Morris; her lines " To a New York Shop Girl Dressed for Sunday ’’ do vaguely bring: to mind Rossetti’s “ Jenny," but have their own charm as well, a certain womanly pitifulness and appreciation of the subtle beauties tlint assnil the heart in the midst of common and vulgar sights. It is not a performance to mutilate by fragmentary quotation, and in spite of its extraordinary, irregular, and personal loveliness we must pass it by in ' favor of this sonnet called ** Sweet Wearl-, ness," that shows' one delicate side of it3 1 author's delicate talent, conspicuous In its sensitiveness to tlie beauty of shades:
! Fatigue itself may be a pleasant thing And weariness be silken, soft, and fine! Upon mv eyes its little vapors shine. Trailing me softly like a colored wing! Tender as when beloved voices sing It steals upon me and with touch divine Lulls all my sense till each thought of mine
Is hushed to quiet, unremembering.
Oh. weariness thrice dear, so frailly spun Of ended pleasure that still shines and glows;
Oh, weariness, thrice dear! What hare I done
To earn this delicate and deep repose?
“ Child, thou hast worshipped at the setting sun
And looked long, long, upon the opening rose."
