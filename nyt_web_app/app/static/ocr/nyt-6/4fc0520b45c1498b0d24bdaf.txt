Drink and Female Frenzy.
CONSTANCE WEST. By E. R. Punshon. l2mo. Pp. iX>3. New York: John Lane. ? 1 ■ GO.
A woman scorned can toe a very unpleasant creature, and this booTt seems designed to exhibit her at her worsj. To be sure, Mrs. Constance West had some ■'reason for bitterness; her husband, crazed by drink, had knocked her down and blinded her of one eye, and for the offense hacU*been sent to the penltentiary-
That was some thirty years ago In England. The story introduces a small woman of middle age who Is getting off the train in a Western village, Tyhere her ex-convict husband, John, (whom she's not seen all those years,) 1b striving to mend bis broken life and advance the cause of prohibition. She is minded to forgive John and be a loving wife to him again—but she finds he has a daughter by v another woman. The latter is luckily dead, for Mrs. Constance embarks on a mad career of revenge. She takes service as housekeeper at the village hotel, and there plots, first, to tempt John to drink again, second to cheat a young man who loves John’s daughter into making a beast of himself, third to bum down John’s house and haystacks and wlpo out the results of twenty years of toll.
Meantime mine host of the village hotel has fallen in love with Mrs. West, because of which (and also because she is an excellent cook and housekeeper) he
is her slave* 'He is further interested in the lady's diabolical schemes because the Prohibitionists are trying to take away his license, and John is the leader of those well-meaning but dangerous people. In the end tlie young man who loves the girl is hit over the head with an axe, and poor John, who has meekly admitted that his wife had every right to destroy anything he had—has in fact sat patiently by her, side .without an effort to save them, while she gloated over hts burning homestead—gets filled full of buckshot by the hotel keeper, who thereafter sets fire to his hotel and turns tramp. It’s a frenzied story—but doesn’t seem to have quite sufficient excuse for existence.
