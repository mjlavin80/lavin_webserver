E. P. Dutton & Co. have acquired thg American, rights of ** The Evolution of an English Town," in which Gordon Home, author of books on the Cities of Fam-ham and Epsom, *' What to See in England," &c., ail illustrated by himself, tells the story of the ancient town of Pickering, In Yorkshire, from prehistoric times ; down to the beginning of 1905. As he says In his first chapter:
I have endeavored to produce a com- I plete series of pictures commencing with the Ice Age and finishing at the dawn of the twentieth century. In the earlier chapters only a rough outline is possible, but as we come down the centuries and I the records become more numerous and ! varied, fuller details can be added to the ; pictures of each age, and we may witness how much or "how little the great 1 series of dynastic, constitutional, religious, and social changes affected a district that is typical of many others in the remoter parts of England.
In the course of the history tho author describes some of the finds now in the 1 local museum, literary associations, &c. There are many illustrations from drawings by Mr. Home, as well as a bibliogra- ! phy, and a list of the vicars of Pickering from 1150 down to the installation, in 1902, of E. W, Drage, who has written a short introduction for the book. There is, besides, a sketch map of the Pickering district. Further, numerous extracts from ancient and comparatively modern documents have been given.
