An idea of tfre scope of Oscar Terry Crosby's volume oh " Tibet and Turkestan,” which G. P. Putnam's Sons will publish shortly, may be had from the | following description of it:
A recital of the 3oys &nd perils of travel in hidden lands; a carcful state* ment of existing political knd social conditions in the little-known heart of Asia;
, a fair, criticism of British policy in Tibet; an important contribution to a knowledge of Russian and Cbinese'characteristics as exemplified In the Government of the two Turkestans; a study of the effects upon I human -society of climatic and religious ' influences at work throughout the vast region traversed from the Caspian Sea, through Turkestan and Northwestern Tibet to Kashmir.
| The author .is well fitted to write such a Look, having acquired knowledge and | sympathy ' for ‘ the people whom he describes by’previous travel In Somaliland,
! Abyssinia, and*'the Soudan, and he shows the. white man's methods and the dark man's difficulties:	Among	the incidents
of which he writes are the comforts of ti ■ bazaar, life In uninhabited wastes, where for forty days no man was seen; the intense heat of the Taklamakan deserts, the cold" experienced In traveling over glaciers, &c. The illustrations in the book are from photographs, and present views and scenes in Bokhara.- Samarcand, Au-dijan, Kashgar, Khotan, I*adok X6, Sriria-' gar, the Altai and' Himalayan' Mountains, and the Tibetan'Plateau, .
