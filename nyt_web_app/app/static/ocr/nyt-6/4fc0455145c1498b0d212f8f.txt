Henry" 'I>aiirehs,' ’ George . Washington,: ;!PatrickJ.;He:niry,£anil'; Ja^^-Madison^ are among the’other writers of Prof.' Trent's -: first; period. J Those, of his second period;; ^1700-18<>5,Include a few whose names we-do not; generally associate with literature, but who knew well'how* to set'down their, thoughts and Ideas plainly, such as Davy Crockett, (whose account of his opposition to Jackson and his defeat for' Congress is full of living spirit,) and Sam Houston, whose description of the battle of San Jacinto Prof. Trent quotes. Chief Justice Marshall, Parson Weems, William Wirt, Key, the author of “The Star-Spangled Banner *’; Richard Henry Wlldo, Robert Young Hayne,, M. B. La-ihar, Charles Gayarrd, Gilmore Simms, and Horseshoe Robinson Kennedy belong to this extended period, as well as Poe,‘ TImrod, Paul H. Hayne, and John Esten Cooke, from whose writings, prose and verse, Prof. Trent has made suitable selections. But he has also Included the South’s great men in statecraft and military leadership of this epoch. All that he quotes is surely hot literature.	'
He has a separate department for the poets of the civil war, and a third period, 1866-1904, In which we find R* M. Johnston, Sidney Lanier, G. W, Cable, Joel C. Harris, Miss Murfree, James Lane Allen, Irwin Russell, Thomas N. page, and Walter H. Page. He finds room, also, for a group of the younger Southern poets of the present hour. From Capt. John Smith to Madisony3awein, the period Is as long as the history of English settlement on the Western Continent, and as broad, one may say, as the Atlantic Ocean. For each author there is a biographical note. Prof. Trent’s handbook may be confidently recommended to all students of American literature. North or South.
Prof. W. P. Trent’s handbook of selections in prose and verse called “ Southern Writers " (published by the Macmillan Company) is comprehensive in its scope, and probably the compiler’s hope that it Will not be " regarded as a sectional product in the unpleasant sense of that term ” will be realized. His idea that the youth of the South ought to have the opportunity to study the writers of their own region in detail is perfectly sensible. Prof. Trent’s boofc ie intended, of course, for schools, but it will find its uses elsewhere, too.
