Holders of French UteraM***c have gained from a great many sources much information concerning- the characteristic French domestic triangle of which Victor Hugo was the apex—to his inspiration, his recreation, and possibly, very often, to his embarrassment. That there was much more in this triangle, however, than others of similar nature may be gathered from the historical fact that it retained its symmetry for half a century. *
The attachment of Juliette Drouet for the great French poet and romancer is among the paradoxes of love. Its duration, it nothing else, makes it so. Another remarkable feature of the attachment is that it seemed to grow more intense, both humanly and spiritually, as time passed, and even to lift itself from the commonplaceness and triviality which gave it birth, and, in the end, to be tolerated if not smiled upon by conventionality and respectability. All the more reason, therefore, for bearing in mind the fact that unconventionally and defiance of society are the weaknesses and not the virtues of a great man, however poetically and romantically clever writers may have blended them with his greatness.
These things are worth reconsidering by everybody, who, for a variety of reasons, may be attracted to the bunch of love letters written by Juliette Drouet to Victor Hugo, unearthed by Henry Wellington Wack, a New York lawyer, in the Island of Guernsey and published by him in attractive editorial setting and with an introduction by that excellent poet and crazy* politician, Francois CoppGe. Of
course, the latter declares that.Mr. Wack i has done a proper thine: In dragging these frailties from their dread abode. Otherwise he would not have written the in-1 troduction, which, however, is interesting for other reasons—it abounds in those
" con tea, intimes *' which French Writers know so well how to fabricate. In such circumstances and under such auspices we are not astonished to find Mr. Wack comparing the attachment with the love of Burns for Jean Armour and with Nelson’s, relations to Lady Hamilton, but his continued parallel narrowly escapes being ridiculous with the added cases of Abelard and Heloise. of Petrarca and Laura, of Dante and Beatrice. The attachment in question, however, may, up to a certain point, have impressed Mr. Wack as being a composite passion of the paradigms cited. He may be right. He is certainly right in describing Mme. Hugo’s attitude toward the said attachment as the most remarkable in the domestic relations of the great.	■
We doubt *f these jptters indicate Ot* suggest anything about Hugo that has not been indicated, suggested, or imparted before. As a series of human documents showing the developmf-nt of a. woman's intelligence, judgments, impressions, end emotions they am in valuable to students of psychology. Juliette is quite of the conventior.al type when she writes to Hugo in 1U31>:	“ Do not trouble
yourself about me. Do not persist obstinately In a generosity, perhaps prejudicial zo your interests, which are dear to me, ani to those of your family, which are sacred." What a fine Parisian touch that last phrase has! Nearly a quarter of a centur> later, we have the following:	“ Think of my love, so pro-
found, so pure, and so devoted, and wlsll I were with thee. I am going to bed, rrayin^ God for thee end thine. I trust my prayers will not be fruitless, as I am asking for their happiness and thine, should it be at the cost of my own life.** This helps us to understand Mr. WacK’S comparisons, if not Mme. Hugo's complacence. A score of years later we find Juliette expressing herself in a fine burst of amorous jealousy which savors of the street or of the hearth—you can take your choice—added to which we are not surprised to find this postscript: *4 It is over I am no lon&er foolish. I love you, believe in you. All the rest is noticing, provided you Jove me and Jove no other." This postscript reminds one of one once penned by the poet to his lawful spouse after a letter in about the same utrain; “Adieu; pardon this Illegible writing, and accept a thousand kisses from your poor husband, from your Victor." What are called the "human" qualities of a great man certainly reached a very high point of development in Victor Hugo.	•
As Victor Hugo, being a poet and a ro^ raanccr. seemed to disdain nothing which was poetical and romantic, so nis admirers need disdain nothing which may serve to elucidate these characteristics In him. The genuine importance of Mr. Wack’s publication may bo best appraised by those who believe that the individual la arreatcr than his limes and customs.
