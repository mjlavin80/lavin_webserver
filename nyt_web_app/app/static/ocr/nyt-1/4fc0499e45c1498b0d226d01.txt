RUSSIA.
Wolf von Schierbrand Reviews:** Th® Land of Riddles," by Hugo Ganz.*
HIS book is the fruit of a visit to Russia' lasting1 several months and undertaken by the .author early in 1004 for the purpose of making a face-to-face study of some of the main phases of Russian life* The author is a German Journalist now settled in Vienna, and a number of the chapters making up this book appeared some time ago in German newspapers, creating quite a deal of attention because of their uncompromising frankness. In its present English dress the book con* tains, however, much additional matter, and some of it valuable. O: course it cannot be expected that Herr Ganz within so short a space should have solved all the riddles of Uie land he describes; neither does he pretend to have done so. But his newspaper training has stood him In good stead in his task. By dint of a keen vis* Jon and of indefatigable personal inquiry he has indeed fathomed some of the ap-parerit contradictions and anomalies in Russian life. Furthermore, he states throughout the truth boldly, as he sees it, and in most cases gives his authority, or authorities, for his facts and conclusions, He was still in St. Petersburg when the war broke out with Japan, and until his departure, some weeks later, he found everybody he interrogated on tho subject ardently desirous of Russian de* feat. On the face ot it this is very strange, but as one reads one of his interviews after the other, had with men of liberal tendencies as well as With con* servatlves and high Government officials, one's amazement vanishes.
One of the leading St. Petersburg lawyers, for instance, answered the question, What hope is there for the future? with:
Everything depends upon how this war ends. If God helps us and we lose the war, improvement is possible; for then ruin, above all, the chronic bankruptcy of the nation, cun no longer be concealed. II a man should enter tny room now--Ut tnlS ’ hour only respectable persons enter my room-and I should say to him: What do you hone and wish in regard to the war. his answer would be: Defeat; the only means lo save us. If we calculate how many men are shot and exfled, and how many families are ruined every year by absolutism, the total equals the losses in war—a more terrible one, however, for only a catastrophe can make an end of this war, which has long been destroying us. Therefore I say again, if God helps us we shall lose the war in the Bast. Do not allow yourself to be deceived by any official preparations. Every good Rus-gjon prays:	God	help	us	and	permit	us
to be beaten! *’
And when the author, later on, paid a visit to Count —■—, a Conservative and a high Government official, that gentleman said to him: " What have you heard? "
“ That Russfa is starving, while the papers report a surplus in the treasury.” That, unfortunately, Js true.”
"That your thinking people are in despair."
•• j^iso true.'*
" That a revival of the Reign of Terror is to be feared."
" Equally true.”
" That all Russia hopes the war will be lost, because only in that way can the present state of things be brought to an end."
" True again."
■* That your present regime passes all bounds of depravity and can be compared only with the Pretorian rule in the period of the decline ot Rome.”
“ That understates the truth.”
Singular—nay, astounding—Is it not to hear a high " Government official" admit this much? But the author, without exception, met with similar responses wherever he inquired, But, no— 'there was one exception, an old-fashioned Russian kupetz (shopkeeper) in Moscow, who answered the~~question as to what he thought of the war in the " old-fashioned ” Russian way: “ We have no business to be thlnkiwr about this war, but only to obey-God and the Czar.**
The author proceeds to give a string of anecdotes and little stories illuminating the present " system.” He attended the funeral of a noted Russian writer. Of course, it was conducted under strict police surveillance, and one of the higher police officials present said: "It is not the business of the police to maintain order, but only to keep people under surveillance.” One of the professors attending this funeral was afterward exiled. The author says: “ 1, however, carried away with me from MiKhailovski's grave the certainty that the coming generation is lost to the reaction. Young Russia, In so far as it possesses an academic education, Is liberal, both the men and the women. And thus that funeral day was for me the most hopeful day that I had lived in Russia”
The two chapters devoted to the Jewish problem in Russia arc most enlightening. About tlio Hebrew subject of the Czar he says: ‘‘His intelligence, his sense of justice, are offenses against the sacred order of things, which demands stupidity and obedience. Thus exists the entirely in-

comprehensible condition that a great realm steers toward inevitable economic ruin for lack-of economic intelligence, while It possesses., 5,000,000 born financiers/ who in the lifetime of a man could change Russia into an economic world power.”	_
As the sovereign remedy for the present Jewish question he proposes the abolishment of all restrictive laws, and to open to the Jews .the interior of the country, as well as all occupations which they might wish to enter. That would give to Russia “ Just what it lacks—an intelligent middle class capable of culture." But no does not think this will come to pass, for, says he: "The Jewish question will long remain unsolved, for whom could tho Russian officials bleed It not the tormented, worried, defenseless Jews? "
The examples the author gives of tho *' system ” as a. whole show it in all of its abhorrent features, A '* system ” of government which permits such fearful outrages against common decency and morality as are outlined on Pages 163 and 1W; which encourages such wholesale stealing as that mentioned on Page 188-Grand Duke Pot or Nlcholaevitch himself Involved in a ° steal" amounting to 8,000,000 rubles; such perversion of justice as spoken of on Page 218, and such wrongful persecution of high-minded and courageous lawyers as Instanced in the case of Dr. Lokoloff, of Kishincff trial fame, is, take it all in all, a blot on civilization. The motto for the life of tho mouzhik and of the humbler classes generally the author found to be contained in the telltale Russian proverb: “ Duck, little brother, duck; everything passes away!" He says that these poor brutalized Russian masses have even lost all notions of justice, but take the horrible oppression or the Government as they lake a hailstorm or a drought—as something that cannot be avoided.
Of interest, too, is what the author has to say of the academic youth of Russia. A noted Russian university professor told him; "At present there is no studying done at our universities; politics swallows up everything.” And further: " The universities are only political camps, awaiting the call to arms, and nothing more.” When the war broke out with Japan the author was in St. Petersburg. He witnessed, and now describes, the methods used by ine Russian police to manufacture " patriotic outbursts ” in public places, such as theatres, conceit halls, &c, Until thus "prodded” and “goaded *’ into patriotic fervor the audiences everywhere received the news of Japan's attack on Port Arthur either with perfect indifference or else with the outspoken wish that their own troops would be defeated. In the chapters devoted to Russian finances the author exposes tlie " Juggling " with the budget figures which has been a regular feature of official Russia since the days of Wishnegradski, the man preceding Witte, and shows, on the strength of facts furnished him by leading Russian financiers themselves, what a bubble is tho whole of Russia's foreign credit. Incidentally he also unco\*ers the system of bribing and “ Influencing " the press, both In Russia and abroad, for the purpose of inflating or maintaining the ” borrowing power ” of the country. These chapters, indeed, are worth a careful study by all who wish to get at the mil facts about Russian finances.
There are probably some persons who never so much as heard before the name of Ryepfn: yet Herr Gan2 devotes a whole chapter to him In order to prove that Ryopin is the greatest of Russian artists. His painting?, drawings, etchings, and sculptures have never got beyond Russia. For thirty years past this man has been creating masterpieces, and the world was never aware of it. Truly Russia is a world per se. __.e many paintings from his brush during this long time constitute, In their totality, the most terrlbla arraignment of Russian autocracy in ex* istence. Because of this tendency th* Russian Government forbade their repro* duetlon or sale abroad. Yet, being glorious masterpieces, the Czar and his satellites. the Grand Dukes, purchased them at good prices und put them in their collections; others of his canvases were bought by Russian museums and the eus-todians of public picture galleries, where they can be admired. Strangest of all. this archrebei- nns been and is to~day th'* leading professor In the Imperial Academy of Arts in St, Petersburg. But here Is at least a partial explanation of the whole enigma: Ryepin paints what and how he pleases, but his mouth is shut and his pen Ik rusting.
Of interest- too, is the author's oircum-
starAial account of a visit to Tolstoy on the estate of Yasnaya Polyana. The account Is a very sympathetic one, but, while expressing great admiration for Tolstoy, tiie man and poet, the visitor by no m^ans blinks certain facts. He reproduces the salient features of a six hours’ conversation with Tolstoy, and there is a grent deal in this to portray for us clearly the great Russian as he is to-day, at the close of his long life—with his moral grandeur and transparent kindness of heart, but also with his queer crotchets and extreme views of life. Incidentally we learn that Tolstoy is getting ready for print a book devoted to the " smashing ” of the " Shakespeare craze.” The village belonging to Tolstoy’s estate the author
