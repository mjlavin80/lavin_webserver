H1LE "GcnGvra" is hardly tho story that might logically have been expected from Charle- Marriott cs tho successor of *' The Column," It Is undeniably Interesting and a forcible presentment of Its theme, which mainly concerns
•	the opposite effects of a great passion in man and woman, the selfishness, vanity, and brutality that may easily lurk In the extreme development of the artistic tcm-‘ perament, and the natural working of such qualities when brought to bear upon the ordinary relations and responsibilities
of life. It is not an exceptionally orlg-Inal theme, but it is one which easily lends Itself to dramatic situations, strong character contrasts, and the expression of vivid emotions—all valuable adjuncts in novel making—and the author of “Gen-,evra ” has used every one of them to good ^advantage, besides giving ample evidence of being still the possessor of the same subtle force and style that rendered his previous book notable.
The scene is laid in Cornwall, within 'walking distance of The Land's End, and. with the exception of Genevra Joslin and her artist lover, the characters are of the simple type that inevitably figures In talcs of the Cornish Coast. Genevra. elemental, perhaps, but certainly not simple, was the daughter of a yeoman farmer, and lived with her brother at the old manor house of Treeotts in much impoverished
circumstances. She Imd Itocn taught to hold in lasting memory that the De Jocelins from whom she was descended had once been the proudest of county families, and that Treeotts, once the most important manor of West Cornwall, dated from the Norman conquest. This pride of birth, together with her poverty, had the effect of rendering her shy of human companionship, while much in sympathy with the moors and hills, and stern, forbidding coast of her native Cornwall, and ; as an outlet for a singularly full Inner j Ufe, that had as yet found no object upon which to spend its riches. Genevra had early taken to writing poetry. At twenty-nine she had won some fame with her verses among the discerning few in London, and it is at this interesting point in her career that the author brings Mr, Leonard Morris, an artist of the most intense variety, to paint in Merlin's Wood, where Genevra was wont to go to declaim and revise her poetry.
Just what the poetry was about is never quite revealed, but its quality may be inferred fron\ her publisher's forcible description of it:
. Brains! It Isn’t brains, it's woman? Writes verse? She don't write verse—she bleeds it. I hope to God she never marries—unless she*s deserted In a week. T don’t care if she's crucified so long as she don't use her blood for making babies and take to writing verse.
. Nevertheless, after the old familiar fashion of women, whether clever or stupid, Genevra had only to meet the man who fitted into her dreams, in order to forget all about “ bleeding verse." and stake her hope of happiness upon the very career to which Mr. Edgar Noy, previously quoted, was so bitterly averse. But that j would have been commonplace and ended the story, and the author, evidently agreeing with Mr. Noy. that, for literary purposes. at least, a groat poetess is better worth while than a happy woman, proceeds with his plot on tragic lines. Genevra is neither married, deserted, nor crucified, but she is served with the far worse fate of knowing her idol to be made of clay and of finding out by slow degrees that her lover could more willingly dispense with her in his life than with his art. Morris had neglected his precious art long enough to make himself Indispensable to Genevra's happiness, but when it came to the crucial test of being bothered by her disturbing proximity for the rest of his life he quietly slipped off to Norway on a vacation, wrote her a letter that was “ cruelly misunderstood.” and later found himself absolved front any further anxiety about his “ art ’* by having his subsequent missives loTt unanswered.
Every woman will feel grateful to Mr. Marriott for the manner in which he turns Genevra's sorry love story into a test of character that still proves the wisdom of her instinct, if not of her choice. Her lover failed her, but her love helped her to understand herself- -made of her the woman she was meant to bo. Genevra herself thus looked upon her lot. oven though she was not always philosophical enough to prefer wisdom to happiness, but Noy openly took back his words*-" I ask you. is it worth it? Lost faith, dead love, a lonely hearth, and children crying to be born—and a few little words on flimsy scraps of paper."
When seven years had gone by and Genevra. graver and sadder, but still beautiful and clever, and more than a little famous, was earning in London a comfortable living with her pen, the

A little enigmatic is the ending of Genevra’s story, as far as Mr. Marriott is concerned, as if he were not quite sure himself of what a woman like the Gc-nevra ho has drawn would say to Mr. Leonard MorrlB at that point. Vo our thinking he had lost his chance for good and all, but in tho words of Noy—V whatever gods may be used him. for their own purposes, and undoubtedly he's made her."	’	’
Genevra and Morris dominate the book and absorb one's interest to an extent quite os large as they have filled'thin noLicc. but there nre at least three other charactcrs in the book that nre notably well drawn—Genevra's weak brother and his vulgar wife, and the old schoolmaster.
