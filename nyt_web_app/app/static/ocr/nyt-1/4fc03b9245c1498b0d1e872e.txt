WOLF LARSEN AS SUPERMAN.—The chief interest of Jack London's latest novel, “ The Sea-Wolf,” lies in the adml-xable way in which he has made use of a fictional form to work out an ethical problem without making puppets of his people or losing the story in the lesson. Notwithstanding that Wolf Larsen is a
typical Superman, the great blonde beast of Nietzsche, and is altogether too consistent in his selfishness to be quite human, yet he is no mere ajmbol, but very much alive. He remains with us as a real acquaintance, however glad we would be to forget him. And, although thousands read in “The Sea-Wolf " nothing but an exciting tale, yet the ethical theorem is developed by argument and illustration with a symmetry and completeness rare even in a serious treatise.—The Independent.
CARLYLE’S ETHICS.—We arc wont to think of Carlyle more often as a moral teacher than as a. historian or a, writer on
literary subjects. As historian or essayist alone, he might perhaps be superseded or fall into neglect; as a moral philosopher it is scarcely conceivable that he should not permanently occupy a high place in English literature and have a wide influence upon readers. Yet a close examination of his moral doctrines reveals striking deficiencies as well as peculiarities. Ho has enunciated his ideas with tremendous vigor, a clearness that never leaves uncertain the meaning of any sentence or paragraph, and with wearisome iteration; yet he has nowhere reduced them to any system, nor sought to establish them on a secure metaphysical basis; and at times even their practical application remains in doubt. He was impatient of any attempt to “ justify the ways of God to men." Ills moral convictions were ingrained, and suffered no essential change—a characteristic rare among great thinkers—during the whole course of his literary activity. An expression of “Sartor Resartus’* or of ** Friedrich" is equally authentic as an expression of his permanent belief and doctrine. His attitude toward literature and literary art altered remarkably as the sense of the earnestness of life bore with increasing weight upon him; his hopefulness; disappeared, his denunciation became more vigorous and unrestrained; but his perception of duty and its sanction was the same from first to last.
*	* * To his inheritance of the stern and sombre Scottish temperament were added the struggles of his youth and earlier manhood with untoward circumstances, poverty, ill-health, and doubt, to impress upon him the darker side of life. He was driven by outward as well as inward necessity to work, yet was capable of no performance without extreme effort; and work, by the unnatural stress which he must lay upon it for himself, became to his mind the chief object of existence. He suffered much and magnified his sufferings; and endurance appeared a virtue as well as a necessity. The power of enjoyment—the taste for art, music, society, and travel—were denied to him by nature as well as circumstance: and he conceived the pursuit of happiness to be'among the most unworthy of human motives. In spite of his rejection of the externals and the dogmas of Christianity, he retained a profoundly religious sense, solemn and awful in its combination of the Scotch with the Hebrew spirit. Beyond the necessity for bread, he felt that there was an equally peremptory and inexorable spiritual necessity—a vocation not to be combined with the other cxccpt at the price of exhausting effort and suffering. With all
his earnestness and force, ho was long unheeded; and tlie neglect and misinterpretation which he and his works encountered'may well have exaggerated his idea of the evil, injustice, and thoughtlessness of the world. * * * Carlyle has been dead but little over twenty years, but his voice comes to us like a voice out of the past. The catchwords of modern philosophic writing—optimism and pessl-.mlsm, altruism, evolution, and tho like,* are absent from his works. Ho paid little heed to the passing phases of thought; his eyes were fixed upon eternal truth, as he could perceive it, regarding with impatience all distorted reflections of that truth. The reflection of It In his own mind may to others appear distorted; we may
find his Why Insufficient, and differ from him as to the How. Yet a teaching which enforces man's serious duties, even with an excessive degree of gloomy earnestness, must always have its place and value. His office is not that of the metaphysician, but that of the preacher, who, dispensing with analysis and: taking much for granted, warns and incites, stimulates and denounces. The duty of ascertaining what is the right to which he exhorts, he leaves, If somewhat doubtfully, to our own perceptions and consciences.—Charles J. Goodwin In The International Journal of Ethics.
JI7SSI3RANr>*S " HISTORY OF. THU LITERATURE OP THE ENGLISH PEOPLE."—One feels a. certain difficulty In characterizing this book adequately. It is not only a literary history—the work of a scholar—It is good literature. It is filled with those dellcatc asides to which
the language in which it is written lends itself so well, with phrases which lose some of their bloom when quoted—Greene, “ who beats his mea culpa on his neighbor's breastGooge, “ qul ne sort do la banality classique quo pour tomber dans Ie sermon,” and many others—the gentleman who spoke every language with a French accent, “ y comprls la slenne, mais non compris, he las, la franQaise M— the “ Custell of Laboure,” where “ Raison le raisonne, Descspolr lo d£sesp£re, et Ennui ennule Ie Iecteur de la premiere ligne £1 la dernlcre. * * * II faut savoir gre toutefois aux deux auteurs d’avoir comprls la literature parmi les occupations de Wysedome.”
But this book Is more than literature; Jt Is the pros© epic of tho Elizabethan ago. One seems to recognize in it the admiration that refined and cultured souls sometimes feel for a strong, brutal, passionate time when hard blows or heroic sacrifice were the relaxation from sonnet making, and the new wine of life was drunk straight from the fermenting vat One does not quite know how one would liave got on among these good-humored bandits, but one might have found a safo corner somewhere, and it would have been better sport to watch them in real life than to read about them three centu* ries later. However that may be, the result is achieved, and the England M. Jusserand has described for his countrymen is a land of which none of us need be ashamed: its faults, its virtues, were those of a strong and manly race. If, as he smilingly suggests in a hoto on Burton's “Anatoms'.” our abandonment of public r&joiclngs on an Ambassador’s arrival is, perhaps, a contributory cause of contemporary melancholy, Ambassadors themselves are returning good for evil by adding to the store of public delight. When M. Jusserand comes among us that worthy custom should assuredly pe revived.—London Athenaeum.
MR, HALL CAINE.—Mr, Hall Caine has been making a great pother in a speech to the Vagabonds’ Club as to the status of the novel. Mr. Caine would seem to have told ins audience that there were people who rather scoffed at the novel as light reading, and he thereupon entered into a sort of vindication of the place of fiction in the life of nations— surely a very inneeessary proceeding,
Mr. Caine should be content with having the world with him. His books apparently sell in millions in every country of the world and in every language. What else
matters? All that a few voices crying in the wilderness have to say on the subject is to regret that Mr. Caine should take himself so seriously. There are novels and novels; there are just a few artists exactly the same way as there are painters and oleograph manufacturers; among the artists in fiction are Cervantes, Fielding, and Balzac, and certain others who surely no one in the world depredates in the least or fails to place upon the proper pedestal. What some of us complain of Is that there is not sufficient recognition of the very wide gulf that separates these artists from the mere manufacturers of cheap replicas.—Clement Shorter in The London Sphere.
NEARLY FORGOTTEN BOOES.-IU reading Dr. Moncure Conway's recently published autobiography I have been struck by the number of references to books of some importance in their day which have become wellnigh forgotten. Some of these judging by the impression which they made in the past might be
found worthy of ropublication. I have not space to mention more than two of them now. One Is John Sterling’s romantic story of “ The Onyx Ring,'* which appeared originally in Blackwood's Magazine in 1S3S, and in the second volume of Sterling's “Essays and Tales" in 1548. Tho story has a certain old-fashioned air about it, but is by no means without interest. The other book to which Dr. Conway’s commendation has sent me Is “ Charles Aucliester, a Memorial,'* a novel which was published anonymously in 1S53, and met with a very mixed recep-
tion. It was written by a young woman ot twenty-three, Elizabeth * Sara Sheppard, and, to quote a contemporary critic, “is a strange, wild, affected, incongruous, mystical, art-novel—incomplete, incorrect, foolish, extravagant; still, displaying feeling without discretion, power without learning; and a passion for music rather than a knowledge of it.” Benjamin Disraeli—to whom the story was dedicated—wroto to the author Baying: "No greater book will ever be written upon music, and It will ono day be recognized as the Imaginative classic of that divine art." It Is to be imagined that Disraeli here showed himself a flatterer rather than a true critic or prophet. I may add that Dr. Conway mentions a lady “ who could Identify every character In tho novel.” In a later story, ** Rumour,’* Miss Sheppard introduced—of course under disguised names—Disraeli and Beethoven.
ThtTfelssuo of “The Guide of the Per--plcxed" of Malmonldes In its English translation and in a popular form should prove interesting to many readers with a taste for speculative subtleties. Moses,’ ben Malmon, commonly known as Mal-monides, flourished over seven hundred years ago, having been born at Cordova in 1135. Few of his worlds have been translated Into English, an<T“ The Guide of the Perplexed " was not translated until 1881-85, when Dr. M. Frledliinder's version was issued by the Society of Hebrew Literature, The object of the work is “to afford a guide for the perplexed (to thinkers whose studies have brought them Into collision with religion) who havo~~studied philosophy and have acquired sound knowledge, and who, while firm In religious matters, are perplexed and bewildered on account of the ambiguous and figurative expressions employed in tho holy writings."—Walter Jerrold in The London Academy.
DISRAELI. —It is one of th© most splendid ironies of politics, which for the true love wo bear him we can only hope Disraeli is able to appreciate from a better world, since none would enjoy It more exquisitely than he, that Lord Beacons-field has come to be the hero and the beau-idcal of the type most antipathetic to himself, the type that never understood and usually loathed him in his life, and the type he most contemned. Disraeli was never popular with the respectable; Gladstone was the respectable man’s hero. Disraeli could get on with the aristocracy, who have never counted as Brltish-ly respectable, though usually philistine on the better side, and they grew to like
him; and he loved the working classes. But the solid, sensible, stupid, correct, and vulgar middle-class type did not appeal to him, and to them he was suspect nearly to the end; not quite. The cause of *the change of attitude is multiplex; partly he grew old, and age is respectable, but even more he had made them see that he was playing a big game, and a big game is always attractive. Unfortunately he did not live to complete the education of the country. Had he lived ten years longer, we should have less pothouse jingoism at this moment and more of intelligent appreciation of what empire means.—London Saturday Review.
TROLLOPE’S CHRISTMASES.—To find the dullest Christmases in fiction is incon-testably^to go to Barchester and the surrounding country with Anthony Trollope and to realize that it is not of necessity dull to read of things dull in themselves. “ The Small House at Allington *’ relates how Christmas was kept at the Great House, with dinner somewhere about 3 o’clock, with the horrible result of a sort of endless evening setting in all unnaturally just when it should be tea time. Poor jilted Lily Dale has to “ eat her pudding with the rest,” and somehow that bare statement makes us additionally sorry for her. They had “ played blind man’s bufftf the year before, but Trollope was probably wise in not attempting a repetition of that effort after liveliness. His heroes wore “ peg-tops *’ and flowing whiskers, his heroines ample crinolines, and could not behave like Messrs. Tupman and Winkle, or fur-booted Arabella Allen. They were the veritable apotheosis of the Early Victorian in their drawing rooms of magenta rep, and if the booklover likes to find cause for congratulation that he did not flourish In the sixties, a few TroIIopian Christmases may have that effect. In , “ The Last Chronicle of Barsetshire ” they take their pleasures very sadly, after | the English manner, and. truth to tell,
! the pleasures do not seem to have been numerous. The making of wreaths for the churches was a great occupation for I tho young ladies, now so busy with golf finals and hockey ties that they have I scarcely time to sit down quietly, at , " Framley Parsonage.” Trollope’s coun-j try dinner parties are bits of v^ry noat characterization. Plenty of good food and wines and table talk of the very baldest.— London Chronicle.
THE BATH LETTER.—The mysterious letter scratched onv a leaden tablet which was discovered at Bath early in 1S8D, about fifteen feet below the former level of the King's Bath, has at last been deciphered by Mr. E. W. B. Nicholson, Bod-ley's Librarian at oxford. For over twenty- years scholars have been puzzled by this inscription, and even the language in which it was written was in doubt.
*
According to Mr. Nicholson it was written somewhere in the first half of the fourth century by a Christian Presbyter or Episcopus named Yinisius to a woman
named1 Nigra, who was living at Bath, the subject being an answer to her complaints on tho 111-doing of her husband. Vinisius also refers to' the visit of an Arlan named BUIconus, The letter was probably writen on the same leaden tablet as that to which it was an answer, the original letter having been erased; and tho reason why lead was used instead of wax was that Jn Roman times there were lead mines near Bath, so that tho material would bo cheap and plentiful. Why the tablet was found in the bath Is explained by the fact that the Inhabitants of Britain were, and in Cornwall still are, addicted to throwing metal objects Into wells and springs to prbpitiate the Pis-kles, who were supposed to dwell therein, and it is probable that Nigra herself, although she was a Christian, had enough of the old paganism In her composition to throw In the tablet when it had served its purpose. Mr, Nicholson's reading of this mysterious letter is the more valuable as the literary relics of Christianity in Roman Britain are remarkably scanty. —London Globe.
A NEW SOUTHERN MAGAZINE.— Ex-Gov. Robert L. Taylor has determined to embark on a Southern magazine venture, to be published at Nashville, and to that end he will shortly move his residence to that city, having already disposed of his stock in The Bristol Courier to Mr. C. H, Slack. It is stated that the new magazine will make its appearance some time in the Spring, and that it will have sufficient financial backing to fairly test the possibility of a purely representative Southern publication. If personal popularity can be relied upon to glve'such a publication an auspicious start the association of the genial ex-Govcrnor's name with it will prove all that could be asked for in that direction. After the fair start thus guaranteed for It, the magazine will have to stand on Its merits. There are no
good reasons why a distinctly Southern periodical should not succeed, it is true the publication graveyard is full of adventurers in that direction, but that does not indicate that there is not living’ room for the right sort of periodical produced by Southern brains and talent. It will not do, however, to rely for support upon sentiment. A few men and women are actuated that way, but the vast majority of the people want substance as well as sentiment, and we believe Gov. Taylor appreciates that fact and that he will be guided by the lessons his ” dead *' predecessors fully teach in this direction. At any rate, he will start off with the best wishes and the ardent co-operation or more people than any other promoter entering tlie same field before him,—Chattanooga (Tenn.) Times.
WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS.—His humor, like all the best humor, lies close to the source of tears. But there has never been any doubt about the side he has taken in the conflict between good and evil, and he is more illuminating when he shows us what we are in our relations to each other than when he merely tells us what we ought to be. We can be agreeably merry with him in the books of his lighter vein over the foibles of the race to which we belong, and we can also have a pleasant sense of contributing to his acute insight by our acute recognition of his discoveries, which perhaps tend to prevent restiveness under his teaching. By means of his realism he illustrates his points of morality with an extraordinary perception for mirth-compelling details. It is not until we have amassed in our memory an appreciable number of these that we become aware how they make for discrimination between coarseness and fineness, sweetness and peevishness, gratitude ■ and ingratitude, truth and sham.
For the rest—ror all that exists independently of any intention, defined or in-
*
definable, to demonstrate the beauty of
righteousness, what an amount there is
of it and how grateful the future will be for its quality! No other novelist has recorded the spectacle of our constants changing civilization with such a quick and joyous sensibility to its shifting impressions. No one else has brought lo our-mingled poetry and prose so happy an equipment for reproducing its complex savour. With no one else can we so surely find the capricious charm of our sky and air and of our long vistas of ugly streets, the magic of certain quarters of our cities, the physiognomy of our rural homes. Whether we sit, elated by our innocent Bohemia nism, at the table of some foreign restaurant, to taste at home the peculiar ccstasy of travel, or lounge about the great caravansaries of our civic enterprise in homeless enjoyment of our wealth, or extract from poverty its gayer essence in our search for lodgings among the poorer neighborhoods; whether we dine with aristocracy or starve with tenement dwellers, whether we drive through the region of our abandoned farms or whirl in our Pullman cars over our Western prairies, we know that we are never for an instant away from our expressive American society. Wc know that Air. Howells has put in our possession a picture, complete and subtle, under its bright free brush work, of our manners and our minds, our simplicities and our sophistries, our humors and our principles, our amusements and our interests. Without him wc should have had only fragments and studies In place of this harmonious substantial whole.—Elisabeth Luther Cary in The Lamp.
