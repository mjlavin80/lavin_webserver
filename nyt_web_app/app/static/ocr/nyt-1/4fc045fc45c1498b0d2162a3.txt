Of all your many interesting debates
from readers that concerning “ Tho Eagle’s Shadow’* is easily pre-eminent in interest. And I should like here to venture a suggestion as to what In my opinion is the real root of argument.
It is that the book marks the passing of the heroine. She was such a dear, ladylike creature that it is no wonder some of us cannot bear to see her go. The novel heroine early crystallised in the character of Fielding’s “ Amelia, and since then Amelia has ruled English fiction. You find her in Scott, disguised It may be in mediaeval trappings, but under them always Capt. Booth's tender •wife You will see her in Dickons under various aliases, and in Thackeray she comes forward boldly :is Amelia, with a perfectly transparent affectation of being named ,SedIey and not Booth. In practically every English novel she appears, bearing various names, Indeed, but always gentle and clinging and faithful, and in fine, always Amelia. She is the tyrant of English literature undethronable. For over a century the rule has been unquestioned. Your novel may treat of almost anything, your hero and villain may be what vou will, but yoar heroine must be Amelia. And now Margaret Hugonln pops into fiction and naturally flutters the sedate. It is against all tradition that the heroine of a novel should even remotelv resemble any woman that ever wore flesh and blood. She must be Amelia, says Mrs. Grundy.
I	think that the real importance of ** The Engle's Shadow " lies in the fact that Margaret is very emphatically not Amelia, liar pa ret is a real woman, commendable or not as you please, but a real woman; and while we have had many real women in novels, hide-bound tradition shies at the notion of having a real woman as a heroine. It is so unusual. Candidly, is that not the true motive which actuates Margaret’s detractors— irritation caused not so much by her being what she is as by her. falling to be an Amelia woman? We are a people of enduring tradition, and to some of us this endeavor to plump a mere human being into the high seat Immemorially sacred to that dear, ladylike creature, tho heroine, must necessarily savor of blasphemy.
