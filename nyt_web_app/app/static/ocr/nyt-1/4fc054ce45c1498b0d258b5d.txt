-	It is agreed by the specialists that the first publication of “ Don Quixote ** occurred three hundred years ago this month. There has not been a tercentenary since those of the births of Dante and Shakespeare, It would bo bold lo say that there will be another of the birth or the “ first edition ” of any writer born since 1G05 of so much importance in the history of literature. It is curious to reflect that the devotion of the earliest of modern novelists to a life of letters was the result of accident. But for the severe and disabling wound which he received after conducting himself with conspicuous gallantry at the battle of | Lepanto it is very unlikely that the j author of " Don Quixote M would have ** smiled Spain’s chivalry away " by becoming Its author. It is as curious to reflect that the Spaniard who made the greatest mark upon his time in the generation preceding that of Cervantes should equally have been diverted by the same cause from a life of action to a life of thought. But it was on the most glorious day in the history of Spain, that day which broke the power of the Turk in the Mediterranean, that tlie future novelist received his disabling wound, whereap the siege of Pampeluna, conducted twenty-six years before Cervantes was born, is remembered now only for the pirrum-stanec* that it converted Ignatius Loyola from a secular to an ecclesiastical career, 'Whether it was a greater ! achievement to found the Horiety of Jesus or to write " lion Quixote ** is an invidious question upon which we need not enter.
At any rate, it was the lui ning of Cervantes from the art of war to that of literature which gave its beginning to the modern art of prose fiction. The romances which preceded the novel of Cervantes and of which it was begun as a burlesque are of no more importance to the modern reader than the lost tales of Miletus, whereas the novel three hundred years of age this month .is as alive and as young as when it first saw the light. The pnority of Boccaccio is no more to the real purpose than the priority, reaching back to “ the twilight of fable,” of ** The Arabian Nights." For these wonder stories and sportive tales make nu sort of pretense of containing the philosophy of life, of being the ** book of humanity," as which Sainto-Beuve so justly praised the great novel of Cervantes, which still remains, iii spite of Calderon and Lope de Vega, of all the poets and of all the dramatists, tho chief literary monument of the .Spanish people.	.	—
The justics of Byron’s epigram ha-been strongly and justly disputed. It was not the “chivalry'1 or Spain, but the false pretenses into which that chivalry had degenerated that the first and greatest Spanish novel " «milcd away.*’ There have been other chivalries since, and some of them still survive, which have stood as much in need of the satirist’s puncturing. But fie satirist has not appeared. It was to the kindliness even of the satire, to i recur to the French critic's word to its "humanity,** that the satire owed iis ! lasting power. Colonel New come is ! not more human or more modern than I
his illustrious predecessor. It was not " the true romance " but the false that the Spanish realist exploded with his realism, with the tilting of his hero, helmeted with .a barber's basin, against giants that in the light of common day were seen to be but windmills. One can imagine no better meeting ground for the arrangement of a truce between the realists and the romanticists than this romance of reality affords. The consensus of mankind has at least decided that there is something the matter with the man who does not like it. And one can look forward to the six hundredth anniversary of its publication with as confident an assurance as he can feel about any book published since that *' Don QuixoteM will still continue to be read and relished and its author to be regarded with admiration and affection.
