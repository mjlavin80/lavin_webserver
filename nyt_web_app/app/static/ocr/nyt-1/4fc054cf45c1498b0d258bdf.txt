Mr. Eugene Newman's rcmarlcs on a great many subjects here collected liavc several entertaining qualities, not the least of which is an outspoken habit and a tendency to present a view of a given public man quite surprisingly different from the one you nre accustomed to meet. Tlie form nn the other hand is very old-fashioned, with much embroidery of classical and Biblical allusion and a generous supply of adjectives of heroic size. As an old newspaper man Mr. Newman seems to speak of public men from a vciy full knowledge of their public careers, and he docs not hesitate to distribute praise and .blame in large packages. He begins with Conkling, whom he seems to admire immensely. and takes occasion to express in passing a very uncomplimentary judgment of Garfield. As for Thaddeus Stevens, he gives him credit for being to tlio ** revolution of 1SG1-5” what Mirabeau was to the French Revolution, and adds that while “ Greeley and Beecher hated slavery and loved the slaveholders, Stevens hated the slaveholders even more than lie hated the institution/' "Writing of Stevens gives occasion to a picturesque expression of opinion as to Mrs. Stowe’s firc-brandlcal Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” which Mr. Newman calls “an absurd yam/' and leads to a defense of James Buchanan and somo lively remarks on the reconstruction policy and the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the Constitution. " Enlightened statesmanship,” says Mr. Newman, “ had nothing to do with them. Hell and Utopia—Stevens and Sumner
brought them forth, Ignorancc and malice rocked their cradle." Then the author defends Andrew Johnson, whom he considers a fine typo of the •statesman sprung from the plain people, praising his devotion to the Union and speaking his mind of the men who got him into such hot water when fate set him iii Mr. Lincoln's chair. Just preceding the paper on Johnson is one on Matthew Carpenter, who “began the study of law at tlie age of fourteen, and two years later practiced in a local court and beat his grandfather and another lawyer in a bitterly contested jury trial.” Carpenter. too, sat in the Senate with Sumner, Kdmundri. Sebum, Conkling. Thurman, Trumbull, Slierman, Morton, and
Bayard, but he was chiefly a lawyer.
The paper on John James Ingalls begins with tho picturesque .(hut perfectly accurate) statement that ” Kansas is the child of revolution and fanaticism, and was created in massacre and terror.” The author analyzes Ingalls's brilliant talents, and^ then switches off to a discussion of the negro question, which for the frankness with which it states certain phases of tiiat subject—phases which it is fashionable now to ignore—may be considered altogether worth perusal. For, says Mr. Newman, after you have educated your negro (after the Booker Washington plan or any other) what then will you do with him in a white man's country*.’ For there Is even less room in such a country for an educated than for an uneducated negro, the white man needing hewers of wood, but nowise teachers and preachers of another color. The next papers deal with Oliver P. Morton, with Seargent S. Prentiss, with Lucius Q. C. Lamar. Then follows an account of Samuel J. Tilden and of the Field family, after which is an appreciation of tho late Marcus A. ITanna and one of Thomas Brackett Reed. Tlie
next paper, on Benjamin H. 1 [ill of
Georgia, is made the occasion of some remarks on the Generals on both sides during the civil war, with comments on their several military qualities somewhat out of the rut of such comments. Tho remaining pages of the book are dedicated to George F. Hoar, Frank Wolford, Stephen A. Douglas, and Thomas C. Piatt, but here, as throughout the volume, tho method is widely discursive, and many other public men nre discussed, Blaine, for instance, and Garfield, who are nowhere nominated in tlie titles, coming in for as much as any of the others. Altogether people interested in men and politics, whatever their individual bias, can harcUy fail to derive entertainment from Mr. Newman's essays. His point of view on current questions is Southern, but he is Initially a Union man, and brackets secession and reconstruction as twin crimes and follies. At points you may, according to your disposition, agree or disagree vehemently: in any case you will have your own views spurred, as it were, into livelier action.
