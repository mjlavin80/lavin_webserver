If yuu have an evening to spare, with abrolutcly nothing to do. dine leisurely, don't si:ip any of the courses, then tnke your own good time and drop in at the Lyric Theatre. You will be in plenty of time to hear Katie Barry in her best number, “ My Word,” which gives her an opportunity to do a series of very clever imitations, and you will have plenty of opportunity to judge whether “ Fantana” is the style of entertainment for which you arc looking. Incidentally, you will be better pleased by reason ot* having* missed the first act, which is only worth mentioning: by reason of the fact that it precedes the sccond.
In its general characteristics, to be sure, the second doesn't differ much from the first. The authors have taken the liberty of calling the piece a Japanese-Amcrlean musical comedy, but all save the least sophisticated of us learned long y^o tlint in I his sort of thing one name is about as good as another nnd equally descriptive. If one were actually pinned down to it, he might be obliged to admit that the whole affair is just vaudeville and nothing more.
But for some strange teason managers do not like to use that term. Fantana differs from the common or garden variety by reason of tho fact that the specialties are strung together on a thread of a story that constantly threatens to break under the strain, and thou, too* there: is a richness of picture und costume which one i does not fmd in the places where th ■ banjo artist follows tho man with the trained rabbits, but the general trend is the same.
Th^ so-called book of Fantana is written by Robert B. Smith and Sam £?. Shu-bert. the latter merging from hi:, modest occupation of managing theatres and big shows to share in the somewhat dubious honors of authorship. The book, like the music, contributed by Raymond Hubbell et al. (the et al. are not mentioned on the programme; is like most of the efforts of its kind with which we are familiar. It contains plenty of noisy fun of the sort that patrons of this class of shows seem to like, the fact being demonstrated last night by prolonged laughter.
Jefferson De AngeHs is the star in this particular production, and his familiar sallies into broad humor met with much approval. Ho appears first as a valet, then disguises himself as a Japanese Ambassador. becoming actually funny in a wild chase around tho stage after the tassel on his hat which has a habit of flying into his face at every possible opportunity.
The piece is staged lavishly, and though the effects indicate no especial originality they are generally pleasing. The acting and singing are generally adequate to the demands, and the chorus is large and comely.
RfiETC^LFE SAW “FANTANA.”
Ignored Letter Managers Sent With-/ drawing Tickcts—No Trouble.
, James S. Metcalfe of Life, who was barred from forty-seven theatres by the action of the Theatrical Managers’ Association on Wednesday; attended the opening performance of ** Fantana" at the Lyric last night. The Shuberts, who
manage the house, said that Mr. Metcalfe came after ho had Lvien asked not to.
They said that the tickets for the performance were sent out before the action of the managers’ association, and yesterday afternoon the officers of that body were called together to decide what was to be done. A letter was sent to Mr. Metcalfe withdrawing “ the invitation,'' as the Shuberts expressed it. Despite this Mr. Metcalfe attended and nothing happened to require the services of the three private detectives in the house to preserve order.
ALL STARS IW~OWE CAST.
i An Extraordinary Metropolitan Plan for “ Die Ficdermaus,
«
! Mr. Conried announces as one of the most noteworthy events of this operatic season at tho Metropolitan the production j on Thursday evening, Feb. XG, of *' Die Fledermaus," with an unusual cast. Every singer of note in the Metropolitan oom-; pany will appear at this performance. The part of Rosalinde will be sung by
Mine. Sembricli, while, in all probability, Miss Olive Fremstad will appear as Prince Orlowsky. Miss -Bella Alten will have the
Koubretto part of Adele. Mr. Burgstaller will be the Alfred, Mr, Dippol the Elsen-stein, Mr. Gorltz the Frank, and all the remaining stars of the Metropolitan, including Mmes. Karnes, Nordica, Ackte. de 'Macchi, Komer, and Miss Walker, Messrs. Caruso. Snleza. Scotti, Van Rooy, Plan-con, Blass, and Journet. will be seen or
heard in the ballroom and concert episodes.
In view of the unprecedented nature of the production, special prices, ranging from S2 to $10, will be fixed for t^tis per-' formancc.	_
SATURDAY AT THE OPERA.
It would be difficult to find in the repertoire of the Metropolitan Opera House two words more popular than “ Faust ** and *' Lohengrin,” so the theatre was crowded yesterday when these two operas
were sung. "Faust” was performed in an apathetic fashion at the matinSe, due* chiefly to Mr. Franco's slow and rather unyielding	tempi.	Mme.	Eames	was
again a lovely Marguerite, Albert Saieza sang- with unusual strength and beauty
of will, and MM. Plancon and Scotti com; pleted a	quartet	which	should	have
aroused much more enthusiasm than the 1 audience evinced.
" Lohengrin.'* the evening performance* offered a subscription case at popular prices. Consequently the theatre wa.s crowded.	Mines.	Nordica	and Walker
and MM.	Knot.e.	Gorits,	Journet,	and
Muehlman were the singers. They have.
| with the exception of Journet, been heard i before in the same rOles. and it need oniv be said that Herr Knote's impending- departure seems more regrettable than ever in view of his beautiful singing last night. Mr, Hertz conducted.	.
