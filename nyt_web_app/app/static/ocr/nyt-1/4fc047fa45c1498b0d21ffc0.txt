OSEPII CONRAD ON 1IEN-RY JAMES.—Tho critical fac-lilty licsltates before the mag-niiudc ot Mr. Henry James's work. His books stand on my shelves In a place whose accessibility proclaims tlie habit of frequent communion. But not all his books. Thero Is no collected edition to date, such as some of " our masters *’ have beer* provided with; no neat row of volumes in buckram or half-calf putting forth a hasty claim to completeness, nnd conveying to my mind a hint of finality, of a surrender to fate of that field in which all these victories have been won. Nothing of the sort has fcoen done for Mr. Henry James’s victories in England.
In a world such as ours, so painful with
all sgrts of wonders, one would not exhaust one's self In barren marveling; over mere bindings, had not the fact, or rather the absence of the-material fact, prominent In the case of other men whose writing counts (ror good or evil)—had it not been, I say, expressive of a direct truth snirltual and intellectual; an accident of— I suppose—publishing business acquiring a symbolic tmtinlng from its negative
nature. Because, emphatically. In the body of Mr. Henry James's work there is r.o suggestion of finality, nbwherc a hint of surrender, or cron of mere probability of surrender, to his own victorious achievement in that fin’d where he is master. Happily, he will never be able to claim completeness; and. were he to a moment of self-ignor-not be believed by the very minds for whom such a confession naturally would be- meant. It is Impossible to think of Mr. Henry James beyom-ing " complete ’’ otherwise th:in by the brutality of our common fate whose finality is meaningless—In the sense of its logic being of :t material order, tin* logic of a falling stone.
I do not know into wh.it brand »»r ink. Mr, Henry Janies dips his pen: indeed. I heard tint of late he has been dictating; but I know th:tt his mind is steeped in the waters flowing from the fountain of intellectual youth. The tiling—a privilege —a miracle—what you will—is not quite hidden from the meanest of us who run as we read. To those who have the grace to stay iheir feet it is manifest. After some twentv years of attentive acquaintance with Mr. Henry James's work, it grows into absolute conviction, which, all |nr-sonal feeling apart, brings :i sense of happiness into one's artistic existence. If gratitude, as some one defined it. is a lively sen^e of favors to come, it becomes very easy to be grateful to the author of ‘‘The Ambassadors to n:ime the latest of his works. The favors are sure to come; the spring of that benevolence will never dry up. The stream ot inspiration runs brimful in a predetermined direction, unofleeted by the periods of drought, untroubled in its clearness by the storms of the land of letters, without languor or violence in its force, never running back upon itself, opening new visions at every turn of its course through that richly inhabited country its fertility has created for our delectation, for our judgment, foi our exploring. It is. in fact, a magic spring.
With this phrase tho metaphor of the perennial spring, of the inextinguishable youth, of iiiiiiun^ water, as applied to Mr. Henry James's inspiration, may be dropped. In its volume and force the body ot his work may be compared rather to :i majestic river. All creative urt is magic. is evocation of the unseen in forms ptrsuasive. enlightening, familiar, and surprising, for the edification of* mankind, pinned down by the conditions or us existence to the earnest consideration of the most insignificant tides of reality.
*	* * Through it ail Mr, Henry James keeps a firm hold of the substance, of what is worth having, of what fs wnrth holding. The contrary opinion has been, if not absolutely affirmed, then at least implied, with some frequency. To mu.-t of t's. living willingly m a sort of intellectual moonlight, in the faintly reflected
light of I ruth.

And. apart from that just cause of discontent. it is obvious ihai a solution by it— jceiiun must always present a certain ap-I'arent la--*k of finality, ; sjjiT-ijilly	l-

But so it ;s: and these snlutlons ure legitimate, iua'-1-m*jch as they satisfy the desire for finality, for which our hearts yearn with a b Hiring frreaJer ihun the longing tor the h.uves and fishes of this earth. Perhaps the only true desire or mankind, coming t:*u.s to light in iis hours of leisure, is to be *et at rest. One is never n t at rej-f by Mr. Henry James’s novels. Ilis bon Us end as an episode m life ends.

i THE LITERARY AGENT.-The literary agent hits become a factor In the modern world of book and magazine making. Ho Is, as bents himt a cog Jn the vast machine of his time, a labor-saving device. To say that he Is popular with editors would be, perhaps, to overstate the truth. But he is adroit, suave, and he Is conscious that, month .by month, bis importance increases,' us more and more authors, tired of conducting their own business affairs, place litelr marketable wares in his hands.
But though he te, like the steam car, modern and convenient, his rise marks the decline of certain well-established and pleasant* things.,even as the stenm engine compelled the decadence of tho excellent, ambling stage coach, that vehicle Induclvc to friendly encounters and leisurely sightseeing. Ths literary agent has Interrupted those courtly exchanges of compliments between authors and writers which used to add zest to the days of a hard-working writer. There was a delicate flavor to such Exchanges; one beheld one’s personality as in a flattering, mirror. An ucccpted manuscript—toward which no author can ever be Indifferent— appeared in ah atmosphere yet more radiant than that created by the wonderful fact of acceptance, and this glory beyond a glory was the editor’s compliment. Nor wtis the returned manuscript without its compensations. That perfect note of regret and appreciation which accompanied
it, and which set forth the hardly rested temptation under which tho eJllor ill bored on reading It. was a compensation for much disappointment. That (he public should go uneditted, the author unrewarded. appeared light things tn view of tho fact that the editor had lnd the privilege of perusing a paper which he was. by unfortuitous circumstances, prevented from sharing with his subscribers.
But there amenities are passed.* The literary agent is brief, businesslike, unemotional, and to the point-und tn tlie per ecnl. A sturdy abruptness has taken the plat e of oiii-time courtesies. The minuet is over—aye, and the j.'g. It Is a commonplace paee that the literary agent sets for us. Not ever, his ready cii.^ek—minus his well-enrned percentage—can quite make up fer the ceremonious, old-time pleasures of polite correspondence.—The Reader Magazine.

LBLAND’S “HANS BRE1TMANN."— Hans Breltmann reflected nothing American, he satirized nothing American. Any creature more unlike that long, thin, lank, nervous, almost hBeetle Uncle Sam America has evolved as its National type, could not well be Imagined than the big, fat, 1 easy-going, beer-drinking, pleasure-loving German who was the hero of tho Ballads. He was not Of'the soil, as were Parson
Wilbur and Hosca Biglow, and the others who roused the laughter of overwrought patriotism. He was not even Pcnnsylva- j nia Dutch, as critics who had never set i foot in Pennsylvania were so ready to assort. Ho was fn every sense an alien; by birth, in his language—which was not Pennsylvania Dutch either, whatever the critics might fancy—an alien fn his thoughts, his habits, his ideals, if he can be said to have ideals. No figure could have been more unlooked 1 for In American literature, up till then so intensely National In character—or, "provincial.” I can fancy Mr. Henry James correcting me. *	•	* Brelt-
mann " flashed into being,’' as Henley says of l’anurge. llow spontaneous waa the laugh from which ho sprang, the history of the early Bulluds and the character of Breitmumi himself go fir to prove. This history I ‘Jin able to give with details never before published. It was partly told in the author's prefaces to the adit ions of LS71 and 1SS!>. But It Is more fully supplemented by tlie author's marginal notes in his copies of these two editions, now in my possession. I read chance throughout—the chance there Is In any laugh that rings true. To begin with, it was the hmgu ige tlmt made Breitmann, nnd not Hrcitmana. who rnr.de the language. Por Brdtmann did not appear until one, at leist, of the ballads that now ; go by h:s name had got to thp point of being printed. " * Der Prelschutz * was written before ‘ Hans Brcitmann's B.tr-ty.' " Is the note on a slip of paper inserted in ihc copy of tlie 1S71 edition, open before me, " one season when a German u troupe was playing at the Opera House in Philadelphia. It was first published in The Phfl idetphia Evening Bulletin, of which paper i was one or the cditnrs, I subsequently republished it in Graham's Magazine, with a small wood cut. not larger than an English shilling, before oath verse. These cuts were very clever and were executed by an engraver named Scattergeod. 1 Der Ercischutz ' was one of several burlesque opera librettos which I wrote. They all h.Ld a great run through the newspapers. ' Der Ereischutz ’ was especially popular, but when published in a work with the rest of the * Breltmann Ballads * the reviews declared It to be much Inferior to any of the others.’* * * *
" While editing Graham's Magazine I had one day a spire tn fill,** their author says In his *• Memoirs.” as be htd already written in his copy of the 1K71 edition.
“ In a hurry I knocked off ‘ Hans Brelt-miinn's Burly ’ lSat»; I gave it no thought whatever." "it was written only to fill up a page,” the note in the 1.VO edition says, “ i:nd I never expected that any one would notice it.”
He thought so litll^ oT it tbit in the "Ballads" immedatefy following tlie " r:.u*iy ’’ Breilmntm was left out as often as not.

WATTS-Dl’XTON ON THE POWErt 01*'’ WORDS.—The lover of painting will perhaps he startled by the contention . 1 Mr, Watts-Dunton that poetry is incapable, through the necessary limitation of mere urtleuiated words, of rendering the most passionate expression uf the emotions. This Is mainly, as he truly points out. because the most passionate emotion, whether of love, rage or a i-guish, does not seek to express itself in
words; and he quotes the Niobe and IjUo-coon groups as superior as expressive art to the speech of Andromache to Heitor, to the cries of Cassandra in l*;c ** Agamemnon." and even to the waitings
of Lear over the dead Cordelia. I sahl •’startled," because, strangely enough, the view of his great namesake, Geotge *
F.	Watts, was the polat***contrary, and, oft repeated, was .generally accepted; he would habitually lament the fact tlur. painting; was but n poor medium for the expression of the higher . thoughts and more passionate emotions, and that If a cruel fate had not withheld from him the power of words he could have appealed In his didactic work more directly and powerfully to the human heart. Dout*.-less the theory of Mr. Watts-Duntoii comes nearer to the truth, ulbeit tUe actual limitation of the plastic or graphic artist is more narrowly restricted hy Its incapacity to do more than render tha emotion of the instant.—M. H. Spielmann
HC1TILLER YEAR.—Harvard thus takes the lead, and appropriately. In the celebration of Schiller year. As observed by Prof. Francke Jn the current number of The Harvard Monthly, "it seems peculiarly fitting that among American Institutions of learning Harvard University should bo the first to observe the Schiller centennial. I^or no other American university has so persistently and unswervingly stood for liberalism In every sphere of intellectual and mcral endeavor as Harvard; moreover. It was here that Schiller found his first Inspired interpreter in America, the never-to-be-forgotten Carl Follen, whose lecv»re** «u * Schiller's Life
and Dramas,’ delivered during the Winter of IStt-KI. and published in 1841 in the fourth vulume of iitn collected
works, arc still interesting to ua as a reflection of the youthful enthusiasm with which the liberalism of Schiller’s own generation and of that immediately following entered upon the fulfillment of Its tasks."
In Germany the Schiller year is already under way. Fur months past the repertoire of the leading German theatres has Included an unusual number of the great author's dramatic works. German scholars ’nave turned their energies anew to the study of I he man and to every as-I»cct of his work; various publications espcclaiiy devoted to the occasion—
" Festsehriften." as they are called— bringing together ;he estimates and tributes of leading names in every branch of thought, nre appearing constantly, and will make altogether an impressive array. Among the universities and learned societies the occasion is receiving appropriate recognition. The name " Schiller.” more than at any previous time, is in Germany to-day a name to conjure with; remarkable evidence, it may be added, that not only the works but the personality of the great autnor gained a most enduring hold upon the minds and hearts of the German people, and «f other peu-! pics as well,-Boston Transcript.	I
I DISRAELI AS A " ROM A NT KY1 —The typical Disraeli, from the point of view of the literary critic If not of the politician— the Disraeli who Inspires enthusiasm in the breasts of youthful hero-worshippers— only found full and persuasive expression in the 1'oung England sequence.
It is usual to regard those novels as having been, in the first instance and in the last resort, political manifestoes. They have, or course, their very definite relation to their author's political ambitions.
just as George Sand's novels have their very definite relation to their author’s amorous enterprises. Politics was his medium as illicit love was hers. But the artistic merit is independent of the medium in the one case as in the other, and has even less to do with it in the case of the KngJi.shman than fa thrtt of the Frenchwoman.
Disraeli was the contemporary of the great Romantics—of Victor Hugo, anil Dumas, nnd George Sand, and Baltic, ami Alfred de Musset. His novels may be regarded as great English examples or the I work of the Romantic movement.
It is easier to define Romanticism than to be sure that one's definition will stand all the tests that may be applied to it and fit all tho eases which it is designed to cover. Hut it means among other things the lifting of literature to a higher level than that of an exercise in composition— the breaking away from the classici! and conventiniuil rules which t* tided to reduce it to that level—the attempt to see life, whether of the ptsl or of the present, through a temperament, to bring some strictly personal contribution to the lit-j erury feast, to impose a view of life, and I lo rrilh-ise Jife, if not in set terms, at least by implication. It was also perhaps essential to Romanticism to find life, if | not beautiful in alt its details, at least striking and grandiose, and speetacuhr
in Its total effect, Dismeir^ novels fulfill
all these conditions und fulfill them in an eminent degree. They have, of course, their limitations. They lack certain great ; qualities to be found in most of the great-j est novels both of the same school and of i other schools. In particular they kick emotion. Not only the obvious pathos of : Dickens, but also the more subtle pithos . of Thackeray is wanting to them; and the 1 loves of the various sets of lovers are quite unconvincing. No reader ever be-| licved in the alleged passion of Conings-| by for Edith or of Egremont for Sybil. Statements are made on these subjects; but the actual passions are not conveyed to the reader because they are not realized by the writer. This is the price which Disraeli pays for realising other sentiments too vividly. Overweening ambition to succeed in the world and the doctrine that the world is well lost for love are incompatible;-*. A man must choose between them, although it will be an unconscious choice determined by his temperament; and the choice wilt be reflected in his writings. So with Disraeli.
SI) c Jfeur JjjorkEtmcs
U was through the eyes of ambition— .*1 magnificent :tnd grandiose ambition-thal li<* looked upon tlio world which In* was j lo inUTpr^t as ;i novelist.	1
Y«*t ambition—though it explains Ihe nnrraliJy o|' the love stories—is not tlio j last W'Hd to he spoken in tho matter. A
inorr i)Ot(Tt factor in the molding nf thr*
novels was Disraeli's eye for the spectacular. ff all rhe world was a stage for him, at l*':ist he was more concerned with tli«* miy*’-on-sct’ne than with the drama. I lie* realized life as something potentially, if not actually. very gorgeous; and lie was impelled so to render it. His genius lay t:i his ability ro to render it without having recourse to otner materials than those at the disposition of all the world— to arrive at the ideal by transfiguring the real—to build a stately edifice ’v'*'* -wy dirty bricks. Por he had no illusion^
to the worthlessness cf most of the personages that fill Ills pages and give its charactcr to the society therein described, lie Is absolutely cynical about the Rig* bys, and Tapers, and Tadpoles, and other sycophants who offer themselves for sale; about tho professional politicians for whom politics is a game with £l,i!00 a year for the prize: about the great political dames who are always Intriguing for sinecures for their younger sons; about thr- noblemen who have perfect manners but no hearts; about the laboring classes who do not know what they would do with their charter if they got it; about the landed gentry who hold that any cottager ought to be happy and contented on 8s. a week; about the Bishops who regard any young man who is serious about his religion as a visionary; about nearly everybody and nearly everything. One could not easily imagine a sorrier company, pursuing grosser ideals more blindly, than that which he prinrJpatly depicts. But he secs all this, -and then sees further. He pictures youth, the trustees of posterity, working upon thfs unpromising material, and setting in motion the machinery that shall transform it. There are no details— no specific directions; but, somehow or other, character and enthusiasm are to operate like the magician’s wand. Somehow or othnr all that Is good in feudalism
is to revive; somehow or other—we certainly are not shown exactly how—the sovereign and the people are to combine to dish the Whigs. The aristocracy are to distribute alms; the agricultural laborers are to dance around the Maypole; and true religion is to flourish and abound.
This is a beautiful picture In the romantic manner; and to take it seriously ag politics would be to spoil it. It is incredible that Disraeli took it seriously himself, though It might be interesting to inquire how much ol r-erious Intent there was behind it. Assuredly there was nothing serious in the sigh for feudalism. To regard that emotion as anything but sentimental would be to write Disraeli down a fool who was blind to the signs of the times; and whatever he may have been he was not thaf. The feudalism seemed essential to the picture, and so he put it in.—London Timet*.
THACKERAY AND DICKENS.—In a review of Mr. Percy Fitzgerald’s book on " The Garrick Club.” it is stated that as the author "accuses Thackeray of having attacked Dickens some time or other
in * Fraser.’ he had better produce the evidence. As it stands, this loose statement conveys the impression that there is something in * Fraser * not to Thackeray’s credit. It is ‘ not generally known,* says Mr. Fitzgerald. Then let us all know it.” The reference. T take it, is to a short passage in “ Catharine not as a rule given in the reprinted editions of that story—in	which Thackeray protested
against the “Newgate parts” or “Oliver Twist *’ and other, popular novels of the time, adding 44 the pathos of the workhouse scenes in 4 Oliver Twist,’ of the Fleet Prison dcscriptlans in * Pickwick,’ is genuine and pure—as much of this as you please; as tender a hand to the poor, as kindly a word to the unhappy as you will, but, in the name of common sense, let us not expend our sympathies on cutthroats and other such prodigies of evil."
I do not think llint Mr. Fitzgerald can point out any worse “ attack " by Thackeray on Dickens than this perfectly legitimate piece of criticism.—Walter Jerrold in London Academy.
“ COMMENCED AL’THOR.”—You state that the phrase ** lie commenccd author ** is not English at nil. Will you allow me to point out that in the eighteenth century it was thought not only English but good English, for it was a favorite expression of Dr. Johnson’s? He says of Akensidc 44 he first commenced physician at Northampton" and uses the same phrase about Sir Richard Blackmore. He also says of Young “ whether he ever commenced tutor is uncertain." (See ** Lives of the English Poets.")
The expression seems to have been not uncommon In the eighteenth century, though It afterward went out of use, till latterly revived. Whether this old phrase Is an English emigrant returned from America I will not venture to say.—J. F. P. in London Saturday Review.
