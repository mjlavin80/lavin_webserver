" Epoch Maps Illustrating American History,” by Albert Bushnell Hart appeared first in J8!)l; reissued nine times since then, it is now revised a second time, and embraces fourteen historical maps showing the various stages in our history since UKO. Prof. Ilart is also the editor of ** Epochs of American History," and tlie author of numerous works on the subject, besides occupying the Chair of History in Harvard. Those maps are identical with those in the ** Epochs of American History,” brought down to date by including the recent annexations of territory. They are made from ''the original records—from the texts of grants, charters, and Governors* instructions, and from statutes, British, Colonial, State, and National. In showing the territorial development of the United States, the principle adopted has been to make the maps conform to the official treaties and to tlie laws of the United States, ns understood at the time when they were negotiated or enacted. The most typical map or all Is No. 11, territorial controversies, 1840-1850. It shows all the claims by both sides in Mffine, Texasr nnd Oregon, just*what was advanced before the Court of Claims, and what was finally allowed in each ease. (New York: Longmans. 50 cents.)
