Praise for “ The Grito.”
Keio York Times Book Review:
The reception Grito," a novel by Miss Moncure Lyne, has met with cannot fail to be gratifying: to the writer and her many friends. Miss Lyne is a residont of Richmond, Va. The scene of the story is Texas, and it covers the period of the winning of that vast empire by the ster- ! ling patriots of 3830 against the machinations of the cruel and brutal Santa Anna and hfs mongrel horde. The narrative is so graphic and realistic that one cifn almost imagine he is nn actor in the scenes and witnessing the events so glowingly depicted. The love story, which terminates in the usual way, blended as it is with hJstorJe data, is like ** apples of gold In pictures of silver." History and romance, fact and fiction, are so intimately intermixed that it is almost impossible to separate one from the other, and we are constrained to say, in the words of the Psalmist, " Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other." Tlie descriptions of nature are delightfully picturesque and present a pleasing and varied coloring; in fact, nature is improved upon by the poetic fervor, the vivid fancy, of the writer, and her touches are truly artistic as nature herself, and are as fresh and fragrant as tho morning breezes laden with the scent of blossoming flowers and ripening fraits, and one can almost see the ; dowdrops scintillating In the sunlight, hear the whisper of the balmy zephyrs, tlie sough of tho wind, the ripple of the. • glad waters, and the song of the merry birds caroling from verdant groves. The illustrations and allusions employed indicate not only a cultivated mind, but a strongly retentive memory. The subtle touches of human nature that run like a woof of golden thread through the warp of a garment show a keen insight into : the mysteries of the human heart, and exhibit sentiments and sensibilities ennobling and elevating. These sentiments j and touches are often depicted in virile I and vigorous English, accentuated and j punctuated with the peculiar idioms and j vernacular of the people covered by the 1 story. The plot is natural and not exaggerated beyond the poetic lirense of the romancer. The interjection of the patois of Mexico does not savor of pedantry, but gives zest and naturalness to the characters depicted anti the environment.
