BOSTON NOTES.
Phillips Oppenheim’s New Novef-Forthcomin^: Books on the Puba lishers’ Lists.
PHILLIPS OPPENHEIM, in his ** Mysterious Mr. Sabin/’ to be published to-morrow, prodiets that Germany will provoke war with England, and France will revert to a monarchical Government, but neither prediction is fulfilled In tlio stovy. It belongs to the feronp, now almost large enough to merit library classification, o£ hooks written on the hypothesis lliat the Gorman Emperor is superhuman; and it introduces one novel personage, an English Admiral partly crazed by the tragic destruction of tho Victoria, but still so profoundly wise in naval matters
and coast <Menswj lluu tlio spies of rival
empires lay siege to a. study in which he works at plans to save, his country. Messrs. Little, Brown & Co. are tlie publishers of the novel.
*' An American Girl in Munich,*' subtitled '* Impressions of a Music Student," is almost ready for. publication by the same firm. Tlio author, Miss Mabel W. Daniels, is a Radcliffe graduate, who studied a year in Munich, and describes her daily life, criticising the music which she hears and comparing the musicians anti conductors with those of her own country. A German lov*_ story is part
of tho tnlp, and saulnii.s contempl;itlng
study in a CSermnn city may find useful the hints concerning domestic matters?, and the conservatory system.
Miss Carolyn WVlls will appear in Messrs. Houphton, Alifflin Co/s list of authors this Autumn. Mrs. Elizabeth no(»ins Fennell. Dr.	Hanford Hen-
dersont Mr. Herbert K, Job, Dr. Andrew Macphai], Prof. George H. Palmer, Prof. Charles S. Sargent, and the Bishop of Ftipon will be among her serious companions on that list. Andy Adams, as is his wont, will take the middle course between gravity and humor. It is hinted that the visit of Miss Findlater and her sister to Mrs. Wigsin may produce a novel in which American society and customs shall see themselves reflected in British eyes.
*•*
Dr. Nathan Gallizier’s " Castel del Monte,” to be issued next month by Messrs. L. C. Page & Co., has a scene portraying the excommunication of Manfred in the Cathedral o£ Palermo. Tills should be very impressive, but it is hardly safe to venture upon any predictions in regard to the fate of Catholic ceremonial in fiction.
•**
Mr. Frank O. Small's paintings, from which the illustrations were made for " Stepping Stones of American History,” have attracted much attention during their exhibition at the Public Library, but the book, costly as it is. has from the beginning of the Autumn season been one of the most successful on the list of Messrs. W. A. Wilclc & Co, Fcrhaps this Is not wonderful, however, inasmuch as *hc volume represents some three years of planning and advising with educators of experience before the authors, each one aware of tlie plans of all the others, began work.
***
The most successful book, however, on the firm’s list Is'the Rev. Dr. Peloubet’s " Select Notes/’ the commentary on the International Sunday School Lessons, which Is now in Its thirty-first volume, with an annual circulation of C5.000.
*•*
Miss Mary llazelton Wade’s " Ten Little Indians,” published last season by the same house, will bo followed this year i>y
•’ Ten Big Indians/’ containing tlie biographies of ten Chiefs, and a second book from her pen will appear on the list for 1905.
■%*
Messrs. H. M. Caldwell & Co. will continue the “ Pleasant Street ” series in the Autumn, and also tlie pretty set which began with " The Value of Friendship ” and "The Value of Cheerfulness/’ At present thoy arc busy with ** Lawsonucd Lyrics/’ by “Jyngo/’ a wicked little book, In which it is not difficult to detect the artist, the author, and the designer of the cover as one and the same, ** L. J. B.” STEPHENSON BROWNJ5.
