Volume X.—tho final vnlumo—of tho ".History of Irish Literature ” (ten volumes. Octavo. Three-quarters green crushed morocco. Gilt tops. Illustrated. Philadelphia: John D. Morris & Co.) contains specimens of the ordinary Irish language of tho people as they have had it for the laHt couple of hundred years, i and ns they have it now. Examples are I given only of modern Irish authors. There are stories, songs, nnd sayings of the people themselves, nnd a large number o.f them have been written by schol-nrs for old people in Ireland who did not know how to read or wrtte their language. Another part of the book contains extracts from writings ot such Irishmen as Father Peter O’Leary, James Doyle, Conan Mnol (P. J, O’Shea), Patrick O'Leary, Thomas Hayes, Father Dtneen, Tndhg O’Donoghue, and others.
The book contains biographies of the authors, modern and ancient; whose work appears in the ten volumes; a glossary of more common Erst expressions, nnd a general index to the whole work. The Erst and English texts fnca each other. There are also a map of Ireland to-day and five Illustrations, the frontispiece being In color and shewing1 Uie characteristic costume of the older village folk in Ireland. It represents an old woman al a spinning wheel, which denotes an industry that has not yet died out. The other Illustrations are portraits of Patrick O’Shea, the Rev. Patrick S. Dineen, and Turlough O’Carulun, and a photographic facsimile of a part of a proclamation concerning Shane the Proud.
What may be called a sort of foreword | Is an essay on “ The Irish Drama," by | Stephen Gwynn, the critic. It deals I with the Irish Literary Theatre, and ! the part in the present volume Is an account of the Irish National Dramatic So-eiety. Mr. Gwynn describes some plays by W. B. Yeats and others, which were performed by members of the Society. To the article is appended tlio " last word ” 011 the subject by Lady Gregory:
There has always, on the part of Uie Irish people, been a great taste for dramatic dialogue. The 11 Arguments of Olsln and Patrick ’’ are repealed by jH>asants for hours together with the keenest delight nnd appreciation. Other dramatic " arguments" appeal to them —the ** Argument of Itaferly with Death," the " Argument of Kaferiy with Whiskey." or the argument between a Connaught herd and a Munster herd as to the qualities of the two provinces. These old pieces are recited and followed with excitement, showing how naturally the dramatic sense appeals to the Celtic mu nre. it is curfmis, therefore, that
only now should Irish drama be finding its full expression, and not at all cur-
1	ious that It lias taken such a hold ui>on ; tlie country. The dramatic movement had made really an enduring impression upon the life and intellectual activity ot the people.
