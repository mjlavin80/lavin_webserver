It was perhaps Disraeli’s real opinion of Gladstone tbatrfound expression in these disparaging sentences: “WithjUl his abilities and achievements, Joseph Toplady Falconet was essentially a prig:, and among prigs there is a freemasonry that never fails. All the prigs spoke of him as tho coming man," That Is perfectly characteristic of the distinguished and noble author, and it is a good example of the quality which makes this unfinished story by him so highly readable. The characters are marshaled, the story is already well on its feet, ihe action has begun with a notably lively movement already suf-j ficient to evoke the reader’s interest,

The hitherto unpublished story by Benjamin Disraeli. Lord Beaconsfield, which will appear in the Sunday edition of Thb New York Times, beginning Jan. 22, is a novel of satire and philosophy, the philosophy being a part of the satire. The nine chapters suffice to present to the reader a group of clearly drawn and sharply differentiated characters. As in all of Disraelis novels, the satire is directed against English titled and middle-class society.

Their plot to make the j silly and credulous, but socially power-| ful Lady Bertram the leader of their j cult vividly recalls the story of Mme.
I Blavatsky’s relation to the sudden 1 flowering out of Theosophy in New York some years ago. Finally there is Mr. Gladstone, Lord Beaconsfield’s lifelong opponent .whom the reader will at once recognize in the character of Joseph Toplady Falconet. The portrait is drawn with an audacious likeness to the original, and upon this personage the author with visible delight expends his sharpest satire. The pietistic activities of Falconet’s early youth are delineated; his Oxford career, liis entry into politics, his election to the House of Commons, the fervor and zeal with which he devotes himself to public affairs, and notably his eloquence and wonderful flow of words, serve to make the development of the character fol-
