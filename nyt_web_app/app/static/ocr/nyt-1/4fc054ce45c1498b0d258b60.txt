objection to Mr, Clemens’s scheme—i* his judgment.
We regret to say tb-for reasons which Mark Twain will sadly appreciate, this scheme of his, sensible as It actually Is In some regards, and truly philanthropic, will probably appeal* to the wayfaring man In Congress a mere Joke, and rather a puzzling one. It *\ill not be less puzzling when some (me points out that the eighth paragraph of the eighth section of tho first article of the Constitution must be amended before copyright can be given except '* for Umlted times,"
| CONCERNING COPYRIGHT. J
Mr. Samuel L, Clemens may be veiled on to view any cucstion to which his glance is drnwu " under an angle,” as
•	•nr trandfatiiors were \v„»nt to say, Quite different from the usual. In the i
New Year number of The North Amcrl' can Review he takes up a special phase
of the question of copyright and treats it, if not quite convincingly, certainly in a manner that will well repay the time spent in reading his half dozen pages..
Hia article is couched In what ho calls " the unconventional form of question and answer"—a form not usually adopted in official communications, but not rare among the writers of polemics. The questions he puts in the mouth of the Register of Copyrights; the answers flow, with the facility that might be expected, from his own. -rhe object of ! this Soeratic method is to reduce the Register of Copyrights to abject acceptance of Mr. Clemens's arguments, and the aim of those arguments is to I make it clear that the limitation of copyright to forty~two years is a gross wrong to the writers, very few in num-her—about one in two hundred and j fifty—whose books outlive that period. At the end of the time, all right of property ceasing, the profits of further issues go to the publishers, neither the writers nor their descendants getting anything. It is a *’ crime perpetrated : by a great country, a proud world I power, upon ten poor devils a year. Tho profits on * L’ncle Tom's Cabin * continue to-day: nobody but the'publishers gets them—airs. Stowe's share ceased seven years before she died; her daughters receive nothing from the book. Years ago they found themselves no longer able to live in their modest home and had to move out and find humbler quarters. Washington Irving’s poor old adopted daughter fared likewise "—and so on.
The remedy? As easy as lying. Continue the copyright indefinitely on condition that in the forty-second year the , owners shall issue an edition at a price equal to 25 cents for each lOO.UUO words or Jess, which edition shall be kept permanently on sale or the copyright lapse. This is about 20 per cent, of the usual price. Mr. Clemens reckons that it would yield a reasonable profit to the j printer and tlie binder and the middle-j man and a small profit to the publisher. The owner of the copyright would get no profit from this edition, but it would ‘ so advertise and stimulate the sale of other editions that both the publisher !
