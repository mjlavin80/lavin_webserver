Xcw York Times Ilool: Review:
It strikes me that to give unmitigated pral.se to the work of Mr. Henry James shows as much lack in critical faculty or gcod judgment :is the flinging his books aside with the verdict of “ no good.'* That Mr. James’s literary style is incontestably open to severe criticism goes without saying, for his sentences are so involved, so twisted, so distorted, that they would drive a grammarian mad.
I place ms’self in the ranks of this author's friends and admirers. He is a man of genius; lie has a wonderful gift of analysis. And lie sees far into tlie hearts and minds of men and women. It is simply his style, his way of putting things, that I condemn. Why should things exquisite and fine bo tortured out of all shape and comeliness by being forced into words and sentences that, according to the ordinary rides of syntax and prosody, would nut be admissible in the " theme ” of a grammar school youngster? To enshrine fine thoughts, clover and powerful cliaractc-rization, and
all else that goes to the making of a fireat fiotionisl, in sentences such as those in which Mr. James buries his ideas, is like a beautiful and radiant soul in a deformed body. If one admired Mr. James less one would not be so exasperated by Ids abominable poses, which are purely artificial and inexcusable on any ground.
