LM.U1 ERNEST HENLEY. —To conquer a new province for tlio poetry of all the worj<l and to free English vcrfc from the trammels—if such they De—of rhyme— these were the achievements of 'William Ernest Henley by which ho will bo principally known when the history of English literature of the past two decades is written.
What Whitman did for battle scenes in poetry Henley did for lifu in a hospital, 1 What Heine did lor broken lines ami vers libres in Gorman Henley did in English, j Ami, indeed, it is of Whitman and Heine I that one is most frequently reminded in studying Henley’s poetry; of Heine bc-cauf=c of his nmSInr lyrical tarn, Ms litUo sons?5, his “gay, golden-vowcled madri-paI.-.*■' Only, where Heine was essentially romantic, where ho celebrated Seraphinc nnd Angoitque nnd Clarissa ntid mans' j more, the English poet srng to his one ' sweetheart, his wife. • * 1 Ag^iin, Henley did for the broken lin for uurhymed , verse, what Whitman tried to <]o, and in only rare instances completely succecded; tho difference being that i;i Henley one fei'Jj*, "Here is true poetry"; in Whitman, “Here is poetry 111 solution, more
*»r less murky.” With Whitman, tuo, Henley rvajs the poet who sang of death. To him death was ever present, as present as to the Florentines of the Renaissance. His own life a fight more or loss with constant sickness, existence was to
him a battlefield, in which, nevertheless, he enjoyed fighting. e * * So much for the main currents of hia poetry. It was in 18NS that his now famous " A Book of Versos ” was given lo the world. It container! the celebrated poems entitled *4 In Hospital,” enough, one would think, to have made any young poet’s fame. Yet Henley says, "After spending the belter part of my life in the pursuit of poetry : I found myself so utterly unmarketable that I had to own myself beaten in art.*’ As for the hospital verses, " they had long ! since been rejected by every editor of standing in London.” And, indeed, there i was little wonder.* Hero were not cut and | dried subjects, nor reminiscences of anything that had gone before. Here were new subjects and daring rhythms. You i read these verses and you pass out from the open air into an Edinburgh . I “ Hospital, gray, quiet, old,	j

INTERNATIONAL COPYEIGHT.-Con-eidering that an American author can secure copyright here without any of tho restrictions—in many cases prohibitory— . necessary for an English work in the United States, it does not seem a very great thing to aslc that the English author should at least be as favorably treat-od as a foreigner by being allowed a year’s grace after publication in his own i country before losing th© American copyright. As X am asked for my own experience of the present system, here it is for whatever it may be worth. Since the American Copyright act was passed in l«n I have published several serials here under circumstances which made it impossible to secure the American copyright by simultaneous publication. In other cases I have, through my publishers, made arrangements for the purpose; in other cases, again, I have tried, and failed, to find an American publisher In time.
I find that the total amount I have received during the thirteen years o:i account of American royalties is well under £U50, if it even exceeds £100.
I r-uiU: realize that one of the reasons fcv this state of things may be that my work is not so fortunate as to appeal to the Aiijcrican public, and I do m*t indulge the hope that the 1 roposed alt Brat ion hi the conditions would make any appreciate difference so fzir as I personalty am contcmed.
But ,1 feel certain that It wou.d be of immense benefit to the majority of English authors, especially in the case of a first book for which the American copyright could not have been secured under present conditions, and which obtains an unexpected success in England. Its author would then have a twelvemonth during which some American publisher would, on hearing of the vo£ue tho book was enjoying, be certain to offer handsome terms for the copyright.
I have some hope that, if the case of the English author were once put before the' Senate, their own sense of fair play, backed; *as I believe It would be, by the opinion of all the leading literary men of America,, would remove the fn justice, at all events: to the extent of placing us in a position corresponding to that of foreigners under the new act.

UNCUT LEAVES.—Was Napoleon In the habit of cutting his books with his fingers? The Revue Biblio-Iconogra-phique of Paris crotc-sts against the idea, and says tlmt. Napoleon only cut worth* loss books with his fingers. I am afraid that is an experience he shares with many reviewers; there arc “books that are no books,' and most of the books that come ’
to a newspaper office aro :n this category, in any case X know one bookluvcr who can cut a book with his fingers with as great a neatness as most readers can do it with a paper knife. Not many arc guilty of Wordsworth’s crime of culling a really superior book with a knife with vJiicii the poet had just been buttering tc.'.ai:.—clement Shorter in The London Sphere.
SrniLLKR S *'.ROBBER V—It ccr-ta/nly seems a Jong cry from Schi " Kauber ” lo Milton’s " Paradise Lost b’jt I have just been rrruhj)/; an article
in t!iis motuh'ii Deutsein llundsclnu on the place of " Die Rltubev ” in the 1 iterating of tho world, which loos nuieh to establish what might at firrt sight f!pperu* to ho hut a forced and fancif.il similarity. Apart from ihe fact lim ihe styles of the two works deiive their inspiration to a great extent from tlie Bible, both " Die Kauber" nnd "Para Use Lost" exhibit that militant Puritan spirit, that insistence on a complete reconciliation between God and man, which is ono of tho cardinal features of the old Germanic spirit. lint, as was only natural in an age whose chief mark was the {‘mancipation of the individual, it was the character of Satan which exercised the greatest Influence on Schiller, an Influence practically acknowledged by the following reference by Schiller in his own cditim of his play: “Milton, who wrote the panegyric of hf If, mi make for a few moments even tho most sensitive of readers into a fallen angel." The following pair of passage.-: reveal, moreover, an analogy so pronounced as to border dangerously on imitation. In Milton’s "Paradise Lost," I., 24S, Satan says; '
The mint! is Us own plaor ami in.itsolf <*an make n heaven of hell, a lw-U nf hi-avi*n.
In Schiller's "Ole Riiulmr" Karl Moor gives vent to precisely Uie same sentiment. ** Externals ate merely the varnish of man; 1 mysr-11 am my heaven and my hell.” Though, However, l ihink the analogy holds good, the writer strikes me i ns unhappy in his choice of quotation.
! Tlie idea in belli passages is grjod. but Is it not »mir that wa« bound to have suggested itself to almost any vigorous mind? Does it not, in fact, date as far back as Omar Khayyam?	-
Schiller, however, admired Shakespeare even mere enthusiastically than he did Milton, and the writer of the article proceeds to trace the psychological genealogy of Franz Moor from Richard in., lago, and Edmund. The analogy with the latter character Is particularly Striking, as both Pran2 and Edmund intrigue against their brothers by means of a forged letter and lay violent hands on thefr own fathers. But Schiller’s literary outlook was cosmopolitan, and it is interesting to see from the following extract from tho preface and the revised edition the extent to which he was influenced by Plutarch and Cervantes:	!
“ And so was finished this extraordinary Don Quixote whom as Bobber Moor 1 we fear nnd love, wonder at and pity. I This extraordinary individual [Karl Moor] ' owes his main features to Plutarch and j Cervantes, who, after the method of ' Shakespeare, have been blended by the 1 poet's spirit into a new character that is at onco true and harmonious.*’
I cannot but think, however, that the writer exaggerates the importance of the | play in European literature. Is not the significance of " Die Rauber" rather psychological than artistic? In spite of the fact that it still keeps the stage in ■ Germany, the play should rather bo regarded as the outlet for the ferment of Schiller’3 adolescence than as a serious literary achievement of the first rank. Apropos of "Die RUuber/’ I do not remember ever having . seen noticed the striking analogy between the robber scenes of this play and “ Contarini Fleming.’’—Lonaon Academy,
