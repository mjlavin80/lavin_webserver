A New Biography of the Famous Philanthropist, with an Introduction by the Duke of ArgyH.:':
IS not sufficient, as the Duke of Argyll says, to look to tlu* State alone for help.
It is rather by (ho devotion of the individual that the public weal is brought about. ; ** Tho influence of persons i unconnected with the official service of the State will always be necessary to fight ceil teniP*ncies.’' JJcncvol«'iif t* and pood strong: common sense do not always work hand in hand. This biography nf Quint in Hogg tells of the life of a man who devoted his dfiys to the bettering of mankind. His philanthropic work wn.s tif ihe most practical kind. lie entered heart and s^ul into his work and his success was nothing short oi marvelous. Tlie s’ums of N«*w York aro certainly bad t-nough, but they are, or were, worse in London. Quintin Hogg. in his youth, when h*' first undertook his mission, was endowed with a strong and athletic frame; he was famous at Eton as a football player. Sometimes when making his way 11.rough the worst parts of London his life was in danger, and he only saved himself by his coolness and ability tu defend himself. He was no namby-pamby missionary. With a singularly uncouth j clement he had to become the ruler. If j he -was the master, the dirty, ragged 1 urchins, almost naked, half starved, though they bent to his will, soon learned j to love him for his manly bearing, anti because of bis real kindness to them. Quin-tin Hogg’s daughter, the author of her father's biography, says;
Tlie boys used to come in an undesirable condition, so that it was absolutely noc-csary to shave their heads and literally scrub them from head to foot before they were fit to associate with human beings; all of which unpleasant operation Mr. Hogg used to perform with his own hands.
Hogg was just about taking a holiday when th<i cholera broke out in London, and of course was at its worst in the slums. Without a second thought he gave up his holiday.
Almost the first day in the dislvict assigned me made me forget any feeling of regret I might have had. • I found a little boy lying helpless, almost unconscious. sickening for illness. Taking an
o	ran go from my pocket. I squeezed some of the juicc into his mouth, nnd tried to nurse him as best I knew how. though, poor fellow, his condition was such as to make him anything but attractive. Foul as to liis linen, foul as to his body, foul as to his head, there was little beautiful about him except tho childlike gratitude he had for perhaps the only kindly treatment he had known for many a long day. When I was going away he put his arms up and said, ’* Do kiss me,
Sir. No one has ever kissed me since my mother died,'* and one forgot the dirt and uncleanliness of the surroundings to | pity the poor child.	I
Quintin Hogg, the creator of the Ragged School, and above all of the deservedly | famous Polytechnic, was born in 1S40 I in London. The family was of Scotch and Irish origin. His father was Sir James, and a man of large means. Ho had hold several lucrative Government positions in India. In 1858 Quintin was sent to Eton. Though passionately fond of athletic sports, the lad tried to inculcate among his fellows some religions thoughts; and under his direction a Bible class was opened. His sympathies were early directed toward poor and needy j children. When on liis holidays at home, ; he induced his father to permit some of the most unfortunate of the poor children to have a lodging given them In his :
■	father's stables. When the boy left Eton, in 1SG3. the choice was given him of going to Oxford or taking a position in a. business firm in London. At first he entered a tea house, but subsequently found employment in a large sugar concern As be walked through the London streets the poor children again attracted Ills attention. In after life ho recalled an
answer given him by a child, who. when asked what he\know aboht God, replied,
41 Why, that’s the chap wot sends us • to 'ell.”	.
Tlie worst slum was about where the Law Courts now-stand on Fleet Street, and this quarter had a particular interest for the lad. He wanted to work to ameliorate the sad conditions of the children there.
1 Asking a clergyman of the parish as to what he might do; he received his first directions. He associated dircctly with the street sweepers and the bootblacks. ' -He bought a second-hand suit of. shoe. black’s clothes and the outfit and set to work. It is believed that he once blacked ' his father’s boots; escaping recognition.
-	Leaving liis own luxurious home of nights he wr 1 ?pend his time; under the arches of the Adelphl. Then, in conjunction with v Artliur Kinhaird, now . Lord Kinnaird, lie hired a- room and opened a school. It ‘ was furnished with a-few rough benches, arid was lighted by • candles stuck in empty; beer* bottles. Next schools were.es-r tnblished <by'hlm - for both girls arid boys ' in^the Verftable/ces^	and
■rice* The boy.phiianthropist^held^sway/ j for he/became known" as’ a determined ..
enemy of crime and as outspoken as he was courageous. lie was endowed with both infinite patience and perseverance.
Before long the schoolrooms became overcrowded. 1 lis efforts to get the boys away from reading wicked and worthless trash so common on b6th sides of the Atlantic are worth remembering. A great many of his attempts were fruitless, until at last lie read to liis class Kingsley’s " Westward Hoi '* and then the delight oT the children was evident. For not Itli.tn five years after leaving Kton liis life was d*-voted to these schools For all this outside work, he attended stri-tly (•» th*- business of liis employers. As his
biographer expresses it:
It is difficult lo connect in one's mind tlie picture of tlie passionately earnest young man, spending himself so ungrudgingly in the service of the poor and wrei eh* “t 1. f'nd the industrious, hardworking man nf business, quickly mastering the details or his worK, and fojluw-ini* with interest all that might affect the Welfare of trade.
It was the Ragged School in Of Alley. Adelphi. that suggested in Quintin Ilogg’s mini! tlie concept ion of the Polytechnic.
It was but natural that he should want to give his hoys nnd girts a higher education. When this great movement began the poor had no opportunities of aetiuir- i ing knowledge, Practical trade instruction was entirely wanting Even the high- . or classes looked on any attempt to educate the masses with suspicion. This Polytechnic was Quintin Hogg's supreme achievement. At first the lectures were poorly attended, but -soon the desire to improve took bold of the English mechanic and tho lecture room became overcrowded. As time wont on the success of the Polytechnic was assured. Hogg carried out also a plan of emigration for English lads. When one learns that during all tho last twelve years of his life lie was in the worst health and suffering greatly, our admiration of the man increases. At certain intervals, sometimes on business or for the improvement of his health, he took long journeys abroad, and visited all parts of the world. He was in the United Stntes several times. Once an athlete, Quintin Hogg realized the advantages of adding physical training to the love of religion. To show how large and broad was the man's soul, he built temples for Hindus, and mosques for Mohammedans. There Is to-day in the remotest West many a hardy settler whose transplantation Is due to Quintin Hogg. The man w'ho had labored so long and so faithfully died In li*02, when not quite fifty-eight. Of those who attended his funeral “ there was probably scarce one whose life, directly or indirectly, had not at some period been influenced, enriched, ennobled by him.”
