“ Speak Gently.”
A’cw York Timex Book llcvtew:
Concerning the authorship of the poem ** Speak Gently/' about which H. B., Main Street, Binghamton, Inquires, (Appeals to Readers, Nov. 10,) let me say that Appleton’s Cyclopaedia of American Biography states that David Bates was the author of that poem. Many of Bates's poems were published in book form under the title “ The Eolian.*' (Philadelphia, 1&48,) and a complete edition of them was edited by his son, (Philadelphia, 1870.)
Writing of ** The Eolian," Godey's Magazine, February, 18411, in its Editor's Book Table, says: "There is one poem in this collection which will make the name of the author always remembered. * Speak Gently * is one of the sweetest effusions of the muse."
There is a piece of music now before me, published in Boston in 184G, of six stanzas, four lines each, having the same lines given by your inquirer, entitled “ Speak Gently," to which are added the words " adapted to a beautiful melody the composition of W. V, Wallace."
It thus appears that the facts are just the reverse of what one of your correspondents states—the words of the song were really by Bates and the music by Wallace.	S.	M.	M.
