Supposably “ Japan, the Eastern Wonderland/ was written by a Japanese for j the amusement and instruction of his friends in England, where he had received ! the finishing touches of his education. The narrator’s name is Kotaro and he I calls his sister Hana, meaning -Blossom. Their parents are poor rice grow- , ers living not far from Yeddo. Over the flat grounds there looms up in the distance the great mountain Fujh When Kotaro was bom, in 1850, lie was carried to the nearest Buddhist temple. The father wrote three names on slips of paper and threw the slips in the air before Uie gods, and the bit of paper which fell first contained the name given to the child. When he was fifteen another name was given to him. If he entered the service of the Government another new name was bestowed. After his death another name would be presented to his shades.
Seemingly nothing can be more happy than Japanese childhood. Kotaro’s mother carried him, when hu was an Infant, in the fo/ds of her loose robe, while he clung with his little hands around iiei neck. If he w;ts left at home there was nothing in the room for him to stumble over and so hurt himself. Japanese bubios " seldom or ever cry, because they are so gently dealt with in their infant days.” At the very beginning the children are taught obedience. They go to school early, even the very poorest, and all can read, write, and keep accounts. The special instruction given girls is to know how to keep house, to receive visitors, to make and pour tea, to play on the harp, or samisen; to arrange flowers, and to decorate rooms with them. The use of the fan is a special accomplishment. Fans serve on all occasions, and in the hands of a woman convey all kinds of meanings. You may almost talk with a fan. Occasionally the little girl Hana had a party* Then the mother painted her cheeks red, her lips crimson, powdered and whitened the rest of her face, and did up her hair stfffly, drawing it back and tying It tightly behind, and then frizzling It eut into a great chignon, which was ornamented with long gtlt and sliver pins and with flowers.	,
The boy longed to become a Samurai. He had an uncle who was a famous armorer, and that business carried with It much distinction. The lad went to Yeddo anti was his uncle's apprentice. He might become a priest or a soldier now. The past of Japan and much of its history is dwelt on in the volume. Wonderful have been the changes made during the second half of the last century. There has been the regeneration of Japan. Feudalism has been abolished, the Samurai have had their privileges curtailed. There are no processions of damios, when the prostrate merchants and the peasants lined the road, with their heads fn „he dust. There are no tortures for petty crimes. All religions are tolerated. The school children learn their lessons from Japanese translations of foreign text books. Native literature is not neglected, but it is no longer used as a guide.
