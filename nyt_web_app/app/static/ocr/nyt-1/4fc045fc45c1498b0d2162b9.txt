A Book About Its Working In Germany, France and Our Own Country.*
Mr.
HE great question which has been confronting the British public for the past months i^ the same as that very persistent issue in our own .National politics—tlie tariff. In Great Britain, however, Chamberlain’s powerful personality
jrave to the policy he advocated an air of novelty, though ideas similar to his own had been advanced by others. The British public thinks slowly and deliberates long before it acts, and fortunately for itself is in no danger of being swept off its feet by a brilliant minister or an abstract proposition. The volume before us is an endeavor to put before the British public, in a brief form, tlie tariff histories of Germany, France, and tlie I’nited States, for the purpose of showing how these countries have met the problems of free trade and protection. It is the work of a politician and an economist, who felt the necessity of coming to a clear and unprejudiced understanding of the great problem. Mr. Haldane is careful to observe in the preface, however. that the public must be wary of jumping at conclusions based on current opinion in foreign countries. Because pro-t*'Mion has worked well in one country it does not follow that it should be adopted by another.
The tariff history of Germany Is sketched from tho formation of the Zoll-verein to the present time. Considerable attention is given to Germnn economic thought on tlie subjr-et of protection and frei? trade. Works of an academic nature have had far mere practical influence on German tariff legislation than has been the case in the United States. Friedrich List's “ Nationals System der Politisehon Oekonomic " had an influence in Germany to which that of Adam Smith’s work in Great Britain alone can be compared. List's influence depended to a great extent upon the patriotic appeal to the German people which his book made. His arguments remind us of those advanced by our early tariff legislators on the necessity of protection for military and political reasons. It Is interesting to notice that neither List nor the great American protectionist, Clay, in their promulgation of the infant industries argument, originally favored protection as a permanent policy. The hlstoriacl school of German economists has, in the main, inclined to protection, though not regarding It as an ultimate ideal. This school disfavors making tariff policy a question of right or wrong, and insists that it, like the whole economic organization of society at a given time. Is merely a phase of a continual historical evolution.
More recent economic thought in Germany has been mainly protectionist, but tho Infant industries argument, being no longer tenable, has given way to the argument for the protection of agriculture. The theoretical free traders, of whom Prof. Brentano of Munich Is perhaps the best-known representative, favor the abolition of duties on agriculture as well as on manufactures, point out the essentially wasteful nature of protection, the power which it elves combinations at homo to maintain artificial prices, and declare that " tlie real protection of national !a-.bor is free trade." There is a middle school, also, which insists that the tariff problem admits of only relative solution, everything depending on time an£ place. After reading the first part of the book one feels that the English voter can derive very little practical help for his own problem from reviewing the history of the German tariff. As Mr. Ashley remarks, “ the safest lesson to draw from the experience of Germany Is the simple fact that changes In tariff policy have been only one, and commonly not the most important, among the many causes of her economic progress.”
The case of France may be dismissed with a word or two. It probably throws even less light on the respective merits of the tariff question than does Germany, and it affords the Englishman no more valuable lesson. The protective policy of the Third Republic seems to have had a bad effect on Industrial enterprise In France, but it has been only one of several influences making for economic stagnation, and it Is impossible to discover the force of this particular one. Mr. Ashley thus sums it up:
Of the French tariff legislation It can be said with-some confidence that, whatever it may have done to maintain agriculture—and even there it is arguable that it has .encouraged the continuance of old-fashioned. methods—it has wrought little good and in various ways much harm to industry and commerce.

In the United States the policy of protection has generally been considered to
*	have been begun by the tariff of ISIS. The preamble to the Tariff act of 1788, however, justifies the contention that the framers of that act had the Idea of protection pretty definitely in mind, and two years .later Hamilton, In his great

report on mn mi tortures, made a very elaborate argument for that policy. We cannot say that the Government was committed to protection till after the war of 1812, which built up American industry by cutting off foreign trade. The patriotic motive was extremely popular with our statesmen and legislators at this period. Protection was popular because it would make America industrially independent of Europe. By 1S&! It was .iccoming obvious that protectionists wore beginning to regard their policy as a permanent one. The result of this discovery was South Caro-lhm’s nullification, which in turn caused the compromise tariff of 1833 and the gradual abandonment of protection. The era of free trade preceding the civil war , is briefly described, and the leading : events in our tariii history since the war.
! President Cleveland's message of 18S7 ! definitely committed the Democrats to free trade and identified their opponents with protection. The campaign of 188S was fought out principally on this issue. In connection with this campaign is an excellent example of the trouble caused by a misleading statement. Mr. Stan-wood in his recent work on the American tariff says that the tariff had been the only real Issue in the canvass of 1SKS, and that the Republicans had the right to treat the result as a popular verdict for protection. Mr. Ashley echoes the same opinion on Page lilio, and neither one seems to have remembered that Mr. Cleveland on an avowed free trade plat-fnrm won a very considerable popular plurality over the Republican candidate, though he lost the election in the Electoral College. How <*:in wl* accept the result of the election as a popular approval of protection?
The conclusion reached by Mr. Ashley seems to be that protection in the United States has done a pood work, but that its work Is, in the main, done. That the tariff fosters the trusts Mr. Ashley Is, of course, able to s<*e, but he p:»ys little attention to this most important phase of the question, as it is not germane to his subject.
He has given an interestirifc history of the tariff in three great countries, but wc cannot see how tho results of his studies are going to enlighten his countrymen very much. It is; after all. only by studying their own conditions that Englishmen will be capable of solving their own problem.
