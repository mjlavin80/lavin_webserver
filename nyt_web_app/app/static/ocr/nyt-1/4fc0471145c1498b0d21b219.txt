So I could so on telling^of the suggestions and influences this remarkably high-toned book has produced upon. me* Tho time is ripe for such an atmosphere to pervade our fiction, an atmosphere freo from the adulterated strain, imbued with profound thought, true ideals and humanity’s progress, even if permeated with limitations which are yet to be eliminated from the race.

Xcir York Times lionl: Jicrlnr:
Arc book reviews a help or not? asks a friend. Here is a notice of Elizabeth .Porter Gould's story, “A Pioneer Doctor." which savs it reads " like a story of real life," and in the same mail comes another from an equally reliable paper winch says that it has “ no semblance of reality.” Now what are we going to do? Of this same story one paper says “ its spirit and underlying motives in the writing are so noble as to place the book beyond tlie pale of criticism ” and another narrows it to a mere Sunday school basis. Such diverse opinions may lead to a reading of books; but do they add to true criticism? Do they lead us to read a book with that freedom we desire when new things are placed before us? T, for one. rend Miss Gould's book before seeing a single review; and 1 must confess Unit it held my attention to the end, that it read like a real story. There were places of joy as well as of sorrow that called forth tears. I do not recall that I ever read a more beautiful love scene than that on Pages ‘JOO and -01. The-characters are distinct creations. I am acquainted with them, and I actually made und enjoyed
that visit of tho futhor and mnthor to tin* doctor at Beirut. The descriptions of Syria were interesting, yet not too profuse. as were those of Boston and other American places.
My congratulations are duo Miss Gould for trenting the- laws and influence of the spirit realm in a delicate and guarded
wav. She wont just far enough and not loo lar. It is a brave author who will f>r*;id out a book in these days making prominent the awakening of the spiritual life, the recognition of the Divine Presence, and tho surrender to the Infinite. While it is just as real a fact of existence as birth, marriage, or death. it is
iccognizod in its rullnctis only by the experienced, Before this great fact other things of this life fall into insignificance, Tho book leaves the impression that our spirit influence for gojotL-must begin hero and now, and that it is not necessary to ; wait for a life after death in order that i the spirit of truth may breathe through
us. Almost every page has some inspiring or profound thought. I think 1 shall never rend the Gospel of John again without thinking that he “ leaned so near the great Heart that he heard its beating in sympathetic communion with the Father.” It gives a new and valuable interest to that Gospel, and I shall try to see more distinctly the “ Person behind the expressed thought." The following sentence, which I have read several times, holds my attention strongly, but I do not know why:	**	One of the profoundcst
things in life is that tho most precious possessions are bought with the price of
