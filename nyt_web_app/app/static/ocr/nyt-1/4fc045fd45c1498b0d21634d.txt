FETICHISM.
A Missionary’s Book About the Native Customs and Superstitions of
West Africa.*
iHEX Miss Kingsley was in West Africa slie became acquainted 'with the Rev, Robert Hamill Nassau’s studies on fetich ism, and expressed the belief that the publication of his observations j would be worth while. Hence this work ! on “ Fetichism. in West Africa.” One incident of the superstitions of the Africans must have made an impression on Miss Kingsley. She had been given shelter in a house in a Fang village. Goins into her room she was annoyed by a peculiar odor. There were some bags suspended from the "wall. Pulling down one, she found inside *' a human hand, three big toes, four ears, two eyes, and other portions of the human body." It was what the natives called a Taka or a numbatti. This ugly charm was considered a certain preventive against ill fortune. The fctich is a material thing, and its use Is so universal as to dominate ltiudi of negro native life and to form a large part of his religion, which we call fetichism- Fetich is an English word, an abbrevation from the Portuguese *' feitico," meaning “ made " or *■ artificial," and it was api plied to the charms and amulets worn in the Roman Catholic religion. It was applied by the Portuguese sailors of the eighteenth century to the deities they saw worshipped by the negroes of the West Coast of Africa, i Man's superstitions are the most dif-I ficult of mental processes to eliminate.
It is an axiom that *' civilization and religion do not necessarily move with equal pace." Only look backward to Egypt, or Greece, or Rome, and note their fine mental qualities, their wonderful art instincts, and <!ieir , religious beliefs. We | all ought to know that sacrifice and wor-I ship were in the past identical terms.
Hundred of acts and practices in tne life of Christian households in civilized lands pass muster before the bar of aesthetic propriety and society, and even of the Church: are not only harmless and allowable, but commendable and 'conducive to kindness, good will, and healthful social entertainment; but In the doing of these acts few ar^ aware of the fact that some of them in their origin .were heathenish and in their meaning: idolatrous, and that long ago they would have brought on the doer church censure.
The Christmas-festivities originated in a heathenish feast, and the mistletoe and holly used of old by the Druids served their special purpose when there were human sacrifices. For the* holly bush the African negro substitutes the pepper bush. That bush Keeps off the bad spirits. To the Christian neither tree nor holly has any definable religious significance, but to many an African they form part of his religion. The authors reflections on the lasting effects of fetichism and witchcraft on the native explain how difficult is tlie work of the missionary. He
writes that, being a. thief, a native may become an honest man; from a liar, truthful; from being indolent, industrious. He may be no longer Brutal or a polygamist, "and yet in his secret thought, while he would not wear a fetich, he believes in its power, and dreads its influ-j enee, if possibly it should be directed against himself. The number of objects which may be converted into fetiches are countless. The author saw once an old coffee pot which, was supposed to possess magical powers. The witches, male and female, are countless, and their power too terrible to be described, -They will bring about death whenever it pleases them. Belief in. lucky and unlucky days the natives do not monopolize. The cultured white man is often equally silly. It is not in Germany only that the werewolf exists. Onco Mr, Nassau saw some children and their mothers playing with them. He tried to count the little ones, when the mothers seemed frightened and hid their babies, telling him that it would bring the children bad luck and maybe make them “ die to count them. The spirits were around watching how they could do harm, and would have their attention called to the infants. ‘
Mr. Nassau declares that one of. the effects of witchcraft beliefs in Africa is the gradual depopulation of that continent. Taking the entire population of Africa, of all nationalities, to be 200,000,000, the negroes do not amount to more than 100,-
000,000. The slave trade certainly may be counted as one of the causes of depopulation* but that nefarious business has fallen off of late. The author says that the loss of human life in the so-called " Free States ** is enormous to-day.
But aside from all these and other civil and political causes, the fetich re--ligion of Africa has been a large part of , its destruction. It has been the Moloch whose hunger for victims was never satis-fled, as illustrated in the annual sacrl-fice of hundreds and thousands by the priests of the Kings of Dahomey and Ashanti and the burial victims at the

funerals of great Kings, as in Uganda and all over the continent. If the destruction of such human victims is not so great to-day as It was twenty years ago, due to the enlightenment by Christian missions and forceful prohibition by civilized Governments, the spirit and disposition is not eradicated; it is only suppressed. * * * Inbred beliefs, deepened hy millenniums of years oi practice, are not eliminated by even a century of foreign teaching:. Costume of body and fashion of dress are easily and voluntarily changed; not so the essence of one’s being.
The reason for this depopulation may be thus more particularly explained. The African has no idea of a natural death. He thinks that he ought to live on forever. If a man dies a natural death, it is supposed that his demise Is duo to witchcraft. Then one or more persons are ! accused of the crime and are made to ! suffer death. It can be understood how the circle of deaths »s always increasing.
