I have noticed some correspondence about tho “Boy’s Own Book." I had in my possession In England :l copy of this book in lSUT, and it was undoubtedly in print then. I Iiavc at present in my possession an American reprint of the samo book, published in 1SS1 by It. 'Worthington, 770 Broadway, New York, which is marked " Fifth edition, revised.'* This is a cheaply got up copy, and the type and paper aro poor, but in other respects, illustrations, ornaments, &c.. it seems to be an exact reproduction of the English cony tliat I had, with the exception that the articles on riding, driving, lawn tennis. rowing, and sailing (and possibly others) are omitted.
A small article on ** fiorr," which is also termed “ Bandy-Bull,” is in this 1SS1 top}-, and it describes the game ot‘ goir very much as we know il. the* golf links being referred to as *■ Goff-lengths " and the crooked club being rulied a “ bandy,” from its being bent. In tlie preface, after quoting from the Knglisli edition, the publishers say; “ So far the London Preface. Tho American publishers have omitted a few' articles, entirely useless on this side of the Atlantic, ;is the extra expense w'ould have debarred the most useful part from being in ihe hands of hundreds of youths who will find everything tfcnt wili amuse them in our present volume."
