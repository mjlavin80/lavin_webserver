JVYic York Times Hook AVrifir:
I-wonder if any of your readers have noticed the attack on John Ilaneoek's memory in “My Lady I^augbter.** a new novel by Dwight Tilton. This author evidently takes himself quite seriously in his attempt to r-ervert history, and makes Hancock out to he a coxcomb, a- usurer, and a silly and brainless exquisite. He accuses him of loaning: money at high interest and then forcing his debtors to the wall. He grants him not a single statesmanlike quality, and indirectTy charges that the eminence lie attained w:ts due to the helping hand of such men as Adams. Otis, nnd Warren. He devotes whole pages to descriptions of Hancock's luxurious dress, liis adornment of his " carefully cherished person.” and portrayals ol the vainglorious conceit with which he attributes him.
While it may not be necessary to take writer?: of historical novels seriously, I question whether it is wise to suffer to pass unchallenged statements that reflect upon the heroes of the Nation’s early history. U John Hancock was the brainless fop of *• My I^ady Laughter,” why has it remained for Dwight Tilton to find it out? Am I right or wrong in my belief that Hancock was a credit lo his city, his country, and himself?
