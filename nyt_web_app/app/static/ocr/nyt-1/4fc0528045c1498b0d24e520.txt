A reprint of Theodor Storm's little romance. *• Immonseor is appearing in an Knglish version by Bertlia M. Schinimel-fennig. (Thin llhno. Pp. 40. Nile green cloth, firilt lop, uncut edges. New Vork: Thomas Y. Crowell & Co. r»0 cents.) Tlie book contains a number of new half-tone illustrations and a preface by Helene Schlmmelfennig White, in the course of which she writes:
It is noi in his [Storm's] own love life,
*	* * but rather in the bitter disappointments he suffered through his ardent but unrequited devotion to his country's long unsuccessful cause th;jt we must seek the reason for that strain of gentle resignation, :is well as heartfelt sympathy with
unsatisfied love, that Is so marked u feature in a large group of his writings, notably tlie earlier ones, and of which ** Inimenxeo is typical. In them the old theme of "to have loved ana lost ' is sounded in many and touching variations, and, as our author’s method is preferably that of retrospection, we meet his heroes and heroines in the evening of life, when, from the standpoint of an achieved aim. which is seldom the one set in the first flush of youth, tho disappointments and passion of life appear . ^subdued and mellow light to the clarified vision of age.
She gives also in ttils preface a brief account of Storm’s life and of his work in prose and poetry.
