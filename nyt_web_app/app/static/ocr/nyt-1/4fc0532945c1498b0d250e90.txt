Mr. Aldrich's Poetic Drama and Mr. G. C. Lodge’s "Cain."*
T was a happy inspiration that moved Mr. Aldrich to build a drama upon his fine poem “ Judith/'. We arc the richer for. a truly poetic .drama, not quite so felicitous in imagery and expression as the earlier version, and without the swift dramatic movement of inevitable events that marks the perfectly successful play upon the theatrical side, but dignified and imaginative und with ihe author's unfailing Insight into 1 the passionate emotions of human nature. The . portions of the drama that are new show no decline of the power to evoke pictorial images and touch deep sources of feeling by which the early work of Mr. Aldrich was distinguished, and the final prayer of Judith for strength to perform her task is a flash of pure dramatic light across a somewhat dim stretch of eloquent but overelaborated narrative:
Thou that rulest all, Hold not Thy favor from me that I seek This night to be Thy Instrument: Dear Lord,
Look down on me, a widow of Judea,
A feeble tiling unless Thou sendeth strength!	'
A woman such as I slew Slsera.
The hand that pierced his temples with a nail
Was soft and gentle like to mine, a hand Molded to press a babe against her breast!
Thou didst sustain her. Oh, sustain Thou me,
That I may free Thy chosen from their chains!
Each sinew in my body turns to steel, My pulses quicken, I no longer fear!
My prayer has reached Him, sitting there on high!
The hour Is come X dreamed of! This for thee,
Oh, Israel, my people, this for thee!
Sudcrmann translated is rather less Sudermann than Shakespeare translated is Shakespeare, and his " Johannisfeuer/* . compounded of German sentiment, German passion, and German poetry, depending for its moving quality entirely upon tho sincerity of its accent, Is neither convincing nor interesting in Mr. Swickard's translation, which is nevertheless not bad as such translation goes. The theme is hopelessly vulgar, and the wealth of psychological wisdom and suggestion in the author’s treatment of it Is concealed under the undisciplined English of the translation.
Mr. Lodge's drama is a personal and passionate reading of the story of Cain and Abel, in which Cain is presented as a Biblical Prometheus daring the wrath of Heaven to bring light to the souls of men. He Is the archtype of the modern free thinker, while Abel is tho cowardly formalist, shrinking from independent thought and insensible to
The power of life, the grory of rebellion, The fire and love of liberty, the pride Ot freedom, poverty, solitude, and pain.
All the aelit;ht and all the tiagedy And all the burden of manhood
which are revealed to Cain iii one swift
moment of fierce insight. He kills Abel
that iho hitter may not have power over
later generations
To breed a sickness In humanity And bring pollution lo the springs of life through spiritual bondage. The mission of Cain is thenceforth to pass from liand to hand tho torch of free thought, and to boar for the sake of man the brand of an outlaw. The final passage of his farewell to Eve indicates the mood in which liis character is reconstructed for the modern reader, a mood widely removed from that of Genesis, but elevated and austere.
Farewell! My will ana mine alone Has.made me outcast from tlie laws of men,
And from God's laws, and from tho humcs of men.
I am the man I am; no causc but this Has east mo naked and lonely from the win
To wander, alien in tho Academe,
Cursed and derided in the market-place, Slandered and scourged before the shrines of God.
And when I shall lift up the immortal light
Like dawn in the dark places of men's souls.
All men shall hail it as a ruinous fire Horn lor their world’s destruction; they
.shall rise,
Nerved with ferocious fear, and hale 4 me forth.
Seize me. traduce me, judge me, and condemn.
And press tho hemlock to my unshrinking lips
Or nail my scourged flesh naked to the cross.
Yei shall tlio grf-nt light live?
„	,	It	shall	not die!
Farr well!
