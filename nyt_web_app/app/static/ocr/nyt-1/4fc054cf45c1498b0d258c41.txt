A>tc York Times Itook Itcvieic:
Seeing that much interest is shown in the earlier editions of *• The Boys' Own Book,'* I wish to say that I have a copy published by Crosby, Lockwood & Co., London, 1877, who in the preface state j that It was originally produced more than I a quarter of a century previous by them* und that if imitation be the highest form of compliment, as pronounced, the propri-; etors have ample reason for congratula~ tion; for it would be difficult to find any work that had so many imitators. More than 100 new engravings are added in this edition, 7-4 pages. Every article is thoroughly revised or entirely rewritten, with an appendix embodying tho bicycle, or two-wheeled velocipede; baseball, the American game; lacrosse, Canadian; lawn tennis, and badminton.
