FRIEND OF POETS.
>	Joseph Jacobs Reviews the New Bi-’ • ography of Theodore Watts-Dun-ton, by James Douglas.*
REVIEW this book with 'something of a pang. One of the last things I did before leaving England was an at* tempt to Induce my friend and colleague Mr. Watts-
*	<	.	.	Dunton to allow me to select
from his admirable and, In many ways,
.. epoch-making reviews tn The Athenaeum ; a volumq, which would give him his due 7 posltion<as the foremost constructive critic of the English-speaking world* Negotia-
-	tlons lingered. Mr. Watts-Dunton shuns
■	notoriety as much as other people court it.
■	Other projects summoned mo and the plan fell through. Here It Is carried into
. existence by another hand, and on some. what different lines than what I had contemplated. Mr. Douglas has regarded his ; hero as primarily poet and novelist. I had designed to exhibit him to the world solely as critic by as large a collection of his reviews as I could, cram Into a volume. Mr. Douglas has besides given in some sort a biography Interspersed with a few Bos we 111 sms, and above all has Included a number of illustrations which will recall to every one who has enjoyed the hospl-tality of the “ Pines,” Putney, the wealth ^ of poetic and pictorial association which will one day make it one of the most sought for literary shrines In England.
Mr. Douglas, as I have said, has rc-garded Mr. Watts-Dunton mainly as - a
Sigt and novelist, and I have no doubt r. Wutts-Dunton hlrasclf would prefer to be known mainly for his works of creative Imsglnatlon—who would not? But If one must shame the devil and say the
-	true verity, it is more as a critic than as
-	a poet and novelist that Mr. Watts-Dunton will be known in future ages, if. In* deed, he will net beet be known ns a higher and rarer thing tban any of these —what Rossetti called a hero in friendship." He nearly saved Rossetti from the demon chloral, and for a quarter of a century has been to Mr. Swinburne more than a brother. When one adds that Mr. Watts-Dunton has enjoyed the friendship of Tennyson, Morris, Browning, and Lowell, not to mention the smaller fry. it Is clear that his name is already inseparably linked with the history of poetry in England in the nineteenth century. Pie is emphatically the friend of great poets.
But it does not follow that a friend of great poets must necessarily be a great poet himself. No one. it is true, can deny Mr. Watts-Dunton the title of poet;-' Tn particular some of Ills sonnct-scquenccs vie with the best in Uie language, and he has almost equal command over rustic description. His “ Romany " poem, *' Make the ICas white the Kern says 4 make it * ” given here, brings the very whiff of the hay field, and is fully equal to Barn os at his beat. Mr. Watts-Dunton has most of the qualities of the great bards; he has vivid imagination, exquisite eensibility, a wide and accurate vocabulary. a sense of music rarely equaled, and has evidently experienced the very ccstacies of passion. Yet with all this it is going too far to run^c him, as Mr. Douglas does, with the great poets dt the Victorian era. lie is somewhat mannered; he is at times reminiscent, and above all he has rarely the individual note. There is scarcely a line of his of which one could say “ Watts-Dunton and Watts-Dunton alone had written thus and so." This volume contains a tolerably full anthology of his poems. There arc perhaps not more than four or flv" of them which one would insert in a golden treasury of Victorian poets. Let me not be misunderstood; no one for a moment wouUl deny the true poetic gifts of Mr. Watts-Dunton, but one has at the *<ame time a conviction that his mastery of poetic form is greater than his poeti? force, to use "a distinction - which ho would be one of the first to appreciate.
Similarly with tho som- what exaggerated claims put forth for Mr. \V;iUs-Dun-ton’s romance “ Aylwin " by Mr. Douglas, he again places ft on a level with the masterpieces of nineteenth century English novels. Ilere again no one can dtny the very high qualities of this romance, but equally, if one is to remain true to one's literary conscience, one has to recognize an incoherent plot, a want o action uf the characters, nnd on the characters, that bars it from a place among the highest. Yet that it has fallen in with a mood of the moment is undoubted. The solid fact of twenty-six editions in England is sufficient to prove its popularity. Mr. Watts-Dunton would however be the last to permit a claim of high merit to bo based on wide circulation. Was it not Mr. Howells who said, 14 Thank Jfeaven, I never circulate more than twenty thousand "? Its appeal to the spiritualistic interests, its challenge to identification of the characters, the romantic situations and scenery would of themselves account

for much of this wide circulation. But at best the novel will take rank by the side of " Contarini Fleming," tlie nearest analogue to It in the language, and few would claim for “ Contarini Fleming" a high rank In the realm of fiction.
But when It comes to Mr. Watts-Dunton tn his capacity as critic there la no need to make any such reservations as are called forth by his poetry and his novel. ‘Indeed the chief fear is that one is likely to indulge In expressions which migiit be regarded as exaggerated. But it may be sold without much fear of contradiction that his Is the greatest critical intelligence that has been devoted mainly to the investigation of the lawB of literary art In the English language. Others may have had the taste, the capacity for appreciation to as great a degree; others again may have had sufficient of the scientific bent to generalize about the laws of literary production; even Herbert Spencer lias his say on such matters. But the combination of exquisite tnsto and generalizing capacity Is found in Mr. Watts-Dunton. and in him atone. He reminds one Indeed of the late Prof. Fleem-Ing Jenkitr, os described by Robert Louis Stevenson. Whenever any person mentioned an Interesting fact to the professor he would immediately cry: "Surely, I have a theory to explain that,*' and sure enough within five minutes the theory was forthcoming. Mr. Watts-Dunton not alone observes literary phenomena with the keenest of observation, but he is never content to leave a literary fact alone until lie has brought It In harmony with other facts of the same-kind. When the scullion In "Tristram Shandy" hears that a fellow servant Is dead and remarks complacently. “ So am not I," Mr. Watts-Dunton Is not content to point out the immortal humor of the remark, but explains to us why and how it deserved im* mortality, by an ingenious distinction between absolute and relative humor.
He is exceptionally equipped for the post of scientific critic. He 1ms been trained in science by his father and uncle. He has passed through a period of what he himself calls ** music madness," and is acquainted with the technique of painting, und in addition to all this he is exceptionally widely read In imaginative literature. Above all, he loves literature with an undivided passion. Matthew Arnold, with whom one naturally thinks to compare him, was, after all, much of a theologian, something of a politician, even before he was a literary critic pure and simple. Walter Pater, tho other name with which one naturally associates Mr. Watts-Dunton’s. was even more Interested : in Greek sculpture and Renaissance art than in Charles I^imb or Coleridge. When one adds that Mr. Watts-Dunton lias seen In the working the operations of the minds of two of the greatest literary creative artists of the generation, one begins to understand why his literary criticisms bear tlie mint mark of true induct ions, as compared with the mere impressions of a Henley or a Symons. *
Yet Mr. Douglas in this book has chosen to represent Mr. Watts-Dunton aa critic by very few. and those for tlie most part badly selected, specimens. He gives at length that review of Christopher North's ** Nodes Ambrosianae," which first revealed to us the new force which had come to English letters. But excellent as tho review was in its exuberance, in its humor, in its style, the subject of it was scarcely worthy of Mr. Watts-Dunton’s powers, and does not, therefore, give adequate expression to them. So, too, Mr. Douglas quotes n good deal of a review of Browning’s " Fcrishtah's Fancies," just because it happened to throw light upon an interesting but rather trivial episode in the relations of Mr. Watts-Dunton and Browning, but the review itself happens he perhaps the worst Mr. Watts-Dunton ever wrote on Browning’s poetry. There remain only copious extracts from Mr. Watts-Dunton’s eloge of tho Bible in his review of the Marquis nf Lome's " Psalms." nnd from the article "Poetry" in tho K n cyclopedia BriLnnnica, which, fragmentary as it Is, is the only critical treatise on the subject in the language. None of his reviews of Mr. Swinburne, none of those on Victor Hugo—when' Mr. Watts-Dunton was absolutely at his best - has been reproduced in whole or in part by air. Dougins. 1 remember in particular an elaborate review or Mr. Swinburne’s " Note on Charlotte Bronte.*’ which gave a whole poetics of the novel.
Mr. Douglas has a defense for his sins nf omission. He claims for his horn that his host work in criticism is on a line with his poetry and his romance in expounding and advocating a new force in literature and even in religion. According to him. Mr. Watts-Duntou is pro-eminently distinguished as the Prophet of the Renascence of Wonder. • Yet when one carefully examines what is meant by this Renascence it is somewhat difficult to distinguish it from what other critics call the Romantic Spirit. If this be so. tho great originality of Mr. Watts-Dunton in this regard is somewhat les* sened. We have had Heine, we have had Sainte-Beuve, and wc have had Matthew Arnold on the romantic school and the romantic spirit, not to speak of more formal critics like George Brandes. Mr, Watts-Dunton’s distinction is, however, to have seen signs of the revival of this
spirit. Ordinarily when criLics speak of the romantic movement, they are thinking of the Schlegcls and Victor Hugo at the beginning of the nineteenth ^entury. They have not recognized that somewhat the same tendency has arisen anew iimons creative workers at the end of the century as well as at the beginning. Perhaps it would be more exact to say that the romantic spirit catfio Into England with the pre-Raphaelltcs, and spread from theii painting to their poetry.
Mr. Wntts-Dunton, as usual, Is not content merely to observe a literary phenomenon. He must give his theory of It as well. The romantic spirit is opposed to the classic, not alone by its breaking away from the older forms, but by the whole attitude of mind toward the world nnd life. The Spirit of Wonder is the name given to this new attitude, and the ^amc spirit works, according to Mr. Waus-Dunton and his disciple, Mr. Douglas, In religion ns well as In art. In other words, the agnosticism of science, which denies, is to be replaced by the agnosticism of art which desires. Other thinkers have observed the same phenomenon In the trend of modern thought^and called it "the wish to believe," or as Prof. James puts It, “ the i will to believe." Mr. Watts-Dunton re-1 gardsit ns the spirit of reverend wonder, of joyous awe.
All this is interesting In tlio extreme,
. but It would be hard to convince any one acquainted witii the currents of modern thought that Mr. Watts-Dunton’s views on these high matters are excessively novel or have had any wide influence. Mr. Douglas is, one might almost say, as usual, putting emphasis on tho wrong things in laying so much stress upon this
speculative activity of his hero, and this 'is all the more to be regretted as It has led him to confine Ills extracts from Mr. Watts-Dunton’s critical writings to those portions of them which bear upon what Mr. Douglas seems to consider the central doctrine of the Renasance of Won-i der. .
:	In a certain sense, indeed, one must
i own that Mr. Doughts is justified in cori-j siderinfy- this the central aspect of Mr.
I Watts-Dunton’s teaching as a critic, but i that Is merely lo say that he represents , both in poetry and In criticism the pre-! Raphael!tc school. His treatise on poetry i in the Encyclopedia Britannlea might be | described almost as tlie jMiotics of pre-! Raphaelism. He puts into conscir/us i laws and generalizations the underlying principles of the poetry of Rossetti and ! Swinburne, tiie two most original poetic forces in* late Victorian literature. Hence, his in sis ten co- upon tlie intimate relation of form and force jn pnotlc composition. I remember liow we used to be bored by Mr. Wutts-Duntons insistence upon tho lessons to be derived from the Italian folk poesy, the Kispctti and Stornelli, of tho Sicilian—or was it the Apulian?—peasants. But Mr. Watts-Dunton was in tne right in insisting upon the vital relation of metre with the lyrical passion to which it gives expression. Indeed, his analysis of metrical effects in his various criticisms lias been among bis most original and valuable contributions to general criticism. It is undoubtedly tlio pre-Raphaelite poets who have nf recent years tried most experiments in metrical facts on English poetry, and it was doubtless in watching their procedure that Mr. Watts-Dunton was enaoled to bring his generalizing mind to bear upon the laws of verse.
Even in his philosophic views Mr. Watts-Dunton may be regarded as a product of the prc-Raphaelitc school. Ono of the most Interesting passages quoted from him in this book by Mr. Douglas is tho contrast he draws between work and sport, and his arguments against the modern heresy of work as a duty. His paradox at first sight seems original, but after all, it is but William Morris's contention that every work of art is produced with a grin of conscious delight in the skill, and that without that delight life Is not worth living. Of course, it might be contended that Morris learned this as much from Mr. Watts-Dunton as the latter from the decorative artist, but as William Morris told me himself—and indeed ho made no secret aiiout it—this view of his came straight from the chapter on the nature of Gothic in Kuskin’s " Stones of Venice," so that the doctrine is one of the school and cannot be claimed by any one man. it is not the worse, or the less true for that, but .Mr. Douglas was ill-advisoil in la.vyig claim to the doctrine for Mr. Watts-Dunton.
Altogether, it will be seen that this book of Mr. Douglas does less than Justice to the great position of Mr. Watts-Dunton In contemporary l-higlish letters. He lays stress upon the wrong thing, praises his hero for his lesser qualities, reproduces too little of his criticism, and too much of his poetry. Mr. Douglas even fills out-dare one say, pads out?— his pages with whole sections from "Aylwin," which is not what ono could call an altogether inaccessible book. I dare say I am to some extent personally influenced by the feeling of a workman who sees a task that ho had hoped to do himself bungled by another, but really 1 cannot think this a good piece of work, even apart from that somewhat narrow standpoint. Let this, however, be said
for Mr. Douglas’s book. Whoever wrttits to~know Mr. Wntts-Dunton In his capacity as poet and novelist will find his merits more than sufficiently exemplified nnd Insisted upon In Mr. Douglas's book. There still remains, however, the greater task of displaying Mr. Watts-Dunton to the world as the greatest of English critics, and that will not need so many ornamental epllhets as Mr. Douglas has lavished on Mr. Watts-Dunton. There is a story of a merchant who after receiving for three weeks elaborate explanations from lila drummer as to why he had just escaped receiving very large orders, wrote to him curtly and said:	"Mr.	X,
we do not want explanations; we want orders.” One might paraphrase this with regard to this book and say: "Mr. Douglas, wc did not want explanations, wc did not want gush, wc wanted the criticisms."
