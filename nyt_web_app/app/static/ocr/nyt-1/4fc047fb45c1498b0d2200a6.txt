As in liis book on " Roman Society in the Last Century of tho Western Empire,” Pvoti Samuel Dill, la Ills new volume, ** Roman Society from Nero to Marcus Aurelius," which the Macmillan Company is about to publish, deals principally with the inner moral life of the time, and gives very little space to its external history and the machinery of government, lie treats at some length of the relation of tho Senate to the Emperor in the first century, and the organization of the I municipal towns. He alao gives a com! plete survey of the literature and in; seriptions of tho period. Prof* I>111 has provided explanatory und reference notes at the bottom of each page, and a comprehensive index. In tlie opening chapter he says of the period of which he treats: Tho period of social history whu-h we nre about to study Is profoundly interest-i»K hi many ways, but not least in the
many contrasts between its opening and its etose. It opens with tho tyranny of one f>T the worst men who over occupied :t throne; it t'uds with the mild rule of a Stoic saint. It begins in massaiTi* and the carnage of civil strife; it closes in tin;

The contrast of character Ij« — ..twi-cii Hit? u\o Princes is generally sup-po;;,*d to find a correspondence in the .i.oral character and idenls of th<> men wlumi they ruled. Th« aeet-ssion of \ Vi‘sp:isiitn, which, alter a deadly strnswh-. seemed to bring the orgies of a brutal despotism to it. close, is regarded as marking not only a potitical, but a moral, revolution. H was the dawn of an age of repentance nnd amendment, of beneficent administration, of a great moral reviv:il.
