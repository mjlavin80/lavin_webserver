Profs. Charles Mills Gayley and Clement C. Young, in their volume on "Tlie Principles and Progress of English Poetry, with Representative Masterpieces and Notes,” fl2mo, pp. cxi. and	Green
cloth. New Tork: The Macmillan Company, $1.10,) have attempted to show through extracts and by a scientific study of rhythm, melody, and movement as well as by historical analysis, how English poetry has developed and how it has been touched by external and Internal influences since tho days of Chaucer down to those of Tennyson. Each chapter has a separato introduction descriptive of the school to which the poems included in it are supposed to belong. There are also biographical data arranged in chronological order concerning the poets mentioned and many pages of notes on comparative word usage and a comprehensive description of the circumstances In which the poems were written.
The introduction, on "The Principles of Poetry,” alms to answer the questions that arise when poetry is the subject of discussion, and to give the questioner *' a grasp upon the essentials necessary to appreciation and to the formation of an Independent judgment.’* Prof. Gayley discusses the relation of art to nature, and of literature to art; of poetry to literature, and of verse and prose to poetry; of the creative or Imaginative expression in poetry proper, and of its association with rhetoric and logic; of rhythm and metre, melody, harmony, and structural form in verse, and the relation of all these to the organic principles of speech, etc. The chapters on the " Progress of Eng- j lish Poetry ” aim to focus in one study 1 the theory, history, and practice of the art. Besides an exhaustive index there is a table of the English rulers and the poets of their time.
