Herculaneum.
Kao York Times Booh Review:
"Whatever value may attach to tho poetry of Sappho or tho last tragedies ot Aeschylus, there are missing1 works which arc not mere lacunae, but veritable abysses. Take, for example, the subject of cartography. In B. C. 1324, or within a decade or two of that date, a plan of a gold mine, with two wells, travelers* | houses, miners’ houses, and the treasury, was drawn and painted. It was one ot the papyri in the Turin Museum, and has been reproduced in fac simile. But until the eleventh century of the Christian era is reached there is no map to be found, except as the mediaeval atlases more or less faithfully reproduce those of Claudius Ptolemacus. On only one of these, printed in Rome, 1490, and reproduced by Nor-dynlcsjold, ia there that tiny addition of two lines, half an inch long, to which the whole Raigan-Moeris project owes its existence, Its financial and economical value, according to the Proceedings ot the Kh6dlvial Geographical Society Jan,
10,	ltHV4, Is something over $300,000,000.
There are two geographical papyri, Nos,
I and 2, of Boulag, which it was my good fortune to complete by the discovery of a fragment in an English country house. It briefly indicates that the papyrus refers to four canals leading to Howara; but this is sufficient to suggest four " rivers '* that led to a certain Paradise, of which the present Fayoum is the best extant example. Some student, about the time of the destruction of Herculaneum, attached numbers to the sections, one of which is now conceded to represent the figure of Joseph (son of Jacob) standing waist deep in that great lateral channel of the Nile, whose agricultural value is over $10,000,000 a year. There is a plct-, ure representing the barrage of a Ramcs-i side period; and the Egyptian Ministry of | Public Works expended, two years ago, $3,000,000 on a new barrage intake for this ancient work. What would not be ! the value of the Greek transliteration of this document, with the explanatory text, by some (Greek) Vitruvius? Are the two maidens whose boats are being guided toward Joseph tho “ banoth " (daughters, not branches,) of Genesis xlix.?
One day in the Fayoum a peasant brought me a tin cigarette box with a score of fragments. The majority of them appeared to be something that resembled Sassanlde Fehlevi, but I shall never forget the disgust expressed on the face of Sir Maunde Thompson when, after patient consideration, he denounced them as meaningless scratches. They are, I think, unintelligible scribblings, charms used 2,000 years ago in dovecotes. Fancy, however. my feelings at seeing a fragment in uncial Greek as large and as beautiful a script-as any Codex.
Alas, it proved to be only a few lines from the oration of Demosthenes against Jfeldas. It was reproduced in the Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology. for Its palaeogTopliical value. Suppose that it were known that a copy of Manettlo, or Alexander Polyhistor, was buried in Herculaneum; or on engineering work of the time of Petronius, describing how when the Nile rose but eight cubits no famine followed.** (Strabo!) Who could doubt that it ought to be recovered at any cost? The uncial edition de luxe of Demosthenes was, evidently, part of the library of a man of letters.
It did not belong to the class of manuscripts, religious or scientific, used professionally.
Therefore, in view of the number of missing volumes of a serious character, there cannot be a doubt that any other library found on the Bay of Naples would deserve the terms used by L. W. C. in his article in The New York Times Book Review. If any one else has ever read the Oratio Aegyptiacti of Aelius Aristides,
In which he says that he visited Egypt four times, went up the Nile as far as Ethiopia, left nothing unexamined, (Page i &U.) whether “ Pyramids or Labyrinth.
Temple, [sic] or Canals," having pro-I vided himself “ with all the books in •which there were measurements,*’ there must have been, as In my case, keen disappointment that no Coptic manuscript contains a map; and the Fayoum papyri , have never yielded a specimen of the J Greek guide books of the second and ■ third centuries. Portontoslssimum hu-| mani impendli Opus,’* wrote Pliny of the Labyrinth. Its c*xistence was denied before ls&i: and not u vestige of its walls and corridors has been identified in situ or elsewhere. How were the Tombs of the Kings lighted for the use of the sculptors and painters, if not by an incandescent light? Ali these and more are rewards for a practical age; and if the archaeologists find the chemical formula for hardening copper they can make their own terms with Birmingham and Pittsburg.
