If they've any more in good, old London town like “ The Duchess of Dantzig,” Jet's have them over here “ good and &uick,*' and if the free list 011 musical comedy isn’t free enough already, let’s oq.il *a special session of Congress and revise the tariff, if need be, to encourage importation. This newest musical show,
although it has crossed the briny, hasn t the least suggestion of salt about it. It is the freshest thing that has come along in many a day, and that, too, despite the fact that it is built up and about and in and around our old familiar “ Sans Gene,”
which cannot by any account he considered the newest of the new. But Henry Hamilton, who wrote the book and lyrics, and Ivan Cary 11, who contributed the music, have succeeded in making
the old Sardou play as epic and span and j clean as a bit of linen from Catherine j Upscher's own wash-tub.
" It is a peculiar biend, this musical play, which, after a prolonged success at the Lyric in London, met with the warmest ot welcomes at Daly s last night, it is sat down as a romantic light opera, out there are moments where the story has been followed so closely, and where the lyrics have bo*.'ii so admirably composed, that it is carried a full lift higher than that. At times it takes hold of one's sympathies so strongly that it is like real
drama, and in a notable trio or two there is a s uggestion 01 vury-near-giand-opeii.t. And in its stronger phases it is aided, very considerably by several people, who, * besides being able to sing, are capable ot bringing a degree of sincciity to bear ill
Their actincr.
The new 'Sans Gene is Evie Greene, who talks with a sort of brogue—Lancashire dialect, they eall it who know—but though that's a speech one may .rea-, scnably assume th»_* Rue Koyale didn t, know, it do(.*»n t detract irom tiie lady a bit. It's France's l*iss. not ours, for we' rather like it. ^Uss Greene is a young worn:! 11 of charming personality, with abundant verve and go and a fetching plqaam sai’eim-^s that inakes her Catherine an i-wrlasting delight.
In addition to a v«-rv decided gift for huir.:;r. she able to approach an occasional sit nation demanding sentiment and it cling wiih moiv than ordinary success. This was especially noticeable in a scene ii. th*.- fir-<a ;ut whert; she rescues the Yicomie de Bethune from pursuing Communists and is charged with disloyalty bv her sweetheart, Lefobvre. Her voice is" a rich, clear, well cultivated soprano, and she phrases delightfully. Occasionally her speech, in moments of sudden pique, suggests Lulu Glaser, the resemblance between the two women in this respect being marked.
. The singing honors, next to her, fall to Lawrence Rea, who contnuutes several numbers in a mellow baritone of broad and expressive range, Adrienne Augarde. an extremely dainty little woman, also hag a pleasing voice and a personality that wTill probably make her a 1a-vorite with our audiences, and Courtice Pounds, in the part of a bumptious, selfsatisfied court milliner, provides a capital bit of low comedy. Nothing funnier in its 1 way has been seen for some time than the scene in which he offers to teach Catherine court etiquette.
Holbrook Blinn’s Napoleon is conspicuously successful, the actor giving a thoughtful and consistent performance of the role, and one in which an excellent make-up is supplemented by characterization of a very' high order. Lempriere Pringle is less successful as Lefebvre, but the minor parts are generally well played, and the chorus, though not as beautiful as those we are familiar with in this city of show girls, makes up for that deficiency in the desirable quality of voice.
2tlr. Caryll’s music is exceptionally good for musical comedy, the concerted numbers bring especially pleasing. Indeed, the song hits were so numerous as to practically include the whole libretto. The piece is charmingly staged, and it bids fair to be one of the biggest musical successes in years. Mr. Edwardes, the producer, responded briefly speech.
