| Beginning directly with words and sen: tences, and skipping: the intricacies of the alphabet entirely, Florence Bas*« "First Reader" for first-year elates follows the very latest pedagogic theories. The first few lessons are in script as well as In print, with illustrations in colors. Words which pupils are not able to recall from previous work arc fir«t taught as wholes, either from association with objects, pictures, or actions, or from the sentences In which they are used. The teacher Is supposed to give the children ** phonic drill " separate from the reading lesson, with the idea that they will soon learn a sufficient number of sounds to enable them to
find out some of the new words for themselves. Only eighty words in the entire book need be learned as wholes The first twelve lessons take up the study of several familiar animals, their color, what they can do, &e. Many plavs and talks of children are introduced, with a liberal use of kodak pictures instead of fanciful engravings. The author says there are only four new words to the page, yet at the end of the course the First Reader child should recognlzc* pa'ulv over a thousand words. (Boston: u. t\ Heath.)
