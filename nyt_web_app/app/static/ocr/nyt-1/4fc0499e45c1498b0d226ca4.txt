This is a novel of Russia, and has the marks of its kind. That is, to an English speaking-, American thinking1 reader much of it seems futile and much else of it dull. Similarly all of it seems to lack that sense of humor -which is nothing more or less than a sense of proportion. The story is of a young girl, an Englishwoman, who came to he governess in the family of a Russian nobleman of the old style. The nobleman is a species of madman who dwells mostly alone in his special tower and surrounds himself with a collection of all the latest makes\of American phonographs and mechanical musical devices. He likes to have half a dozen of these going at once, and, taking kindly to the little Englishwoman, who is pretty and saucy, has her up to listen to the concert. There are two other gov, ernesses, a “ Mademoiselle ” and a i " Fraulein.” The Mademoiselle presently runs away with a handsome young Russian Lothario, the Fraulein is very plain and, by reason of that, subdued. Another i occupant of the house is a queer old dame i who has a horror of touching anything or
■	any person which (or who; may at any time have touched a dog. Moreover the i mad nobleman has a wife as mad as him-i self in a different way and she beats one 1 of her daughtc-rs black and blue. The throe dukes of the title are not really dukes, merely the suitors of the three heroines, but one of the young men is a Duchess's son. It is this last who woos j and wins tlie English governess and caps the climax of the story by rescuing the mad noblvmun from his tenants, who are
about to put an end to his eccentricities and to his lilV at the same time. One of the eccentricities was to refuse to rent his land to cultivators, who for lack of it—and it Ivin# idle— were likely to starve. There is a very tragical ending to the affair of Mademoiselle and the Lothario, and for the rest the plot is somewhat befogged. Tlie fact is. the whole is so remote from the familiar as to render deslfable a great manv explanations (to say nothing of translations of Russian terms) which the author has not seen fit to provide.
