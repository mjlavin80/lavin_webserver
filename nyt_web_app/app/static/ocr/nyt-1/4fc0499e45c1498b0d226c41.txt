i I'rof. Sparks recently imule .m;iih- pretty ] sharp liui. mi Hie whole, just. criticisms ; of our avprjij,'*' school histories. " Tho j .outrageous way in which American his-» tnry is taught in the public schools to: day is enough to destroy the benefits of
*	Tlie Hague Tribunal and *11 of the peace | conferences of the world.” The i*,:slories ' of America teach nothin.? but " war, war,
! war!.......Hie real patriot,*’ he said, ** is
*	tli« man who in ltm**s of pone*1 dedicates
j himself to fulfilling the duties of citlzen-' ship, ffolnpr to the polls ai:*3 votins’ *is his t conscience tells him to; who works for the good of the Nation; who rears his , children to be good citizens; who places 1 in his heart God first and his country | next.”
| Prof. Sparks's work is a rather agreo-| able reaction from that bellicosity which 1 has been bo much in vogue with writers of popular histories. The youthful braggadocio which hurried tho country iuto a second war with Great Britain.the war cry of the Young Republicans, "On to Canada.’* and the party slogan of 18W,
” Fifty-four Forty or Fight," are good examples of the sort of thing many historians have regarded as intensely patriotic. Prof. Sparks remarks that the "hluft and bluster policy which Europe is prone to ascribe to American diplomacy is not without historic foundation.” Yet we cannot help thinking that Prof. Sparks pays too little attention to military affairs. It Is carrying a principle too far to devote only about twenty pages in a work of nearly eight hundred to the civil war. It is goinff too far even when the
tiuthar says:	* * 11 will bo necessary to
omit many details commonly found in a history of the United States for the sake of considering only those centralizing or decentralizing factors which have aided or hindered the unification of the States.”
The main object of the book is to trace the constitutional evolution of a federal nation from a loose confederation. Prof. Sparks pays a eood deal of attention to our Government under the Articles of Confederation, to the period to which FlsKe drew popular attention for the first time.
It is possible that Prof, Sparks’s remark that ** to the larger number of the American people tho statement that we have lived since our independence under a national form of government other than the Constitution is a matter of surprise,*’ is warranted. At any rate, tho subject of* the confederation deserves the somewhat -• extensive treatment accorded to it for the losKttti.s which it taught.
The revolutionary character of the movement of 1787 and 1788 is clearly and correctly pointed out. “It was a true revolutionary movement, a turn in? upside down, in comparison with which the Revolution of 1770 becomes a revolt against the Kins.” The question of State Sovereignty vs. Nationality was fought out as truly, though not as decisively, in the ratifying conventions of 17S8 as in the civil war. The States, however, retained, as Prof. Sparks shows, a very consid-enible degree of supremacy. His words describe the actual historical situation, leaving aside metaphysical speculations as to the nature of the Union:	“	What-
ever destiny may have made of the later Union, whatever theories may now be Indulged in concerning the abstract Union the fathers made tn 178!>. the concrete Union which was put into effect was the offspring of the States, not only in' tlie thoughts of the people, but it was even dependent upon them for aid in several
particulars n«?ceBS«ry for putting it into
operation." The adoption of tlie Constitution. then, marked a revolution in that It overthrew the old Government, but it did < not give us the Union as we now know it.
Tlie transfer of power from the Federalist to the Republican Party and the transformation of the latter from a party Of strict construction to a party of liberal construction are suggestively treated.
The second volume begins with the popular revolt which swept Jackson into power, and concludes with a chapter on the ” Present Aspects of tlie Republic.” The so-called middle period of our history is adequately given from the constitutional standpoint: the United States Bank, internal improvements, the tariff, and slavery, were the great topics of this period of our history.
The constitutional aspects of the civil war and reconstruction are fully discussed. . The subject of reconstruction has only recently received much critical attention. It is coming to be a historical rather than a contemporaneous subject of inquiry, and Is so treated by Prof. Sparks.
As is the cose with other volumes In the Story of the Nation Series, the present work is not accompanied with a bibliography * ,
