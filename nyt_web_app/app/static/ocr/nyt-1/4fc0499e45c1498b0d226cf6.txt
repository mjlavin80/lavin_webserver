ETURNING to the record of progress In the art of bookbinding in this country in 1WW, some account of the various exhibitions ot the ^ Autumn season is required. Sept. li>, Mr. Ferdinand i Ktister gave an exhibition of fine book- | bindings executed by liim at his bindery, j io East Houston Street, New York City. Ten volumes were on view, all of which were executed in full green levant morocco, crushed and highly polished. Tho gold tooling by Mr* Xus ter was from original designs, and constituted the most elaborate work that he has ever a*tempted. One volume introduced some vary satisfactory inlaying. The books were bound to the order of John Gerard Kecksher. The volumes were with but a single exception upon fishing themes.

Minn., was held, with samples of bookbinding executed by Elizabeth Griscom Marot of Philadelphia, Ellen Gates Starr of Chicago, Peter Vcrburg of Troy, N. H.; Mrs. F. B.

'j'he gathering of books shown ay the Scribners this year was made in Europe by the firm's European representative nnd was particularly choice. The collection contained a number of books printed on vellum,
among which was the llomce, p-inled in
17!):i by Didot for Marshal Junot (Napoleon’s famous General.) which was sold afu-r his death in London in lSlft for £140. This magnificent b?ok contained twelve beautiful plates by Percier. Tlie
binding was in full brown crushed levant morocco. with gilt top. It T*'as one of
only two copies printed on vellum. A copy nf Lucain in two volumes, printed at Paris in 1770 end bound in mottled calf, was originally in the library of David Garrick, as indicated by Garrick’s
book-plate, which it contained. A magnificent <•< ■ of Oeuvres de Franz Edmund \\Y ter, P-intre Allemand, Paris, 177.%. bound in red morocco with gilt edges by Derome, with his ticket, ami probably tin* choicest copy extant of
this beautiful book, the majority of the plates being brilliant proofs, once belonged to llarie Antoinette and contains her beautiful ex-libris (when Dauphine.) designed and engraved by Eisen. 3omo of the oilier books shown were formerly owned by Louis XV. and Lord Cornwallis. Another notable book in the Scribner exhibition was an *' Imitation of Christ '* G02K> in black letter. It was a fine example of monastic binding by Buschmann of Antwerp, with silver cl as pH. etc.
In connection with the books mentioned, the Scribners bad on view a rieli and very unusual CDdection of original manuscripts. autograph letters, and rare documents of a literary, political, and sicial character. These included many autographs and portraits of the Bonaparte family, fifty-one letters of Charlotte Bronte, fifteen letters of Edmund Burke and a holograph draft of his will, many Dickens letters, a lot of Garrick correspondence, nineteen letters of Dr. Edward Jenner, the discoverer of vaccination; sixty-two letters of the Marquis de I-ai-fayette, six letters of Charles Lamb, some letters of Lord Nelson, others written by William Pitt, Pope Pius IX., many of the Prime Ministers of England. Dante Gabriel Rossetti. William Blake, the rulers of France, ('ommenning vdth Lot is XI. and ending with Emile Loubet; John Rus-kin. Voltaire, the Duke of Wellington, and thirty-two autograph letters, poems, and esssays by Dean Swift. These items wore mostly unpublished and constituted an absolutely unique collection of great importance.
Nov. :iS-Dec. a.—The Bonaventure exhibition included eighteenth-century almanacs and souvenir cases, many finely embroidered; jewelry and lace coffrets. writing portfolios, silver bindings, eight-esnth-century illustrated books, and rich modern bindings. Possibly the most interesting number of the Bonaventure exhibition last year was a manuscript by Nicholas Jerry. This consisted of a short list of the navy of Louis XIV. and bore the date 1GSI. It contained sixty leaves of vellum. On one of these leaves was
painted a miniature wherein wore represented Neptune nnd certain water nymphs bringing gifts to Louis XIV. The frontispiece of this manuscript consisted of tho King's cipher, painted on a vellum sheet. The volume was bound by Cap6 In full red levant moroco, with silver-gilt ’ clasps. The double was In blue levant morocco, sprinkled with the King’s cipher, tooled In gold. This cipher was likewise in In Id. in blue and green, on the book's cover, with gokl-todled outlines, Bonu-vcnture showed a number of books in miniature. One oF these, dated 1702, wnich measured two Inches square, contained a story of a bad boy who, under tlie influence of a violent fit of anger, threw’ down his lute and broke it Into fragments. In some way and somehow it was repaired, and then it was found that its tone had increased in sweetness. Whether this was Intended to encourago children to smash their lutes is not so clear, but the story is interesting now, as It must have been In 17IK!. A little almanac was the smallest offering In the exhibition. It measured less than one inch square. Within Its pages were contained songs and music current durng 1815, the year «f publication. Some of the bindings lavished upon these miniature volumes were very elaborate. Leather, velvet, mother-of-pearl, mica, and ivory were all used as binding materials.
Sjtuo bindings of Vale Press booka by Margaret La hey of Brooklyn showed excellent results obtained by this young woman, both in forwarding and finishing. Her parallel line tooling in gold, always 1 a difficult binding achievement, merits much approval. The only other American binder whose work was included this year was Stiketnan, who scut .**01110 characteristic work. Other items that deserve al least a passing mention were certain rontemporanenus silver bindings of tlie fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Tortoise shell was dragged in as a binding material by soim* of tho early German ;:.id French binders, and Mr. Honaven-tnre was fortunate in Inning been able lo pick tip examples of this for his exhibition. Sollie of the embroidered bindings j were perfectly preserved and looked as they might have been executed but a ! few weeks ago. Around other:* clustered
a wealth nf historical association. Dec.

its third annual exhibition, including
bookbindings as one department. Among
the exhibitors were Miss Elizabeth Griscom Mnrot, Miss Kllen Gates Stnrr, and
Peter Wrbtirg. Pee. 7-k Ye Hamlieraft-ers of Ilmoklyn, Jew York, gave lh«Jir first annual exhibition at the Packer iiouse. Miss Elizabeth Goodwin Chapin, who lias considerable local reputation as
a bookbinder and ;is jl lecturer upon 11 er
art, showed a small ease of hand-bound books as recently executed by h**r. Mnnv oi them were loaned by their present owners for exhibition purposes. Miss Chapin's exhibit was rendered especially interesting by her display of tools and otlPT materials which ontei* into the bookbinding (‘raft, as well as by her showing of a number of books in various stages of the process of binding.
