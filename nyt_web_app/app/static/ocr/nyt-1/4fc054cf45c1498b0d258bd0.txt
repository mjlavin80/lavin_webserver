Two now volumes will shortly appear In the American scries of the English Men of Letters, published by tho Macmillan Company. Tlioso aro "William Culleii Bryant," by William Aspemvall Bradley,* and “ William Hickling Prescott,” by Prof. Harry Thurston Peek of Columbia University.
Besides the account of tho life anif friendship of Prescott, Prof. Peck’s book contains an estimate of him as an historian in tho light of modern research. Evidence is set forth to show how far Prescott is to be accepted as an accurate historian. An appreciation of him is alsS given, in which ho is compared with his contemporaries, Bancroft, Hildreth, Irving1, and Motley.
Mr. Bradley lays special emphasis in his biography of Bryant upon the national element in the poet of Puritanism and American nature and landscape. But he shows that this did not influence Bryant in carrying out the traditions of English ; verse. While he deals particularly with | Bryant as the poet and man of letters, Mr. Bradley touches upon his qualities as a man of affairs and his participation in the politics of the time; and as the beloved citizen and foremost figure at the civic celebrations of New York City.
