I A list of a thousand of the best novels, compiled by the Newark (N. J.) Free Public Library, of which I Mr. John Cotton Dana is the alert librarian, is doubtless a pamphlet which many voracious readers of books will like to possess. Doubtless, also, Mr. Dana will be glad to distribute copies of it to persons who feel the need of it and will communicate to him their need. The list, which is classified, begins with works of so diverse quality and character as C. C. Abbott*s “ Colonial Wooing,” Edmond About’s *' Man with tlie Broken Ear,” and George Ade's “Artie,” and concludes with titles of books by Zangwill and Zola. The intermediate titles are all that one might reasonably expect, including, of course, a somewhat arbitrary selection of the novels of Scott, Dickens, Thackeray, George Eliot, Meredith, Hardy, Balzac, and Dumas. Lists are appended of children’s books, books of folk-lore, myths and fairy tales, and books of humor. Mr. Dana contributes an interesting introduction. The lists were made up in pursuance of a theory and on a scientific plan, which is surely just as good as any other plan for compiling such a list. The pamphlet is useful, giving the name of a publisher and a price for each book, and we shall keep it by us for reference*
