In the preface to his new book, " The Clansman,.’' which Doubleday, Page & Co. publish to-day, Thomas ,Dixon, Jr., sets forth the motive of all his Southern books. He writes:
“ The Clansman is the second book of a series of historical novels planned on the race conflict. " The Leopard’s Spots ” was the statement in historical outline of the condition- of the negro from the enfranchisement to the disenfranchisement. ** The Clansman *' develops the true story of the Ku KIux Klan which overturned the revolution regime. I have sought to preserve in this romance both the letter and the spirit of this remarkable period. The men who enact the drama of fierce revenge into wtiich I have woven a double love story are^ historical figures. I have merely changed their names without taking a, liberty with any essential historic fact. In the darkest hour of the life of the South, when her wounded people* lay helpless amid rags and ashes under the beak and talon of the vulture, suddenly from the xnist of the mountains appeared a white cloud the size of a man’s hand. It grew until its mantle of mystery enfolded the stricken earth and sky. An “ Invisible Empire” had risen from the field of Death and challenged the Visible to morV tal combat. How the young South, led by the-reincarnated soul of V the Clansman of .Old Scotland, went forth under this cover * and. against overwhelming odds, flaring exile.
