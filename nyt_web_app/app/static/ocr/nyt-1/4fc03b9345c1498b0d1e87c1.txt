The rather extraordinary volumo before us occupies itself with a medley of charlatans and charlatanism in the sixteenth century and with the most splendid patron of such matters. Rudolph II., King of Bohemia and Hungary and Emperor of Germany. This eccentric monarch, a contemporary of Queen Elizabeth of England. neglecting affairs of state, held a court of learned men, doctors, knaves, and mountebanKs at his castle of the Hradschin in Prague, where also he gathered many art treasures and an equal
number of worthless curios, and kept a stable of the finest horses. Not the least learned of his attending mountebanks was the famous Dr. Dee, an Englishman skilled In sundry scientific matters, a scholar and an alchemist. Queen Elizabeth had patronized him, and when his career at Prague was closed and he returned to his native land she conferred i upon him the wardenship o£ Manchester t College, possessed of the emoluments of | which post he died et the age of elghty-one years. Dee practiced crystal-gazing with a clever rascal named Kelley as assistant, and professed to be able to trans-i mute quicksilver into gold. The two made a great figure at Rudolph’s Court, did (to alt appearances) make gold out of quicksilver, and got much money and honor. After Dee’s departure Kelley grew still j more in favor, and was made " Golden Knight/* but finally was cast into prison, and after torture died there.
The author tells about the alchemist’s tricks with relish, pictures the magnificence of Rudolph, and quotes quaintly from English and German poets. Tycho Brahe was another one of Rudolph's proteges after the death of his earlier patron, Frederick II. of Denmark and Norway. For the astronomer dabbled in alchemy, too. At Rudolph's castle of Benatek, put at his service, he had an observatory and a laboratory, where Kepler was his pupil. Mr. Bolton has curious chapters on Rudolph’s physicians (all of whom dealt, more or less, in the occult,) and quotes formulas for many wonderful elixirs invented by them. He has another chapter on the secret symbols of one Johann Bruckner of Kontgs-berg, who called himself Pontanus, and had an elaborate recipe for the philosopher’s stone. Altogether the book contains a deal of queer information, about queer people and things of a time (In some ways) more credulous than ours. Readers with a taste for the out-of-the. way, for historical junk in short, will find much to entertain them.
