Aric Yui l' TiinCK'Tiwtb Itcvietr:
In your issue of Saturday, Jan. 7. you quote the following paragraph from Mr. S. L. Clemens's article in tlio January North American Review:
Tho profits on Tncle Tom's Cabin’ continiu- to-day, but the publishers get them. Mrs. Stowe's share ceased seven years before she died. Her daughters receive nothing from the hook. Years ago they found themselves no longer able to live in the modest homo and had to move out and find humbler quarters,
T^est th** readers of Mr. Clemens's article should draw a wrong Inference from the above statement, it is only fair to ourselves, as tlie authorized publishers of all of Mrs. Stowe’s writings, lo say that while the copyright on *’ Uncle Tom’s Cabin ** expired three (not kg von) years before Mrs. Stowe's death, lhis caused 110 termination of our payments of royalty to her on the sales of all our editions of that book. Naturally tlie cheap reprints with which the market was flooded the moment the copyright expired affected very materially the sales of the authorized editions, so that Mrs. Stowe's income was very greatly reduced’at a time when she most needed it; a fact which we have often cited as an illustration ol* the great injustice of the copyright term not being extended to cover the life of the author. Mrs. Stowe's daughters, however, were promptly assured that whatever sums were needed for their mother's support and comfort would be supplied by us. This was carried into effect by a business arrangement .satisfactory to all parties. We may further add that Mrs. Stowe’s daughters have had the benefit of such value as the cheap reprints of “ l?n-
cle Tom" have left in the authorized editions.
