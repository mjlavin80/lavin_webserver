Purely Pathologies’.
A. DIVOHCE. By Paul Bourgpt of iho l^rrnch Academy. 1 li mo. Pp. 30::. Kvw York:	Charlva	Scribner's	Sons.
M. Bourget, In this book, has so far subordinated tho human interest of his characters to tho problem that tho whole may be said to tako the shape of an algebraic formula In whirli the letters a, b, c, d, e. f, stand for the various persons and mathematical, moral laws do tlie rest, that is. granting the author’s premises. For the case is this: a, a pretty woman of the middle class marries b, who is a brute. They have a son c. and presently separate. B soon marries again. Then appears d, an old admirer of a, and persuades her to marry him. They live happily and have a daughter e* The mother, though she has cared little enough for the old faith for many years, brings up c In the church and finds the child’s pious fervor a strong influence. Then when she would join her daughter at her first communion tlie priest forbids. since	the	Church does	not	recognize either	the	divorcee or	the	second
marriage.	So	the law of	the	Church
enters Into	the	problem, we	may	call it.
A is torn between religion and love. To make matters worse, c. tho son by the first husband, b, falls In love with f, a young woman who has previously lived with a man without the formality of marriage. IJut not from passion. It I was merely that she thought the mere j legal sanction unnecessary. The second husband d eagerly disapproves the match.
; The son, c. can see no essential difference between the case of tho girl, f, and his own mother. And he says so. For the Church holds his mother’s second marriage void as me law refuses to recognize the girl’s irregular contract. And there you are: a -b+c f d+e-K+M equals, misery. As M. Bourget regards it. it is the working out of the moral law upon the original sin of the woman in taking a new husband by the laws of France'when the Church forbids such a thing. Naturally, M. Bourget has' split some pretty fine psychological hairs and gone into minutiae after his somewhat ' feminine manner. Naturally, the thing reads in English much more like a scien-‘ tific treatise than it would in the French.
