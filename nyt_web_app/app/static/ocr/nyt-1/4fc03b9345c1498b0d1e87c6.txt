VERYBODY who likes to read tales of the mysterious will surely read the newest story of Anna ICatharlne Green, “ The Millionaire Baby,** which Is published by those untiring purveyors of American literary " sensations," the Bobbs-Mcrrlll Company of Indianapolis. This lady. sincc she produced " The Leaven: worth Case,'* years ago, has bravely hold her own as a writer of detective stories that are worth while. In the literary art, so far as we arc able to judge from remembrance of her earlier books, she has made little or no progress. Perhaps the portrayal of recognizable traits of human character In her present book Is a little more skillful than ft used .o be; perhaps there is loss of the naivete of the amateur writer In this story than in some of its predecessors. But these qualities, or^he lack of them, really count for nothing in the reader's appreciation of her work* She always hat- a story to tell, and it Is always thrilling. full of seemingly impenetrable mystery which is easily dispelled in the denouement. One reads from page to pago with breathless interest.
As a detective story, M The Millionaire I’iiby ” is as clever us anything Anna Ketharine Green has written. If it has some other qualities which were missed in the others, from " Tlie l>cavenworlh Cast* ” to ** The Filigree Bail,” ho much the better.
We fa noy the character of Dr. Pool of Yonkers is something more of a ** character study ” than any other personag^ in the whole list of Anna Katharine Green. An unscrupulous physician of miserly habits, who is suddenly transformed in his old age by religious mania, the potentialities of this grimly picturesque personage might have been made much of by another novelist with less absorbing matter in hand. In the greed of his un regenerate days lie lends his services
for money to a scheme of criminal duplicity. Under the spell of his newly found religious Inspiration he becomes a righter of great wrongs and an avenger. In one passage he is strikingly portrayed, but he counts for little in the development of the plot, and is abruptly killed ofi* long before the denouement, tie causes
nil the trouble, but is useless in unraveling the mystery.
The title of the book suggests one or two living American infants who have betn much talked of. The little girl whoso strange disappearance makes the story is seemingly like those real infants, heir to more than one vast fortune. Sin* is, It seems, either stolen by persons anxious fo> a reward, or drowned by accident m the Hudson. You must learn for yourself from the book which hypothesis is M ue. or whether either is true. You will Icirn, if you pick up the book, for you will not lay it aside until you know the wl.ole story.
