Cndcr this title E. P. Dutton & Co. will shortly issue a volume by Katharine Liur-riil. Thu little volume is made up of j essay.1*, foveral of which appeared in a j London magazine, to girls on friendship, cleanliness, duty to parents, letter writing, cooking. &c. In her " Foreword " the author speaks of the modern girl. She docs not believe in sending a girl away from home for her education. The mother is the best teacher. '* It is better," she writes, " to keep a girl at home, if all she h arns is .spelling and simple arithmetic, than give her a giund education out of all proportion to her home and its surroundings. There is a very silly expression used by some people, * A Finishing School.' Could anything be more absurd! As if our schooling was ever finished! The world is a vast school, in which wc all have lessons to learn, sometimes very hard ones, so hard that it takes us all our life to learn them." And she continues:
At school a girl is hemmed in with rules and regulations, bells for this and bells for that, hours for work and hours for play, the whole day carefully mapped out and very little left to her own initiative. She comes home from the very superior Foreign Schood or the Higher Education College, and T-ley, Presto! everything is changed, with very often dire results. For at eighteen wc are quite sure we know everything* as we arc certain at eight-and-thirty we know nothing and can never live long enough to learn one-million th part of what there is to learn. H<?Ocksuro Youth gallops round the world while Ago sits at home and is afraid to look out of the window. Brave Dare All Youth is very fascinating; we can even forgive him his remarkable cocksureness, only 1 like to see Youth showing reverence and respcct to Age. Age's slippered feet once were booted and spurred to ride round the world.
