pany. SI.
Mr- Wright’s littlo volume on caricature seems likely to serve a very useful purpose. For if it does not tread a well nigh unteachable art, it will be found to contain many serviceable hints to the workman as well as bits of Information which a layman likes to posses. “ To descend from the sublime to the ridiculous," says thtr author, " Is the caricaturists’ j constant effort. To explain how this can be accomplished interestingly and pictorially Is the purpose of these pages. Carl- ! cature, contrary to popular conception, is not incorrect or bad drawing; it Is I good drawing, refined, and controlled to produce a humorous effect.**
One may insist that the effect of humor is not always produced by “ refining" without impugning the large truth of Mr. Wright's statements. He proceeds to say something very general about the history of caricature and then to give attention to various practical hints about learning how to observe and to draw as preliminary to the exercisc of the license of exaggeration, omission, selection, which is caricature proper. He suggests, for Instance, that the ambitious aspirant try to draw a lamppost from memory, and then go out, sketch in hand, and consider an actual lamppost—and observe how badly his memory has served him* He presents diagramatic methods of getting the human head In due proportion—using an egg for model—he studies the measurements of the human figure, the arrangement of muscles and bones, and calls attention to the necessity of learning particularly how to draw hats and shoes. Then he discusses methods—rapid lines, slow lines, cross-hatching, providing illustrations of them all and commending simplicity. Mr. Wright has special reference, of course, to newspaper cartoons and the conditions of haste under which they must be evolved, and he insists on the importance to the cartoonist of the " nose for news ” so indispensable in a reporter. Appended is an account of many conspicuous American newspaper caricaturists, living and dead, and the book Is furnished with many examples of the work of each of these, from Thomas Nast to the present. Above all, the work is sensible and practical and easily understandable of persons devoid of the lingo of the trade.
