believe that these troublesome and Injurious restrictions would soon be Amended by Congress. Meanwhile, I do not see that we can blame the Americans In the least. They are a strictly business people, and If they find that they have to deal with folk who prefer a shibboleth to their own legitimate gains, it is but natural that they should take advantage of the fact.
Despite these suggestions, we shall continue to believe that the ultimate goal toward which all writers of whatever tongrue should work is the universal recognition cf the right of property in literary productions and free commerce in such productions in all lands.

The recent action of the House of Representatives in regard to copyright , for “ foreign " authors, i. e„ authors in other tongues than English, has flut- ■ tered the literary dovecotes of Britain In a remarkable manner. It will be remembered that the bill which passed the House provided' in substance that the works of authors in foreign tongues might be copyrighted in this country at any time within a year. Our friends in England look on this as a most invidious Jiscrimination against them. The Standard has opened its columns to them, and a bitter stream of criticism and protest flows therethrough from the gail-dipped pens of such writers as Rider Haggard, Bernard Shaw, Conan Doyle, and Frederic Harrison.
We should think that the actual difference in the situation as to French or German or Italian authors and that of authors writing in English would not be very difficult to see, even by interested and aggrieved persona. It all lies in the fact that in one case there must be a translation and in the other none is needed. That means added delay ar <3 expense Jo publishers, and these add to the risk, which is already greater than with English books. If, for Instance, one of Mr. Shaw’s puzzling plays, before it could be published with copyright in this country, had to be set over into another tongue from that in which he chooses to write, it is plain that it would be sensibly more puzzling than before, and the risk which a publisher would take as to its " catching on " would be greater. Then if Mr. Shaw were to be required to wait for publication in England until a satisfactory translation could be made, would not his native impatience —one of the sources of his charm, but,
1 nevertheless, an obstacle t:> bargain-
_ ing—become irresistible and block the transaction? It is to avoid or overcome these artificial and extraordinary causes of risk in publishing foreign books that the change in our law is proposed. F >r ourselves we should be only too glad to see the same or greater liberty extended to British copyright, but we think that the proposed law makes no real distinction of an invidious or injurious nature.	j
We note with some amusement that all the writers we have named, except Mr. Harrison, have a notion that the true remedy lor their wrongs is in retaliation. and in this they are joined, of course, by The Saturday Review of London, which never declines a chance , to couple sneers at Americans with ad-vicB to follow their example in the matter of protection. Mr. Shaw puts the case in a characteristically plain manner:
The only wav to deal wiih this [situ- ! ationl from the point of view of the , American printer, who is apparently ! the dominant factor in tho situation, is for the I’nited States to join in the Berne Convention, and then put a prohibitive import duty on foreign plates, sheets, and, in fact, on all printed matter that is not, like Mazarin Bibles and I Kclnifcott Chaucers, imported as art i treasure, payirg duty under that head. ;
The next step is defined by Mr. Rider Hagga rd:
Were not this country so lightly tied to its sacred [fi'K* trade 1 principles, the difficulty would, perhaps, be got ! over. Thus we should say, what is sauce for the goose is same for the gander. If English books must be j printed in America, American books j must be printed in England. Then I
