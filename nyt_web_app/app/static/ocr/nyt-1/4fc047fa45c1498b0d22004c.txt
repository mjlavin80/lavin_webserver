Tlio tenth volume of *' Early Western Travels " describes the settlement In Illinois, in the first deeadc of the last century, of certain Englishmen of wealth and education. At the close of the Napoleonic wars there was agricultural distress in ! England. Mobs and public disturbances were common. There arose a strong sen- ■ j tiinent In favor of emigration to the Unit- I I ed States. An abundance of land in the I West and its cheapness induccd not a few I men with money to seek new homes. Two Englishmen, Morris Birkbeck and George Flower, the former a Quaker, disposed of their property in England and headed the j movement. Flower came first, in 1810.	'
i The two bought a large tract of unbroken prairie land in Southwestern Illi- J i note. They brought their families with , them and no small quantity of baggage. Letters they wrote home Induced further Immigration. Why William Cobbett vio- , lently opposed tlie choice of a place se- j , lectod by tlie immigrants is by no means : dear. He wrote several diatribes, ridiculing the movement. To the Cobbett strictures answers were made by Birkbeck,
| Flower, and others. The volume under i notice contains the letters and journals ot Richard Flower, John Woods, and Thom- ; i as Hulme, ail published in London between ISIS and IS‘21. It is worthy of re-I membrance that the part played by these Englishmen was important, since they | ! helped to prevent the introduction of I slavery into Illinois.

j John Woods's *' Two Years’ Residence in the Settlement on the English Prairie in the Illinois Country " is remarkable in i a literary sense for Its clearness and good j style. Woods, with his family and seventy other passengers, chartered a brig of 5<k0 tons from Portsmouth bound for Baltimore. The start took place in May, 1K10,
It took fifty-eight days’ sailing from Cowes to reaeh Baltimore. The little company hired several wagons for the transportation of themselves and their luggage, which latter weighed (1,000 pounds. When the Ohio was reached tlie company took to an ark. At last the English settlement
in Illinois was sighted. Woods tells
amusingly of the nomadic character of some of the settlers. There was a man on Uirlt’s Prairie (Birkbeck's) who had a small orchard. The man’s wife told Woods that her husband had planted " six orchards before the present one,’’ and that “ she had twelve children, but never had two been born in the same house.” The author admires the American idea of freedom. He writes:
They are a most determined set of republicans, well versed in politics, and thoroughly independent. A man who nas onlv half a shirt, and without shoes and stockings is as independent as the first man in the States.
Woods comments on the speceh of the people:
Well begins most sentences. Plunder ; and truck include almost everything, a horse is generally called a creature. Beefs 1 arr cows. Toat (tote?> means to carry anything. Strait and turn in are words I they frequently use. Women- they n.1-I ways call their wives their women. Many I of them, instead of saying yes niake a : surt ol noise like " him-liim,” or rather ! pronouncing m, m,” with the mouth ; shut.
I As there is to-day, tnere was then nn overabundance of Judges. HejiOl’nIs. Colo-ne)S, and Captains. Present ehronielers of manly sports in the Vnited States will find that nt the English Illinois scttle-i ment, in	several cricket matches
i were played, and " that the Americans , seem mueh pleased at the sight of the I game, as it is new to them.” At Albion Woods attends the Circuit Court, tie notes the fact that the Judges wore no particular dress. As it was a ivarm day, one of the counsel took off his coat and pleaded without it. The value of the volume Is enhanced by the introductions and I notes furnished by the editor, Mr. Reuben Gold Thwaftes.
