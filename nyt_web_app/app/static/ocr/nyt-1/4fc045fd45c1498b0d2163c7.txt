Tho author continuer his history or the " Panama Canal Projects," beginning1 with the failure of the De Lesseps Panama Canal Company and the organization of a new company to take over the franchise and property of tin* old one, pay its debts, anil complete the canal on the new plan. Tie writes of the negotiations of the Ignited States with Colombia in ltK>3, the rejection by the Columbian Senate of the Hay-Herran treaty, and the final ratification of that treaty. Commenting on the results, Mr. Scruggs says:
The rights of sovereignty of even the weakest and most insignificant of the Central and South American States should bo scrupulously respected by the great powers, and more especially by the I'nited States, which stands In a peculiar relation to them. But these rights should be exercised in a spirit befitting the occasion and the wants and necessities of civilization. Neither Colombia nor other of those Governments, even K administered with more regard to the just demands of commercial nations than they have sometimes been, can be permitted to close the eates of intercourse on the great highways of the world, and justify the act by the pretension that these avenues of international trade and travel belong to them exclusively, and therefore that they may choose to elose them; or, what is equivalent to the same thing, to encumber them with such exorbitant and unreasonable demands ana unjust relations as would prevent their general use.
