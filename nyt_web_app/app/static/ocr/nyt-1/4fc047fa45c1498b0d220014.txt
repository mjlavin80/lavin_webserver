:: “DON QUIXOTE”
An Account of the Various Edittons-of the Master Work of Cervantes.
[E tercentenary of the publication of the first edition ol! Uie first part of “Don Quixote*’ is celebrated here only by an exhibition of early and rare editions of Cervantes's book, wjiich can be seen at the Lenox Library. There are few raver books in the world than that printed in Madrid in January, 1G05, by Juan de la Cuesta. We know of only two copies in this country, those in the un-
-	rivaled Spanish collection of Archer M. Huntington, and there seems to have been but one recent auction sale of this classic rarity, Baron Seilli&re’s fine copy, in the original limp vellum, in perfect preservation, bringing £113 in London In February, 1887. A search through booksellers’ catalogues revcals"tlie presence of one copy— an imperfcct example, with twelve of the preliminary leaves in fac simile—which, together with the first edition of the second part, 3015, was offered for £150 in a Quaritch catalogue in 3900. Bidot, greatest of Frcneh bibliophiles, could procure no edition earlier than the revised edition of 3608, now in the Lenox Library, while George Tick nor. whose “ History of Spanish Literature*’ was once considered authoritative, was unable to add the first edition to his Spanish collection, now in the Boston Public Library, the earliest edition owned by liim being Cuesta’s second edition of 1005, (lacking the title page and two other leaves,) which he fondly prized as the editlo princeps, although it is, in reality, but the third of the five editions in 1005.
The precious.quarto of. <W4 pages, Issued in Madrid early in 3G05, is therefore a work of extraordinary rarity, and we may eafely set upon it a valuation of not less than five times the price paid for the Seillidre copy eighteen years ago. os Li-mating Us present value at at least $2,500. | It is not a handsome book, this editlo princeps, having been put forth in an imperfect and mutilated form, swarming with printer's blunders and hearing every mark of having been neglected by author and publisher, Cervantes himself might well have been careless of the fate of his book—an experiment in a totally new line —for he was in dire straits, almost at the lowest ebb of his fortune, a hanger-on of . tlie Court, from which ho had little to hope, and with small reason to believo , that this new child of his wit," conceived in a prison, would bring him credit or profit.
It has been thought that the first edition of the first part was perhaps issued late in December. 3*104, for the privilegio (license) is dated Sept. 20, 3004. the list of errata Doc- 1, 100-1, and the tasa. (valuation for tax) Dec. 20, 3004. It is possible that this was a notable example of tho obnoxious method of publishing books toward the close of one year with the date of the next; but the romance, in all probability, was not issued until early in January, 3005. Tlie book, however, was undoubtedly circulated while in manuscript form, after the fashion of Shakespeare's *4 Sonnets,” for it was familiarly known in literary circles, and spoken of as on u par with the most popular novels of the century, about two months before the date of license, and five months before the actual publication of the first known edition, for on Aug. -J, 3004, Lope de Vega wrote to the Duke of Sessa, giving him tlie latest literary news of the day: "Of poets I speak not. Many are in the bud for next year, but there arc none so bad as Cervantes or so foolish as to praise * Don Quixote.* ” And in the “ Picara Justina of Andres Perez, the privilegio of which is dated Aug. 22, 1001, we have some truncated versus which speak of:
" Don Quixo y Lazari Qu<* Alfarach y Celesti.”
Tlie success attending the publication of the first part quickly let! to the production of new editions and reprints. The second edition of 3005 was unquestionably that printed in Lisbon by Jorge Kodri-guez. This, as Saiva and Watts clearly demonstrate, must be acknowledged the second edition, for it contains what no other of the early editions does, the passage in the twenty-sixth chapter, in which Don Quixote speaks of having improvised a rosary out of strips from the tail of his shirt, which only exists in Cuesta* s lirst Madrid edition and this one of Lisbon. H is a quarto volume of 402 pages, printed in double columns. The approbation is dated Feb. 20, 1005, a little more than two months later than that which is affixed to Cuesta's first edition. Watts styled it as even rarer than any of the Madrid editions, and Korney, Quarttch's head cataloguer for many years, was of the same opinion. A copy, joined with j Rodriguez's 1017 edition of the second part, was priced by Quaritch at £72 in 1SS5.
The third edition of the first part and tho second of the two only genuine editions produced in 1G05 is tlie one which Cuesta published in Madrid soon after Rodriguez’s Lisbon edition. In form, size, character of the print, and number of tuc pages it is precisely similar to Cuesta's
first edition, but contains, however, some curious and important variations, among •them being the alteration in the twenty-sixth chapter, where Don Quixote makes -his rosary, not of his shirt-tails, but of
*	oak-galls—a change probably made by the author at the instance of Uie censorship. This edition was even more carelessly printed than tho first, and appears to have been hurried through the press. A fourth edition of 3005, printed tn Valencia by Pedro Patricio Mey. Is an octavo of sixteen preliminary leaves and 70S pages of text. This was better printed than any of the preceding editions. The text follows Cuesta's second edition of 1005, as does the fifth edition of the first part, which was printed iii Lisbon later in the same year by Pedro Crasbeeck. This is an octavo of 010 pages. Watts called it equally rare with the first Lisbon edition, and equally without authority from or
profit to the author.
These editions may be called the first five editions of tho first part of Cervantes’s romance, nnd he who possesses one of the five may be reckoned, as Watts wrote, " supremely happy among Quixote and Quixotic collectors/* A set of the five editions is in this country in Mr. Huntington's library, and another is In the British Museum, but wo know not where to look for other sets. The five editions were followed by a valueless reprint of 3G07, piratically issued in Brussels. Tlio next year, 3H0S, Cuesta published the true second edition of the rfrst part, made under the eyes of the author j and containing many alterations and corrections. This edition, together with the 3015 edition of tho second part, is the editio parens of Uie text of Cervantes, the | parent of all succeeding editions. The i second part, which Cuesta printed in ; Madrid in a quarto volume of 5S1 pages, was preceded by a spurious second part, a forgery of a writer known as Avcllan-eda, printed In Tarragona in 3G14 by Felipe j Roberto. Tlie latter is very rare, and we have seen but one copy described in catalogues during recent years—tho fine example, from the Nddier and Hercdfa. collections, which Quaritch priced at £23 ten years ago. It is much rarer than tlie edition which it anticipated, although Watts, curiously enough, calls tho first edition of the second part 14 even rarer than any of . the early editions of the first part.” This is absurdly incorrect. The Cervantes collection now being shown at the Lenox Library includes no less than three copies, each united to fine copies of the 3C0S edition. One of the three Lenox copies is the Didot example, in olive Morocco, which brought 2,500f. at the first Didot sale, in 187s, and cost Mr. Lenox from Quaritch £150 in 187H.
Later editions of the complete " Don Quixote," infinite in number and of every variety of merit, can be (seen in the Lenox collection, whiuli includes the special Cervantes collection formed by the late Dr. Wendell Prime and bequeathed to the library in 380IJ. Dr. Prime was able lo
obtain no earlier edition than the Valen-cian one of 3005, but Iiis collection is wonderfully rich in Spanish editions of later date and in the various editions produced in foreign tongues. The very full gathering of English versions begins with Thomas Shelton’s quaint translation of 3G12-3U20, the first made in English: includes the various translations made by John Philips UCS7f) Ned Ward (1711-12,) Mottcaux (1700*03,) Charles Jarvis (1712,) Smollett (1701,) Wilmot (1774,) &i\, and ends with the excellent version of the late Henry Edward Watts, (1SSS, revised in ISOa.) The rarest of the early editions in English is, of course, Shelton’#, a fine copy of which, with both title pages, (which are seldom seen together,) sold for £G1 at the Hibbert sale in London in 3002.
