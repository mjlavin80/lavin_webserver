NTEREST In tho bookbindIng craft has grown slowly but surely during the past year. Ttio appearance of no very great nov®}^ in bookbinding during 1004 can be chronicled, but the Bpiendld. showing of hand bindings at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition at bt. Louis probably did more to stimulate popular interest in the subject than any other. Incident of the last quarter of a ccntury.
A few special bindings were given P^ccs at tho Pan-American Exposition at ttui-falo In 1901, but they were not as numerous or comprehensive.
The earliest exhibition In which bookbinding was included in 1004 took placo under the auspices of The Ousamequin Club in the Town Hall at Bridgewater, Mass., Feb. 15, and continued three days. The exhibition included also other products of various arts and crafts, and was accompanied with a booklet entitled ** Arts ana Crafts/' which replaced the customary catalogue hitherto issued by this cluo. M. Gertrude Cross exhibited twenty bound volumes, and Edith L. Hull of Newton, Mass., contributed one binding to the ex-
hibltion.
March 21 to 2G Harriet Keith Fobes gave an exhibition of artistic leathers, books, and dyed woods at her Carnegie Hall studio. The bindings were many of them upon the Mosher publications, and were confined to pyrographlc decorations. Miss Fobes used limp leather in various tints, upon which were superimposed designs burned upon tho binding material with a glowing platinum point formerly called “ poker work ” or “ fire etching/' March 22 to SG the Guild of Arts and Crafts held its fourth annual exhibition at the Guild House, East Twenty-third Street. The bookbinding department jvas not quite as large as it was the previous year. Bookbinding from the hands of Ellen Gates Starr of Hull House, Chicago, and Peter Vcrberg of Troy, N. H.t made up the numbers of this exhibit.	^

sembJy of tlie members of the Na,tlonal

A few of the French binders were represented at St. Louis. A more showing was made, however, y Sanderson, the English master, anions exhibits of Great Britain. One or tho Cobden-Sanderson exhibits- Consisted 01 Volume J. ot The Authorized Version of the English Bible. ‘‘Paradise Lost was another number that attracted mu£* attention A number of other examples of bocteblndlngs by binders not rrevlous y represented In any former exhlbttionsin this country were deserving of the most careful study by those Interested in the
B'a^ characteristic showing was St. Louis by Messrs. Zaehnsflorf of London. The Collection of bindings sent was a comparatively small one, and consisted of some twenty-odd volumes. Mr. ^ehns-dorf was a guest of the C^^ CIub at its January meeting when on his^ way to St Louis for the purpose of installing the firm's exhibit. Ho showed rubbings of the proposed exhibits to members of the Grolier Club, among whom they attracted much favorable comment. One o£ uie Zaehnsdorf bindings was on a. copy of the “ Ode on the Nativity" by John Milton. It contained a fino example of illuminating by Miss Edith Ibbs. The binding was in brown levant morocco decorated with a Grolieresque design inlaid with black bands. The double was of morocco, with a new rendering of the style of Clovis Eve. A first edition of Tennyson's "Maud” (18oo) was decorated with a modern design after tho style of Roger Payne. A few examples of miniature bindings were also shown by this firm. The tiny books (smaller than a postage stamp in size) were properly bound in a technical senso notwithstanding which they easily ranked with the larger volumes on every point of workmanship.
The Minneapolis Society of Arts and Crafts devoted their April meeting to a consideration of the subject of bookbinding, with especial reference to the results obtained In the craft on the part of Cob*
den-Sandcrson. A lecture was delivered
at this mooting on tho “Craft of Mr. Sanderson” by Miss Edith Griffith, and tho subject was afterward generally discussed by the members. May 0-14, the Handicraft Exhibition Leaguo of Cincinnati, Ohio, gave an exhibition which included bookbinding. Elizabeth Griscom Marot was perhaps the best known exhibitor here. May 13, Florence Foote gavo an exhibition of her own recently executed work, as well as the work of pupils of tho Evelyn Nordhoff Bindery at the Art Students’ League Building in West Fifty-seventh Street. Some thirty books were displayed. The bindings were for the most part done in levant morocco, although there were a few books bound in pigskin. Some few half-bindings were likewise included, and several examples of finishing in blind tooling were on view. The work done by the pupils of tho Nordhoff Bindery showed a remarkably high average, particularly when it is considered that the pupil exhibitors had with but few exceptions studied less than one year. Miss Foote has recently given a number of lectures upon bookbinding with sterc-opticon IlUistrations that have been very popular. By means of her lantern projections she can make the process of bookbinding quite as clear to her audiences as if she were going through the actual processes with a single pupil. The^ivlng of these lectures to the pupils in metropolitan schools is now under consideration*	W.	G. BOWDOIN.
