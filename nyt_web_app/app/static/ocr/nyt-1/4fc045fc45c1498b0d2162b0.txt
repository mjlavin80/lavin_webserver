THE SEAT OF WAR.
Thomas Cowen’s Book on the Russo-Japanese Conflict to the Battle of Liao Yang*
wjO M E W H A T prophetic in view of the rcccnt cupltula-latlon of Fort Arthur Is tho closing; paragraph of Hr. Cowen's volume, whlcn
The few occasions on which the Russians have attacked have perhaps not been in circumstances affording a fair test; but, at any rate, it is likely that the Japanese will hold their own, and that If the next phrase of thib war is a wearlnB-out process, It will be Russia that will suffer.
A trained observer, for many years a war correspondent, describing for newspapers tho Boer War, the Japanese-Chlnese War, phases of the Spanish-American War, both in Cuba and the Philippines, the Boxer War in China, and the siogu of Peking, Mr. Cowen treats of the war in tho East with exceptional facilities for getting at the facts. His book prepared lost Septomber after the close of the Liao-Yang- campaign, and while tho Port Arthur siege was in progress, Is most helpful to a thorough un-derstandlng of the situation.. His analysis of the reason for Japanese success Is thorough, both as to Japan's prepara-tlons for the struggle, and the causes for Russia's unpreparedncss.. lie sums up tho cause for the Russian failures in I these words: "Indecision in emergency has been a characteristic weakness of Russia," " Beware of the correspondent" was, he says, the burden of the reports to Tokio of all Japanese army | observers who accompanied the English troops during the Boor \ftir. To the observance of this warning he attributes i much of the success of tho Japanese army and navy, In that the observance of that warning saved tho conveyance of information that might have been of great ! value to the Russians. Japan’s pre- : parations for the war in which she has been so singularly successful began with ! Russia's announcement of the " huge Siberian Railway scheme in 1WH."
AVhilo ’ Russia was slowly encroaching on China, Manchuria and Korea, despite Japan’s diplomatic protests, Japan built as rapidly as possible a navy. She mobilized her army; niched ahead of tlie worlds in tho const rue tion of guns and ammunitions, made, of necessity, a new method of military tactics to meet her peculiar difficulties that were to bo overcome, and while Russia rested serenely safe in her bulkf in tlie overpowering strength of numbers, Japan built for her reception such a hornet's nust as had never before been dreamed of. She was even ready for the Allied Powers of Europe if need be.	”
Napoleon was wrong, afler writing of the battle of the Yalu, if he ever did say that Providence was on the side of the bigsest battalions; he should have said the side of those who can shoot host. Russia had pinned her faith to iier numbers and the numbers failed. * * * Providence, too, Is usually on the side of the Quickest battalion. Finally, the most important of nil the factors that made the YalU battle pre-eminently the decisive battle of the war was that the Japanese soldier had made the acquaintance of the Russian soldier and had made him run • • * It could, of course, not be by one defeat that the mighty power of Russia could be broken; but this one blow broke the spell of Russian resisticssness, which had crushed the larpest part of Asia and had overawed Europe*. It demonstrated that the prowess of the Samurai race was not merely a tale of Old Japan unsuited for modern times and European warfare^
Remarkably effective as word pictures are his descriptions of tYic naval operations In the early days before Port Arthur, when Admiral Toga wiped the Russian Navy out of existence, of the battles at the crossing of thf* Yalu, of tho landing at Liaotung, and the operations before Port Arthur that preceded and made possible the successful b:ittle of Tellssu, the capture of the passes at Fenshuillng, and led up to the tremendous nine days’ battle before Llao-Yang, the bloodiest and most desperately fought in all history. But of greater value are the carefully analyzed reasons for each step taken, tho clearing thus of doubts as to the why and wherefore of It all. Nothing seems to be left to
the Imagination of the reader. With the simplicity of a tactical primer the reasons , for success and the causes of failure are alike made plain. And with it oil there is a constant succession of pictures of army and navy life that is positively fascinating in the simple old-fashioned manner In which it is told with no attempt at “ fine writing,” and a directness that Is wholly effective. While probably not so intended, it is a perfect brief in favor of the military methods adopted and made perfect by the quiet, but clearheaded, yellow men who willingly took up the task that all Europe has feared. Here is his description how the Yalu was crossed:	'
It was surprising that the entlro Japanese army crossed the main stream of the Yalu practically without a shot being fired, * * * Eating and sleeping had to be

very secondary considerations that night. During the day all the men had been supplied with three days' rations, and they could eat when they had the chance. In an advance there is usually a' good deal of waiting. The men had to march, wade, wait their turn at a plank bridge or shallow ford, help each other up a slippery bank, pass In single file sometimes through a willow copse, wait, climb, jump, mud-scramble, and march again, for about six hours, getting into position, lining out In front of the long extending Russian trenches. No light wns allowed, nor a voice above an undertone; for the most
gart there were not roads to march on, ut the men had to cross fields, grope In the gloom for strange paths, or struggle past obstructions where no path could be found, using dry water courses as tracks till they led Into pools, over stubbly cornfields, in and out among tenantless farm buildings, up country lanes and hillside footpaths, each officer and “ non-com ” peering into the gloom, feeling his way to the unpointed snot, consulting a rough sketch plan, and drawing his men after him with an angry “Hush! ” at any sudden sound that might reach the enemy. This silent, stealthy advance of a whole army into the blackncss or tbi ;nknown was wonderfully Impressive. L. cry thing depended on getting into position before daybreak," and it was most admirably done. Really the battle was won In the silence of the ntglit; the banging of guns and the slaying of brave men next day only proclaimed the accomplished fact.
Here is his description of the way In which the attack on Fort Arthur that led to its capitulation has been carried on:
While Admiral Togo's squadron, seven months ut sea, and stilt tireless, vigilant, keen as ever, day and night continues sending In from long range those terrible Shlmose shells, worse than lyddiLc, on the battered town, the forts, the outposts, tho Japanese troops with patient and devoted heroism keep on creeping forward, burrowing under ground, digging deep trenches that zigzag toward the enemy’s lines. Slowly, laboriously the Japanese tunnel into the slopes under the Russian forts, and literally inch by inch they forge ahead, till near enough to emerge and make a rush—only to fall in heaps, dying and dead—and their brothers have to try again. In many places the ground is solid rock and the Japanese cannot counter-mine; but, little by little, masses of rock and bngs filled with sand ! are collccteil In some corner out of sight j of the Russians, and are suddenly rushed forward In the night, lo make temporary sheller where a regiment can get forward a hundred yards, rest, Tire for a few minutes, and get forward another hundred yards, till at last they are close up to (he enemy. Then a charge In the teeth of fierce rifle fir*\ and only a few Japanese survive it;

; how, for ft is wonderful how many bul-| lets cun miss. *	*	* But it seems
lo	be true, as Napoleon said, that there ! Is no such a word us *' impossible.” It seems that 110 fortress Is absolutely Impregnable In the face of determined attack. The Japanese have not yet taken Port Arthur, but they have taken several of the outer forts, and apparently must in thne tak,e the innermost cltndvl. It is a question of time; to take the place means necessarily a terrible amount of bloodshed, and the best way in this case is the slow and sure.
