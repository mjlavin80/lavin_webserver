Written for The New York Times Book Review by EDWIN MARKHAM.
Author of '* The Man With the Hoe " and Othor Poems.
E Americans—those who are fortunate among us—have been congratulating ourselves upon our National prosperity, Mr. Hunter’s book on our National pov-. erty, therefore, is a timely one. It comes to correct and moderate our jubilation; to point us to the grizzly Shape that follows in the track of Prosperity. Mr. Hunter tells a piteous story of the privations and degradations of the dim. silent millions among us. And Mr. Hunter speaks with authority; he has not gone to any man for his chief facts. He has gotten them at first hand, for he has been an earnest worker for many years among the tribes of poverty. One can live a lifetime on Riverside Drive, and yet know almost nothing of the g-aunt
poverty of the east side.	.
It is well/ then, that Mr. Hunter comes to revive for us the actors in the grim drama of poverty, setting before us the Pauper, the Vagrant, the Sick, the Immigrant, the piteous and portentous Child. Among remedial measures he mentions only those that lie has tried or that others have tried. We are told in the preface that “ the more far-reaching and radical reforms proposed by the Socialist, the single-taxcr, and the individualist have not been examined here, and therefore not condemned or indorsed.” The book, as ar whole, has one aim—namely, to show the grievous need of certain social measures calculated to prevent the ruin and degradation of those working people who are on the verge of poverty.
Tlie first chapter deals with poverty in general, and with *' the several reasons for believing that in fairly prosperous times no less than 10,000.000 persons in the United States are underfed, underclothed, and ' poorly housed." Mr. Hunter goes on to say:
There are many people in the world who believe that the provisions of charity in the present day are : so generous and varied that no one need suffer, but, even if this were true, it would nor materially lessen tho,sorrmv of the poor. To thousands and thousands of workingmen the dread of public pauperism is the agony of their lives. * . *	* *When the poor face
the necessity of becoming paupers, when they must apply for charity if * they are to live at all, many desert their families and enter the ranks of vagrancy; others drink themselves insensible; some go insane, and still others commit suicide. * * • *
This distinction between the poor arid the paupers may be seen everywhere. There ■ are. in all large cities In America and abroad, streets and courts and' alleys where a class of people .live who have lost all. self-respect and ambition, who rarely, if ever, work,-who are aimless and drifting, who like drink,-who have no thought for their children, and who live more* or less contentedly on rubbish and.alms. Such districts are certain portions of Whitechapel and Spit-alsfield in London, Kitrof Rynock in Moscow, parts of Armour Avenue in Chicago, Hat Hollow In Cincinnati, and parts of Cherry Hill and the Minettas in New Tork City, and so on in all cities everywhere. The lowest level of humai^ty is reached in these disr tricts. In our American cities negroes, whites, Chinese, Mexicans, half-breeds, Americans, Irish, and others are indiscriminately housed together in the same tenements and even in the same rooms. The blind, the crippled, the consumptive, the aged—tne ragged ends of life; the babies, the children, the. half-starved, underclad beginnings in life, all .huddled together, waiting, drifting. This is pauperism. There is no mental agony here: they do not work sore:-there is no dread; they live miserably, but they do not care.	.	.	.	b
In the same cities and, indeed, everywhere, thefe are great districts of people who are up before dawn, who wash, dress, and eat breakfast, kiss wives-and children, and hurry away to work or to seek work. The world rests upon their shoulders; it moves by. their muscle; everything would stop if, for any rea-. son, they should decide not to go into the fields and • factories and mines. . But the world is so organized that they gain enough to live upon only when they., work; should they cease they are in destitution and hunger. The more fortunate of the laborers are but a tew weeks from actual distress when the machine* are stopped. Upon the unskilled masses want is con *
. stantly pressing. As soon as employment ceases suffering stares them in the face. They are the actual producers of wealth, who have no home nor any. bit of soilvwhlch they may call their own. They. are the millions who. possess no tools and can work only by permission, of another. ■ In the main, they Hve miserably, they, know not why. : They work sore; • yet gain nothing. They know the meaning, ot: hunger and the dread of .-want; They love their wives and ■ children. They try . to - retain - their: self-respect. They have some ambition. They, give to. neighbors in need; yet they are themselves; the actual children of poverty. * *	-	Many, many,
thousand families who are in no sense.paupers are In

•> poverty. * \* * ■ They are the largo class " m any Industrial nation who are on the
-	verge of distress. * * • The funda- | mental thing in all. this Is • that every 'workman 'who Js expected by society to remain Independent of public relief end capable of self-support must be guaranteed * * * an opportunity for obtaining those necessaries essential to physical efficiency. Such a standard is uie basis of almost everything; for, unless men can I retain their physical efficiency, they must degenerate. To continue in poverty for any Ion*' period means In the end the loss of the power of doing work; and to be unable to work means in the end pauperism.
A few years ago Mr, Jacob A. RUs collected figures which showed that about one-third of the people of New York City were dependent upon charity at some time during the eight years previous to 1800. The New York State Board of Charities reported that 2ft per cent, of the people of the State of New York in 1897 found It necessary to apply for re' lief. In the Borough of Manhattan 60,403 families were evicted from their homes In ISiB. This is about 14 per cent of the .total number of families. During the year 1003 In Boston over 136,000 persons, or 20 per cent, of the population, were aided by the public authorities alone. It is estimated that 3361,000 persons were . aided through private charities. And . there are only about 000,000 persons in Boston.
So page after page we are confronted by staggering facts and figures. There isa general impression that we have a widespread diffusion of property owner-
*	ship. But Mr. Hunter calls our-attentlon to certain startling facts based on the census. It appears that 34 per cent, of J our fanners are renters, and nearly 10 per ; cent of the farms aro mortgaged. The census for 1000 shows that more than half the families fn the United States do not own homes. The case Is at Its worst In the cities. In Boston 81 per cent, and In New York (Manhattan) D4 per cent, do not own their homes. The property of the Nation is so divided that one family In j every one hundred owns more property than is owned by all the remaining ninety- ] nine.
" Poverty,” says Mr. Hunter, “ is already widespread in this new country, and. knowing this to bo true, It seems the height of folly that the Nation should disregard so absolutely this enormous problem of misery that not an inquiry is made as to its extent or as to the causes which add to its volume."
Mr. Hunter tells ns again and again that tlie poverty of to-day is In a great measure unnecessary, and that it is due in no small degree to certain social evilS1 s' which must be put right. He notes the curious fact that the people of any country can be easily aroused to protest against atrocities existing in another country. Injustice abroad causes great Indignation among many of the people who are insensible and apathetic to tho injustice and cruelty in their own State and country. And yet he is hopeful of the future, for he says:
I am not so pessimistic in regard to the moral state of our Nation as to believe we slialJ much longer make the wago earner boar upon his own shoulders the heaviest costs of progress, and. In the •painful struggle become uncomplainingly the despised vagrant, pauper, prostitute, or criminal.
Lack of space forbids adequate mentiori of the chapters on The Child, The Sick, The Immigrant, Tho Pauper, The Vagrant Nor can I pause over the stories of the garbage heaps and the M flop houses." Nor can I stay to tell of the machine politician, “ who, In some cities, owns the finest houses of vir<? in (lie district," of the saloon-keeping politician.
who is a feudal lord among his * boys/ " of the policeman, " who is not permitted to stop law breaking when ho sees It," of the party boss, who is tlie most powerful person in the political life of America.1* In passing these pages, however, the eye calchcs one momcntoi^ statement:
So long, indeed, :is there is such a thing as enforced unemployment, just so long will the? sources of vagrancy be ever active. Neither artificial employments nor charitable provision can remedy the evil. The worker is himself helpless. lie Is a wastrel, begging to be used in a competitive industrial system which in its present form requires his continued existence.	1
Here is Mr. Hunter’s brief summary of the whole problem:
There are probably in fairly prosperous years no less than 10,000,000 persons in poverty; that is to pay, underfed, underclothed, und poorly housed. Of ttiese, about 4,0(MM*00 persons are public paupers. Over :!,ooti,000 workingmen are unemployed from four to six months In the year. About .'(>0,000 male immigrants ar= rive yearly and seek work In the very dis-. tricts where unemployment Is greatest Nearly half the families in the country are propertyless. Over 1,700,000 little children are forced to become wage earners when they should still be in school. About
5.000.000	women find it necessary to work and about 2,000,000 are employed in factories and mills. Probably no less than
1.000.000	workers are injured or killed each year while doing their work, and about 10,000,000 of the persons now living will, if the present ratio is kept up. die of the preventable disease, tuberculosis.
Mr. Hunter proposes certain reforms for Immediate adoption.
They would make all tenements and factories sanitary; they would regulate the hours of work, especially for women and children; they would regulate and thoroughly supervise dangerous trades; they would institute all necessary measures to Stamp out unnecessary disease and to prevent unnecessary death; they would prohibit entirely child labor; they would institute all necessary educational tind
• . ■ r - * recreational Institutions' to replace the social and educational losses of the home and the domestic 'workshop; they would perfect as far adT possible, legislation and institutions to make industry, pay the legitimate cost of producing and maintaining efficient laborers; they would institute, on the lines of foreign experience, measures to compensate labor for enforced seasons of idleness, due to sickness, old age, lack of work, or other causes beyond the control of the workman; *	*. * they would restrict the
power of employer and of shipowner to stimulate for purely selfish ends an excessive Immigration, and in this way to beat down wages and to increase unemployment.’*
Now we come to a still blacker chapter in the terrible story. One would suppose offhand that it would bo necessary only to point out these social wrongs to have all peoples rush to the rescue. One would suppose that conventions, clubs, and societies would talk and work for lit- , tie’else. For, as Mr. Hunter says, “ pov- ; crty Is, to a considerable extent, due to social causes which arc clearly to be seen, and which are possible of remedy." We would suppose, then, that wrongs would bo searched out and remedied at the root. But, alas, instead of this, we find a cold, stubborn opposition.
It Is Impossible In a brief review to give a just impression of the scope and significance of this work. Mr. Hunter's book on " Poverty M is the most impressive and important book of tho year. Every page is crowded with vital matter. There 13 no high coloring; only a plain, quiet statement of tho frightful facts. Tho book should attract National attention It should have a million readers.
