The object of this work is to e*ve a complete and systematic di«oussion of tho theory and practice of locomotive operation. By this is meant the work or results accomplished by a locomotive !n motion, together, with the effect upon itself and the track, and the amoun^ of fuel and water needed to perform such work, rather than an exclusive treatise upon the mere manipulation of the machine, though the latter naturally forma a part of the 'study in connection with the proper manner oi procuring certain results.
Thus G. K. Henderson, M. A., Soc. M. E,, speaks in the preface to his book on " Locomotive Operation.*1 He has also j endeavored to discuss tho various laws of mechanics which govern the subject in a technical and . a practical manner, ■a^^wWie^'formulae aire used lor .the ;benefit^i^thosc~wiio -defiire itojfoliow. en-
