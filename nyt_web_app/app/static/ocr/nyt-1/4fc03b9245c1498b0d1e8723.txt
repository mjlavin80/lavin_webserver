Mi*. Oocher’s History of Capt. Wads* ; worth’s Achievement and the Plot of Sir Edmund Andros.#
tAPT. JAMES WADSWORTH, who “secured the charter ot
Colony lot Connecticut] In a
very troublesome season,'1 according to the official records of the State preserved la the Capitol at Hartford* was a native of that colony, and tlie third child of William Wadsworth and his second wife, Eliza Stone. He was horn to 1C48, and first came into public notice aa one of the freemen of the town of Hertford who joined the forces that fought in the war against the pcquot Indian, King Philip, a war that was little more than a massacre, but that established the power of the English, settlers In Southern Kew England.
Typical Puritan as he was in Ids religions life, Wadsworth had the 1)1 ooa of the fighting Wadsworths of England, who claimed descent from the fabled Duke Wada of Yorkshire in his veins, and was active as an officer of the ** train hands " —organized to protect the settlors from the raids of the Indians—tho military or-gunlzatfons that were the forerunners o[ th* militia, of the colonics that did such valiant and effective work in the War for Independence a century later, anil have been heard from favorably in every tvar since then. In his later years he served as a member of the General Court of the Stale, ’which corresponds to tho Legislatures of to-day. An irascible chap he must have been, judging front the records of his trials before that same court, of which he was a member, unearthed by Mr. Goeher, which tell of his public reprimands by the Governor because of his habit of speaking his mind all too freely on any subject. When the Indian wars were ended and Wadsworth was forced to a peaceful life he took up the study of the law, and was admitted to practice when in his sixty-fourth year. How much of success he achieved the records do not show. Nor is there any record of his death other than that he died in the year 1720. at tlie age of eighty-two. lie is supposed to have been buried in the old cemetery at the corner ol* Main and Gold Streets in Hartford, though there is no record of the interment and his grave is unmarked.
But Hartford and Connecticut will ne\'cr forget the name of Wadsworth. The stately old Wadsworth Athenaeum on the main street of the beautiful capital, where are stored the records Of tho Connecticut Historicn* Society, XncJudi/ig- tho charter that Wadsworth saved from the clutches of Sir Edmund Andros, will prerent oblivion. if nothing; else does. The charter that Wadsworth saved, and under which the colonists of Connecticut lived and >vere governed until ISIS, when the new Constitution was adopted. w;js written on three pieces of parchment and illuminated with a portrait of Charles II.. who granted it. Two of those precious bits of parchment are now in the Wadsworth Atliciw^uni in the original charter box.
The complete duplicate charter that was hidden from Gov. Andros and ids men in the oid Whitfield house at Guilford—the oldest house standing in America—is in the State Library in the Stale Capitol. The first of these was saved in IKE 7 or ISIS by tlie merest chance from tfie Wyl-lirf mansion, near which stood the fiirnous
Charter Oak. This was tho way in which it came to be saved, according to Air, Goeher* s chronicles:

H was so broad that the Duke of Yorlc, who had general sovereignty over all the section north of tho Delaware Capes, was envious of it and tried for many years to sccure it. But the colonists Iield to it through the years of trouble that preceded and followed the Protectorate of Cromwell, well into the reign of James IT. The latter, however, under the influence of powerful friends at Court, made Sir Edmund Andros—who had been deposed as Governor of New York on charges of Irregularities in his accounts— Governor of all of the New England ccl-

It was for this purpose that Sir Edmund went from Boston to Hartford in October, reaching there on the last dny of the month. And this Is Capt. Wadsworth's description of iiU entry into the town, says the author, writing from notes made by Wadsworth and found in an old chest in the house he and his descendants had long occupied, and which still stands in tlie City of Hartford:
Two trumpeters preceded his Excellency, the jangling notes of their horns sounding strangely in the curs of those who had been accustomed to hear nothing but the meeting house bell or tho roll of the drum to herald the arrival of a dignitary or a call to duty. Sir Edmund was mounted on a steel gray horse, whose fine bony head, tapering ears, and crested neck showed that lie carried in his veins the Barb blood which Charles II. and Cromwell hart introduced into England. * *	* Joseph Dudley and John
H'ltz Winthrop, tho latter having joined the party at Norwich, followed tho Governor, and they were in turn followed by William Stoughton. Robert Mason. John Usher, John Pynchon, Bartholomew Gid-ney. Edward Ting, and Secretary John West, all of which preceded iwenty-five or thirty red-coated soldiers nrmcd with small guns and short lances in the tops of them. Sir Edmund Andros turned his horse from the street, and, passing between the trumpeters, who posted them- 1 solves on opposite sides of tho cleared 1 space between the train bands, rode ul- I most to the meeting iiouSO. on tho steps 01 j 1 which Gov. Treat, Deputy Gov. Bishop, | the Assistants, and Deputies were drawn ! up to receive 1dm. As he swung out of the saddle I could have brushed his coat i with my hand, the company of which C . was Lieutenant being close to the build-In g.
I There was a night meeting at the '* Bunch of Grapes" Tavern, at which the colonists pleaded with Sir Edmund to be allowed to retain their charter. Of i them none made so pcrfervld an appeal as did the epileptic, Andrew Lcete,
As Leete uttered tho last words and before any one could reach him, he plunged headlong on the table between the candelabra. ills outstretched arms upsetting both of them. In an instant the room was in darkness, and before the ensuing Confusion subsided, Nathaniel Stanley handed me the charter through the Open window. Slipping the precious parchment under my tunic I rushed down tiie stairs and, opening the door, cautiously stepped into the Jane- * * * i hurried through the lane to the meeting house alloy, down which I ran at full speed until the river was reached, ft took only a few moments to cross it Jn one of tile flat-bottomed boats which were pulled up nn the bunk, and in less than leu minutes after the Charter was taken from the Council chamber, it was back again in the front parlor of Samuel Wyllis's house. * * * After telling her what h:id occurred in the. chamber * * *> phe saM that there was but one thing for me to do, and that was to hide until Sir Edmond and all of his spies had returned to Boston. As for the charter. I could hot t»U0 it with me, and ft could not remain in the house, as a general search might he made for it. so .she said: ** HiJe Tl in the hollow of U10 oak. It will shelter it just as the leaves of the Boscobel oak hid the King who granted it from Cromwell's soldiers." And hide it we did, first wrapping it In my tonic.
This differs rrom most of tho stories of the stealing of the charter from under Sir Edmund's nose, but Mr. Goeher believes it to be as near historically correct as any version of the story can be, and claims to have the record from notes made by one of Wadsworth's descendants n.*» tuken from the lips of the Captain himself.
The Charter Oak. which was destroyed by a windMorni Aug. HI, lNr,!!. was the only tree of tie* sort ih the immediate vicinity, and tradition has It that It was the treaty tree of the Indian tribes of that vicinity; that under its branches Hooker concluded the purchase of the Hartford colony from the Suckiag (Hartford) In-ilta Coder it, too, tho Suckings and Mohawks concluded their treaty of peace after long warring, and all stiles of lands by Indians were perfected under its shelter,	^
A book showing long nml careful historical research, this volume will add much to the lore of the Connecticut colony. for ihe author treats of the story oT the regicides, of the New Haven and other colonies, and includes interesting memoirs of lioger Ludlow, John Hooker, John Winthrop, and others who worked so effectively fur the establishment of the first pure democracy in the Kew World.
