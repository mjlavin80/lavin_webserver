NE of the critics who found thetr Waterloo in Conrad’s books timidly attempted to find fault with his construction. But to the veteran novel reader—and surely it Is only for such he writes—that very elusiveness of construction. that hide-and-seek confusion
of characters, times, and scenes. Is the first charm of hts hooks. To them it la the subtlest a*t, and one of Ills chief means of enchaining attention and whet-' ting appetite, in which he Is past master.
Not a staff critic, but a lady of supposedly trained taste and old culture, ventured to criticise his language. It was very evident, she said, that his English had been acquired in the forecastle. That Is very doubtful, by the way, since nearly all Poles imbibe foreign languages in their early childhood; and wo have Conrad's own word for it that he did so. But let it be: even so, there certainly Is not one word In his books which is not used with the fullest Intention. It rather seems that no one else has so fully proved tho truth of the remark, so often made in various clever forms and of n.ore languages than one, that the English language becomes pliable and beautiful only In the hands of a foreigner, or of one who masters several other languages besides.
The value of the cultured lady's criticism, however, may be best gauged by that of another. She pointed out, with the pride of first discovery, the repetition of a period, word by word, on two successive pages. She had marked them neatly with question or exclamation marks in the margin, in a borrowed book, to immortalize her cleverness. To her it indicated carelessness, like that of the general language. It was in " Children of the Sea_" The pages described the Calm and sunny passage of a ship southward over the Indian Ocoan. Every one knows what that voyage usually is until the Cape is approached. The pages were perfect poetry; the repetition, which seemed unconscious, had the effect of a melodious refrain to a stanza; it impressed one deeply with the evenness and grand monotony of the voyage. It was all to serve as a background to the turbulent doing of the children of the sea next described, in language as vigorous and terse as that of the preceding pages was beautiful and languid.
In " Romance M the critics who had before been driven into the corner, speechless, thought they found their chance to return from St. Helena. But *‘ Romance ” is not Conrad at all; it is Ford M. Hoefer; Conrad merely stepped in to show that even with the conventional novel he could do so much better than all the others. The very name shows the Intention; he is writing of what he has not seen.
But on “ Nostromo ” a criticism may be passed; he trades on his name, and descends to using words for the sake of words; words which say little or nothing. or merely repeat; words to sell. Perhaps as a consequence he becomes over-subtle. However, this may be the critl-cism of anger or exasperation, for even the keenest literary gourmet becomes finally tired of that everlasting stern chase after the vanishing hero. It is well enough to have one's interest again and again aroused and held by ever-new characters and scenes, with only tantalizing glimpses of the promised principal: but by the time one reaches the two hundredth page, the centre of the book* three-quarters through, one is tempted to cry out; “Oh, well, then, keep your Nostromo! Perhaps he isn't such a wonder. after all! " But at each such temptation. every time Nostromo has been ail but forgotten or given up for lost, with consummate skill he is juggled on to the stage again, with a clank of spurs, a dash of a silver-gray mare, a gleam of flashing eyes and teeth, till one is consumed with a desire to know more about him. Ana after all one has to close tho book, the desire but half appeased In the last one hundred pages, with a feminine “ Oh, dear! ” or the masculine equivalent. A recent well-intentioned reviewer reads into the book a great deal that is not there, and says Nostromo, the man and the name, is symbolic. It would then surely be the first time that Conrad set humanity before the man, the individual. It may be humbly supposed that Conrad was himself disappointed when he reached the six hundred and thirty-first page without having been able to make more of this man of all men.
Tike “Lord Jim" as a contrast; that book may have been called *' wordy ” by some, and oversubtie. But what a vast difference from this latest. For there it was his beloved man he was exploring all the time; that inexhaustible mine for research and source for reflection. South American republics, or any political arena, or any combination of human beings, are so obvious and all on the surface to the diligent student. Conrad seems rather to make it his point to show that man is the only thing in the universe which cannot be measured or classified: which is ever new and ever differentiated.
On the other hand, in “ Nostromo" Conrad has made one vigorous step forward; for the first time he has, not only one, but two true and glorious women.
And he seems at last to be wholly in earnest. The latter may be the consequence of the former. The last point given up by the cynic is usually his lack of faith in woman.
Another criticism may be only the criticism of prejudice, or none at all. Con-
