PitzQerald, the Irlsli Rebel.
** Edward and Pamela FitzGerald" is I tho If I lo of il volume compiled by Gerald * Cn.rnplH-11 from the letters of those who know them, In which Is told the “ life story ’* of Hie Irish rebel leader and his wife. Unlike other memoirs of Lord FitzGerald, this is not founrtert in Thomas Moore’s “ Life and Death of Lord Edward FitzGerald," which appeared in 1SJI1. The letters cover in all a period of sixty years —from 1770 to 1831. The object of the first part of Lhe volume is to give a picture of the home life of Lord Edward'3 family, and incidentally portraits of tho frlltrs of the epistles. No attempt lms heen tnndc to Kivc a connculed account of the story of his life. The letters liavo been left to sliow how lie was regarded by those who wrote them and who knew and loved him host.
Mr. Campbell, who is one of Lord FitzGerald’s great-grandchildren, after dealing with the reasons which led his ancestor to adopt tho cause of the revolutionary party and the circumstances of his arrest and death, considers more particularly than has yet been done the history of Lord Kdward’s wife, Pamela, the reputed daughter of the Due d’OrlCana nnd Mmo. de Genlls. Speaking of Lady FitzGerald Mr. Campbell says in his preface:
She has been so often tho object of ill-natured comment on account of supposed Irregularities tn her conduct, besides being a centrc of Interest owing to her reputed relationship to the Due d’Orl&ms and Mme. de Gcnlis, that I wished, as far as was possible, to clear up once for all the two questions which have been connected with her name. Whe problem of her birth remains, perhaps, unsolved, but as far as her personal character is concerned her own letters and those of her husband's family reveal her as a woman of a singularly sweet and lovable and innocent nature, and it is my hope that tho voice of calumny may now cease its attempt to defame her memory. She was the idol of her husband while he lived and of her children after his death. Iiy her numerous 'descendants she is regarded with scarcely less love and reverence than Lord Edward himself.
There are several half-tone and photogravure portraits, including a number of Lady FitzGerald and two of Lord FitzGerald. In an appendix is given a statement by Lady Pamela Campbell, Lady FitzGerald’s daughter, concerning her mother’s parentage. (Octavo, pp. i!T>0; index; uncut: cloth.
