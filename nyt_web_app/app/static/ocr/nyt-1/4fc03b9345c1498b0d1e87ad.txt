A book that will attract much attention this year will be the volume of the correspondence of Henrik Ibsen, which has already appeared in Germany. An English translation will be published in London early in the Spring. and doubtless we shall have it here about the same time. Whatever one may think, of Ibsen’s philosophy and the. possible moral effect of Ibsenism upon the masses, if its influence should ever reach so far, (which is possible.) the Norwegian writer is certainly a commanding figure in the world of letters, and one of the most interesting personalities of the present hour. James Huneker says of him, in a contribution in The Smart Set, from which we fiuote elsewhere this week, that while “ Tolstoy faces the past, Ibsen confronts the future.’* I-Ie is, assuredly, a living force.	.
