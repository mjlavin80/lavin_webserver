No man, -whichever his side of a fence which is reputed no longer to exist, but which somehow still casts a rather substantial sort of shadow, can fail to find much pleasure and satisfaction In contemplating Mr. Lincoln in the angle of view in which Mr. Oberholtzer has chosen to look at him.
The bigness of the man seems not less but greater, 'because the author takes full account of how it grew and of the circumstances which favored the growth,
" He was a man,” writes Mr. Oberholtzer,
** made great by that powerful aid ^to greatness, success, which he hod done
much by personal endeavor, guided by a rare talent and a suitable temperament, to achieve, but which could not have been his were he not favored by the irresistible logic of events and the co-operation of other remarkable minds.” Naturally, being the Kind of book it is, the best part of it is that which deals with the earlier 1 years of Honest Abe—his boyhood, bis young manhood, his time of trying his hand.
For instance, you behold Lincoln a I " grocer" or general storekeeper, his partner one Berry, the stock purchased by grace of promissory notes. Berry was an " idle fellow," who M early displayed a i ruinous fondness for sUong drink, and Lincoln, with head propped up upon a roll of calico prints at full length on the counter, was given to the perusal of Blaekstone and Ohitty. *	*	* Thus it
was that the* business " winked out.’ ’*
Somewhat in the same fashion had Patrick Henry prepared himself for another great career. And if provident persons and moralists are grieved at the picture, most men smile and are pleased, thinking no whit loss of the giants. Earlier he had been a Mississippi Bivor raftsman and had floated down to New Orleans and seen slaves sold at auction. The sight grieved him, but, as Mr. Oberholtzer is at pains to establish, did not make an Abolitionist of him. Now came h/s love affairs, which were unusual to say the least of them. One of them was with a lady no longer young and very plump of figure. Lincoln advised this lady not to marry him, though he said she might if she chose. Mr. Oberholtzer docs not precisely accept Herndon’s account of the Todd affair: how the marriage was first fixed for Jan.
1,	1S41, and how Lincoln's heart failed him at the last moment, and the bride and parson waited in vain. However, Lincoln admitted at the time in writing: “I am now the must miserable man living.“
The author brings out this story in such a way as to invite no blame: rather from the judicious understanding and from all and sundry sympathy.
Naturally a somewhat full account of the famous debates with Stephen A, Douglas is included, and a showing up of the expressions of both on the slavery question. The exposition of where public opinion on the matter of freeing the slaves stood at various stages, anti how carefully Mr. Lincoln kept it in view and never got too far In front of it or behind it in all his career, is one of the most instructive and characteristic features of a volume in which
the author manages as a rule to be aston-fshfngly fair to hoth sides and to get in most cases very close to the truth. There are lapses, of course. Times, too, when in his eagerness to make bold generalizations the author misses things he should have considered. Now and again, for instance. 1}JS rapid account of a battle of the civil war is .sadly misleading. But there nre other times, as in the case of Gettysburg, (very summarily treated.) when the Impressionistic method is singularly satisfactory.
