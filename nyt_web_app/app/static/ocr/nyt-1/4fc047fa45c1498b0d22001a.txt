Lady Ridley in this story deals with the shadow of a very dark deed Involving a question of casuistry tn morals. The heroine has a grandfather who Is a rich paralytic*and incidentally a mfser and a tyrant. The heroine has also a brother whose life is being spoiled by the old man, a brother who is the old man’s lawful heir, i and who if he were freo might expect a happy life and a brilliant career. As it Is the young man is so badgered and humil-lated that it seems likely be may be j driven to drink as his father was before him. The heroine therefore decides that I duty to her brother requires her to kill ! her grandfather. With the aid of cbloro- ! .form she docs kill the old man, and no one suspects foul play. So the brother ,
-	has his chance and improves It The girl goes about with her hoirld secret, and for a time shuns all society, devoting her life utterly to the brother for whom, as she thinks, she has bartered her souL Then the brother marries, and presently ' thereafter appears a man. eager to marry : her. She loves the man—but she is a murderess. What' is she to do about It? Her first impulse is to say no and explain nothing. Her second is to explain everything. Her third is to take the man and keep the secret. We will here deliberately omit to say which one of these courses sho actually takes. There IS, however, another woman in the case—an. Interesting invalid, the wife of a husband who spends most of his time after big game in Asia. This person takes opiates of various kinds, including chloroform. For a time she stays in the same house with the lady who made away with her grandfather, and during that time, with that lady a victim of jealousy, the reader must be In constant fear of another crime. Again it would be inappropriate to declare here if that crime is or is not committed. A state of doubt in the matter is essential to the reader’s proper interest In the problem. Evidently the author intends to give the impression of a strong-minded and sufficient woman .whose motives are of the highest. Perhaps the reader will not find the unselfishness quite convincing.- Some might call her merely unscrupulous in attaining her own ends. The final impression is that, while the sin carried its punishment, the mltl-g-atins' circumstances of the case were taken into consideration by the relentless fates as they probably would not have been by even the most charitable Board of Pardons. But the board’s harness would proceed from the theory that the murder of a grandfather by a granddaughter counts as "unnatural crime” whether the conduct of the grandfather I toward the crandchild has been ** natu«
' ral" or not. Theologically, of counse, there is no defense. The book is interest*
ing in a dismal way. The odor of chloroform pervades it and hangs heavy on every page.
