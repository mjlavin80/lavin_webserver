Mr, Cook’s volume on Switzerland is copiously illustrated with half-tones in various tints. There are pictures of the people, the Castle of Chillon, Mont Blanc, and Chamounix, the Jungfrau, Bern, the lion of Lucerne, tlie Spaler Thor in Basle, the tomb of Marshal Saxo In Strassburg, a statue of Wilhelm Tell, Beethoven’s house in Bonn, the “ Convcrsationshaus •* in Baden-Baden, the Mouse Tower in Bingen, the old canal In Ulrechi, and others.
The author has divided the volume into six chapters—Western Switzerland, East-'" ern Switzerland, tho Upper Rhine, tho Middle Rhine, and Main, the great Rhine gorge, and the Lower Rhine, lie has here attempted to do for Switzerland what lie has already done for America, England, and Franco, by emphasizing with personal impressions those points of human interest which usually receive mere perfunctory notice In the guide books. He opens with a rapid survey of the history of the Swiss Confederation, followed by descriptions of the Lake of Geneva, Lausanne, Vcvey, and Montreux. Coming next to the Castle of Chillon, the reputation of which Inspired Lord Byron's “Prisoner of Chillon,” tho author writes:
No place has more doleful legends than Chillon. The “ potence,’* bleak with age, is shown, where tho prisoners were hung; there is a hole in the wall whenco their bodies were cast into the lake; a torture chamber, with a wooderf'pillar to which they were fastened and seared by hot Irons; an •* oubliette," having a trap door shutting out the light, beneath which were three steps downward, hut no fourth step, and the victim fell eighty feet upon sharp knives. Such Is ancient and forbidding Chillon.
