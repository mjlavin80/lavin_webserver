“ Klements of Mechanical Drawing.'* by-Gardner C- Anthony, takes the pupil in hand before he has seen a single instrument, and in 132 pages teaches him to make full-sized sectional drawings of a complete commutator from a rough working sketch jotted down free hand. Tl*e author is Professor of Drawing in Tufts College and Dean of the Department of Engineering; his textbook, first issued ten years ago as a strictly elemental
work, la now revised and changed for
use In evening drawing schools and t^oh-nical colleges. The first chapter tclis just what tools to get: pencils, drawing-board, T-square, triangles. &e., and just how to use and not to use each. Thu next gives a short description of the art of lettering, with many examples. Then follow chapters on geometrical problems, conic sections, orthographic projection, and Isomctric or oblique projection, the development and intersection of surfaces, and the drawing of spiral3, screw-threads, &c. The last chapter contains problems and their lay-outs. The numerous Illustrations and ; the clearness of the text make this a most useful work
for self-'help, although It Is written for study under a teacher. (Boston: ■ D. Heath. Technical Drawing Series.) ■
