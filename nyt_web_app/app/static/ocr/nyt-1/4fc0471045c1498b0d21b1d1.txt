'Alisa Sarah 'Warner Brooks, author of “ My Fire Opal,’' “ Poverty Knob," &<»., writes in her new book, “ A Garden with House Attached." in a semi-practical, semi-meditative manner in regard to tlio , comforts and enjoyments of n small coun-| try home. (Square 8vo. Pp. 115. iUustrat-cd. Cloth. Boston: Richard G. Badger. $l.r>0.) The garden she writes about la in Cambridge, and for nearly twenty year** was the property of one who had in the Harvard Botanical Garden “a friend at Court" and was able thus to obtain choice shrubs and herbaceous plants. The author describes the rose, foxglove, iris j Canterbury bells, violets,, hollyhock, and other plants in this garden. She portrays a *• Spanish ’* garuen she lias in her J " mind’s eye."

"Simples," as these herbs were then called, *	*	• were
even in our own generation zoalousiv gathered by our grandmothers. and I well remember the lime when to be without dried herbs—bonesot. hoarhound worm-i wood, motherwort. calnJp. nml kcnikm— was to be shiftless indeed. In laying out this imaginary garden plot I have covered a good hair acre of rich soil, which I have in fancy divided into pretty beds of various size and shape, with neat intersecting gravel walks There I have sown or planted such-herbs as once hung in generous bunches, drying leisurelv, Jn all respectable garrets, when such' minor ailments as " flesh is heir to *’ were cured on the spot.
And she proceeds lo tell what she knows or the herbs to which she refers. Here and then- are citations from classics, and a number of illustrations in half-tone from photographs have been provided.
