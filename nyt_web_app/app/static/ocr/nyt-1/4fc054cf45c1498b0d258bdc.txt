Two movements of public sentiment
with reference to the relief of poverty and its accompanying suffering and evils are pretty plain in modern times. One is a decided growth of the tendency toward sympathy with the sufferers; the other is the development of a feeling tliat relief can and should he given in a manner to prevent injury to those relieved and to the permanent interests of society. Hence arises the conscious need of what may be called
a science of relief, a body of generalizations worked out from Intelligent study and adequate observation and, as in any other science, modified with the increase of knowledge.
It is to the gradual attainment of such a science that we must- regard the new work of Dr. Edward T. Devine, General Secretary of the Charities Organization Society of the City of New York, as a valuable contribution- Dr. Devine would be the last to assume that he had said the last word on 14 The Principles of Relief" which form the subject of his work; the spirit of it is wholly opposed to any such narrowness; but unquestionably it is the latest and one of the most instruct- * ive and helpful statements of such *' principles ” as can now be formulated. A single passage in the introductory chapter indicates fairly clearly the general aim of the author. He says;
As soon as the need of preventing disease becomes paramount to the ducy of nursing an Individual sick person: as soon as the possibility is recognized that, by preventable sickness, by unsanitary housing, by avoidable accidents, by premature death, by industrial distress, or by any other cause, wholly 01* partly social in character, families may become dependent, ;t becomes of vital social concern to examine all such causes of dependence and to devise such systems of relief, of alleviation, and of cure as may be found practicable and desirable.
The practicable alleviation and cure of dependence, that is the problem. The old notion of mere giving cannot solve it. The notion that things will work out, 011 the whole, for the best if let alone, and that the fittest will survive if the loss fit are allowed to drop out is still further from meeting the case. Mere giving may and often does tend toward increasing dependence. Letting things alone indirectly has the same effect. The less fit do not drop out. They live along, in most cases in a manner that menaces the health, the order, and the decency of society, They tend frequently Jo become criminals, and they produce offspring at rather more than the normal rate, who in their turn continue and spread the subtle infection. Dr. Devine points cut that undoubtedly the organization ond industrial methods of modem society do in some degree produce dependence, quite unj>reventable by the victims, and though that tendency may not be as great as it was formerly, it exists, and it is the duty and the interest of society to provide that such dependence—as well as all dependence—shall be cured as far as may be.
TVhat constitutes dependence? That is, of cours?, a difficult and delicate question which cannot definitely receive an answer good for all places or all times. Broadly, Dr. Devine, as we gather, regards it as inability to maintain the standard of living of the com-
munity, the minimum for aelf-support-ing families. This standard Is fixed ultimately by public opinion, which Is sometimes expressed Jn .legislation. In : the large cities, for Instance, tlie law requires that every family shall have a certain amount of cubic space In Its dwelling, certain provision for light and air and water, certain quality in food, and that its clotliinsr shall he manufactured under certain requirements. In effect, therefore, tlie law In some degree actually fixes the cost of housing, feeding, and clothing a family, fixes, that is, the minimum standard of living as to Uie three most important elements of family expend!-ture. The unchangeable sentiment of 1 the poorest class that can be called self-supporting fixes the standard as to other things—decent burial, for example, Now, the purpose of scientific— which simply means intelligent—relief for those who cannot maintain this standard is to prevent avoidable causes of dependence, to help those temporarily dependent to regain independence, and to care for those hopelessly dependent in a way to save society from harm. Dr. Devine brings lo the discussion of this work very wide experience and observation, cool judgment with warm sympathies, an admirable faculty for clear statement. The “ principles ” formulated are Illustrated by numerous specific actual eases. The book is indispensable to any one who desires to know what is doing apd can and ought to be done in
the field of which It treats.
