British Poets.
Prof. Curtis Hidden Page has chosen from all the British poets of the nineteenth century selections from Wordsworth, Coleridge, Scott, Byron, Shelley, Keats, Landor, Tennyson, Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning, Clough, Arnold, Rossetti, Morris, and Swinburne for his volume on "British Poets of the Nineteenth Century.” (Octavo. Pp. IMO. Cloth. New York:	Benjamin	H. San- ,
born & Co.).
The selections are very full, and for the most part complete poems. They are designed to give the best of each poet's
work and to give some representation of each important period and class of his work. Long poems are usually given entire. Among these are Byron’s "Manfred,” Shelley’s "Prometheus Unbound," Scott’s "Marmion,” Coleridge's “Ancient Mariner," etc. Prof, Page has selected such poems as would be prescribed for a college student. The amount of space given to an author, he points out In his preface, does not necessarily correspond with his relative Importance or rank as a poet. He lias selected 100 poems from Wordsworth, 100 from Robert Browning, 3S from Byron; Rossetti, Tennyson and Landor are each represented by poems numbering between SO and 00; while the' others are not given so much space.
