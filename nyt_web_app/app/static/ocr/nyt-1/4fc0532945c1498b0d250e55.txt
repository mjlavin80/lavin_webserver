** Captain Amyas."
A>to York Times Book Review:
Your criticism upon “ Captain Amyas *’ Is true from an Amorlcan point of view. The last few lines in your article I must beg- to have tho privilege of discussing with you.
Tho three books written by Dolfo Wyl-larde are evidently all written for a purpose, which is to bring into evidence or to show up the immoralities and frivolities
of the English men and women who live
In Africa and India. The ecene Is set in
Africa, but In India it Is the same. Tlieso books were intended for the unsophisticated English parents who send their daughters to Africa or India to find husbands, possibly chaperoned by a self-absorbed brother, as in “ Tho Story of Eden," or a stupid father places a young girl under tlie care of a Captain, as in " Captain Amyas." Tho young woman may or may not secure a husband; she most likely finds a lover; she sees the young married women childless, or mothers with nothing to do, their children having been sent home. Tlie cllmato In too warm for hc.tllhy exrrLion, nnd ^hey amuse themselves with risky flirtations with subalterns, spending hours alone in bachelors* bungalows.
Young wives, members, perhaps, of families of six or seven girls' are married to get rid of them to men-they care little for. When circumstances throws some one else in their path in a country where life Is so d£ciass£ and without restraint, the husband is sacrificed as in the “ Rat Trap.” The English edition is “Uriah the Hittite." which is a better name— ami which book is defended from being
published in the United States.
These novels were not written for the
American woman to read—from its moral point of view she does not need them. She has not the temperament of the European; she can stand alone and take care of herself. No one, unless he has taken these long ocean voyages, as I have done, can know how good a picture the life on board of Captain Amyas’s boat is.
The book is vulgar, but the English people call “ a spade a spade." The writing of it is not to be deemed “ powers gone astray.” It is said that the possession of India and Africa is a groat opening for the unemployed Englishman —and a ruination to the young English men and women.
eio one living in the atmosphere of tho United States can comprehend it. Happily not.	MRS. C. A. MARKHAM.
