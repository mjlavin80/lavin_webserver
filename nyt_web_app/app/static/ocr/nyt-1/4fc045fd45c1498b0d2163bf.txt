nnd revised edition of “ Poet's Walk: An j Introduction to English Poetry,” chosen and arranged by Mowbray Morris; " Lon- J don Lyrics," by Frederick Locker Lamp-son. with an introduction and notes by I Austin Dobson, and the " Poems of Christina Rossetti,” chosen and edited by William M. Rossetti.
The present issue of “ London Lyrics "
\ is based upon the twelfth edition pub- 1 lished in England, It is printed from a J copy in which tho author had made some later corrections. Mr. Dobson says of The poet:
He was too careful of brevity to ho ever wearisome; and of flatness or obscurity
he may assuredly be acquitted. As a metrist he is uniformly neat and polished. He can be charmingly playful; he can be tender; he can be archly gallant. His manner is clear, direct, and simple; his wit as lively as his irony is delicate, and his humor seldom without its touch of sadness. The mingling of mirth and pity, Indeed, he claims as part of his equipment.	—»
The new collcction of Christina Rossetti's poems in this series is said by the editor to contain her best pieces. They include ** Goblin Market/' " Monna Inno-minata," a number of devotional poems,
“ The Prince’s Progress,*' &c. Mr. Rossetti says of his sister’s work:
My own view is that Christina ha* fully as true a poetic vocation as Dante Gabriel, and wrote poetry, which though far more restricted in scope, and more of a monotone in method, was, according to its own showing, by no means inferior to hjs. Restricted though its scope, the pitch of her verse is high, owing to the intensely devotional quality of her spirit; her main concern is eternity, or time as related to eternity, * * * They were both original, in tho sense that neither of them took any particular predecessor as a model of style or a preceptor in development. For limpid freshness of feel- I ing Christina stands the higher; for depth of feeling she cannot be called the lower, I though she is less obviously passion- ! wrung in the stress and coil of circumstances.
