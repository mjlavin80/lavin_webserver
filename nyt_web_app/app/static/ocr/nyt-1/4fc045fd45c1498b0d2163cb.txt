It is a very English story of a very English rat intended primarily for English children and supposed to be told by
ihe ml khtts6lf. Doubtless, however. American children also may read it with
pleasure and take delight in the pictures —though these, too, are very English looking. Master Rat, arrived at the hoary age of three years, and the hero of adventures which have cost him half his tail and one forepaw, sits down to be^an autobiographer, to speak of his youth, of the horrid time when the Weasel slew his mother and sucked her blood, of his early days of orphanage, of his several matrimonial venture-**— some of these verging upon the scandalous—of the charms and tempers of bis various wives, and of the tragic ends of some of them. He tells of hfs life in English cornfields, by Snglish rivers, in English mills and farm, houses, and expresses freely his opinion of boys, dogs, ferrets, and women. He acknowledges that he prefers, for his part, to live in a house where a woman is mistress; for these petticoated creatures, he avers,
arc apt to be either kind-hearted or timid, and 50 allow rats liberties which men and hoys wil not permit, Of all places of residence, however, he prefers a pig pen,
farther, the old rounder discourses upon
traps and shows much learning on the subject of such engines of destruction. " Store traps,'1 devised by ingenious commercial persons and made and sold in j wholesale lots he regards as beneath the ! contempt of a well-regulated rat of the j world. The things catch, says he only very young rats, or rats in their | dotage, or rats hopelessly silly for some other reason. For home-made traps he professes respect, and describes a number of such contrivances which he has met with in his travels to the imminent danger of his neck. Very insidious are things with holes hacked in the semblance of the gnawings of te-th, little machines made with a hazel wand, a bit of stick and a bit of wire, by some cunning person who has remembered to | rub his hands in the dirt and so disguise and dim the offensive man'smell. Once ! Mr. Bat saw no less than fifteen of his | boon companions hung high as Haman in a single night by the contrivance with j hazel wands. It was only by sheer luck that he himself escaped. The auto biographer is not himself a traveled person* age, but he tells you second-hand the I story of a friend of his, a city rat, born and bred in ths sewers of London; bow
this adventurous felJow went aboard a
ship in the Thames, \*islted the Par/s sewers; upon another voyage went to Cork, upon another to America, suffered
shipwreck even. This globe-trotter preferred. says his friend, the easy-going ways of tramps and sailing ships to the splck-and-spanness of great liners. Once upon a liner he was nearly starved.
So the story goes, with departures into the ethics of ratkind, including especially cynical remarks on the extreme convenience of not being obliged or expected to love your relatives or to prefer the safety and comfort of others to your own. The rule is every rat for himself and the safest hole for the foremost.
