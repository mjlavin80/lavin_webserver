List’s “ Political Economy.”
Owing to the interest aroused by the fiscal controversy in England, demands have been made for Frederick List's ** Political Economy." A new edition of the bools is now being: sent out by Longmans, Green & Co. The first edition appeared in Philadelphia in 1827. List was born in 1780 in Wiirtemburg, and when quite young became Professor of Political Economy in TUbingen. whore he formulated the plans for commercial union which led to his expulsion from Germany. After wandering about for some time he was urged by Lafayette to visit the United States, where he soon became the friend of James Madison. Andrew Jackson, Henry Clay, and others. He returned to Europe as American Consul at Leipsic, and remained there some years. While
in Augsburg he rewrote his ** Political Economy." It was immediately attacked, and caused violent discussion, but was translated into many languages. The principal objection to it was that the system it propounded was not one for the benefit of the whole world, but for “Germany alone, which List did not seek to deny.
