Some history, more genealogy, anti a modicum of biography well served by the compiler of the neatly printed volume, make an interesting story of the still quaint and nUher Dutch litlc city on tllu Mohawk, which now lias large manufacturing interests. Seen from the car wimlows of the ICew York CVntral, Sche-
necUuly is commonplace. From the vcr-du re-clad hills and the rich meadow Jand.s 1 of the beautiful Mohawk Valley about whit'h ore still scattered tlie Dutch manor ! houses built a century or more aero, it is 1 one of Kcw York's most charming cities. And it lias history; plenty cf it. Pounded by a lot of .Dutchmen from Albany who revolted against the trade monopoly of the Dutch West India Company, it was a centre of trntfn activities iso years ag-o. it was here that the canal system of the State was instituted by tlie traders! who wanted to get to the Albany market. It was from hern that the first train was rnn over tho primitive Mohawk and Hudson Railroad, the first link of what is now the New York Central Railway system. It was here that the possibilities of railroading in this country were first agitated by Gcorse W, Fcatftcrs-.onfmug'ij, and accepted a dozen years later by ' Stephen Van Rensselaer, who furnished the capital for tho accomplishment of the enterprise. The story of the struggles and final triumph of Mr, Foatherston-haugh makes one of the most interesting of the chapters of the volume, even though it has nothing particularly new to add to railroad history.
Schenectady means, according to th® researches of this writer, " beyond tho pine plains ’’—which separated it from Albany—rather than the more poetic ** without the door," which was supposed to be the Indian way of locati^jr the settlement, as being just outside the limits of the Mohican Indian reservation. Whatever its meaning:, it was the scene of a terrible massacre by Indians and French from Montreal in 1690, the result of a religious war between Jesuit and Protestant missionaries over their respective rights to ** convert ” the Indians, in which of the 400 settlers were killed and 30 made prisoners, while every house in the village except two was burned. There is a legend of another religious war with less murderous effects, when a century later the' Presbyterians were barred from worshipping in the St. George Church, which they
had jointly built with the Kpiscopallans, of which the author tells quaintly.
Tlie book bristles with anecdote, reminiscence, and tradition of the families of Glgn-Sanders, Duane, Featherstonhaugh, North, Toll, Vrooman, Sclicrmerhom, and others whose names still count for much in the Mohawk Valley. There are illustrations of the old homes of these families aa well, including tlmt of the Sclier-merhorns, which still remains a Scher-merhorn property and Inhabited by a Sehermerhorn after more than 200 years, and which, the author believes, is a unique record for this section.
