“ Do	you	not see then.*1 says	this au-
thor. •• that i*:»i*h snnl. however mistaken, is nevertlii'lt'ss striving truly, from its centre oi' good to a circumference, an outer condition of desired good? Its im thods are wrong. nnd it is floundering j along dark and devious pathways, but its K‘*al is suro as its centre is steadfast.** Kvi'ti the murder of a friend proceeds, Mr, l'attirson continues, from a misdirected good impulse. In other words, lit* sets out that thn good is in man as life in t he seed and must grow, though outward conditions destroy its beauty. And it is the saint* impulse which leads to actions which the outside world culls good or evil according to circumstances. The author jtlaces man on successive pianos and treats of him as he works upon each. There is the natural man ** who is doing right when he follows his physical impulses, there is the " rational man *’ who is doing right when ho follows his reason, there is the "psychic man" who. has attained control over still higher faculties, and has by tluit means more complete J control of both mind and body— ! even his health is his own to give as he j will. This, of course, (though Mr. Pat- j terson makes no mention of it by that name.) is t lie stage of the Oriental i ** Yogi." Proper breathing seems to be tho secret:	but	breathing not according
to a reasoned plan, but as the expres-j sion of an inward harmony with things.
■	"It ts nothing more or less than the breath of the Spirit that we must inhale, nnd when we have learned to receive the lloly Spirit, (the whole breath.Mhe complete life of love, we will give it forth I again in perfect vibration throughout our whole being and activity." And so on. Then comes something still higher, the ** spiritual man." and the second half of the book is devoted to the consideration 1 of Jesus of Nazareth as the " measure , of a man.” the pattern of what a man I can becomfi and must become. In the j author's conception Jesus is only man i with His full powers developed, and each ! man is a. Christ in embryo. Such, at least, seems to be the doctrine, which, as is usual with such doctrines, is set forth in highly figurative lanp-uage and avoids j definitions in the plain words of the i people.
