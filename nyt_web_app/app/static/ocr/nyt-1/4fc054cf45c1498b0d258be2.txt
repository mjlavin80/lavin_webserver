Yet, after all, thcro are many perfectly Intelligent persons who, through unavoidable defects either In taste or education, have nothing of the sort. I do not know whether Mr. Donald skies with the majority In preferring ‘upon the whole slovenly writing. For Writing seems to be the only art In which Immediate success Is .quite independent o£ whether the work done be good or bad. We do not, for example, commend a^painter for slapping paint upon his canvas haphazard, whereas we very often praise an author for ** manly, straightforward writing,” which is usually a synonym for a precisely similar botchery. Possibly Mr. Donald has that tnste for u manly, straightforward writing "—seen at its perfection in the " Kick Carter" Series—which is shared by so many excellent people. I express no opinion as to this, as I have no opportunity of forming an opinion. But in any event I can scarcely bellevo him to be serious in his expressed wish to exclude all disagreeable people from fiction. Even the classic simplicity of diction that characterizes the detective story is occasionally devoted to the villain’s exploits. And to rule out from library shelves each and every book that contains an unpleasant character would necessitate a rather drastic overhauling of English literature. Shakespeare of course would have to go, whereas Hilton, who actually wrote of tlie devil, would be burned, I suppose, by the hangman. There is entertaining work for the imagination in conceiving all literature Bowdlerized upon this basis.

Since Mr. Acheson has set the example
I likewise venture to differ with Air. Thomas AV, Donald in his opinion of “The Eagle’s Shadow." Jfe asks what conceivable pleasure can be derived from reading this particular book. The answer is simple.* If you have any ear for the niceties of prose, if your notions as to what constitutes good prose are somewhat more exacting than those of M. Jourduin, it* in a word you so far differ from the average novel reader as to prefer well-written books to badly written books—why. in that case, you will find ** The Eagle’s Shadow *’ both a surprise and a delight. Viewed purely and simply from a stylistic standpoint the book is a little miracle, crammed to overflowing with examples of tlie euriosa felieitas of diction. Viewed as prose, quite irrespective of tlio story, the book is a notable
achievement. And in that it comes unheralded it is doubly notable and at least triply welcome.
At the risk of being blue penciled I cite an example: “They came presently with desultory chat to :i meadow bravely dcelied in all tlie gauds of Sprins. About
: them the day was clear, the air bland.
I Spring had revamped her ageless fripperies of tender leaves and birdcrios and sweet, warm odors for the adornment of this meadow; above it she had set a turkis sky splashed hero and there with little clouds that were like whipped cream; and upon it slio ha.d scnttercd
largesse, a Damic's shower of buttercups. And about them the shadow of the maple leaves made a little island of sombre green around which more vivid grasses rippled and dimpled under the fitful Spring breezes. And everywhere leaves lisped to one another and birds shrilled insistently,*'
You cannot find a flaw In that, you cannot even suggest an improvement. And it is only a sample. Passage after passage, page after page, you come upon these bits of impeccable writing. At times the diction is almost too ingenious, almost too preclose, but always It Is splendid, always finished ad unguem. And at times you run across passages that scarcely forward the tale’s action, that are merely fantastic Interludes done from tho author’s sheer love for juggling words. For example. I might cite the chapter relating to the contents of Margaret’s wardrobe or that containing Kennarton’s
