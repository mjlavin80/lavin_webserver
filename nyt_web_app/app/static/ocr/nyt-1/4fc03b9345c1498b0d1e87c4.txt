** The Boys’ Own Book.*'
I.
New York Times Bool: Review:
The "Boys’ Own Book," fifth edition, revised, 1881, referred to by Mr. James Chittick in the last number of The Book Review, is possibly a. reprint of some old plates. On my desk I have a copy of "The Boys' Own Book; A Complete Encyclopedia of All tlie Diversions, Athletic, Scientific, and Recreative, of Boyhood and Youth. Sixth American Edition. Bos- 1 ton: Monroe & Francis; New York: Charles S. Francis. 183S." It tells about games with marbles, tops, balls, (among the last—" Goff or Bandy-ball,”) 41 lofty leap-frog,” and other ** Miscellaneous Sports/* It also has articles on the deaf
and dumb alphabet, archery, cricket, gymnastics, swimming, arithmetical amusements, optical amusements, chemical .amusements, draughts, or checkers,” legerdemain, tricks with cards, cn the care of rabbits, guinea pigs, and pigeons, on fencing, gives charades, conundrums, paradoxes and puzzles, and also ccntains directions how to make an neo-lian harp, harlequin inks. &c., and explains the automaton chess player and other automata. The book Is thickly in-j terspersed with wood cuts, and each di-I vision of the book Is prefaced with a few old-fashioned words to tho young reader, beginning with what Is probably “ original verse,*’ A quaint old hook; I should be glad to hear if any of your readers know when the five editions earlier than mine were published.
