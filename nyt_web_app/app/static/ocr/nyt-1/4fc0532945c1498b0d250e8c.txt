1 am afraid Mr. Ashby will have to consult tlie files of the contemporaneous London newspapers for particulars of this worthy. Immediately after the return of the survivors of Waterloo, the press, such as it was, teemed with accounts of those episodes which, acted by the rank anti file, are not given in detail by historians of former times. Shaw was, from his bodily eminence and skill in boxing and swordplay, as welt as tlie fine carriage of the Guards, kept up by regimental pride and drill, (ladies of tho aristocracy take lessons in walking from Drill Sergeants in London,) the typical gladiator or an age when the King, George IV., favored corporeal excellences. ■ Shaw went with the brigade of the royal household troops to the overthrow of Napoleon. Waterloo, in spite of the great steadiness of both tho French footguards and the English infantry, was quite a cavalryists* battle. Though Napoleon was an artillerist officer by profession, he handled centaurs by full sense of their value as a sort of thunderbolt. So at his defeat, cuiras- 1 siers, heavy dragoons and light horse I were matched against the English, Bruns-wickers and Bluchcr’s hussars with incidents like ancient actions. What fire they had to ride into may be judged from the fact that Marshal Key, an infantry commander, had five horses shot urnler him. AVhen ** Night and Blueher came,” with Grouchy a bad third. Napoleon, his right wing annihilated, had to execute the desperate evolution of facing front under fire to oppose the French and British. Belgians and Germans: the British cavalry, released on their left, followed tip the shock given the French at Belle Alliance by the Knglish artillery.

Caesar topping the hecatomb under which was buried Shaw would have been a fitting touch to the story: So you will untlerstiind thut. if you break the ice-
