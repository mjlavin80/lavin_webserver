John Mortey. since his return to England, has been prophesying a Byron revival: He was talking :it the* ^opening of a new Carnegie library, in one of the outlying boroughs of London, on the educational value of books, which he held might be overestimated, (for there are other important educational elements and agencies,) and he remarked that poetry, while the taste for it was not inherited by nil, was needful to a complete existence. Then he recommended Byron to the beginner in poetry, and declared that " when democracy extends its reading, and applies itself for inspiration to poetry. Byron will once more have his day." Daring, energy, and the historic sense are the attributes of Byron's poetry, which, Mr. Morley thinks, ought to commend it to the multitude. Early in the nineteenth century, he said, Byron " was the great central inspiring force of democracy on the Continent of Europe.*' A revival of interest in Byron would really be an encouraging sign, and democracy Is certainly beginning to “ extend its reading."
