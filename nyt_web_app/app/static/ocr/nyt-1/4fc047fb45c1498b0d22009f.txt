“ Economic Principles."
Prof. A. W. Flux's volume on ” Eeo- ; I nomle Print-ipU-s," which is about Vo be ; j broug-lit out hero by 1C. P. Dutton & Co., 1 contains very few references to the writers who have built up the i henries of econom- , ics und given them I lie form which renders them useful in undet-shm'linf? modern economic /arts. The author's object in j omitting these references, he points out in j his prefatory note. has been “not merely to ;jvni(i introducing controversies which e:m im!y interest inoiv advanced students ! than tl use for whom he writes, but nUo i to retain a freedom of expression." In : the table of contents, at the head of a , summary of each ch.ipter, nre given a few | references for those who wish to pursue \ tlie study of tho subject. The study nf economics is defined tn the introductory
amount of the gratifications it eould procure. The nature of the environment, the extent of the equipment of tools, the skill anti intc-1 lisente with -which the work is pl:i lined and executed are obviously uf primary Importance in the one as in the other c:i«e.
In brief, we study tie-* complex organization oT communities, the sources of their wealth, the shares claimable by their members, nnd the idlocntinn of tasks to individuals which result from tlv* choice of occupation freely exorcised under tho stimulus "f the rewards obtainable.
