Henry Shorthouse, author* of “John Inglcsant,'' The one woman In the gallery is Anna Swanwiek, of whom Professor I-Cniglit is intensely appreciative. “Retrospects" is, on the whole, too much involved In the academic and professionally literary point of view to inspire such interest as a more human account of the same people must needs call forth.

Prof. Knight, in these essays—if essays they may be called—professes merely to add to fuller and more formal accounts of his literary contemporaries odds and ends of which he has had personal knowledge. These reminiscences ha has In most Instances supplemented with letters from the famous ones to himself—these letters in the main, though hitherto unpublished, of very trivial importance—notes of thanks, notes declining invitations, notes acknowledging receipt of books, notes of purely academic interest. Prof. Knight begins with Carlyle, whom he met forty years ago and more at Linlatlien House in Forfarshire, where both were guests of Thomas Erskine, and where later the author met many other lights—Maurice Kingsley, Arthur Stanley, and Mcl4eod Campbell. ^ Prof. Knight tells also of evenings spent with Carlyle nt his house In Cheyne Road, Chelsea, “when the inspired mood was his," and “he used to discourse at large, his facc—with the small red apple in the cheek, which remained rosy till his latest year—becoming more eloquently expressive as the monologue went on; and his words sometimes as musical ‘as tho voice of many waters.* ” The professor wishes he had been able to take stenographic notes of those talks, but that no man might venture. He adds that Dean Stanly once reproduced from memory a conversation with Carlyle, the manuscript of which extended over more than forty pages of the Dean’s notebook. This “reproduced the Socratie talker in so realistic a fashion that it is a great loss to posterity that the manuscript has disappeared.*' It is curious to observe that only one bit is recorded here of Mrs. Carlyle. That is a plain, ordinary, womanlike remark; and for the rest, though nothing very new about the sage may be found in what Prof. Knight says, the veteran’s recollections In this instance will be found readable enough.
In the paper on Tennyson are printed
critical conversations between the professor and the poet in which the professor's part is quite as carefully rendered as the poet’s; accounts also of the life at Farringford and the way Tennyson read aloud to guests and neighbors assembled of an evening. It Is noted, too, that Tennyson was very anxious to have Sir Henry Irving explain to him why his “Eecket” and “Harold1* had not been successful as acting plays. Of Browning, the author says “he w\s one of the most delightful of human beings; more so, per-| haps, than any of his contemporaries. I never beard him utter a morose word or assume an unsympathetic attitude toward other men of genius." This by way of contrast with Carlyle. Especial note Is made In this connection of Browning’s, admiration for his wife as a poet—admiration expressed in a conversation with the author held shortly after Elizabeth Barrett’s death. However, much of this particular paper la take up with a correspondence between Prof. Knight and Browning, the subject of which Is the Rectorship of St. Andrew’s University, an honor which the students sought over and over again to bestow upon the poet, but which, in spite of Prof. Knight’s mediations, was always declined.
Not much Is said about Matthew Arnold and most of the matter under his name consists of correspondence between Arnold and Prof. Knight about the latter’s volume of "Selections from Wordsworth'* and about the Wordsworth— Society. Even leas extended is what is said of Mr. Gladstone—some unimportant notes •of the statesman filling much of the space on the five pages devoted to him. *
A long paper on Dean Stanley is supplemented by the Dean's address at Dundee In April, 1875, printed in full, the subject being “The Mutual Relations of Religion, . Science, and Literature-” Of
Stanley, Professor Knight says: "Theologically and ecclesiastically he was perhaps the widest minded man of his age.” Another long paper deals with James t&Tartineau,'; much of the. content bearIng upon troubles with his ecclesiastical governing body, into which expressions
