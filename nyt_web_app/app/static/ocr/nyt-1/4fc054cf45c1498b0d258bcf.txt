'l'lic Rev. John White Chadwick
A'cir York Times Book Itcriar:
Attention has boon called in these columns to two of the poems written by the lati* John AW Chadwick. The hymn “ To the Departed *’ Is widely known, and of it Dr. Collycr prophesied that it would trc sun# a thousand years; from now.
It may be that Mr. Chadwick's poems, essays, and biographies are destined to live longer than his sermons, but his work as a preacher should not be underestimated by those who admire tlie other products of that noble* mind.
His versatility was reflected in his sermons- No one but il poet could have given them their distinctive literary charm. They embody his love of science,
biography, and history. An Insatiable reader, it was his pleasure to share the best thought of what he read with his
Ijork Sintra
congregation. Biographies and scientific works wore among the books which gave him many texts; and a few others of lighter character gave the name to the pennon, such as "In His Steps” and “ The Iteign of Law."'
Tho number of those who gathered in tlie little ehurc hto hear him preach was Mnnil compared to that larger congregation in all parts of the country who read his printed sermons. They are sermons to he read und re-read.
l’crsons who ask if the T'nitarian faith is not cold und vague may find in them i>n answer. What could he more definite than the conclusions based on hij careful reasoning; his'denunciation of superstitions, old or new: and his knowledge of what Uniturianism has accomplished for tii»* liberalizing of religious thought? He was not an emotional preacher, but appealed irresistibly to the best in the human heart—the love of nature, of truth and right; tlie love of brotherhood and of (.’hristlike character.
At liis funeral the Rev. Mr. Wright said that now is the time not for valedictory but salutation—for a b»*tt»^r appreciation of Ins thought. Now is the time certainly for the better knowledge of l.'nitarianism which may be found in his sermons. The very titles promise inspiration—*' Life’s Constant CJoorl,” " The M-tentire Soul,” “God’s Love in Man's," are a few of them.
His^ sermon " The Interpretation of Life,” recently published, closes with the following paragraph:
The last word lias not been spoken concerning _t he interpretation of life until wc
*X°	the	secret	of the Lord is
WJth them that love Him. *' Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.”
11	is the life grounded in reality that arrives at the reality of tilings, that sees tilings as th«y are, knows them for what they are worth, amid the thunderous roar and crash that smite deafeningly for
<n-Y; :,Ild for	also,)	hears	a
still small voice, an angel song, and Knows ihat there is “perfect peace subsisting at the heart of endless agitation.” The good life is made aware of the good world the ~ood God. He will keep them Jr perfect peace whose hearts are stayed on Him.
