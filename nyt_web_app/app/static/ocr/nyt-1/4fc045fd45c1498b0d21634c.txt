LITERATURE OF YOUTH.
PROF. ARTHUR TILLEY'S HISTORY OF THE BOOKS AND AUTHORS OF THE FRENCH RENAISSANCE — RABELAIS, RONSARD, AND MONTAIGNE.*
Written for The New York Times Book Review by
CHRISTIAN GAUSS.
CASUAL mention of certain creat names, Rabelais, Ron sard, and Montaigne, for instance, in the history of the French Renaissance brings to the mind of English readers a body of literature with a flavor and quality entirely its own. It has been read and enjoyed as thoroughly by Englishmen as by succeeding generations in France, That it should have appealed so steadily and so strongly to Anglo-Saxon readers while at times it was allowed to pass almost unregarded by the nation to which it was primarily addressed is the result of just this quality and flavor. For, strangely enough, French characteristics do not distinguish the French literature of that period. In fact the distinguishing characteristics of Renaissance literature in general, whether it appeared in Italy or France or England, are not so much national as they arc peculiar to an epoch. To be sure, there are differences between the Renaissance literature of England and France and Italy, but taken as a whole it was dominated by an ardor for knowledge and experience strong enough to “ overleap all fence,M and we find in it, very little of national prejudice or bias. Among all its creators there is a well-defined spiritual kinship. Its writers in ail countries were carried along, carried away often, by new and powerful forces, and the result in all countries is a certain freshness and strength. There is no sentimentality; it is lusty, It has zest. The works of Rabelais and Montaigne, two typical names in the history of the French Renaissance, owe not so much to France, the nation under whose standard and in whose language they were written, as to the Renaissance, the general movement of thought which informed and begot them. That which ax>peals to us, not only in these masters, but also in the lesser craftsmen of the French Renaissance, is their lively imagination and their irrepressible individuality. These are qualities which characterize the great periods of English literature. In France the case stands somewhat differently. Her subsequent literature has not been primarily individualistic and imaginative. She turned, in fact, from this exuberant outburst of individualism to the development /yf’that k&en social sense and lucid logical style incompatibly with the spirit of her early Renaissance literature, and her classics have been marked out for greatness on the strength of iheir appeal, not to the imagination, but to the reason. It is not astonishing, therefore, that work of this charactcr should have found almost equal favor with Englishmen,
It is astonishing, however, that to a period of such Interest to us, critics and “students should so far have directed but slight attention. Outside of the excellent work of John Owen, rather philosophical than literary, on the skeptics of lho French Renaissance, and Mr. Spingarn’s complete but technical treatise on the criticism of this movement, English readers have so far been forced to content themselves with the short surveys In general histories of French literature and the very rare particular studies like Walter Pater’s illuminating little essay on the poetry of Joachim du Bellay. Except for these there has been comparatively little. Mr. Tilley may be said, therefore, to be writing for an audience already assembled. So thorough and scholarly a work as his must in many respects compensate students for the long delay in its appearance.
Though there may be differences of opinion’ as^to the proper spirit and method of treating literature, and not a few will disagree with Mr. Tilley, it will be but just to him and to the advantage of tlie reader if for the time being the latter enters into the author’s point of view. His work shows him to be net so much a lover as a student of letters, and his two volumes are conceived and executed in that spirit of dispassionate, “ scientific " inquiry which characterizes so much of the historical and critical Investigation of the last few decades. Mr. Tilley's study, he tells us, was begun in 1885 and is, roughly speaking, the work of twenty years.' He show3 a remarkable familiarity not only with the important, but practically with all documents, literary or his- ; torlcaV accessible to the contemporary student.

From' his point of view very, little has' escaped him, and If he is to tie censured at all It would be rather for his occa-■ slonal unnecessary display* of critical machinery, and for what he has now and then included and failed to use/ than for
*	any omission or lapse of attention. In general Mr. Tilley Is concerned not so seriously with the interpretation as with the genesis of the works of literature. He seeks the sources of a poem rather than its spirit To he sure, the latter is not entirely disregarded. The attempt to ascertain accurately dates of publication, 1 influences at work upon the writer and possible models, however, usually occupies the bulk of his attention. To do j this as thoroughly and as satisfactorily . as he has done it with regard to a period already so remote involves much travel, time, and labor. It Is rather strange, therefore, that the reader should receive the impression that it was not, for the author, a labor of love. No--where, save on stray pages treating of Montaigne and Amyot, the translator of Plutarch, floes he seem to be writing “con amore” and then only when momentarily off his guard. His own method, however, has many solid advantages which will amply compensate the reader who is willing to watch a singularly well-equipped and conscientious student of literature at his work. .
Mr. Tilley takes as his special field of inquiry the period lying between the date of Francis I.'s accession (15XS) and the beginning of Malherbe's movement (3GOG) to bring back to rule and order the French language nnd literature, disorganized, as he believed, by the rioters of the preceding century. Many of the -works Written within these limits did not appear until a much later day, and certain writers of the early seventeenth century, like Regnier, for instance, can only be satisfactorily treated as continuators of the old school. For all of these, with the omission of St. Francis de Sales, tho writer finds room, and it Is surprising to note what a gallery of literature and literary portraits he here brings into our ken. Beginning with Clement Marot and his school, he enters into the turbulent but withal fruitful reign of Francis I., still occasionally called by Frenchmen the “ father and restorer of letters.” In his reign, with- its many Italian campaigns, we find the beginnings of tlie Italian influence, harmful in the main, our author believes, yet not without its grain of good. For the Italians had long possessed that secret of style as yet almost unknown across the Alps. This foreign influence reached its height In the reign of Francis’s son, Henry II., and his Queen, Catherine de Medicis, and is perhaps most pronounced in that Court’s school of poetry, led by Ronsard, then verily believed to be, and now often fondly called, the Prince of roets. In the later reigns of the century broke out the religious wars, and Paris, always the literary as well as political capital of Franco, ceased for once to be the Mecca of her poets and authors. The_ clans had scattered, and very little of the work of the last twenty-five years of the sixteenth century was written or published in Paris. It is a curious phenomenon to see, jn the reigns of Charles IX., Henry III., and Henry IV., Uiis literature showered from all quarters of Prance as it never has been since. For the rich gold of the Renaissance had not yet all been minted, and in Gascony, in Normandy, and in Geneva appeared work still undebased and bearing the hallmark of greatness. It is the timii of Montaigne, of BrantOme, of the dramatist Gamier, of the restless, vain, and many-sided D’Aubignc, of the religious poet, Du Bartas, (translated in part by our own Spenser,) of the incomparable political satire, the Satyre MenipSe, and of the first great French poet-satirist, Mathurin Regnier. Then suddenly comes a hush, the darkness before tlie second and greater day. In which Malherbe and his pedantic followers slowly work toward the light.
Such, in brief, is the course of Renaissance literature in Franco. Many of Its greater creators are loo individualistic, however, to fit into such a scheme, or for that matter, into any scheme. Mr. Tilley, therefore, acted wisely in consecrating to many of thorn special studies. Particularly able are those on Marot and Montaigne.
In Marot he finds grace and wit and pathos. Of these he was assuredly master, and excelled in the lighter forms of verse, the familiar epistle, the epigram ana the rondeau; and, though he docs not have Shakespeare's "wood-note wild"
(it would be safe to add that no French poet has ever had it), yet he lias a certain naturalnf-sK and spontaneity which distinguish him from all his fellows.
In his chapter on Montaigne* Mr. Tilley has made excellent use of all the latest work on that great Gascon. The rambling. conversational character of the Es-sais made ii possible for Montaigne to change and interpolate long passages in the successive editions of his work that appeared during his lifetime. Such interpolation often altered the general tenor of an essay and signaled a change of heart or opinion on the part of the author. Mr. Tilley has with much penetra^ lion collated these various editions and the Known facts in the story of Mon-
taigne's .Inner life, 'rind arrived often at new and-'very Interesting conclusions. He gives us a consistent arid complete history of Montaigne's intellectual development. Tn fact it is here that his method is peculiarly adapted to the subject treated, and it mattes this chapter of his
work one of the most valuable and Im-
t
portant references now accessible to tho student of Montaigne. We are much In sympathy with Mr. Tilley’s attempt to prove that Montaigne's attitude was not one of thoroughgoing skepticism, but believe that he might possibly have conducted his argument on other lines and brought it to a more definite conclusion. Skepticism Is tho nccessary point of departure for all disinterested, dispassionate, and thoroughly honest thinking. One must begin with no bias. It Is not, how-i ever, a possible refuge or final attitudo for any thinker of the calibre and seriousness of Montaigne. A great thinker may" end In pessimism, but cannot rest In skepticism. And so Montaigne Is skep-| tical about the particular date of experil ence, about the Innate dignity and no-| bility -of man, for instance. Yet passing through the refinery of his own mind these' very data are transmuted and result in a noble system of conduct and a theory of “education. Wo could, there-fere, ask for no more satisfactory refutation of Montaigne’s skepticism than Montaigne himself. We are not so much in sympathy with our author’s attempt to prove that Montaigne’s modesty was an affectation, a Gascon's vaunting negative qualities? a mere ** gasconnade h. rebours," as M. Faguet felicitously styles it. To us i It seems thoroughly consonant with the man's general attitude. This note of selfdepreciation is, furthermore, as pro' nounced in the private journal of Jits j , travels, written In part by a valet and i not intended for publication, as in the Essays. It is human to appreciate most-highly tha qualities wo do not possess. To Montaigne, whose manhood was passed in the feverish activity of the Renaissance, and who' spent his leisure with Plutarch’s heroes of antiquity, a life of comparative inaction, such as nature and temperament forced upon him, may well have seemed valueless and futile. We sec no reason why the sincerity of one who In all other matters was scrupulously open-minded should on this point be called Into Question.
In contrast to his excellent treatment of Montaigne stand tlie chapters on Ronsard and tli£ poetry of his school, the Pleiad. Mr. Tilley rarely touches its spirit, lmt conscientiously and with much critical acumen traces sources and influences. So fruitful has his work In I these byways of criticism proved that one might Imagine it to have been an entirely derivative poetry. Its distinctive characteristics he fails to signal. It has no great fund of ideas, Is not closely in touch with life; yet it has tho distinguishing qualities of imagination and style, and wo ! hear in it now and then that “lyric cry” , which is not heard again in France until the beginning or the last century, Mr. Pater Im admirably styled it the poetry of pure effect. The botanist cannot explain the scent and beauty of a rose by> counting all its petals, and the essential quality of French Renaissance poetry is still unexplained by the critic who gives us all its sources and the dates of its composition. Mr. Tilley might have added here that Spenser likewise translated and adapted certain of Du Bcllay's sonnets.
Mr. Tilley’s style, which Is singularly arid for one who treats literature, is at its worst fn his treatment of Regnier. The chapter Is formless, and except for the extracts from Regnier, wearisome in tho extreme. There is nothing to vivify tlio great mass of detail, which, however much labor it may have cost, is worthless if not used to help interpret literature. Mr, Tilley does not attempt to use it so, and It remains a dead weight upon his hands and a tedium to the reader. His method has unfortunately made it impossible to do justice to an interesting subject.
It is a pleasure, therefore, to turn from it to Ills conclusion, In which he ably sums up the results of his Investigation.
It is wholly admirable. From it wc quote the following:
Thus while the English Renaissance Is strongest on tlie poetic side, while there is nothing .in France to match the high poetic achievement of tho Fairy Queen. th«i melody nnd passion of our songs and lyrics, tlie splendor of our drama, th® French Renaissance ih strongest on tho side of prose, and in throe departments of it, memoir-writing, the short story, and prose-satire, shows a decided superiority.
Mr. Tilley’s accuracy is unimpeachable. He has spared no labor to arrive at the fatrU\ For questions of detail his is tlio most complete and reliable study in English. His bibliography alone must have demanded years of patient search and inquiry. Tn thoroughness and accuracy it supersedes all previous work in this department, and it is invaluable to studenU of this cnoch i:i France, He Is likowige never satisfied with anything less tha^ an intimate, first-hand knowledge of all his characters. One could not reasonably expect more from one who has done so much excellently. Yet building on so broad and firm a foundation, it will be a matter of regret to a certain class of readei-s that' his work should In somo
respects have fallen short of completeness. In evaluating Influences, he very often makes much of’little, as when ho says that the Pleiad derived their'fondness for comparisons from mythology I from the Italian artists who decorated i Francis I.’s new palace at Fontainebleau, j Certain members of the Pleiad, Du Bellay, for Instance, would have had very tittle opportunity for meeting Rosso and Prl-j amatlccls, tho artists in question, and almost certainly never entered the palaco at Fontainebleau. It is much more natural and much simpler to trace the tendency to tMSlr passionate fondness for Greek and Latin literature, where such comparisons abound. Confining himself occasionally to his very excellent studies of detail, he likewise fails to convey to us the essence of the work in hand. For all his scholarly matter on Rabelais's life and works, wc should hardly know from Mr. Tilley why he Is one of the commanding figures in the Renaissance. The spirit of the work Is not always made clear by his treatment. And yet of the literature of all this Unto It is the spirit that " lm-porteth most." To the maker as well as tho student of literature it has much to say. For it Is the literature of youth, of the youth of our own times. Wc are still living In the evening of the Renaissance. Tliero has been no Counter-Reformation here. We have as yet had no movement that really contradicts its tendencies, and Is not, in some sense, the fulfillment of one or another of Its aspirations. Its faults aro the faults of youth. K has much, too much often, enthusiasm, imagination, gusto, and passion, but few established standards of conduct, style, or taste; and so it Is uncurbed and lacks the faculty of self-criticism. There is imitation, there Is decoration, as Mr. Tilley abundantly show's, but there is some little poetry here that has the freshness of morning about It, that at its best st/ll smells of the ground. There is, too, much artificiality, excess, and overstatement, and, it must be said, here and there poor taste and obscenities, as in the Sfeur de Bran-tOme, for Instance, and King Francis’s sister, the Queen Marguerite of Navarre; for they had flung wide the doors, and in the true spirit of the Renaissance entered into the kingdom, not of heaven, but of this world; and in reading much of this old work we cannot help feeling that they had a quality which we have lost, and remembering that these were
