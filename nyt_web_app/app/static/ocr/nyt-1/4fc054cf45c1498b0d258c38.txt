Henry James.
A’etc York Times Hook Revteic:
The praise lavished upon Mr, Henry James is unfortunately of a somewhat compromising nature. With a few notable exceptions tt lacks the sincerity of an essential understanding; it signally fails to make the reproaches of the author’s critics seem very shallow or very unfair. This whole discussion on Mr. James's dimensions as a novelist might conveniently reduce itself to a petty controversy on his choice of words, so smat-tered is the knowledge displayed by the majority of those who review his books. The only really profound study of the productions of Henry James (though it is very brief) which it has been my good fortune to come across is Mr. Conrad's appreciation in this month’s North American.
