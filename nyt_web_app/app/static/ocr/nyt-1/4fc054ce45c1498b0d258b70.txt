The Harpers will publish on Jan. 19 “ The Wonders of L.ife,” by Ernst Haeckel, a further explanation of the theory of existence propounded by tho ;iuthor in his previous book, “ The Riddle of the
Universe.” This theory is purely material and largely biological, Haeckel taking biology as the basic or key science, and with that for 'a starting point, explaining the various processes and so-called miracles of life. It Is said that the present volume is the outcome of what was intended lo be a letter-general to all the persons who had ashed for elucidations of points not touched upon or thoroughly explained fn the ourlier work. From a letter tho explanatory paper grew into a book, which, taken with the other, may be considered a complete exposition of the author's views.
