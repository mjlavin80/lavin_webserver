Pat to the moment has been the publication of Mr. Thomas Co wen's book on " The Russo-Japanese War from the Outbreak of Hostilities to the Battle of IjiaoyangV* which we have been enabled to review In the week of the fall of Port Arthur. Mr. Cowen is :in English war correspondent of wide experience, who has lived long in the Far East. His book, as we said a fortnight ago, was written at the front day by day, and the printing and publication were hurried along. It brings the record of incidents up to the beginning of the great siege now ended with a Japanese victory, explains clearly the causes of iho war, and is full of graphic descriptive passages.
