'The Hawthorne Bibliography.
Kcin York Times Hook ltevietr :
In the Book Review for Jan. 14 your Boston correspondent says that “ Mr. P. K. Foley is reading the proofs of ‘ The Bibliography of Hawthorne,’ ” prepared by Miss Nina E. Browne, &c, I have not even seen a single page of the proofs 1 referred to. Through Miss Browne's kindness I had the privilege of seeing I purt of her manuscript. This has boon the sum total of my connection with her bibliography, though I should esteem the j honor of being connected with a publication which, I venture to predict, wilt j be welcomed as the best guide to the ! writings of Hawthorne which we will have, a lasting memorial of earnest, pa-I tient work, well performed.
