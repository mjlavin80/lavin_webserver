5c.) is primarily addressed to students. The text adopted is practically Malone's revision of the edition prlnccps, tlu*Quarto of lOOSt, all the variations, with the exception or differences in spelling and punctuation, being noted. The sonnets have heen divided into groups and carefully annotated, Dr. Beeching discusses all the most recent theories on the subject, besides criticising the work of other editors of tlie sonnets.
In tlie long analytical and expository introduction, vilik‘1) Is based on an article in the February. 190’J. Cornliill Magazine, occupying <17 pa^es of the book, he writes on the subject of the sonnets, the " patron ” and “ literary exercise" theories, the date of tho sonnets, the friend, the rival poet, the form and >tylj of the son- : nets, the text of the Quarto, and Uie so- ( qiieneg of the sonnets, lie pays special j attention to the position taken by Sidney j Lee, who holds that most of tlie sonnets i were early work, conventional exercises i addressed to a literary patron. Dr. • l.lect’hing has other views which he sub- I simulates by facts drawn from ids own ; researches, lie writes:	j
* • * And in pursuance of his theory ! Mr. Lee places th*- bulk of Shake-i speare’s sonnets in l.Vl-l. But all tlie ‘ evidence there is pointed to a date con, siderably later. No reference to tlie sonnets has been traced in contemporary literature before MW. ]t was not till I .MU that two of them found their way into print in " The Passionate Pilgrim.'’’ And the only sonnet that can be dated with absolute certainly from internal evidence belongs to l(io.'{. Tiie evidence irom style ; points also, for the most part, to a later ! date. *	•	*	There is,	however,	a line
of argument hitherto neglected, * • * i —the argument from repealed expressions
•	• ■ It Is not uncommon for him (Shakespeare) to use a word or phrase twice in	a	staple play, nnd never	afterward. *	•	•	Nuw the	greater number	■
of the pirallel passages hitherto recog- i nlzed are to be fount] in ** Henrv IV.” in 1 "Love's l*al)or’s Lost." nnd in “Hamlet:" ! and it is certain that ** Henry IV." was ! written	in	that	" Love’s	Labor	j
Lost" was revived in that same year, and that ** Hamlet " is later still.	i
In his critical article on the relation j hetVreen the sonnets of Michael Drayton { and those of Shakespeare. Dr. Uceching i says that Drayton copied Shakespeare’s
manner of writing, and concludes:
Neglecting, however, all questions of word borrowing, which can seldom bo conclusively settled, I prefer to rest my case on the broader ground of style. I would ask any one to whom the Shakespearean rhythm is distinct and familiar to read Drayton's last sonnets, * * * above all, “Why should your fair eyes with such sovereign tjrace " and ** Since there's no help, come let us kiss and part.” and. if lie detects, as be must, some fellowship, I would put to him this question. If a poet at one time could write so like Daniel that his ** Clear Ankor, on whose allver-sanded shore " is as gooi and as characteristic of Daniel as any sonnet that charming writer ever produced, and at another time so not unlike Sidney that his " My heart was slain, and none but you and I " suggests at once the " Astrophel and Stella," is it reasonable, when in turn we find him writ. Ing In the school of Shakespeare, that he should be accounted Shakespeare's master and not his pupil?
The notes are clear and full, and the editor has credited every explanation that Is not his own to its original proposer.
