aspirations without knowing the meaning : of his own words. l\e pawns his testament tQ buy “ Grlorloso," a story of a magnificent robber, he entertains himself (and the woman of all work) with vain tales of .being himself a Prince, and by night sees an ineffable Princess in the ;
stars. Then he falls in love cased fifteen) with a wash-girl, (aged seventeen.) and has. in short, all the thrills and longings i of a gentle and dreamy youth. He has .other experiences, too, suggestive of those of Joseph Andrews in an immortal Eng- : JiSh classic, and in telling about them the modern Dutch author is almost as frank -as was the Englishman of an earlier cent- . ury. In fact, you may see in Dekker now touches of Fielding, now of Heine, (be has ; been called the Holland Heine.) now of : the contemporary iconociast, Bernard Shaw, whose hatred of “ respectability ’* ; he shares. This volume gives only the story of Walter's boyhood. There is more i of it in the original. -The translator has been daringly and somt times unfortunately colloquial in his ; rendering, and he confesses to having “ unraveled as extraneous matter a good deal of the flax or silk of this Chinaman’s pig-tall." So Dekker wrote of his discur- ; sive method, in allusion to the custom of the Celestial in reinforcing with foreign matter a queue too slenderly furnished with hair. Adherents of the new school . of novelists, Ibsenites, &c., who are not already familiar with Dekker* s work will not regret a perusal of Mr, Evans's ren- . derlng! nor will the more catholic seekers after real life in fiction—real, yet divorced from sentiment.

As the translator remarks in his preface, the name of Dekker, though the greatest in the modern literature of the Netherlands. is little known in England or America. Dekker was In his life a sort of Ish-maelite. He ruined his career as an official in the Dutch East Indies by sympathy with the natives injudiciously exhibited. He was the exponent at home j of radical notions and a savage satirist , of respectability of that cheap, smug, ig-i norant kind which is the fetich in Holland 1 as elsewhere of the lower middle classes.
I This story of Walter Pleterse (extracted i from the author's hodge-podge "Ideen ") relates to the adventures of a boy born in the cheapest rank of the middle class aforesaid, but by a not rare chance endowed with imagination and a soul for less trammeled things. The passion for “ respectability, which held poor Walter's family in its deadly grip, the life they i lived in a narrow flat in Amsterdam, the things thev thought, all are rendered minutely and mercilessly. Naturally, in such environment the boy. full of the generous sap of youth and thirst for re-mance, grows up much awry. He writes verses expressing savage and immoral
