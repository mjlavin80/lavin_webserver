In the Red Man's philosophy, as interpreted by the author, himself a full-blooded Sioux, the beasts of the fields and he birds of the air are the brothers of their human fellow-creatures. The four-footed and feathered tribes also, in the same philosophy, regard the Red Man as a brother. They are the animal people, and these stories are stories of them as such—stories which differ not as widely as might be wished from the white man's animal tales now so numerous. Yet there is a difference. Somehow the author's animal people seem more simply interpreted and more poetically endowed, which may be well understood if, as Mr. Eastman says, he has tried merely to reproduce animal lore current among his people when he was a boy, as one might say. sought to edit the Aesops of the woods. The first story is of a great wildcat, her young, and her hunting; the second of the gray wolves and how by night a great band of these creatures attacked the sheepfold of a pioneer, enemy alike of wolves and their brothers, the Indians. After that comes the story of
tlie' ** Little People,*’ the mice who were cast down from the sky for nibbling away too much ot the moon. Not that they deemed the orb of night green cheese, according to the homely fancy of the palefaces, but that the Great Spirit had assigned them the task of making it wane once a month.
Because they overdid things they were precipitated to earth, where they had no business, and therefore all earth-born animals conspired to kill them. Another
story is of an Indian girl and a tamo raccoon, who was her hunting dog; another of “The Sky Warrior,’' the eagle,
! and how a certain brave captured one of the mighty birds and shared his venison ; with him “ as one warrior with another/* i To be sure, th* eagle Had slain the deep
which furnished the feast. Further stories are of the.buffalo, (or bison, if you please,) of the prairie do&, who builds towns like the white men, of the coyote and the grizzly bear. It seems "a pity that with a book of stories by a. real Indian before you, a book which professes to give the real Indian’s, point of view of the real animal " he knew- so well, you -cannot castoff^the impression of a reflex upon- the whole . of the:; work- of . moro sophis ticated .men., .men-whoaa-familiarlty; wUh^the./wildemess,- howevergreat;_isac-‘
