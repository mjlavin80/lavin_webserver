Mi*. Louis Becke's admirers can but congratulate themselves that in “ Under Tropic Skies " lie has abandoned, for the time, at least, his ambition to become a novelist of tho Jong story type, and has returned to the writing of those delightful .sketches of life In the remote islands of tlie Smith Pacific that first brought him into favorable notice. Mr. Itcokc. like Mr. Kipling’, Mr. Lafeatlio Hearn, Mr. Norman Duncan, and some fev.r other fortunate ones in this generation, discovered a new corner or the earth Avlth which he had a. special talent for making the rest of mankind acquainted, and he accomplished this task in several volumes of short stories that are gems of their kind. Few things are better in tho short story line than Mr. Beckc's " By Reef and Palm,” but " James Shervinglon ” and ” Helen Adair,” conventional tales of considerable length and of a rather uninteresting dm racier—brought a distinct shock oi disappointment for the simple reason that in them their author very plainly snowed that he was out of his depth and out of his element.
Ills element is, without doubt, the mrowing of just such flashlights upon the far Paumotus, the Carolines, Fiji, and other fascinating dots in the Pacific solitudes as fill tho pages of the volume which is called ** Under Tropic Skies,” and in it he seems almost to have gotten back all his old-time skill. That there is any apparent falling short is perhaps more duo to lack of present novelty in the material than to any loss of virtue in Mr. Becke's pen. It is doubtful if these stories add very much to the pictures which he has already drawn of the desirable days ^hen fortunes waited in these fairy ‘ atolls for almost any trader who was skillful enough as a navigator to slip safely by their protecting reefs and enough of a diplomatist to make a good bargain with ‘the savage natives before he unwittingly infringed some one of their strict rules of etiquette on the part of visitors and was spirited away into the neighboring “ bush " to form an evening meal for the chief. ** Trading ” was a dangerous occupation in those parts in those days, and the men who followed It were of a temperament sufficiently strenuous to make their doings of a nature Quite lurid enough to match the most uncivilized imaginings of the na-ti\ os. 1 ho savagery In those stories is by no means all on one side.
But one cannot rend through to the end of this volume without coming to the conclusion that Mr. Beclco stilt writes ^ &o°d stories, that his store of incidents is simply enormous, and that he knows the South Sea Islands-natives. traders, and all their ways, past and ?y«Se«(!ras r11 as1t.he ordinary AmerJ-
wP	kno,ws hls.own front lawn.
He makes us know them, too, as far
as he has time to evolve them from his
inner consciousness, and consign them to
words, find, more th^n all, he makes one
long to charter a bark and sail away to
see foi lumself all that Mr. Becke relates.
