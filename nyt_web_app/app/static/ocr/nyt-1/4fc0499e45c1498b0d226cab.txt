I have been rending *■ The Eoy ami the Outlaw,” by Thomas J. L.. McManus, which was pent lo me as a Christmas gift. I thoughi at first that it was a 1 boy's story of tho wild West, but after reading the lunny preface I ventured lo dip into it and I was pleased to find that it is a very humorous story. I see that one of your Southern corresponderits likes tho doctor who betrayed tlie outlaw. I can't say that he is a favorite with mo.
1 shouldn't like a man of that kind for my family physician, though he may have suited the time and class of patients that he found in old Mrs. Angel's barracks on the Potomac. The poor consumptive Jared Whemple won a place in my heart, and poor Louise, who loved him so dearly.
The Virginia Squire nnd the young lawyer who saved from the clutches of the law tearful Mrs. Angel’s best and only
featherbed appeal to me ns true Southern gentlemen, l have never seen many negroes at close range, so I cannot say whether tho outlaw shoukl have quoted* Scripture. I can only say that he met with a sad fate for one so holy. The boy seems to me to be just a little too knowing1 fr.r one of bis years. But wliat became of the boy in the end?	J.	P.
