Somo Further Discussion of the Nov i\ ' Called “The Eagle’s Shadow.”
, debate It lias occasioned in your valuable
columns Is that no two readers appear to
have reached conclusions even remotely
resembling* one another. Now I can state only my own opinion, and It is that tho ..book is a pernicious one.
Mr. Glaenzcr advances a dangerous fallacy when he claims It must be considered
■	as Lamb considers the comedies of the Restoration—as unmoral proceedings in an unmapped Utopia, of gallantry. This Is a Kindly explanation, but -Its value is somewhat vitiated by the fact that it Is
obviously absurd. The scene is the Virginia of to-day, and the characters aro very far’from being marionettes. On tlio ‘contrary, they aro one and all degraded specimens of humanity, very vividly drawn. 1 grant that the book is clever, but I cannot commend a cleverness that can find no better exercise than to Jeer at humnn nature, and. moreover, at every attempt to better human nature. Charity may have its parasites, philanthropy may have its parasites, but that is no reason for exhibiting these virtues in an ignoble UfilU. To cito one instance In many, no one who lias rend the Van Vorst book will Consider tho present condition of child labor in the South a fit subject for jesting, and to make fun of an attempt to cicanso this blot from the Nation’s natiu* Is licit far from being a crime. The same holds true of the noble work of our foreign missions. of the great modern movement toward a more intimate comprehension of nature and of various twentieth century endeavors toward-the extirpation of vice and Ignorance—in none of which can Mr. Cabell see more than an ingenious method whereby a parcel of hypocrites swindle a silly younff woman. To call the story “thistledown" and ** seafoam ** and so on is to beg the question, for to render virtue ridiculous is materially to abet tho cause of vice. I do not for a moment suppose that the young author intended this, but years will bring him tbe knowledge that in such a connection flippancy Is misplaced. Concerning Margaret Hu-gonin I have already expressed my opinion. which is that a good complexion does rot excuse bad morals or a fair mouth foul words. It may be we have progressed beyond *' Jane Austen’s gentlewomen and Cooper’s helpless * females,* ’* but if this leads to a condonation of profanity and bestial rage as peculiarly ladylike traits, the progress is scarcely toward Improvement.
