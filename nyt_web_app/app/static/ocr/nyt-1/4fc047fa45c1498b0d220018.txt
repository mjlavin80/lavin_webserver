Jack London's latest novel. " Tlio Sea-Wolf," deserves a word of appreciation from a reader. Kirst of all, it is a. very interesting: story; it is realistic und probable. The principal character, Wolf Larsen, though unconventional, is depleted rationally and logically and, one might almost say, sympathetically. The author does not try to excuse the brutality, but rather to make it appear caused by lack of moral development. He pictures this sea Captain as without conscience, but immoral rather than immor.il. This distinction between •* unmoral ” and " immoral ” forms an interesting phase of tho story. Possessed of a lucid mind and excellent reasoning: powers, his utter lack of conscience saves him from ‘ being immoral. His temper Js ferocious, his strength prodigious, and on occasion these attributes are used without mercy. Ilis creed, if such a man might be said to have a creed, embodies but one theme— the survival of the fittest.
Mr. London’s psychological insight reminds one of George Eliot, his ability as a story teller of Kipling, and his style of 110 one—It Is quite his own. " The Call of the Wild ” was a splendid book, but “ Tlie Sea-Wolf *r excels It. and will/strengthen this author’s already strong position as a writer of good literature.
