AUTHORS' LANDS.
Essays by William Sharp In Which Several Famous Writers Are Treated Geographically.*]
IKK otlif'r books on geography, this one is furnished with maps; there aro, for instance, maps of the Dickens country and Scott-land. But the author In too wi3-j to i>; carried *iwnv **ntiro!y by analogues with unllterary geographies and map everything. There arc no maps of Stevenson land nor yet of Thackeray land. Tho separate papers composing the book were published at intervals in lOOK and 1JKH in The Poll Mall Gazette, and have been little changed here, where, with plentiful illustrations, they make a most entertaining book, not by any means exclusively devoted to geographical matters, straying, on the contrary, Into many by-lanes of criticism, reminiscence, and biography. Mr. Sharp begins with George Meredith, who is obviously a special favorite of his own private fancy—by the same token that George Eliot, who comes somewhat later, Is not. He place* the cupfta! of the Meredith country at Box Hill, near Dorking, Mr. Meredith's residence. Then he writes:
The literary geography of George Meredith cannot be confincd to a region or scattered regions with definite frontiers, ■still less to a mere county or two with adjustable boundaries: it must bo constructed, say, like the shire of Cromarty, which one finds in bits about the north of Scotland, or like that familiar “ Empire " map where the red flaunt of our kinship Is scattered over the world with what a famous humorist has called an impartial and Inveterate zest for dumping
oil	the most desirable soft spots.
Meredith patches, as all good Mere-dfthians know, are dotted about England, the Rhine country, Switzerland, Austria, France, and Italy, but, says Mr. Sharp;
He does not go*to Venice or to Limburg to write about these places, or lo note the bloom of local color for liter,irv decoration, nor does he diverge to tlie Adriatic or by the winding ways of Lahn, so as lo Introduce tills gondola view of the st-aset city or that forest vision which for English folk has given a touch of beauty to Nassau which before it hardly owned in literary remembrance, j I is men and women are true for a lime or passingly, and so the heauly that Is in the i background closes round nnd upon them or is flashed out for a moment through tile mask* of tlu* same power which g-ivc themselves the breath of life.
Ail of which is most pleasingly put. Ilut then the author's heart is iu it. He has much to say, too, of Meretlilh :is a j>i»i*t— quoting in the somewhat unsatisfactory manner of tlit- enthusiast bits which imne but a fe|low-cnthusiast can fit Intn their proper halos of association. Jn the »vxt case Mr. Sharp is on surer ground with the mass of readers, for his subject is Stevenson and his enthusiasm hardly less. Of much that he says of Robert Louis Stevenson (whoso proper country is all the land visible from Edinburgh Castle on a clear day, but'whose conquests extend su far over seasj we may best quoie heic the description of tlie first sight Mr. Sharp had of the man of " dellcar** Inlay work,*' He reproaches Mr. Kipling lor that term. It was at Waterloo Station, and Mr. Sharp was ignorant of th.* Wen-tity of the man:
My attention was attracted bv a pas* ser.ger of a strangeness of appearance almost grotesque emerging from a compartment of t he Bournemouth train, which had just arrived. 1 allowed m>>ei; an Idle and amused interest in the traveler, who had just stepped on the plutfo.vn close to me. He was tall, thin, spare— indeed, he struck me as almost fantastically spare. 1 remember thinking the station draught caught him like a torn leaf blowing ut the end of a branch. His clothes hung about him as the clothes of a convalescent who has lost bulk and weight after long fever. lie had on a jacket of black velveteen—I cannot swear to the color, but that detail always comes back in the recalled picture—a flannel shirt with a loose necktic negligently bundled into a sailor's knot, somewhat fantastical trousers, though no doubt this cffect was due in part to thetr limp amplitude about ,\vhat seemed rather th-* thin, green poles familiar in danlfa pots than the legs of a human crcature. He wore a straw hat that in its rear rim suggested forgetfulness on .the part of ITs wearer, who had apparently, in -sleep or heedlessness, treated it as a cloth cap.
I These, however, were details trivial in I themselves, and were not consciously noted till later. The long, narrow face, then almost sallow, with somewhat long, loose, dark hair that draggled from be, neath the yellow straw hat well over the I cars, along the dusky hollows of temple | and cheek, was what immediately attracted attention. But the extraordinariness of the Impression was of a man who had just been rescued from the sea or a river.
; Except for the fact that his clothes did i not drip, that the long, black locks hung : limp but not moist, and that the short velveteen jacket was disreputable but not damp, this impression of a man just come or taken from the water was overwhelming. That It was not merely an impression of my own was proved by the exclamation of a cabman was was standing beside me. “ Looks like a sooerclde, don't 'e. Sir? One o* them chaps as takes their down-on-their-luek 'eaders inter the Thinies."
Then, as a friend approached and greeted Ihe unknown, Mr, Sham describes the transformation:
The dark locks apparently receded like weedy tangle in the ebb; the lonr, sallow oval grew rounder and less wan; the
sombre melancholy vanished like cloud-scud on a day of wind and sun, and the dark eyes lightened to a violet-blue nnd were filled with sunshine und laughter. An extraordinarily winsome smile Invaded the face—pervaded tho whole man, I was about to say.
After Stevenson comes Dickens country, where " it Is mostly London." You have a map to show places outside the city where all gdbd men nnd true have followed Dickens’s creatures—Yarmouth and Yorkshire nnd Canterbury, but “ we -have nothing to do here with such minfU* places a« America, despite Martin Chuzzlewlt's voyage .to that country/' Later, dealing with Thackeray, Mr. Sharp shows in whnt a different sense his province .nlso was London. " Not Dr. Johnson," he says, ** nor Charles Lamb, nor Charles Dickens, was more truly a Londoner than William Makepeace Thackeray, born in Cnhyjttn, student of Weimar, newspaper correspondent, and happy married man in Paris, a great novelist in the making at a chateau in Picardy.” But in the case of Thackeray the author Is not all enthusiast. " There is no great writer of our time/’ he writes, " who has committed so much that is copimonplace fn thought and observation, aid commonplace and often jejune in style/' Yet he does full justice to " Vanity Fair/' " The New-comes," and '‘Esmond/’ und dwells lovingly upon many places where Thackeray s beloved puppets have danced upon the wires he strung for them. Mr. Sharp regrets most in Thackeray the absence of those backgrounds of detailed natural scenery which he finds in his contemporaries, Dickens. Charlotte Brontg, in Scott, and now in Thomas llardy and *' that still greater master of prose George Meredith," Thackeray being the other term of the comparison. It may be permissible to interject juHt here that many persons—lovers of good things in good books—skip just those identical descriptive passages, but every man to his taste. Thackeray's was for men and women as men and women, not as manifestations of a mood of nature.
Of course the lund of Scott Is all Scotland, and of that is a map as well as of England, showing the places most celebrated by the author of ■* Waverlev ” Mr. Sharp provides, too. in this case'an elaborate table of local habitations for cach of the Waverley novels and iSa. poems, and does not here, as in th;* case of Thackeray, throw cold water *n the wizard.
The section on George Eliot shows (as Alreadj hinted) but a lukewarm admira-
