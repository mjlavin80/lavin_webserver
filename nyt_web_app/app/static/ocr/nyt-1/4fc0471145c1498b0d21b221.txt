ITH the appearance. of Mr. Henry James’s new work of fiction, “ The Golden Bowl,” and its numerous following : of magazine and newspaper criticisms, tbo tentative ad. mtrer of this accomplished master in ' grown-up story hook land is again brought { to marvel, and is again both amused and discouraged by cmer-. gence of the fact that evasive Mr. Henry James has created for himself, by some occult, fascinating influence, a school of evasive critics. Of Iho Henry Janies stories a bright young woman recently asked: " Which Henry James ending do you like best—the one which turns to the left and says nothing, or the one whicli turns to the right, and says, * So, there we are*?” Highly expert in these elu-give Henry James mannerisms is the new school of Henry James critics; they turn to the left with many words—and say nothing; or they turn to the right, equally non-committal, and say, 41 There you are.” j Of " The Golden Bowl/’ in print, much j has been said; also, much has been ' evaded. It has long been inferable that Mr. Henry James lilmself is opposed to plain verdicts—verdicts may be justice, but they are not “ art.” On the other
hand, the literary public—" sky-born, sky-guided, sky-returning race "—knows that all true life moves inevitably on toward verdicts. Verdicts, therefore, aro not to be evaded; they must be reckoned with. "The Golden Bowl/* then, on an honest verdict basis, falls below the grade^-lt is not a high achievement. Ethically it is far out of plumb. In "The Ambassadors " a notably warped situation ended the story; Lambert Strother advised Chad to eienvc unto the questionable married woman in Paris, and to harden his^ heart to tiie tender claims of his mother and sister in far, humdrum, unartistic Massachusetts. "Tho Golden Bowl,” more vaguely frank as to its sinners, boldly exponent of the ICaty-did-Katy-didn't school of fiction, (in which readers who so wish may believe that Katy did, while readers of other tendencies may deduce that Katy didn't.) closes with a culpably weak so-presented moral arrangement. Charlotte, the woman " flirtress,”—as her author might classify her—Ls merely dragged over to e^ile in dreadful California-far even beyond dint horrible tract of American country inhabited by Mrs. Kawe and Dolly and Polly Lutcli— the terrible "Middle West."
Amerigo, the gentleman flirt—to give him his mildest title—slays in Engl ami, to draw his high salary of American millions a= the forgiven husband of Maggie. Principino, the international baby in the cast*, no doubt grows up to learn from his graceful Italian father that “God is merciful—und man was born to do as he pleases.’' But readers who like their novel characters '* decent " in the closest analysis—and grammarians a’^jo—cannot forgive Mr. Henry James these phrases, in an interview between the husband of Maggie and Charlotte, the wife of dear
litllo Adam Yervcr. Maggie's father:
•< Their hands instinctively found their hands ”—whose hands found whose hands? let us ask. " ‘ It's sacred,* lie said.
*	* * “ it's sacred,’ she breathed * * *'* "Their lips sought their lips; their pressure their response, and their response
their pressure; with a violence that had sighed itself the next moment to the longest and deepest of stillnesses they passionately seyled their pledge." O, Daisy Miller. O, ivlill3' Theale, O, Mamie Pocock, what kind of reading would this be for you? Mr. llenry James approves of adventurous French novels; that approval is hero apparent. Mr. Henry James admires vicious D’Annunzio; that admiration is also here apparent.
Of Les Charmettes nnd the Maison Jenn Jacques Rousseau. in 1S72, when Henry James. Jr., wrote " Transatlantic Slietchts," this perfect master of the charming, phrase penned these sentences: ’* Los Charmettes is haunted by ghosts unclean and forlorn. The place tolls of poverty, trouble, and impurity, * * * But us 1 stood on the charming terrace I have mentioned—a little jewel of a terrace, with grassy flags and a mossy parapet. and an admirable view of great swelling violet hills—stood there reminded how much sweeter Nature is than man. the story cf Rousseau and Mme. de "Warens looked ratlier wan and unlovely,
and 1 cnuhl muster no keener relish for it than is implied in perfect pity." But in lUflK, at the Chcval Blanc, in France, Lambert Strother mused that " the text was simply, when condensed, that in these places such things were, and that if it was in them one elected to move
about on*1 had to make one’s account
with what one alighted upon," With expatriation. it thus appears, intellectual and moral standpoint alter curiously. If “ The Golden Bowl" has any ethical influence whatever, that Influence must undoubtedly take effect remotely—as all pessimists benefit the race—by making other folk cheerfully glad that they are not pessimists, and stanehly determine never to be pessimists. Jf only air.
Henry James woul J migrate witli Adam Verver to far California and there make us one of his old-time magic books under clean, blue American skies! Lord Byron, our ** sad, bad, mad, glad brother," knew
}
the true golden’ bowl, " if only in his dreams, and he left behind him tlifi MJUtltti that there was but one real happiness In love—where a man and a womaii so adored each other that they co.uld con-ccivc of no happiness out of each other’s sight, and this for their whole lives." Coi,
Voyt, however, and Chad, and Prince
Amerigo, doubtless, would all unite in the opinion that none " but a duffer would see the shadow of a ‘ story' in that.”v Col. Voyt, it must be remembered, takes a low view of the field of fiction. The adventure's a relation, the relation’s an adventure. The romance, the novel, the drama are the picture of one. The subject the novelist treats Is the rise, the formation, tho development, tho climax, and, for the most part, the decline of one. And what is the honest lady doing on that side of the town? ”
“ Behavior is just behavior." said Maud Blesslngbourne; “ the most definite thing in the world." So, then, until fully assured that gifted Mr. Henry James's artistically, politely vicious literary behavior has b?en thoroughly clarified and amended, Maud Blessingbourno and her followers will lay no more wreaths of appreciation on the shrine of Henry James—at the sign of the " Golden Bowl With a Big Crack In It." They will worship rather, and grieve, at tho shrine of gifted Henry James, Jr.—tho author of ** The Altar of the Dead,” ** Spoils of Poynton,” and The Tragic Muse."
