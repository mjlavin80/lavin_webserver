‘ It seems that the simple and useful phrase, “ light literature," is to Mr. Hall Caine as a red rag to a mentally disturbed bull. We do not remember hearing any one call Mr. Caine’s stories “ light literature,'* and he does not expressly say that.they were ever so called. But the phrase Is used, in pulpit and press, and in common conversation, to denote fiction, and without English fiction, cries Mr. Caine, we should lack half of what we know about England and the English. Mr. Caine’s remarks, which were uttered at a dinner of one of the London mutual admiration societies, yclept the New Vagabonds, are realiy not of great Importance. By the use of the term " light literature ’* nobody intends to disparage the novels of Thackeray or Meredith or Hardy, or even those of Mr. Caine. It is an attractive phrase, which commends itself to the multitude. To be sure, Mr. Caine is, artistically speaking, a trifle heavy, but her ought not to let his mind dwell sadly on that. He Is still a " best seller/' .	..	I	*	'
