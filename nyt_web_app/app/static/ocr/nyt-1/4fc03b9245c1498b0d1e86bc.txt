RENASCENCE OF WONDER.-Un-doubtedly the greatest philosophical generalization of our time 1a expressed in the four words, ** The Renasccnce of Won-| der." They suggest that great spiritual , theory of the universe which, according to Mr. Walts-Dunton, In bound to follow the wave of materialism that set in after the publication of Darwin's great book. This phrase, which I first became familiar with in *hls ** Encyclopedia Brltan-niea *’ article on Rossetti, seems really to have been used first in *' Aylwin." The story seems originally, to have been called '* The Renascence of Wonder," but thn title was abandoned bccause the writer believed that an unsuggestlve name, such as that of the autobiographer. was better from the practical point of view;
EARLY ENVIRONMENT.—Mr. Watts-Dunton was born in the microcosm which was in those corn law repeal days a little metropolis in Cowslip Country—Buttercup Land, as the Ouse lanes are sometimes called, and therefore he was bom to good luck. Cowslip Country will be as closely associated with him and with
Hhona Boswell as Wessex is associated with Thomas Hardy and with Tess of the D’Prhervilles. For the poet born in a microcosm becomes Identified with it In the public eye, whereas the poet born in a macrocosm is seldom associated with his birthplace.
To the novelist, if not to the poet, there !s a still greater advantage in being born tn a microcosm. He sees the drama of lift* from a point of view entirely different from that of the novelist born in the macrocosm. Tho human microbe, or. as Mr. John Moriey might prefer to say, the hitman uheese-mite in the macrocosm, sees every other microbe or every other cheese-mite on the flat, but in the microcosm he sees every other microbe ur every other cheese-mlto in the round.
Mr. Watts-Dunton’s work is saturated with memories of the Ouse. Cowper had already described the Ouse, but it was Mr. Watts-Dunton who first fiung the rainbow of romance over the river and over thn sweet meadows of Cowslip Land* through which it flows.
JAMES ORLANDO WATTS—Whatever may have been the influence of his father upon Mr. Watts-Dunlon, It was not, I think, nearly so great as that of his uncle, James Orlando Watts. His father may have made him scientific: his uncle seems to have made him philosophical with a dash of mysticism. Mr. Hake has identified this uncle as tlie prototype of Philip Aylwin, the father of the hero. The importance of this character In *‘ Ayl-win ” is shown by the fact that, if we
analyze the story, we find that the character of Philip is its motive power. After his death everything that occurs is brought about by his doctrines and his dreams, his fantasies and his whims. This fTfect of making a man dominate from hi!r grave tlie entire course of the life of his descendants seems to he unique in imaginative literature: and yet. although the fingers of some critics (notably Mr. Coulson Kernahan) burn close lo the subject, th'Te they leave it. What Mr. Watts* Dunton calls " the tragic mischief *’ of tho drama is not brought about by any villain, but by the vagaries and mystical speculations of a dead man, the author ot' “The Veiled Queen.1’ There were few tilings in which James Orlando \Vatts did not take an interest. lie was a deep student of the drama. Greek. English, Spanish, and German. And it is a singular fact that this dreamy man was a lover of the acted drama. One of his stones in connection with acting Is this: A party of strolling players who went tu St. Ives pot permission to act for a period in a \ust stenc-built barn, called Priory Pam, and sometimes Cromwell's Barn. Mr. J. O. Watts went to sec them, and on returning home after the performance said: ** 1 have scon a little actor who is a real genius. Jle reminds mo of what I have read about Edmund Kean’s acting.
1 shall go and see him every night." And he went. The actor's name was Robson. When afterward Mr. Watts went ;o reside in London he learned that an actor named Robson was acting in one of the second-rate theatres called the Grecian Saloon. He went to the theatre and found, as he expected, that it was the same actor who had so impressed him down at St. Ives. From that time he followed Robson to whatsoever theatre in London he went, and afterward became a well-known figure among the playgoers

of tin* Olympic. IK- always contended that Robson was the only histrionic genius of his time.
ROSSKTTI.—It is well knmvn that Rossetti wished his life—if written itt all—to or written In- Mr. Watts-Dunton. unless h:.-‘ hr* ither himself wished it. blit prcPs-of «»ihi*r matters prevented Mr. W.itis-DuiUon from undertaking It. I «*x-poeted difficulties in approaching with regard to tin* delieate subject *»f his relations with Rossetti, but I Was not prc-parcd to find tln-m sn great us they have pi'i»vc(| tn itc, WIiimi I wrot1' I'* him .n;,i
asked him whether the portrait of D’Arey
in “ Aylwin ’’ was to be aecci li'i as a
portrait of Rossetti, and when I .«skod him i*» furnish m»* with sonn* niMcrii’Js and filets to form the basis oi' this t banter. 1 received from him the lollowiug letter:
'* My Dear Mr. Douglas:	I haw n^ver
niyself affirmed that D'Arcy was to be taken as an actual portrait uf Kossetti. Kven if I thought that a por.rait of him could be given in any form <.f imaginative literature I have views of : ly own as to tilt* propriety of giving ;>c'.n il portraits of men with whom a now!is* or poet lias been brought into contact. It is quite impossible for an imaginative writer In avoid the imperious suggestions o;’ irs nuin-ory when lie is conceiving a character. ThousMuds uf times in a year docs one come across critical remi^lts upon the prototypes of the characters of slid, great novelists as Sc»>lt, Dickens, Thaek**ray, the Brontes. George Eliot. (Jeorge Meredith. Thomas Hardy, and the rest. Ami L believe that every one of these writers would confess that his prominent characters were suggested to him by living individuals or by individuals who figure in his£ory--b»t suggested only. And as to the ethics of so dealing with friends and acquaintances 1 have also views of my own. They are easily stated. The closer the imaginative writer gets to the portrait of a friend, or even of an acquaintance, the more careful must he be to set his subject in a genial and even a generous light. It would be a terrible tiling if every man who has been a nntabh* figure in life were to be represented as this or that at the sweet will of everybody who has known him. Generous treatment. I say, is demanded of every writer who makes use of the facets of character that liii.ve struck him in his intercourse with friend or acquaintance. * * *
** The D’Arcy that. L have painted Is not one whit nobler, more magnanimous, wide-minded, and generous than was D.
G.	Rossetti. As 1 have said on several occasions, he could and did take as deep an interest in a friend's work as in his own. And to benefit a friend was the greatest
dinary vividness of the portrait or his ' friend. I have heard more than one eminent frit ml of William Morris say that from a few paragraphs of this monograph a reader gains a far more vivid picture of this fascinating man than is to be
gained from reading and re-reading any* tiling else that has been published about him. It is a grievous loss to literature that the man so fully equipped for writing a biography of Morris is scarcely likely 1 to write one. Morris, when he was busy in Queen's Square, used to be one of tho most frequent visitors at the gatherings at Danes Inn with Mr. Swinburne, Dr. "West la ml Murston, Mmlox liruwn. awl
others, on Wednesday evenings; and he and Mr, Waits-Dunton were frequently together at Kelmscott during the time of the jciia occupancy of the old Manor house, and also after Rossetti's death.
When Mr. Watts-Dunton wrote “ Aylwin " he did not contemplate thaL the llursteote of the story would immediately be identified with Kelmscott Manor. The pictures of localities and the descriptions of the characters were s*» vivid that
llursteote was at once identified with i Kelmscott, and D’Arcy was at once iUen-j tified with Rossetti. Morris's passion for angling is slightly introduced in the later j chapters of the book, and this is not sur-I prising, for some of the happiest mu*
I inents of Mr. Watts-Dunton’s life were i spi-nt at Kelmscott. Treffry Dunn's portrait of him, sitting on a fallen tree beside the hack*water, was painted at Kehn-S'jott. and the scenery and the house are admirably rendered in the picture.
SWIXBl'KNK. —I have been allowed to enrich this volume with photographs of ** Tiic Pines " and of some of the exquisite works of art therein. But It is unfortunate for me that I am not allowed to touch upon what are the most important relations of Mr. Watts-Dunton's life —important though so many of them arc.-I mean his intimacy with the poet whoso I name is now beyond doubt fur above any other name in the contemporary world of letters. I do not sympathize with the
■	hyper-sensitiveness of eminent men with | i egard to privacy. Tho inner chamber of j what Uos.'-etti calls the “House of Life"
should be kept sacred. But Rossetti’s own j ease shows how impossible it is in these I flays to keep those recesses inviolable.
: The fierce light that beats upon rnen of genius grows fiercer and fiercer every day, and it cannot be quenched. This was one of my arguments when I first answered Mr. Watts-Dunton s own objee-j tion to the appearance of this monograph. The times have changed since he was a young man. Then publicity was shunned like a plague by poets and by painters. If j such men wish the light to be true as well as fiert-c, they must allow their friends to illuminate their "House of Life” by the lamp of truth. If Rossetti during his lifetime had allowed one of his friends who knew the secrets of his “ House of Life " to write about him, we might have been spared those canards about him and the wife he loved which were rife shortly after his death. Ryron's reluctance to take payment for his poetry was not a more belated relic of an old quixotism than is this dying passion for privacy. Publicity may be an evil, but it is an Inevitable evil, and great men must not let the wasps and the gadflies monopolize its uses. It may be a reminiscence of an older and a nobler social temper, the tom* per under the influence of which Rossetti in 1870 saitl that he felt abashed because a paragraph had appeared In The Athenaeum announcing tho fact that a book from him was forthcoming. But that temper has gone by forever. We live now in Very different times. Scores upon scores of unauthorized and absolutely false paragraphs about eminent men are published, especially about these two friends who have lived their poetic life together for more than a quarter of a ccntury. Only the other day I saw in a newspaper an offensive descriptive caricature of Mr, Swinburne, of his dress, &c. it is interesting to recall the fact that mendacious journalism was the cause of Mr. Watts-Dunton's very first contribution to The Athenaeum, before he wrote any reviews at all. At that time the offenders seem to have been chiefly Americans. The article Was not a review, but a letter signed *' Z.,*’ entitled The Art of Interviewing,” *nd it appeared in The Athenaeum of Ifarch 11, 187ft	‘
pleasure he had in life. I loved the man so deeply that I should nenr have introduced D'Arcy into tho novel had it not been in the hope of silencing the misrepresentations of him that began as soon us ever Rossetti was laid in the grave at Birchington. by depicting his character in coiors as true as they were sympathetic. It has been the grievous fate of Rossetti to be the victim of an amount of detraction which is simply amazing and inscrutable. 1 cannot in the least understand why this is so. It Is the great sorrow of my life. There is a fatality of dctractioa about his name which in its unreasonable- ' ness would be grotesque were it not heart* rending. It would turn my natural optimism about mankind into pessimism were It not that another dear friend of mine—a man of equal nobility of character and almost of equal genius, has escaped calumny altogether—William Morris. This matter is a painful puzzle to me. The only great man of my time who seems to have shared something of Rossetti's fate is Lord Tennyson. There seems to be a general desire to belittle him, to exaggerate such angularities as were his, and to speak of that almost childlike simplicity of character which was an ineffable charm in him as springing from boorishness and almost from loutishness. On the other hand, another great genius. Browning, for whom I had and have the greatest admiration, seems to be as fortunate as Morris In escaping the detractor. But I am wandering from Kossetti. I do not feel any impulse to write reminiscences of him. Too much has been written about him already—of late a great deal too much. The only thing written about him that has given me comfort, I may say joy, is this—it has been'written by a man who knew him before I did, who knew him at the time he lost his wife. Mr. Yal Prinsep, R. A., has declared that Jn Rossetti’s relations with his wife there was nothing whatever upon which his consciencc might reasonably trouble him.
I do not remember the exact words, but 'this was the substance of them. Mr. Val Prinsep is a man of the highest standing, and he knew Kossetti Intimately, and he has declared in print that Rossetti could have had no qualms of conscience in regard to his relations with his wife. This,
I say. Is a source of great comfort to me and to all who loved Rossetti. That he ■was whimsical, fanciful, and at times most troublesome to his friends no one knows better than I do.
“No one, I say, is more competent to speak of the whims and the fancies and the troublesomeness of Rossetti than I am; and yet I say that he was one of the noblest-hearted men of his time, and lovable-most lovable.”
■WATTS-DUNTON AND MORRIS.—It Is natural after writing, about Rossetti to think of William Morris. In* my opinion, the masterpiece among all Mr. Watts-Dunton's Athenaeum monographs Is the one upon -him. Between these two there was an Intimacy of the closest kind—from 1873 to the day of the poet’s death.
