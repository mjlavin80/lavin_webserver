Wednesday tlie announcement was made of the discovery in Lund, Sweden, of "a book containing the text of Shakespeare's 'Titus Andronicus,* printed in London Jn If this is true, It means that some
fortunate person lias unearthed the greatest of Shakespeare rarities, tlie lost quarto containing the first edition of "Titus Andronicus,” printed in London three years before tho earliest dated Shakespeare play known to collectors and bibliographers, the 15!)7 edition of “Richard the
Second.’*
The earliest edition of "Titus Andronicus** previously known is tlie one of 3C00, represented to-day by the two copies in the Bridgewater collection and the library of the University of Edinburgh. Somewhat less rare is the edition of 1011. tlffree
copies of which were described by Gres in IfSH). Three other copies are known,
! however; namely, fhe Daniel copy, now in the Alfred H. Hutli collection, Kngland, which brought £{t lfts. In 1SG4; the Perkins copy, for which Mr. William A. White, of Brooklyn, paid £35 in 1S89, and the fine large copy, with several uncut leaves, which became a part of another American collection in 3001, at the “ tall ” price of £G20. The edition of 3000 Is worth an enormous sum—the ** lost '* edition of 3594, if it is really extant, should equal the valuation which might be placed upon that unheard of rarity, an uncut copy of the First Folio Shakespeare. .
