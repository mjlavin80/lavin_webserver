KITJ KZLUX KLAN.
[HE CLANSMAN ” is the second in a scries of professedly historical novels which Mr. Thomas Dixon, Jr., has planned to write concerning tlie race conflict in the United States. In developing what the author claims to be the true story of the “Ku Klux Klan Conspiracy/* which, according: to him, overturned the reconstruction r6gime established by Congress afthe close ot the war, this book is the natural sequel to “ The Leopard’s Spots," since that was “a statement in historical outline of the conditions from the enfranchisement of the negro to his disfranchisement.’*
Though at this late day one may question tho wisdom as well as the taste of producing such books as *' The Clansman " to give fresh life to the bitter memories that have Inevitably lain between North and South since their awful feud, yet in view of the recent revival of the question of the black man’s status as an officeholder in the South there is a certain timeliness about the particular phase of the race question which Mr. Dixon here discusses. If the fact that he himself was born in North Carolina somewhat discounts tho surety of his taking a cold and impartial view of the main events upon the thread of which this story is hung, most of ills readers are too familiar with the subject matter to be led far astray from the facts by the author's passionate sympathy’ with his own cause, and all of them can appreciate its capacity for producing a thrilling romance. This “ The Clansman M certainly is, and it is by no means equally certain that the book paints in any too vivid colors the chaos of blind passion that in the North followed Lincoln's assassination or the reign of terror that resulted in the South. That a whole section of this Nation an<f its lawmakers should have even conceived, much less fought bitterly to carry into effect, the early measures of reconstruction as detailed in this story, seemS now incredible, but it Is nevertheless a matter of history to which the novelist has only added the impressiveness of Individual experiences and emotions.
The story is a burning indictment of tho policy of revenge pursued by Congress toward the South after amnesty had been offered and accepted. Most of the men who take part In the fiercc drama are historical figures, either boldly bearing their proper names or so thinly disguised under fictitious ones that there is no trouble in recognising for whom the portrait is intended. Among all the strong and remarkable personalities that this period in our National life developed and brought to the front none is by Mr. Dixon drawn with better comprehension or more loyal .sympathy than that of President Lincoln. It argues such a broad and generous anti unprejudiced view of things on Mr. Dixon's part that one is more inclined than perhaps he otherwise would be to trust his severity of judgment concerning Lincoln's opponents in Cabinet and Congress and the high-lmmled lawlessness ! with which they pursued their purposes j after his death.
Tho most sinister personality in the j book and the one upon which the author | has m°st largely expended his very con- | stderable powers of characterization :s , the Hon. Austin Stoneman, radical leader ! of Congress. In this man h<* undoubtedly meant to describe Thaddeus Stevens, , who so largely held the reins of power among his colleagues at that time, and always advocated the most drastic measures in the conduct of the war and in the treatment of “ the conquered provinces.’’ Mr. Dixon’s delineation of the man's character nnd acts is so frank that he evidently thought it the part of wisdom to give him the benefit of a name which cannot be found in the histories. The estimates of Mr. Stevens's serious biographers have not always been of a flattering character, but he shows up in " The Clansman " as little better than a malignant fiend, pursuing with relentless venom all who opposed his diabolical policy toward the ruined States that had seceded ami willing to make use of the vilest and most dishonorable means to compass his purpose—their subjection to the black population.
! But though the reality of Stoneman : seems questionable, only too true is the , picture which the author draws of the horrors which followed the bestowal of arms and civic rights upon the negroes of the South. It is little womier that to-day the white people uf those same States pas-[ sionateiy resent the least hint of a return j to the days when negro Legislatures and j negro officials east their terrible shadow ; over the land. Bad as such a state of things would be to theorize over, the actual endurance of it must have been so horrible that ons marvels how the men

who suffered It ever made peace with those who imposed it upon them.
The aims and accomplishments of the Ku Klux Klan, so far as Mr. Dixon describes them, seem wholly admirable, and , perhaps they were so as long as its orlgi-I nal purpose was pursued. It was organized to disarm the negroes and to protect the whites, with whom appeal to the law was useless when negroes held all offices. The mystic band of horsemen, with their white regalia and swift, silent meting out of punishment upon the guilty, are as effective In the story as they were in the region where thousands of terror-stricken people looked to them alone for safety. The double love story which winds through ** Tho Clansman ” is of somewhat subordinate interest, but ends happily for all concerned. One cannot but wonder at the use made by Mr, Dixon of the silly superstition that portraits can be ’ found in the eyes of the dead, and It would not wholly be a waste of time if he I had revealed the name of the game at : which Stoneman could stake a twenty-dollar gold piece " on the ace ” and win ! $1,400.
