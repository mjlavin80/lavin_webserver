TH no intention to reopen the animated discussion about the early American novel called " Alonzo and Melissa,’* which was carried on so briskly on Lhe readers* pages of The New York Times Book Review last Autumn, we print this week in the department of “ Current Comment ” Mr. Sidney S. Rider’s statement of ascertained facts concerning the authorship of that work. Mr. Edward B. 'Reed has lately contributed to The Waterbury (Conn.) American an interesting communication, takini? the opporins point “of view. He holds that Mitchell and not Jackson was the author. Mr. Heed believes, in spite of Mr. Rider’s perfectly clear argument to the contrary, that the tale was copyrighted in December, 1S10. He also produces a notice of the forthcoming publication of the book in The Albany Balance and State Journal for Jan. 8, 1811. He identifies Isaac Mitchell as a former editor of The Farmer’s Journal, The Political Barometer, and The Albany Crisis. It seems to us that Mr. Rider’s argument in favor of Jackson's authorship is the stronger. Both authorities agree as to the enormous circulation of this book. Mr. Rider says no other-i American novel “ ever had such a duration of life, and nothing^like such a sale, continuous for two. thirds of a century.” Mr. Reed has found editions j . dated 2824, 1S30, 1831, 1832, 1S3G, 1830, 1S!2, 1S4G, 1847, 1848, 1853, 18G4, 1879. He believes that for , - *
^nearly a quarter of a century "a new edition of
^‘Alonzo and Melissa’ appeared practically every
