Much Ado A bout an Index
Kcw York TtmCB Itaok Ilcviar:
It was tho erudite anil Ingenuous Mr. Edward Harwood who. more than a century ago, writing of the making of indexes, expressed the opinion that •* some of God’s creatures. in successive centuries, appear to have been by his divine Providence originally predestined to this great nnd useful end and it was Lord Campbell—was it not?—who proposed to deprive of the benefit of the copyright act any author who should print a book without an index. This Is my text—the application follows.
Some little while ago 1 read an announcement of the forthcoming issue by Harper & Brothers of a new and complete edition, in six volumes, of the poetical works of Algernon Charles Swinburne. Zt was stated that the poems had been collected and arranged by the poet himself, and that iL was intended to be the final and definitive form in which he desired his work to descend to posterity; and the publishers added, with a fine flourish, that it was an edition which it would be “ a joy and a distinction to possess.'* I was not altogether clear as to where the distinction ** came in. since the volumes were procurable by any one who could command twelve dollars or “ stand off ” his bookseller; but I was sure, from the description, that the possession would be a joy forever. Thereto ro, I ordered the books; and they came
to-day. Mechanically, there is no cause of complaint—clear-faced type, good paper, generous margins and substantial binding leave nothing to be desired in this respect. So far I was delighted— and then I bethought me to reread a few old favorites. I turned confidently to the end of the last volume to consult tho alphabetical index of titles which I felt of course I should find in its proper place— and any booklover may imagine my astonishment and distrust when I could find nothing of the kind. There is, as there 1 should be, prefixed to each volume a table of its contents, with the titles of the poems arranged in the order fn which they come in the volume; but the alphabetical index to the whole, which is much more essential, is conspicuous by its absence.
I have examined scores of volumes of poems in my library since 1 made the
disappointing discovery set fortii above, and T find that every one of them printed within the last two decades has an alphabetical index of titles, while most of them have an index of first lines In addition. It seems to me a very strange proceeding for a reputable publishing house to put forth with a flourish of trumpets an edition of tiie complete works of a sreat poet, M which it should be a joy and a distinction to possess,” and omit so indispensable an adjunct to its satisfactory use as an index. For my use the volumes are : tactically valueless. R L. C. WHITE.
