HOURS IN A LIBRARY.
THE NEW EDITION OF THE COLLECTED LITERARY ESSAYS BY THE LATE SIR LESLIE STEPHEN*
Written for The New York Thies Book Review by
H. W. BOYNTON.
TEPHEN once remarked	that it	is the
rarest of pleasures to be	able to	say of
any critical writing: “ Here is a distinct record of impressions at first hand." His own criticism has been wont to afford just that pleasure. The distinction of his work and its immediate effectiveness have been equally due to its personal quality. Independence and sincerity were his principal characteristics; and consequently eulogy played li^tie part in the recent post-mortem estimates of his character and work.
It would have been too patent an affront to his memory.	Nothing1 quite so roused his impatience	to the
point of anger as false notes, unless	it were	forced
notes. It seems, indeed, that his horror of cant came to amount almost to an obsession. It led him to make some unnecessary sacrifices in method (in the end he would have little dealing1 with any technical terms of criticism) and it betrayed him now and then into- some petulance of expression which may have caused the weak to stumble. In fact, literary snobbishness affected him much as social snobbishness used to affect his father-in-law, Thackeray. He had a similar raw sensitiveness to the possibility of a tu quoquo. In his later years the habit rather grew upon him of insisting upon what he was not, upon what he did not know, and of giving his positive judgments the air of having escaped him by a kind of inadvertence. His opinions are really clear enough and strong enough whenever he goes his way to holding an opinion at all. Only it is always his first business to restrict himself, to define his theme, to make certain waivers necessary to his peace of mind. His agnosticism extends to all subjects upon which the dull, the worthy, and the hypocritical may be supposed to have arrived at a consensus. He prefers to blaze his own trails, and to follow them at his own gait, on foot, with as little luggage as possible.
Most of his work, and all the best of it, lies in the field of English literature from Anne to Victoria. The period has hitherto won much attention from the dillettanti, but little study on the part of serious critics. Stephen was not content with assembling little objets d’art of the given school and pronouncing them not so bad. He began with a respect for eighteenth century literature which developed into strong admiration. In the end he became, if one pleases,*a kind of special pleader: he drew comparisons unflattering to the nineteenth century, and indulged in some girding at the conventional commentators. It should not escape us that he was essentially a humorist, and that his ironical habit in this and other connections sprang from a reaction of sensibility and not from superciliousness.
The Oxford lectures on “ English Literature and Society in the Eighteenth Century," published only the other day, represented a kind of precipitation from his detached studies in that period. These studies had been, as everybody knows, Very numerous, and, though Stephen considered himself more properly a biographer, a good many of them naturally took the essay form. An American publisher now promises us a complete authorized edition of these *4 essays, literary and critical,” (we do not see that the distinction amounts to much in Stephen’s case,) and leads off with a four-volume version, somewhat expanded, of “ Hours in a Library.*’ The volumes, we may say tn passing, are attractive In appearance, but not strongly bound, -and with a text injured by far too many slips In proofreading,	'
To read these essays consecutively (and many of . them are altogether new to the present reviewer) is to get a strong impression of the critic’s personality. These adventures among masterpieces are, as we . have suggestedi the adventures of a humorist. They would often seem inadequate to the Dryasdust, they would often baffle .the literal mind. Like alj strong men, Stephen had his blind spots and his hobbies; his criticism; was, thank Heaven, by no. means unbiased. The question of real importance 13, What were • the sources of his prejudice? Hatred of cant seems ' to'account for most of them. How irritable he grew j over the glib use of.technical or conventional phrases!'
' "I can use the words," he admits, "as easily as my neighbors* The only thing T find difficult is to look wise when.I use them,- or to fancy that I give an;ex-planation because I have .adopted a classification.” Psychological; analysis is an overworked- phrase ’ •

of 1 “ tho modern jargon”; *• realist" is rnothing better than a nickname; " objective ’* and “ subjective *' are terms mainly used to conceal vagueness of though I. He never uses the -word Nature •* •without instinctively putting himself on' his guard against some bit of slipshod criticism or sham philosophy. He heartily wishes the word coulu be turned out of the language.’* In the essay on Fielding's novels, Stephen says with, we feel, not unjustifiable impatience:
" Fielding, we might say, paints flesh and blood, whereas Richardson consciously constructs his puppets out of frigid abstractions. Lovelace is a bit of mechanism; Tom Jones a human being. In fact, however, such comparisons are misleading. Nothing is easier than to find an appropriate ticket for the objects of our criticism, and summarUy pigeonhole Richardson as an idealist and Fielding as a realist; Richardson as subjective and morbid, Fielding as objective and full of coarse health; or to attribute to either of them the deepest knowledge of the human heart. These arc the mere banalities of criticism; and I can never hear them without a suspicion that a professor of aesthetics is trying to hoodwink me by a bit of technical platitude. The cant phrases which have been used so often by panegyrists too lazy to define their terms have become almost as meaningless as the complimentary formulae of society.”
This sounds a little like growling, but it Is the growling of a healthy man over " green and yellow French cookery,” or, shall we say, of a healthy anima] over a marrowless bone. The word Philistine he understands properly to denote indifference to the higher intellectual interests. The word may also be defined, however, as the name applied by prigs to the rest of their species. And,” he adds, " I hold that the modem fashion of using it as a common term of abuse amounts to a literary nuisance. It enables intellectual coxcombs to brand men with an offensive epithet for being a degree more manly than themselves.” It is natural that so uncompromising a stickler for manliness should define the sentimentalist as “ a man who understands to perfection the art of enjoying his own good feelings without troubling himself to translate them into practice."
His skepticism often touches upon matters ot more fundamental Importance. In his disposition to allow all possible leeway to unliterary persons he is led to a whimsical belittling of his own specific function as critic, and to the most liberal speculations with regard to art itself.
" There is,” he admits candidly, “ a good deal to be said for the thesis that all fiction is really a kind of lying, and that art in general is a luxurious indulgence to Tvhich we have no right while crime and disease are rampant in the outward world.”
But Stephen’s criticism never really exhausted itself in this kind of irony. In other moods we find him frankly expressing his preference for life and nature as interpreted by art. The artist gets his material from all sources, but that material becomes of use to tlie world only when " it has been perfectly assimilated and transformed by the action of the poetic imagination.” He believes that a moral quality inheres in real works of art, and lias his quiet smite at the expense of thoss sensitive persons who shrink from any evidence of moral purpose on the part of poets or novelists; for his part, he confesses that he is ** rather glad to find ideas anywhere.” He sees a profitable aspect of even such didacticism as Richardson's. He has a very serious sense of the difficulty and the importance of the critical office—“ to be alternately witness and judge; to feel strongly and yet to analyze coolly; to love every feature In a familiar face, and yet to decide calmly upon its intrinsic ugliness or beauty. To bL- an adequate critic is r.lmost to bo a contradiction in terms; to be susceptible to a force, and yet free from its influence; to be moving with the stream, and yet to be standing on the bank.”
Stephen himself came quite as near the attainment of this balance as we could have desired him to come. It is a pleasure to watch a judicial mind when in its moments of recreation }t gets fairly astride of a hobby. Stephen had ! fixed theories to the effect that an artist of one sex cannot be expected to portray persons of the other sex; that people who talk about nature { are hypocrites, and so on. And lie has | a persistent habit of speculating upon ! what might have been if conditions had not been what they were, verily the id!*-st of habits for a critic to succumb j to. Stephen himself expresses distrust i of the method, but he is continually drifting into it. What if Pope had not been a cripple, or Coleridge an opium-eater, j or Charlotte Bronte a country governess? There is no limit to tlie number of such questions which anybody can propound. They effect nothing, they lend nowhere, and failing to fructify the critical faculty they tend to sterilize it.
The present essays deal almost entirely with the poetry and fiction of the critic’s favorite period. To choose among them would be mainly to express an arbitrary or personal preference. The essays on
the novelists, especially those on Richardson, Sterne, and Charlotte Bronte, seem to one reader to be of more permanent excellence than the papers which deal with poets and poetry, Stephen has given somewhere an explanation of his not having written poetry on the ground that he could not manage metre and rhyme. Without taking the remark too seriously, we may suppose that It does suggest a limitation; " a prosaic mind," as he called it, the critic seems in some sense to have had. It would be Idle to draw a sharp line between “ creative ” writing and such critical work as his; but he was not a poetical creator, and could not therefore (we may assert It boldly) take place among the greater critics or poetry.
There are innumerable passages in these essays which beg to be quoted—a brilliant phrase such as that in which the essayist characterizes Do Quincey as M the adjective of which Coleridge was the substantive; ” or a pregnant sentence like this one about Fielding: “ His morality Is at the superior antipodes from the cynicism of a Wychcrley; and far superior to the prurient sentimentalism of. Sterne or the hot-pressed priggishness of a Richardson, or even the reckless bohemtanism of Smollett/* There are two passages, however, which, quoted together,, may serve to suggest fairly well the important service which Stephen himself performed. The first of these suggests the plight in which the critic finds his world:	'*	We
commonplace beings are hurried along in the crowd, living from hand to mouth on such slices of material and spiritual food as happen to drift in our direction, with little more power of taking an independent course, or of forming any general theory, than the polyps which are carried along by an oceanic current. Ask any man what he thinks of the world in which lie is placed: whether, for example. It Is on the whole a scene of happiness or misery, and he will either answer by some cut-and-drled fragments of what was once wisdom, or he will confine himself to a few incoherent details. He had a good dinner to-day, and a bad toothache yesterday, and a family affliction or blessing the day before. But he is as incapable of summing up his impressions as his infant of performing an operation In the differential calculus. It is as rare as It is refreshing to find a man who can stand on his own legs and be conscious of his own feelings, who is sturdy enough to react as well as to transmit action, and lofty enough to raise himself above the hurrying crowd and have some distinct belief as to whence it is coming and whither it is going.*’ Stephen was about to speak of Johnson; he himself professed little certainty as to many questions of whence and whither. It was not his main business to assert; it was rather to per* form the function which he ascribed to the humorist; “ to strip off the commonplaces by which we have tacitly agreed to cover over our doubts and misgivings, and to explode empty pretenses by the touch of a vigorous originality.”
