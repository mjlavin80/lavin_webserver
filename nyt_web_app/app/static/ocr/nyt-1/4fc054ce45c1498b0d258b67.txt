Longmans. Green & Un. tire about lo brins out this new bonk by Prof. Herbert Hall Turner, L>.Sc.. I'"*. H. S.. of the I ni-vcrsity of Oxford. The author’s aim is to Illustrate " l»y the study of a few examples, chosen almost at random, the i variety in clianyjier of astronomical dis- , coveries. An attempt has indeed been made to arrange the half-dozen examples, once selected, into a rou^h sequence, ac- :
cording to the amount of ' chance ' nsso-eialed with the discovery."	1
There are six chapters—" Uranus and Eros.'* " The Discovery of Neptune."
*■ Bradley s Discoveries of the Aberration of Light and of the Nutation of tho Earth's Axis," ** Accidental Discoveries."
" Sehwabe and the Sun Spot Period," and “ The Variation of Latitude.'* They correspond approximately to a series of six lectures delivered by I he author at the University of Chicago in August, UKM, at the invitation of President Harper. At that time Prof. Turner had the opportunity of seeing ** something of this wonderful university, only a dozen years old, and yet so amazingly vigorous; and especially of its observatory, (the Yerkes observatory, situated eighty miles away on. Lake Geneva,) which is only eight years old, and yet has taken Its placc in .the foremost rank." In concluding his book the author writes;
The one positive conclusion which we may derive from the examples studied : is that discoveries are seldom made without both hard work and conspicuous ability. A new planet, even as large as Ura-. nus, docs not reveal itself to a passive observer; thirteen times it may appear to such a one without fear of detection, until at last it encounters an alert Her-schel, who suspects, tests, and verifies, and even then announces a comet—so little did he realize the whole truth. Fifteen years of unrequited labor before As-traea was found, nineteen years of observation before the discovery of nutation could bo announced. * * * That the necessary labor is so often forgotten must be my excuse for calling attention to it somewhat persistently in these examples.
An index’ and numerous illustrations have been added.
