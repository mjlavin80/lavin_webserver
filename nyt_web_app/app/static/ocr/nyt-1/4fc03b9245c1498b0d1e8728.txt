Mr. Crockett says of this volume: “It Is my desire not so much to write a new book about Galloway as to focus and concentrate what I have already written for the use of Galloway lovers and Galloway travelers." Accordingly, with much intimate and discursive matter about the region in question are incor-! porated many passages from the author’s | various Scottish romances- To a native of Galloway, or to a person steeped in Mr. Crockett's books as some arc steeped ; In Stevenson or Scott or Thackeray, the whole may well be delightful. To the ordinary Philistinic reader much of It will appear superfluous—though even he must catch at $imes the infection of Mr. Crockett's enthusiasm and feel the charm of this bit and that of panegyric ( of reminiscence or local color. For it Is not tho country only that the author writes about He steps aside for some major or minor historical characters, he tells of his boyhood days on this and that Galloway farm, he discourses on Scots humor of sundry brands—the original
horseplay variety seen In Seott and Burns—the kailyard kind wliereof himself and Ian McLaren and James M. Barrie have each been at times exemplars, the grim, ironical, sort. Then he talks of the Scots language, which he avers is a fine, proper tongue, no more to be corrupted with local Idiom than the ,
King's best London English. In other words, lie urges writers of Scots to avoid local dialects and provincial and vulgar words peculiar, say, to Galloway or the Lothians, and stick to the pure tongue used by Sir Walter and before and after him.
Incidentally Mr. Crockett gets in some resounding whacks at his critics—one in particular, who spoke of the “ caninity of his Latin ” when he wrote of an Abbey of Dulce Cor. For an abbey of Dulce Cor— Douce Coeur—Sweetheart, there Is, though more currently called New Abbey, a foundation of Devorgilla, wife of John Baliol, who there enshrined her husband's heart. By way of further satisfaction Mr. Crockett recites some of the ill-natured things tlie critics said about Sir Walter, and, so consoled, returns to his Galloway with its hills, lochs, heather, whaups, blackfaced sheep, and memories of troublous times—of Covenanters, cattle thieves, raiders, Douglases, Thus it Is written feays Mr. Crockett) in a certain family register along with much religious reflection: "This day and date our Jock stickit to deld Wat Maxwell in Traquair. [ Glory be to the Father and to the Son.'* And a Galloway jury goes upon the record thus: " We find that the prisoner killit not the particular man aforesaid, yet that neverthelesse he is deserving of hanging.” And hanged he was! -Sir. Joseph Pennell's drawings show chiefly Galloway landscapes—effects of desolate hills and clouds with now a bit of sea and. now a bridge or a farmstead or village street. There are several drawings, too, of the Sweetheart Abbey already mentioned. As pictures they are exceedingly pleasing, and Mr. Crockett is warrant foe the truthfulness of the intrepreta-tion of Galloway. Read In the proper mood the book will be found a pleasant and restful thing. One must not, however, pick it up in an energetic frame of mind.
