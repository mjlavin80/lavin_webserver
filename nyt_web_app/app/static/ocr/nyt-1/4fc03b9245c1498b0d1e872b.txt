E publish elsewhere this week some extremely interesting1 speculations of an enthusiast on the possibilities of great literary discoveries in the coming unearthing of Herculaneum. Prof. Charles Waldstein, the director of this work, who has lately been in New York, exerts an inspiring influence on all who come in contact with him. There Is no doubt that the project will be carried out successfully. Men of vast wealth, the world over, who are interested in the arts and the advancement of learning, will see that the money needed is not lacking. As to whether or not the lost lyrics of Sappho and^he lost plays of Menander may be found, that is another story. But if ever there was a time for extravagant conjecture to this end, this is the time. Herculaneum was a seat of learning, an abiding place of Greek culture, not like Pompeii, a resort only of gayety, sport and high living.
