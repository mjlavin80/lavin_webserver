Tuthor. T»*J \V. .Tilth St) This volume is the result of the author's nine years’ experience as a teacher in various hospi-lals: she regards tlie preparation of food as a science as well as an art, its ehemis-try as precise as that of tho laboratory. Diet in disease Is one part of the volume; diet in Infancy takes up another, and the third tells how to prepare “ liquid, semiliquid and solid foods." Throughout the book each new chapter is prefaced by a straightforward little talk on what is the best way and why it is tho best: the Introduction explains the object and value of food, gives general rules for feeding the sick, show.*! just how to set the tray most artistically to tempt the invalid s capricious appetite, nnd finally explains the measurements used in a lucid fashion. The appendix contains practical suggestions for the nurse in tlio sick
room, and tables of various kinds; equivalents, percentage solutions, calories', thermometers, &o. Two indexes are provided, one to the recipes and one to the chapter, on Diet hi Disease. The binding Is a slate colored calico striped with broad while lines. Though only a year old, this is the second edition of the book. Many physicians and surgeons are credited with helpful suggestions in the preface.	.
