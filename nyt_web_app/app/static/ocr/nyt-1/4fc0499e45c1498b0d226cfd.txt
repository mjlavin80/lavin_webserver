In 1S05 Mr. Valentine Geere. at Prof. Flinders Petrie's request, was given an appointment on the staff of the expedition about to start for Mesopotamia to continue the work of excavating the ruins of Nippur. The author of "The Nile and the Euphrates,’* uses indifferently *' Nippur" and '* Niffer,” accepting rather "Niffer." The book* as its second title designates, is one not of discovery alone, but of adventure also. Mr. Geere was in the employ of the University of Pennsylvania and the excavations carrlcd out so successfully were begun in 1889. Of-Prof. Hilprecht he writes in the most laudatory terms. It was Hilprecht, he says, who alone saved the work from failure. After many adventures Mr. Geere arrived In Egypt. He writes: "Between unsettled, poverty-stricken, and neglected Mesopotamia, and well-ordered, J flourishing Egypt There is a vast differ-ene&.” From Cairo Mr. Geere went to Behneseh, where Prof. Petrie was then carrying out his work of investigation. Under Roman rule Belinesch was known as Oxyrhynchus, and was splendid with its public buildings. Now it is a heap of ruins, with mounds of rubbish. Wandering over the place he found remains of past glories In the guise of tile work. When the workmen dug up the first .. mummy they were frightened out of their wits and dropped picks and shovels. At first the yield was deemed insignificant, as being too modern, and Prof. Petrie was disappointed. After he had left the place, came Messrs. Grenfell and Lunt, and the great treasury of papyri was discovered. In the Autumn of ISOS Mr, Geere was with the American archaeologists before Nippur, and ho thinks that the size of the old place has been very much exaggerated.
The ideas of Babylon’s vastness and magnificence, to which we have become ‘ accustomed, have been practically exploded. Dr. Koldewey told me, it is true, that the site of the city was "larger than that of any other ancient city": but even so, the idea that it 1 could be compared with London and Its suburbs, which has been very generally held, is entirely erroneous. Tn point of fact, it appears that its walls
were not more than eight miles in circumference. Moreover, the great palaces , are shown to have been poor affairs after ; ail, with wretchedly cramped apartments, and next to no pretensions to architectural style; and the temples exceedingly crude buildings.
