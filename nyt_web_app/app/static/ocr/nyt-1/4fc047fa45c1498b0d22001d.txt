A volume of ton lectures oir Shakespeare’s four principal tragedies, “ Hamlet," " Othello." ** Kins L,ear," and “ Macbeth,” by Prof. A. C. Bradley of the Vnivcrsity of Oxford, is published this
week hy the Macmillan Company. Jn these lectures. Prof. Bradley writes in his introduction, ho considers the tragedies from " a single ” point of view.
Nothing will bo said or Shakespeare’s place in the history of either Knghsh literature or of til*' drama in general. No attempt will he made to compart* him with other writers. I shall leave im-loiiclit'il, or merely #?J:in<-od at. questions regarding his life and character, the development of his gonitis and art. tho g< 11-uineiH-ss, sources,* texts, interrelations of his various works, liven what may he Vallwl, in a restricted sense, the ** poetry” of the four tragedies —the beauties of style, diction, versification- -1 shall pass bv in silence. Our one object will be v.'liat. ngnm in a restricted sense, may be called dramatic appreciation.
Besides the lectures on the tragedies themselves, Prof. Bradley writes on ** The Substance of Shakespearean Tragedy,” *' Construction In Shakespeare’s Tragedies,” and ** Shakespeare’s Tragic Period." He says of these “ preliminary ” discussions;
Though cacli is individual through and through, they have, in a sense, one and tho same substance, for in sll of them Shakespeare represents the tragic aspect of life, the tragic fact. They have, again, up to a certain point, a common form or structure. This substance and this structure, which would be found to distinguish them, for example, from Grerk tragedies, may, to diminish repetition, be considered once for all. and in considering them wc shall also be nble to observe characr tcrlstic differences among the four plays. And to this may be added the. h*itle that it seems- necessary to premise on the position of these dramas fn Shakespeare s literary career.
