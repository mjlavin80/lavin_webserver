The story or tlmt memorable raid by John Brown on Harper’s Ferry could hardly have been more truthfully find vividly presented, and at the same time clothed with preater Interest than liafi been done by Mr. McManus of ynur city In his recent work entitled " The Boy and the Outlaw.*’ The book presents a coterie of unique characters that enter Into nnd form a story that from beginning to end abounds in Interest to both tho young and to tlie old, nnd at the same time so sets forth tho incidents of that ever-to-be-famous raid as to present a delightful commingling of facts nnd fiction. For his success in tills Mr. McManus is certainly entitled to no little praise, and for the entertainment recently enjoyed from his ron I would at least add this slight expression of my gratification.
