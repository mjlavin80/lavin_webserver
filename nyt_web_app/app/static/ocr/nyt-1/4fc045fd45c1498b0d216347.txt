HERCULANEUI.
What May Result from tlie Unearthing of the Famous Roman Libraries in the Buried City.
N a few months tlio world may see a recrudescence of interest in the classics comparable only lo the great Renaissance of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. If tlio hopes of Prof. Charles Waldstein and those associated with him in the plan to excavate Herculuncum are fulfilled— and there is everj* prospect that they will be fulfilled—we may be able before long to read the hitherto lost masterpieces of antiquity, the works of the ancients in the search for which kO many of the Italian humanists gave their lives.	!
The element of chance has very little to do with the Herculaneum scheme. There will be no worlc In the dark, as in tlie case ot Crete and Cyprus. It is as certain as anything can be in this world that buried far beneath the soil, preserved from decay by tlie peculiar mixture of friable ash and Water which overwhelmed Herculaneum, 1 there arc many splendid libraries which belonged to the Roman gentlemen who made up the Herculaneum colony.
Only one villa of ail those at Herculaneum has so far been laid bare. In that villa nearly 2,(MX) papyri were found. They Were unrolled by a delicate process invented for the purpose, and the contents of a largo number of them have been deciphered. Unfortunately the library turned out to be that of a specialist, a man who was interested in the Epicurean philosophy and in nothing else, but the chances are that this library was the only one of its kind in the city, and that in the other splendid villus there the papyri will prove to be of a general character, containing the works which represented in the first century of the Christian era the cultivation of tho world.
And this means so much that tlie prospect is enough to make the brain of a modei’ii Hellenist reel. For, of course, the culture of Herculaneum was Hellenic. It was the Greek authors who were discussed at dinners and at the bath; statuary from Greece adorned the homes of the patricians; Greek slaves were ein-ployed in preference to all others.
As early as the first century B. C. th^re were notable private libraries in Home. That of the grammarian Tyrannion eon-sis ted of MO,000 rolls, and At ticus, the friend of Ciccro, had a splendid collection. At tho time when Herculaneum was overwhelmed tho library was as much an established part of a great private house as it Is to-day. The b^olcs were kept in closets. In rooms specially built for the purpose, catalogues were prepared, and the care of the books was intrusted to librarians.
"What may not be expected when ilie libraries of the dwellers m Herculaneum
are unveiled?	of	all, of coun-<-, come
the poems of Sappho, the loss of which lias been the greatest of its kind that the world has suffered. John Addington Sy-monds expresses this view* and declares that *'so perfect are the smallest fragments that we muse in a sad rapture of astonishment 10 think what the complete poems must have been. * * * Of all the poets of the world, of all the illustrious artists of all literature, Sappho is the one ; whose every word has a peculiar and un- '
mistnkable ,perfume, a seal of absolute perfection and inimitable grace.**'
Surely many copies of the verses of Sappho must lie buried at Herculaneum, and surely, too, were nothing else to he found the recovery of these exquisite things would repay nil the cost of the impending excavations.
After Sappho in importance the choice Is a very wide one. Some may be Inclined to place the lost works of Menander in the first place. What we Jcnow of his comedies now Is chiefly from the adaptations by Terence. That he was read and quoted far Into the Christian era Is sufficient argument for the assertion that copies of his works will be found at llerculancum. But perhaps an even more desirable find would be the 'lost plays of Aeschylus. Of hts ninety plays, tho titles of seventy-nine of which arc known, less than a dozen are now extant.
Undoubtedly some of the most beautiful literary work lost to the world is that of the Greek lyric poets. In recent years interest in the Greek Anthology has greatly increased, and this anthology is but the merest fragment or what was produced und has vanished. In the domain of history finds of surpassing importance may be expected. When, as is often the case, a few words on a papyrus shed a flood of light on things previously obscure, the amount of valuable material which may be expected should a whole Roman library be discovered is incalculable.
Prof. Walstein is an enthusiast in regard to his plan, and, what is more to the point, he has succeeded In communicating his enthusiasm to heads of States and to wealthy men in this country and in Europe. He hopes that the work at Herculaneum will he begun very soon, perhaps within three months, and if things go well and unexpected difficulties are not encountered the present year may be the most important for learning and art and history of any since the lime of Aldus and the Medici.
