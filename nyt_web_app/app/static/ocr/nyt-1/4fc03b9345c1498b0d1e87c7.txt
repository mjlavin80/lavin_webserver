HACKERAY AND DICKENS.—I was reading the other day of a man at a public dinner many years ago who, proposing the toast of literature, conclud-
V	.	.ed: " I drink to tlie health
.. of two of the greatest forces in fiction in Ithe nineteenth century, Dackens and , Ttilckeray—no, no, I mean Dackeray and Thickens." With a mighty effort he ^pulled himself together and began again: '-** Gentlemen, I drink to the health of Thackens and Dlckeray." Then he 3at
down, pleased at having extricated himself from the muddle.
The anecdote is trivial, but. In a way, t$T>lcaI. As Beaumont and Fletcher are always allied in the popular ralnd, so Thackeray and Dickens are always contrasted. The result Is identical. The thought of one writer conjures up the other. In the midst of a group of people say something about Thackeray, and you ‘will be bombarded with statements about Dickens.
It is sometimes said the men were not rivals. -As well say they were angels. For many years Thackeray envied Dickens's popularity and financial success; forever Dickens was Jealous of Thackeray’s style. Undoubtedly Thackeray was spurred to fresh effort by each new success of his great contemporary. “ I say it [* David Copperfield '] has put me on my mettle, and made me fiel I must do something: that 1 have fame, and name, and family to support." Though in private, as in public, he was lavish in
praise of Dickens's works, yet in an unusually confidential moment he remarked; “He knows that my books are a protest against his—that if one set are true the other must be false.”
Even to-day there arc few who will assert that they read with equal pleasure the works of both writers. Mr. Andrew Lang is a notable exception, but he is a man of letters with tastes unusually .catholic. As Lowell said, Dickens was a satirlzer, Thackeray a satirist. The former is undoubtedly >he gift which attracts the multitude. Readers of all classes appreciate Dickens; It is rare that an admirer of Thackeray’s works is found among the unlettered.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the cult of Thackeray is not so extensive as that of the author of “ Pickwick,'* There is no Titmarsh Club, nor Is there a Thackeray Fellowship, including the two millionaires recently claimed as adherents of Dickens.—Lewis Melville, The Book Monthly, London.
HENRIK IBSEN.—Ibsen is a reflective poet, one to whom the idea presents itself before the picture: with Shakespeare and Goethe the idea and form were simultaneously born. His art is great and varied, yet it is never exercised as a sheer play of form or color or wit. A romantic originally, he pays the tax to beauty by his vivid symbolism and his
rare formal perfections. And a romantic is always a revolutionist Embittered in youth—proud, self-contained, retlcent—he waged war with life for over a half century; fought for his artistic ideals as did Richard Wagner; and. like Wagner, he lias swept the younger generation along with him. He, the greatest moral artist of his century, Tolstoy not excepted, was reviled for what he had not said or done —so difficult was It to apprehend his new, elusive method. A polemist he is, as were Byron and Shelley, Tolstoy1 and Dickens, Turgenev and Dostoievsky. Born a Northman, he is melancholic, though not veritably pessimistic of temperament. Monll indignation in him
must not be confounded with the pessimism that sees no future hope for mankind. The North breeds mystics. Shakespeare would have made his Hamlet a Scandinavian even if the legendary Hamlet and the earlier play.had not existed. The brief white nights, the chilly cllmatc. the rugged, awful scenery react on sensitive natures like Ibsen’s. And then the various strains in his blood must not be forgot ten—Danish, German, Norwegian, and Sc< tch. Thus we get a gamut of moods—i.nilosophlc, poetic, mystic, and analytic. And If he too frequently depicts pathologic states, is it not the fault of his epoch? Few dramatists have been more responsive to their century,—James Huneker in The Smart Set.
SOMERSET MAUGHAM HAS NOT ADVANCED.—LooWng back upon the dying year, one is struck by the absence of any new writer to dispute the acknowledged supremacy—in fiction, at any rate— of Mr. George Meredith. Mr. Anthony Hope, Mr. H. G. Wells, and Mr. Stanley Weyman have all maintained their reputation. but have done little to advance it, and Mr. Somerset Maugham, who, in the eyes of some judges, seemed likely to draw into the fnjnt rank, has contented i himself with giving us an earlier work in
! a new shape. George Gissing, who ' worked, at any rate, an original and un, familiar vein, is dead, and we look in
I	vain for the Stevensons and Henleys who, at one time, seemed likely to bo the pioneers of a new departure in literature. Whether this Is any way connected with the fact vouched for by most publishers that 1004 is the worst year the trade has yet known does not immediately appear; but we seem to be at present in a sort of literary backwater, and must wait for the flood to rise before we get out of it.
i	In this, as in other matters, perhaps overproduction is responsible for a good deal,—Pall Mall Gazette.	~
A GERMAN/^NOVELIST,—In point of style it is generally admitted that Peter
Rosegger has no caual among contemporary German ■writers. He has newly finished a remarkable novel, to which he has given the daring title, “ I. N. R. I,” The book purports to be written by a carpenter of Socialistic tendencies who is in
prison awaiting capital punishment. To occupy his time he writes a Life of Christ from his own peculiar standpoint and based on recollections of .his early teaching. It is a story within a story, and ends with great dramatic intensity and skill. Tho book, which is wrftten with extraordinary delicacy and charm, will shortly be translated by Miss Elizabeth Lee, whose translation of Max Nordau's ** Morgantlc" has met with so much praise.—London Bookman.
NOVELS OF THE HOUR.—No one can deny that there is an immense amount of ’ energy, industry, and real talent brought to bear upon the composition of prose fiction. The average would compare very favorably with that of some twenty, or thirty, or forty years ago. There are any
number of clever ladies and gentlemen, in these times, who can construct a readable story, enlivened with plenty of incident, and embodying the results of a good deal of observation, plenty of hard work, and some knowledge of life and character. What strikes one about these works is that they are, for the most part, mechanical, and, so to speak, mercantile. They are articles of commerce, turped out, as it were, to scale and pattern, in order to supply a demand which is as constant and almost as regular as the demand for cotton blouses or silk neckties. It is known that there arc so many hundreds of thousands of persons who must be furnished with so much reading matter, weekly, monthly, and dlurnally. The reading habit is as pervading and persistent as the tea habit or the tobacco habit. The great majority of the adult and adolescent male and female population of these islands require to be looking at something in print, when they are not at work or asleep, or engaged in some form of active recreation; and when they arc not reading newspapers or magazines they want to read novels. So of course novels will be purveyed to them, of the kind and in tlie style suited to their tastes and. capacities. There is no occasion that one can see to complain of this tendency or to protest dgainst it. But naturally it does not exactly lead to distinction In style or treatment on the part of the sedulous literary tradesman, working hard to overtake his
market; nor. in most cases, is such distinction asked for or appreciated. There are people who read a novel every week; there are people who read one every two days. Under such circumstances, the finer qualities of literature are out of place. The ordinary novel is a kind of light dinner claret, that one can consume at each meal, in reasonably large potions, without coming to any harm. A really generous vintage, with flavor and strength, taken under these conditions, might be less welcome, and would hardly be so innocuous.—London Standard.
BOOKS OF 1004.—What is the general impression left on the mind by the books of last year? Chiefly one of number, I think: a vague, benumbing sense of overpowering quantity, which, In the case of the novels, almost amounts to a nightmare. There were nearly 6,000 books produced in all, and of these one-sixth were novels—one thousand novels in twelve months! That is over eighty a month,
over twenty a week, nearly three a day! How is it possible to explain such fecundity? Above all, how is it possible to form anything but a confused idea of their general character, their different varieties, their respective merits? Verdant Green's memory of Oxford—a mass of spires and pinnacles and domes and battlements jostling each other in most admired disorder—would be mere child’s play compared with the recollection of a thousand novels. But at least of one
thing we may be sure. Whatever value the literary output of 100i may possess, it will not be found in the novelistic sphere. It may be discovered in history, perhaps, or still more likely in biography. Possibly something may be said for books of travel, and there were certainly one or two interesting essays in literary criticism. But in poetry, except for the reissue of Mr. Swinburne's and Mr. William Watson’s work, and some would add Mr. Hardy’s “ Dynasts," Mr. Stephen Phillips’s “ The Sin of David,’* and the work of Mr, Alfred Noyes and Mr. Money-Coutts, the field is barren; while in nov- , els the general definition would remind one of Euclid's line, length without breadth, with a reminiscence also of the point as that which has no parts and no magnitude. In detail, of course, such summary treatment would be unjust. | There are some novels that are to be re-membered—one or two which touch high levels of imaginative art. But they are submerged beneath the deluge of ephemeral work, produced, for the most part, at the cost of the author, and ei'entually disappearing as “ remainders." And very few indeed have succeeded in laying a spell upon the reader, or in communicating an unforgettable charm—which is, after all. the real test of a lasting work art.—W.~L. Courtney in London Telegraph.
MOTLEY’S '* DUTCH REPUBLIC."— Motley, in fact, is that rarest of writers, the picturesque historian with a sense of
justice. lie marshals the great pageant, of the time with a touch as sure and effective as thnt of Froudc, but, unlike Froudc, he Indulges In no distorting fa-vorltlsms. It may be said, indeed, that
Motley’s historic or dramatic genius—tho two are more akin than Is commonly realized—swayed him to justice almost against hts will. His ardors are all for the Netherlands, and against Philip, Spain, and Catholicism. The natural hero of his story is William of Orange, whoso steadfast and selfless courage, wise statesmanship, and magnanimous spirit receive full recognition at his hands. Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, Philip’s great General and a foe more terrible, because more skillful than Alva's self to the Protestant cause, is outside the pale of his professed sympathies. Yet he cannot miss the heroic traits in Farnese’s character; the indomitable will, the unerring generalship, the flawless loyalty to an unworthy master. Motley protests, he insists on Parma’s unscrupulous diplomacy: he warns his readers pathetically against the domination of a personality to which he has himself succumbed. It is all in vain; Parma stands out no less a hero in the tragedy than William's self. It is the same throughout. Don John, the young hero of Lepanto, who was to fall and die heartbroken In the struggle against William's sagacious policy and his own King’s 1 ingratitude, is as vividly nnd pathetically portrayed as Louis of Nassau, " the Bayard of the Netherlands," who shed a brief lustre of roman ae across tho austere cause of the Calvinists. In contrast to the Impassioned loyalists and reformers, Elizabeth of England shows In her least heroic aspect, that of the colossal time-server, neither Catholic nor Protestant at heart; averse from giving aid to rebellion against a crowned King, yet resolved that the Netherlands shall causc Philip all possible embarrassment. Not the Good Queen Bess of English tradition, this, but the suspicious, penurious Elizabeth of unflattering history. In his handling of the courteous duel between Parma and Elizabeth, as In many other passages, Motley proves his possession of that final gift of the historian: a sense of humor.—Dora Greenwell McChesnoy in Thu London Academy.
ROBERT HERRICK'S " THE COMMON LOT."—This thoughtful and Inter- ! esting study of professional life in Chicago will increase its author’s reputation. Indiscriminate satire directed against the ! methods and manners of the overrlch in America by their less affluent fellow-countrymen has begun to pall, so that we welcome a more judicial and artistic
presentment of American life, in which the millionaires are relegated to their due ; position of unimportance compared with ! the collective influence of National tend-encles or the spirit of a great city. Mr. Herrick soberly reprobates the corruption and peculation which are so frequently the causes or accompaniments of exuberant success in moneymaking; but he is careful to Indicate that some of the successful are honest and unostentatious, and that ** most of our best people are religious and moral," and he anticipates that the cra2e for accumulating and
spending dollars will eventually abate, so
that men " will respect learning, ideas, and devotion to the public welfare." He gives us intimations of the luxuriant development in America of individuality, which British institutions and tradiLions tend to nip in the bud.—London Athenaeum.
HANOTAUX’S NEW VOLUME.—The second volume of M The History of Contemporary France," by M. Hanotaux, has been awaited with Interest by statesmen, politicians, and historians who have to deal with the actual problems of international life. The importance of history, and especially of contemporary history, is being brought home with increasing force to those who have to deal with affairs of
state. Knowledge of history is not of prime necessity for a statesman, but it i3 absolutely essential to enable him to make the most of experience. A man of genius can do great things by the light of self-illuminating intellect: but, however bright his genius may be. It is certain that he never will shine with full lustre, and do complete justice to himself, if he relies on it alone. No historical knowledge is of more actual value to those engaged in politics than acquaintance with contemporary history, and none is more difficult to acquire. In proportion us we realize this truth we shall be grateful for the work of M. Hanotaux.
The volume now before us contains the history of the first two Ministries of the Due de Broglie In 1873 and 1874 and an account of the failure to restore the ancient monarchy. M. Hanotaux in his account of the latter episode passes lightly over the assistance which the Prench adversaries of the Restoration received from Prince Bismarck. As a Republican statesman, he is naturally disinclined to insist on this phase in the history of his country. Nevertheless, it is certain that the French Republican Party had a powerful ally in the Chancellor of the German Empire. The recall, prosecution, and persecution of Count Arnim, then German Ambassador in Paris, were due to the fact that he differed with Bismarck regarding the policy of German interference to help the establishment of a French Republic. Count Amim was of opinion that such a course did not tend to strengthen monarchical institutions at home; he held, moreover, that the greatness of Germany did not depend on the weakness of any other country. Bismarck, on the other hand, was surprised and even alarmed at the recovery of France after the war of
1870, and Unlocked forward with appro-henslon to*the re-estubllehment of French ' Influence in Europe. it appeared to him that nothing would promote it more effectually than the reconciliation between , the two branches of the House of Bour- ; bon, followed by a restoration of the an-dent monarchy. Tho reconciliation between the Comte do Paris and the Comte de Chambord took place InAugust, 1873; and Bismarck then worked hard ^ to prevent the Restoration. He held tenacious- ' ly to the view that the establishment of a French republic would be an object-lesson to Germany, as showing the 'Injury such a form c>f government would inflict On France.—London Times.
“ ALONZO AND MELISSA M AGAIN.— Among the earliest of American novels, by which phrase I mean novels written by American writers, was this; “ A Short * Account of the Courtship of Alonzo and ' Melissa." It was written by Daniel Jack-pon, Jr„ and published at Plattsburg, N. Y., early in the year 1811. The author, Jackson, appears to have been born in Peru, Clinton County, N. Y., May 31, 1700. This novel was written by him in 1809-10, and in his twentieth year.
By accident or design a copy of this book came into my possession the day following Thanksgiving, liXH. The name had long been familiar, but the book itself, In this form, I had never seen. In This New York Times Book Revibw for Sept. 3, 1004, appears a note concerning it, and in The Nation of Dec. S another note appears. These notes are contradictory, but before I saw either my curiosity was aroused concerning the book. There Is no mention of either the book or the author in any history of American literature; neither Duyckinck nor Griswold refers to it. Roorbach. 1810, gives the name ** Alonzo and Melissa," but not the name of the author. The publication of editions ran from 1811 to 1870, exceeding in length of life any American novel ever published. It was published in Boston. in Hartford, in Philadelphia, in Bnit-tloborough, in Cincinnati, and I do not know how many other places. I declare without fear of contradiction that no American novel of its time ever had such duration of life, and nothing like such a sale, continuous for two-thirds of a century.
For these reasons it deserves mention. But there is another reason. Connected with it took place one of the most astounding literary frauds of which I have personal knowledge. Why It has never before been discovered and discussed is a matter which I shall not consider. Now* for the first time I will relate it. During this same year, 1811, there was published at Poughkeepsie, N. Y„.a novel, in two volumes, entitled " The Asylum; or, Alonzo and Melissa, an American Tale, Founded on Fact," by I. Mitchell. Poughkeepsie. (John Nelson.) 1811. This book was copyrighted by John Nelson, he claiming " as proprietor." The date of this copyright is " the second day of December, in the thirty-fitth year of the Independence." Hence the date of the copyright was Dec. 2, 1811. This is a vital fact and fixes the fraud. Here I must note two errors in the two communications cited. That in The Times gives the pages of Jackson’s first edition as being 278; it should be 218. It was a singular error, for 278 is the precise number of pases in Mitchell's second volume. The other error is in the communication to The Nation; it gives the date of copyright of Mitchell’s book as being Dec. 2, 1810; it was 1811. Mitchell was a newspaper writer and for a time an editor, and the various newspaper notices were mere advertisements inserted by Mitchell; these notices are mentioned in The Nation’s communication. The first is Jan, 8, 1811; this merely fixes the time in 1811 when Mitchell saw Jackson’s book. The two other notices are Oct. !*, 1811, and Oct. IB, lSlt. Can a book be printed, with a copyright notice in it. before the copyright was, or is, <■ 1>-tafned? Most certainly not. Then how could Mitchell’s '* Asylum" have been published or printed in October; or how could a book, if copyrighted Dec. 2, lb'll, published in two volumes, comprising together 542 pages, be written and printed and in condition " soon to appear" on Jan 8, 1811? It was a downright absurdity.
Jackson’s book was never copyrighted; hence Mitchell could use it. But Mitchell’S book was copyrighted; hence Jackson could not legully use it.
That one of these men used the other’s book there is no question; the only question is, Which man?—Sidney S. Rider in Book Notes, (Providence. R. I.)
