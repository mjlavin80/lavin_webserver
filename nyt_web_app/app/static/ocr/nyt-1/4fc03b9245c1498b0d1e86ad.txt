The Griffin was amphibious, for she made her way from the mountains of Switzerland to the Thames, quite indifferent to the parlnges. The craft was In command of Capt. Donald Maxwell, who braved in his bo;it nil the dangers of the sea and the land. ** The log of the Griffin “ is an account of his varied adventures. It was at Uruimadern, in the Alps, where tin* new Jason laid the keel of his vessel. Her precise tonnage he docs not tell. The village carpenter and the blacksmith took tho contract. She had a blunt prow, and wus provided with lee-boards, and these lee-boards caused great wonderment in the village. Two masts she boro anti ihe sails were made'on the spot. There was some disappointment when the fact was ascertained that she was not to bo speeded with an engine. She was carried on a wngon to the water. Lake Zurich was to welcome the Griffin. During the long voyage she took she proved to be fairly seaworthy, having only come twice into trouble. Her safety was due to her strength, for she was iron bound. When 011 the Rhine sho behaved nobly. She threaded the rapids, in the most {pliant manner. Then Strnsburg J was the haven. Now the bold mariner ! with his mate set sail for Holland, that is to say the Griffin was hung In the davits 011 a steamer, going up the Rhine. Arriving in the land of the dikes, the Dutch expressed their astonishment when sighting the nondescript craft. There was a great deal of cruising in the I£ast Scheldt, with not pleasant experiences on account of the choppy ^oas. At Flushing
the Griffin was taken aboard of a steamer and thus transported to-the mouth of the Thames. Thence the brave mariners made their way to Twickenham. Going up the river the peculiar appearance of the craft caused some chaffing, and one old salt cried out " Dio wed if it ain’t tho Hark.*' One feels regret to learn that the Griffin came to an untimely end, but ft must he remembered that all good ships are liiunched to be wrecked, for the boat was sunk off the North Foreland somo lime afterward. No lives were lost, because the Griffin was in tow.
