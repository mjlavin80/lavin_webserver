This book Is largely made up from material furnished by high officials In different departments of the Government service. Cliulalongkorn Is the name of the present King of Slam and he wajs born In 1853. Hlg Majesty made a most favorable impression on the remote West when he paid Europe a visit in 1807.

In 1000 he went to Oxford and devoted ftfmseif to the study of history and published a book on " The War of the Polish Succession."
It may be remembered that the young Prince has paid us a visit. On his way home he went to Japan. He occupies several important military positions in the Siamese Army. Theoretically all power is vested in the King. He is " the master of life and death, and the whole of the land is his property." Actually the King governs by the aid of his Minis-1 ters, and there are about the same offi- ’

| Siam, “the Land of the White Elephant."
I has an area of 2^87 square miles, with a 1 total coast linv of miles. The country ! lias three distinct divisions. Upper Slam, the hill country; Lower Siam, (alluvial plains,) including the eastern provinces,
(table land,) and the Siamese provinces ; of the Malay Peninsula. As to population there does not seem to he any trustworthy data. Siam is not densely peopled* Above ail things the Siamese are an agricultural nuiion. Nine-tenths of them gain their living- from the soil. The main product is rice. Maize, millet, sugar, and tobacco are produced, but it is rice that has always influenced the commerce, tho policy, and the social conditions of the country. The cultivation of rice seems to rise almost to a fine art. The greatest skill is shown in planting the seedlings, in which work both the men and women are engaged. There are not less than six varieties of rice. Tlie total product is given as 800,000 dons. To increase the crop the Government Is looking toward a system of Irrigation. Tobacco is an important product. If more care were taken in the planting, and there were better methods of curing it the demand for it would be largely increased. Cotton has been grown in Siam from time immemorial. If cotton were properly cared for it might becomc a most important product. In some parts of Siam it is treated as an annual, and remains in the ground for three years, growing to be a weedy shrub some eight feet tall. Tea grows wild in Siam, and is not used as a beverage, but is pickled, when it is chewed. This product is called mleng, and is rolled into balls, which are placed j in the hollow of the cheeks. Teak is one of the most important of the natural products of the country. In 1WJ 14,000,-
000	piculs of teak wore exported, the picul being about llllt pounds avoirdupois. There are large exports of native pepper.
The capital of Siam is Bangkok, situated on the River Menam, some fourteen miles from its mouth. The population is fully £00,1100. Within its wall are all the Government buildings* with the palaces of the King. It is the terminus of four lines of railway, has a good service of electric trams, and is lit by electricity. The water traffic is peculiar to Bangkok. The river is crowded with small craft which are for the larger part floating
shops.
