ipu might call Lady Russell's book a story of fleeting beauties. Impassioned words, save from tho pen of tlio poet, rarely convey an idea of woman’s charms. But 111 the “Three Generations o£ Fascinating Women" there really are not so much idealizations as realities. Illustrated by the works of such great artists as Lely, lvneller. Gainsborough, Angelica Kauffniann, Cosway. Sir Joshua Reynolds. Rornncy, Horace Vernet, Hopp-ner, Sir Thomas Lawn-nee, Isabey. and
. Swallowfields. A 'gallery, fn fact, is presented in tlie volume of beautiful women of the pant,	of	those in par-
ticular who were tlie lenders in tin* society of former times. The author is a - little afraid that she may lte taxed with . drawing too much on Horace ^Valpoio,
: but why should she not du so? Was lie :	not the most brilliant eritic of the fash-
ionable society of his day? Who questions hfs accuracy?

“ smiling Mary, soft and fair us down." We may pass over the noble origin of Miss Mary, ohe was well born and the daughter of Lord Bellemlen. At once
Mary entered into Court life. Pope made Hampton Court a visit fn 1717, and wrote:
We all agreed that the life of a maid of honor was of all things the most miserable, und wished that every woman who envied it had a specimen of it. To eat Westphalia ham In the morning, vide over hedges on borrowed hanks, to come home in the heat of tho day with a fever, and (what is worse a hundred times) with a red mark on the forehead from an uneasy hat. Then they must simper by the hour and catch cold in the Princess's apartment. From there, as Shakes pear a lias it. to dinner with what appetite they may, and after that till midnight, work, walk, and think, which they please.
*	Many a ballad was written in Mary Bellenden's honor. Lord Hervey said of her that she w:ts ** incontestably the most agreeable, the most insinuating, an 1 the most likable woman of her time, made up of every ingredient likely to engage or attach a lover."

We now come to the second j-.-.ierali.m or " fascinating rromen.*’ Caroline. Mary Belleliden’s only tVugllter, married when she was barely fifteen, Lord Prue*\ who was old enough to be her father. Thu husband died in	seven	years	after
the marriage. That same year she took for her second husband tin* Hon. Henry Seymour Conway, son of Lord Conway. Caroline had her own title, Countess of Ailcsbury. The marriage was a most happy one. As to the Countess's personal charms, Walpole, having seen the
Countess and the Duchess or Hamilton together, he wrote: “There never was so j pretty a sight. * * • A thousand years hence, when I begin to grow old, if that can ever be, I shall talk of that event, and tell young men how much handsomer the women of my time were than they will be then/' The Countess was somewhat of a gambler and played for high stakes. Loo was all the rage in those days. Hume was her husband's secretary. She was acquainted with Rousseau, who came to England in 17CU. It was Gen. Conway who procured for the philosopher a pension. A11 the literary personages of the time were loud in their praises of the Countess. Hannah More tells of a day spent with Lady Ailcsbury, when she heard a concert. She was something of an artist. Sir Joshua Reynolds often entertained tlie lady, and it was due to her that Angelica Kauffmann was introduced to Hnglish patrons. She was devoted, too, to the drama. The story gne.s that Mrs. Siddons owed her first footing in London to Lord Ailcsbury. Private theatricals were ali tho rag*1, and the best

The Princesso de Lam-ballo came to England In 1701 and tho Countess gave the unfortunate French woman all tho aid she could. In 1792 the Princess returned to Paris and was murdered, Lady Ailcsbury died in 180B.
Anno Seymour Conway* the daughter of the Countess, was horn in 1748, and passed mucli of her childhood under the care of Horace Walpole, at Strawberry Hill. She was highly educated. She was a fall* artisr. and modeled in wax, and subsequently executed work in marble. Among tho.se who sat to her were Nelson, Fox, Ur. Dorwln. Mrs. Slddons, the Kembles, and Miss Farrcn. In 1TGT she married the Hon. John Damer, the eldest son of Lord Milton, The husband was a rake, and tl.e wife led an unhappy life. Finally he cor1 m It ted suicide. The lad3r spent much of her time abroad. Her mother’s French friends made her stay in Paris a particularly pleasant one. Miss Burry tells of Mrs. Damer when in Paris, and (hr many noted persons who wer-i on social terms with her. Mrs. Damer had the greatest admiration for Bonaparte, and visited Madame MOre. Many years later, in return for a bust oi’ Fox, sculptured by her, the Km-per*>r sent her a magnificent snuffbox with his portrait set in diamonds, a relic which is now in the British Museum, Re-tur-thig to London, the lady became th** cent to of a host of literary personages, and among them were Byron. Seott. Rogers, Campbell, Joanna Baillle, Sir James Mackintosh, Lord Brougham, Sydney Smith, and Moore. Her scientific friends wee Mrs. Somerville, John Hunter. Sir Humphry Davy, Sir Joseph Banks, and Playfair, For years she took the leading place in English society, and Strawberry Hdl wa*1 her residence. In 1810 Mrs. Damer moved to London, and she died there
in 1828, aged eighty. And so closes tlio history of the noble women of the Belleii-den and Gunning stock. Many other bygone beauties are described by Lady Russell, with some of the uotcd men of Uie
time:*.
