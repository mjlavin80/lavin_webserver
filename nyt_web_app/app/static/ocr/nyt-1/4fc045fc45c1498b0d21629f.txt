According to tho ccnsus of 1891, India, Including Burma, with an area of l.GOO.OOO square miles, hart a population of 287,000,000. Despite famines and epidemics, tho population has grown largely during the last few years, and, summing It all up In a general way, India holds about ir» per cent, of the entire population of tho world. To describe this vast country is the task Sir Thomas Hungorford Hold rich has Imposed on himself. Having held the position of Superintendent of the Survey of India, hfs knowledge of the geographical conditions of the country is of the best. A large portion of the book is geographical. There are seven colored maps and lOfi other maps and diagrams. As to the early history of India or tho study of tho primitive race or races which made India their home, tho result Is unsatisfactory. The probability is that the first 1 comers were of a low grade in tho scale of humanity, and were followed by a liordc of a superior grade, who conquered the original tribes and held them in bond- ! age.	i
India Is the greatest Mohammedan power In the world. The followers of the Prophet number between 57.000.000 and 58,000,000. It Is only In the large towns that the creed of Islam is carried on with fanaticism. In the Indian armed service the Mohammedans make the most trustworthy soldiers.
Climate, which varies widely in India, affects the agricultural products. Of the present papulation, some 75 per cent, depend for their living on tlie fields. “The change of seasons and variations of rainfall affect the conditions of life so closely and so seriously that in no country in the world are the meteorological variations so anxiously watched and the promises of the future so minutely balanced as in India.” Rice is a 'universal crop wherever irrigation is possible, and the area planted in tea js increasing- Our authority writes, that “tea will flourish at an altitude of 7,000 feet above ihe sea: and it Is noteworthy that tea grown at the highest altitudes is reckoned the best in point of flavor, though the yield Is inferior to that of the lowlands," which depends on irrigation. This work is carried out on the largest scale. Millions of acres which would bo unproductive are rendered fertile by the many canal systems.
The mineral wealth of India awaits development, There seems to be an abundance of coal, and the carboniferous strata Is of a much younger date than in other countries. There are several collieries now working at their full capacities. Once iron derived from native ores was largely made In India. To-day Imported : Iron takes its place.
Washing for gold is a common thing In Indfa. Four men will work all day washing for gold, and be satisfied with a result worth about one shilling. There is,
, however, hard, gold-bearing rock in India, which is regularly worked, and in the Nlzan territory the product in 1899 was worth nearly $0,000. * Much has been written in the past concerning the diamonds and rubles of India. It is a disap-j pointment to learn that there never was a Golconda. There are three tracts In India where diamonds are found. Those at Fanna are the most systematically worked.
