The Boy’s Own Book,
I.
Xcic York Times Book Review:
“ Tlio Roy's Own Book," nsked for by Mr. Georgo Ashby, was during my own boyhood, thirty years ago, in the Franklin Library, at Hudson. N. Y. I remember well tho “chemical experiments ” spoken of by Mr. Ashby, nnd I think It contained, in addition, various tricks o£ slcight-of-hand, as well as in and out of door games. The Library Association afterward turned over the books to the .public schools, and this book is undoubtedly in the high school building to-day.
I believe it would be possible for Mr. Asliby to obtain tlio book, if he* desires it, ns I believe the library lias fallen into disuse.	HENRY	AV, GEORGE.
