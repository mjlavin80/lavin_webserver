Mr. Day, who is a practical sailor and yachtsman as well as an editor. says this little volume is his response to many letters from boys and young men “ asking for hints on all manner of subjects relating to the care, handling, buying, and equipping of small yachts.*' The book Is
full of useful information, ana the author rightly declares that had ho possessed one like it at the beginning of his yachting experience “ it would have saved me time, money, and lots of hard work and anxiety,”	j
The reader Is told at the outset how to buy a boat, whether a racer or a cruiser, whether afloat or ashore. Having satis- j fied yourself that the boat is seaworthy ; or can be made so, nnd Is what you
want, it is wise to let the broker complete the purchase so as to avoid the risk j of buying a lawsuit. Tlie handling and care of masts and other spar;, blocks, j sails, the attention needed by rigging, j both standing and running, training and management of crew, are briefly yet fully and clearly set forth. The important subject of reefing is treated at consid- j erable length, and the suggestions are all needful and practical. Many a young skipper has had occasion to regret an > error or omission of roofing. The novice is told how to jibe, wear, heave-to, come-to at a pier, steer under various trying conditions, anchor, and recover the anchor, get under way at a crowded anchorage, what to do on a lee or a weather j shore, if miss-staying occurs In a seaway, and a great many other things cal-j culated to save trouble or avert disaster. The hints for racing and cruising are of great value. While it is only by implica-! tion he tells the beginner to look out
for squalls, his advice is sound. *' Never parley with a squall. Take in sail at once. You can never tell from the appearance of a squall how much wind is in it. The : most innocent-looking are generally the most dangerous.*'
