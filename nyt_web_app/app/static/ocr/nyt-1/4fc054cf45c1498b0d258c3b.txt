*	tine. So do Dr. Moore, who has edited the book, and Dr. Paget Toynbee, who has supplied an exhaustive Index of names and events. It Is now a little over ten years since the first edition appeared. The second, issued In 1897, differed from it by a few typographical corrections and improvements In punctuation. The edition before us, however, has enjoyed a complete revision of texts, particularly in regard to prose pieces like “De Vulgari Eloquentla "—thanks to the amiability of the Trivulziano and Greno-Oce manuscripts, and Prof. Rajna’s new
| commentary. The *' Convivio" has also been minutely revised, as have the *■ Eclo-gae," with the aid of the conynentarics of Messrs. Wicksteed, Gardner, and Al-binl; the “ Quaestlo de Aqua et Terra'* has been reread in the light of Dr. Shad-welKs criticism, and among the lyrics, thanks to the light brought to bear by Prof. Isldoro del Lungo, the so-called quarrel of Dante with Forese Donati la now included. The changes in the text of the " Commedia ” are few; such as they are they are in the direction of better prosody, grammar, and historical fact, irrespective of what the poet may have originally written. Thus (Inferno, Canto XXVIII., tine 135) we have " al re gio-vane ” instead of *' al re Giovanni,” which Dante probably penned, thereby confounding King Henry with his brother John. Such a method of editing, of course, has its advantages, but whether it should be carried as far as matters of fact is an open question. Textual " correctors ” like the late Dr. Scartazzini rarely venture beyond prosody, grammar, and orthography.
The third edition of the Oxford texts, like the first, includes several prose pieces of doubtful authorship, but to the ten ** Letters ’* already printed Dr. Moore has not yet seen fit to add one alleged to have been written to Guido da Polenta, although its lack of authenticity is no more apparent than that of the Niccolo da Prato. Counts of Romena, and the Cino da PIstoia letters. Of the eleven letters, which are worthy of investigation, only five may now be considered genuine beyond all question—the epistle to the Princes and people of Italy, to the Florentines, to Henry VII., to the Italian Cardinals, and to Can Grande, the last of which receives elaborate and scholarly confirmation In Dr. Moore's last volume of “ Studies in Dante." (Page 284-309.)
The Oxford texts are, of course, without notes and commentary, but their value as well as that of other texts, is measurably augmented by the exhaustive index with cross references prepared by Dr. Toynbee. No proper noun, no pronoun of distinction, no incident, and no reference by the poet to time, place, manner, or degree has escaped his searching eye.
“ Exiles of Eternity ” is an exposition canto by canto, in a simple, popular, yet thoroughly literary style, reaching the aim of bringing before the reader, who may or not be acquainted with the Italian language, the general scope of Dante’s ethical leaching as studied from a broad Anglican point of view, not uncolored by
an intense poetical appreciation. This
exposition is preceded by a brief sketch of the poet, which, like the rest of the volume, seems to be characterized by broad general reading among English and American commentators rather than by special research. Thus we have some of the errors of these commentators transcribed—the elder Rossetti’s on Dante’s correspondence with Forese Do-nati; Drs. Moore’s, Toynbee’s, Ferden's, reading “Bice” for "Lagia” in the sonnet addressed to Guido Cavalcanti, an error set right by Prof. Barbi; D. G. Rossetti’s and that of others in ascribing to the pen of the same Cavalcanti the canzone on '* Fortuna,” and there are many others more or less traditional, which,

whlle^hfey would he regretted In the work of a Dante scholar, ore more or less excusable on the part of Mr. .Carroll, who has striven to avoid “ entangling either myself or the reader In mere niceties, ingenuities, and intricacies of interpretation, in which too frequently Dante scholars are tempted to forget the broad outlnes of their master's meaning." These '* broad outlines" Mr. Carroll gives us in an altogether satisfactory explanatory narrative form and style. Everywhere he Is an optimist. An English reader who wishes to make the acqualnt-ance of the “ Inferno *’ through a broad and pleasant way with Dante's ethical rules of action brought strictly up to. date, cannot Tlo better than to read Mr. Carroll's book.
:	In “ Tho Dread Inferno" wo have a.
series of homilies preached from texts drawn from various passages of the " Commedia,” and although neither the aesthetical nor the philological side of the poem is neglected, the greatest possible stress is laid upon Dante’B ethical teachings, which are invariably interpreted to be almost superior to nfoaern conceptions. Without worrying through a lot of detail which would bear very little relation to Dante study proper, It may be said at once that the author with exalted enthusiasm for poet and teacher refutes and confutes surviving parasites of Leigh Hunt’s remorseless dictum, and reasonably commends Dante as a spiritual guide and the “ Inferno *’ as a " chamber of horrors ” made by sinners for themselves, j and merely revealed but not fabricated i by the Florentine as the special dolorous abode of his own particular enemies. It is an evangelical Dante, a camp-meeting Dante, to whom the author presents us. What is emotional, religious, and spiritually introspective in the student is appealed to, and the accident that we have a great poem is deemed quite incidental to the fact that it was employed as a medium by a great teacher of universal, eternal moral philosophy.
With commendable generosity the Rev. Dr. Vincent registers his obligations to many translators of the *' Commedia ” in the preface of his book, which is a blank verse version of the " Inferno," shortly to be followed, we are told, by one on the *' Purgatorio.” The result of the author's labors among his predecessors in the same field is a more or leas literal word rendering of the poem in more or less musical language. It is far from being a successful translation, for the figurative meanings have almost entirely disappeared with the rhythmical. It is just as far from being a successful poem, for all that Dr. Vincent gives us has already been much more concisely expressed in plain prose. He, as well as many other translators, seems to be utterly oblivious of the fact that an Idea expressed in Italian in the ** terza rima ” may range far from its original meaning when construed word for word into English blank verse. For example, take the final line of the fifth canto according to various translators:
And down I fell, as a dead body falls. (Vincent.)
And fell, as a dead body falls. (Dr. J. A. Carlyle and Norton.)
Fell fiat on tlie ground as a dead body falls. (Hunt.)
And so the list might be increased, each translator having put into English the literal meaning of a very simple Italian line—“ e caridi, come corpo morto cadde." But while all the translations emphasize a quick movement to the ** falling,*' the cadence of the Italian as well as the textual context shows that the movement must be slow. Dante ** swoons through pity as if I had been dying, and sinks to earth as a body falls from which life had already departed.” There is hardly a line in the whole " Commedia *’ that would not grow to three or four times its original length should one attempt to express its full meaning to tlie intellect. But such a process would leave nothing for the imagination, and very little of Dante.
Dr. Vincent frankly eonroseos In his preface that he is fully aware of the ’* disenchantment ” of any translation, but the knowledge does not prevent him from publishing his own, which, however, it should be stated, is fortified with about 125 pages of notes which comprise a commentary on words and phrases and ideas gathered and sifted from H. F. Toner's convenient book of explanation and from similar publications. Tlie author has also scattered some things of his own with lavish hand—principally in the departments of religious and ethical interpretation, although there are some of historical fact. These notes are of uniform excellence, and are, as the author intimates, the result of classroom debates. That a disproportion exists between essentials and the curious but unimportant is due to the commentator’s enthusiasm for what he believes is original research, and may be readily pardoned. On the chance that there are certain intellects which will more readily grasp a blank verse *• Inferno ” rather than one fn genuine poetry like Cary's or in rhetorical prose like Norton’s, Dr. Vincent’s book may not be deemed entirely superfluous. For such Intellects his notes can hardly fail to be otherwise than enlightening and stimulating.
Mr. Mills's M The Secret of Petrarch ” is a finely made volume of thoroughly
bookish' fabrication^ The pagination Is open and elegant, being well set forth In large, clear-cut type with ample leading, printed on thick, light, unfilled linen paper. Quite rightly the author proclaims his pride in the Illustrations—photogravures, the plates of which have been worked over with great care and skill. The frontispiece, “ AllGe des Allscamps,’’ showing a vista of poplars, is an exquisite piece of tint work. Other landscapes are equally successful, and the genuine portrait of Petrarca and the doubtful portrait of Laura are ideal reproductions of lnarListlc and almost commonplace original sketches. The text is divided Into a certain number of prose studies and some poems, dramatic and descriptive,
the facts of which having been previously &et forth in the studies. Like many another amateur enjoying luxurious leisure and disdaining teachers, Mr. Mills has quite unconsciously given false values to Internal evidence. He found In Petrarca’s verse what lie wished to find there, and where twist, quibble, and distortion fall him he sets down his theory as a self-evident truth. Thus we learn that Laura’s full name was Cabassole; that she lived at Caumont; that she never married; that Bhe took part in the labors of the farm; that she did not die of the plague, and that the data concerning her identity on the flyleaf of Petrarca's Vergil preserved in the Ambrosian Library in Milan is false and its script a forgery. All of which may be so, although candor forces us to praise Mr. Mills’s Ingenuousness rather than his scholarship. We can freely applaud his poetry, however, which
gives a far stronger illusion of reality than do Landor's Conversations ” between the same persons.
Dr. Everett’s published volume of his lectures delivered in the famous Lowell course in Boston is a refresh ing^but sufficient retrospect of the times when classical criticism held sway and personal impressions were regarded as a sign of intellectual poverty. The aim of lecturer and author is to show that Italy from the ** trecento ” down to the end of the eighteenth century gave forth a literature which is great without the contributions of Dante, but which is often neglected and thought of lightly owing to the transcendent genius of that one man. Petrarca, Pulci, Boliardo, Berni, Ariosto, Vittoria Colonna, Michelangelo, Tasso, Marino, and the dramatists Goldoni and Alfieri are among the writers concerning whom Dr. Everett discourses with a fine academic appreciation and a charming disregard of modern criticism. At the same time, his textual illustrations show him to be not only a translator In the finest sense, but also a poet of broad and subtile Imagination and of a most delicate harmonic sensibility.
Dr. Everett is well able to inform one on these Italian writers. He learned their language in his earliest youth, and in hia scholar’s life in Quincy he has had time and books to become thoroughly acquainted with them and with their contemporary history. The information that he imparts has been gathered from erudite and venerable sources, and through him traditions are passed on as historical facts. The torch of classical effulgence dropped from the hand of Ticknor, of Longfellow, and of Lowell, he has caught up and illuminates anew what once passed for history. His charming disregard of what the archives of Florence. Bologna, and Ferrara have given forth in the last thirty or forty years is in keeping with his ideals. For him the love of Tasso for Leonora is ;is warm as ever, and the poet ever as faithful to the Princess of the Casa d’Este as tho legends made him. But lei that pass. In these days of literary discoverers and iconoclasts, it is, we repeat, refreshing and wholesome to come In contact with such a critic, if only to learn that enthusiasts and impressionists have occasionally led us astray. On one point, however, we think the doctcr might have made a concession to the moderns as a gentle hint for his own permanency. He might have furnished an index. Ho is also cruel to kill off the poet Carducci, who at this writing Is very much alive.
What is entitled '* A History of Italian Literature,” by Florence Trail, is a well arranged schedule of Italian poets and prose writers, data concerning which are interspersed with enthusiastic little critical. and biographical essays and translated extracts. Although the general scheme is chronological, within certain periods, the writers are classified according to their department of literature — _poetry, religion, history, science, &c.— while the greatest lights of each period receive far more than biographical mention, and their principal works are analyzed both independently and as an expression of the culture of their times, and copious extracts are presented* for the reader's pleasure and study. Dante, Pe-trarea, Ariosto, Tasso, and other familiar celebrities are naturally dealt with in this way. Scores of writers, however, receive brief mention, the proportion of space designated for each being, for the most part, along the lines followed by Italian historians of literature like Alessandro d’Ancona and Orazio Baccl. The book begins with Ciullo d'Alkamo (1231) and ends with a fair array of living writers, popular and well-accepted opinions of which
aro given, Fogazzarb being designated as . *' a brilliant poet and the first of living novelists,” De Amicis as ** the most popular,” and d’Annunzlo as a writer '* whose enchanting1 use of words is undeniably captivating to Italians, and . whose audacities have an inebriating effect upon foreigners.’' From among the hundreds of writers of passing or strictly dialect and local fame good selections have been made. As a history of the Peninsula’s literature the value of the work would have been vastly augmented and its reference qualities broadened by a sketch of the dialects existing prior to the ** trecento ” as vulgar tongues built upon Latin construction until Dante made the Tuscan idiom prevail for all time as the national language. The book in its mechanical parts Is a creditable performance of the Stamperia Italiana of this city.
