BOSTON NOTES. |
Some Atlantic Articles for February —Books Announced for Spring	1
Publication.	j
3 January Atlantic, com- j ing the last day of the old ! year, brought ail innova- |
lion in the shape of a page
giving biographical details in regard to the authors of the month, dates of birth nnd of some characteristic achievement sufficing in most cases. In deference to those who profess to earc not for such things, this page is so placed that it may easily be neglected altogether, and it reveals nothing that can be called private. The February number •will contain "The Democratic
Predicament,” by Mr. Edward Stanwood; "George Herbert as a Religious Poet," by Professor G. H. Palmer; "The Jackson and Van Buren Papers," by Mr. James Schoulcr; and "Put Yourself in Her Place," by Jane Seymour Klinck, a paper described as "a first-hand study of the domestic service problem," Almost any one might like to read a paper descriptive of the feelings of a mistress who discovered that the ycrung person pretending to be her servant was really a spy collecting material for copy. How does
a woman retain her self-complacence, or even her self-respect under such circumstances? Does she draw the line at listening at doors and reading letters, and if so, why? "The Confessions of a News- j paper Woman," by Miss Helen M. Winslow. also announced for February publication, will probably be interesting, as tlie author knows the Boston newspaper offices and their occupants very well, and has written a book or two while pursuing her newspaper work.

Among the books to be issued by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. this Spring is a volume of the papers contributed last year to the London Queen by Mr. GelctL Burgess, who, with Mr. Robert llichens, Mr. W. Pelt Ridge and one or two others, has since the death of Sir Walter Besant filled the space formerly occupied by his department. These papers are neither of the ‘Turple Cow" nor of the "Goop‘* school, but nre light, agreeable essays with only the smallest dash of whimsicality.

"Jsidro," which is to comc early in the season, re^rves a surprise for its readers, both in Incident and in development of diameter, and ihe chapter including »ts climax is very strong. The author, Mr?. Mary Austen, hns grown very rapidly since her first .sketches revealed her us one who could draw a scenc or a character with a few strokes.

Another coming Spring book is ** Ireland's Story," by Mr Charles Johnston and Miss Carita Spencer, This is not Mr. Johnston's first Irish book, for he Is the author of "Ireland: Historic and Picturesque," which has had tho rare good fortune of pleasing both the Catholic clergy and the Protestant laity, and is especially commended by Cardinal Gibbons. He is a North of Ireland man, son of Mr. William Johnston, Conservative member for Belfast, and the author of two or three books. Mr. Charles Johnston Is a Liberal; he was at one time In the Bengal Civil Servicc, but has been living in America for some years. His coming book begins with the legends collected by Mr. Cnrtin and many others, and comes down through the various written records, of which there is a surprising number, to the modern questions, giving separate chapters to Catholic emancipation, the disestablishment of the Irish Church, home rule, and land purchase. It also has chapters on tlie Irish,in America; on the Continent, where they seem to have fought most of the battles, and where they gave Prime Ministers to more than one country. and a President to France; and a third to the " Irish in the British Empire.” The Irish literary revival is elaborately described and the volume closes with a section on the derivation of Irish names, a topic full of Interest to all Irish- , men. for the metamorahoscs of centuries have concealed many a proud name under the humblest of guises, and tne very j slightest of indications Is often all that can be found as material for tracing a genealogy even to the eighteenth century. The book will be illustrated with maps showing both the ancient and modern names, and also with views and portraits.

Messrs. Little, Brown & Co. are about to bring out a new edition of The Colombian and Venezuelan Republics,” by Mr. William L. Scruggs, with an additional chapter on the Panama Canal, bringing the history of the project to the : present moment.	^	j
They are also preparing " Frort on In- | corporation," a treatise on the incorporation and organisation of corporations In all the States and Territories. A synopsls-digest of the general incorporation acts of each commonwealth with decisions bearing upon them; forms for drawing charters, and general and specific object .
clauses are added. The author, Mr. Thomas Gold Frost of the New York Bar, is general counsel of the National Incorporating Company, and bis work is not only a guide to those wishing to form corporations. but a valuable manual for investors desirous of knowing the precise | conditions under which their capital will j be used.	!
After some years of silence, Miss Annie Payson Call will publish a book .this Spring-, and its title will be “ Free*dom of Life/' In a certain sense, it will continue her former works, being an extension of their principles, but it is quite independent.

Miss Jessie Juliet Knox, the author of ** Little Almond Blossoms," has a Chinese story in the current number of the Boston Cooking School Magazine, aud Mrs. Helen Campbell writes of some Maya
sweetmeats prepared according to Aztec receipts which have survived through all the centuries. As they include from thirty to forty ingredients, and require repeated boiling, and as thirteen -hours steady stirring is part of the process, they are not likely to be imitated, but who dreamed that the native American counted dainties so elaborate in his list of edibles? That they spent days in preparing a skin and in making a bead has long been no secret, but that they so catered to the sweet tooth is Indeed a surprise. STEPHENSON BROWNE.
