Persons of delicate and cultured palates j will appreciate this remark of Berthe Ju- 1 lienne Low’s in her " French Home Cooking”: " Alas! the small, tender, sweet peas of Europe are not easy to get in the United States, unless you grow your own.” You will be lucky, indeed, if during an entire season you get a good serving of green peas. Quantity does not make quality. The book under notice is not intended for the restaurant or hotel, but for the home, whore cooking though it may be French is both simple and | wholesome. Dyspepsia is due in large { measure to bad cooking. Then, agahj, we | are most wasteful. Certainly " cooking 1 is an art,” and only acquired by practice. The author criticises the common way of j piling up a plate with everything on the table. The combination mrJies nothing j short of a mess which is not appetizing. It is unwholesome to eat too fnst, and | the overcharged plate ,eads to precisely such ovcre ramming. In ihe French kitchen copper utensils :irc used, but granite ware is better. It is bettor not to store away your pots and pans in a dark ■ closet. Sun and air aro as necessary to cooking utensils as is the ventilation and purification of your sleeping rooms. There are recipes in " French Home Cooking ’* Which cover the entire ground. Hero are all the .sauces known to fame, such as sauce genevoise, hollandaise, may- ! onnaise. maitrc d'hote!, sauce remolade, ' and b&ehamel. In shrimp sauoe the delicate coloring is obtained by the use of “a pin's point of carmine," jn soups the French reign supreme. Pot-au-Feu is a French national dish. Then there is the far-famed bouillabaisse. that culinary glory of Marseilles. If Thackeray had only eaten a well-made fish chowder he might have written another ballad. Are we not, as Americans, entitled to our own rights? Wc will yield nothing to the French In the way of cooking oysters, notwithstanding the half dozen ways of serving them described in this book. ■
