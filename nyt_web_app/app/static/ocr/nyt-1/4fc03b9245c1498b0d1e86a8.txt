SrCORDING .to Father HentiC-pln tho Stato of Illinois derived its name from the Indian word that forma the title of this volume of reminiscences. That Indian word
•	meant, wrote the famoutf
missionary, a- “complete, finished and perfect man, imbued with the spirit and’ bravery of the men of every nation that, ever lived." Therefore the author thinks it particularly appropriate to the men cf whom he writes. These men are »uch as ■
Abraham Lincoln, Stephen A. Douglas, Gen. U. S. Grant. John Huy, Gov. Oglesby. Gen. John-A. Logan, Gov. Yates, Lymm Trumbull, nnd a host of others who played Important parts In the history of the country as well as that of Illinois.
Interwoven In the reminiscences of the early political history of the State from tho time the author went there in 18T0 as a boy. until the close of the war between the States, is a bit of a romance in which a boy, supposed to bo a fugitive slave, plays an Important part, and gives an opportunity for a description of tho workings or the *• Underground Railroad ” over which fugitive slaves were shipped through Illinois to a place of safety in Canada. The love story it curries along with it Is of the most commonplace, but serves well enough its purpose as the string- on which to hung1 the descriptions of the men that it fell to tho author's lot to meet and the- stirring political lire in which lie played a part.
Tills is how Chicago looked to him when he landed there In 1850 after ^trlp rrom his home in New York State through the lakes.
It was low and flat; the buildings were small and beyond them there was nothing to relieve the eye but more flat land. As we entered the narrow river which is the harbor, wo could st*e muddy streets, along which .were successions of small frame buildings, with a few of brick, and no two or them of the' same height, .with, broad sidewalks on such different levels that pedestrians In walking a single block were obliged to ascend and descend stairways a dozen or more times. The plank street crossings were covered with mud, and only seemed to keep the foot passengers from sinking out of sight, * • • Chicago seemed to me only a “ transmission city, a place of meeting and separating, of hail and farewell."
While wandering along he saw ** Long John" Wentworth coming to meet his father.
As I was looking down Dearborn Street I saw approaching us in the distance what appeared to be a giant. He walked" a few steps upon a level with us on the sidewalk, then descended, his legs, his borly, and finally his head disappearing; then his head and body reappeared, but not his legs. He descended again, and again rose, revealing his whole great frame, and again descended till lost to view, and so appeared and disappeared, until finally he came up the steps to where we were. He was simply walking j the street toward us up nnd down stairs, i on a Chicago sidewalk as then construct- I ed. lie stopped before us and looked at us with a smile and then a grimace. He had a way of drawing back the corners of his big mouth, giving him a fierce look, and then relaxing the muscles of his face into a grin. * * * He stood (J feet and U inches in his stockings.
Wentworth, as every one else, was talking about Stephen A. Dougins and the fugitive slave law. and Douglas’s wur cry of "nigger equality." it was then the author discovered that;
To be an Abolitionist as T was, meant political ostracism, and in many localities those so branded were social outcasts. I became satisfied that the man who had done more than any other to arouse and inflame this prejudice was Stephen A. Douglas.
He met Senator Douglas later during the lime of Hie famous Lincoln and Douglas debates, and thus describes him:
I had never heard so impressive a voice, so deep and sympathetic. He had n sort of confiding way. as much as to say, 1 am croinnr *n fell von—I feel that I can trust myself to say to you," as though yon were the one person m whom he could confide. * * • He was only "> feet 4. and was well caltud " Tho Little Giant."
I was astonished to find he had so good ! a figure. There was a little tendency to I corpulency, which grew upon him in after I years, but I have never seen so massive a head, such lustrous eyes, such a magnifi- j cent forehead crowned with luxurious brown hair, and such a resolute but kindly expression of the mouth.
This was his first glimpse at and Impression of Abraham Lincoln:
Rapidly as the coach had swept by the hotel I had noticed that the driver was not ;ilone on his high seat. He had a companion; and before any of the other passengers could allsht this companion had alighted—stepping, as it seemed to me. from the high coach box clear to th:* croimd, he was so very tall, and his legs were so very long. My first impression was that he was the homeliest man I had ever seen, but as lie moved and spoke this impression was gradually changed. He was awkward and ungainly, bony and angular, his body abnormally extended, his long legs and arms terminating in big feet and large bony fingers. His neck was loner, and seemed to be intended especially to lift his head high enough to survey eveiy object about him. His head was covered with thick matted brown hair; his forehead was not high,

He: had dark gray eyes, well set In his head, heavy eyebrows, a largo ex-•prosslve mouth nnd dark complexion. * * * My first crude Impression of him was that he was a sort of clown, whose highest ambition was to make peo-pie Inugh. nnd l\!s greatest pleasure to t laugh with them, for I noticed that ho ■

John A. Logan, young, ambitious, popj ular, reckless, and a rampant Democrat, was the leader of the “suckers*' of South Illinois, who got their name in this way:
I remember their explaining how 111!- • nois people came to be callcd "suckers"; that when the lead mines were opened at Galena the Southern Illinois men, or '* Egyptians," would make their way up the Mississippi to Galena nnd work In the lead mines, * • * and later would de*
sccnd the river to cultivate their lands.
About tho same time that these men ascended the great river the fish known as • “ suckers,r would make their way gp, and as nearly all the population of the State was at that time in Us southern •portion, when these men began to appear from tho South It was said “ the stickers are coming up the river." And thus Illinois became known as "the Sucker State."
It was while waiting for a river boat, one day, that the author firSt saw Captain, atterward General, U. S. Grant, and whose commission as colonel of the 21st Illinois regiment it was the author's privilege to hand the future General after Governor Yates hud made it out.
While thus waiting, I noticed a gentleman come down the gnng plank and ap-pioach us, seemingly for the purpose of speaking to us. He was of medium height, had broad and rather rounded shoulders, auburn hair, sandy whiskers, clrar blue eyes, a very quiet, modest ex-
Rrefsion. and appeared to be perhaps a ttie more than ;jo years of age. He wore a blue sack coat and blue trousers, somewhat worn, but well brushed and cared for. which I afterward learned was the fatigue uniform of the United State.* army. He was smoking a cigar, which he removed as he came near us. and ratse-1 bis hat, but gave us no other greeting. We soon saw that Instead of being Interested in us he v.ns interested in ltose‘3 Kentucky mare. He looked the mare over with great interest for a considerable time, puffing away at his cigar, but without speaking. Then, again removing his clgar and raising his hu:, lie returned on board the boat.
"That man knows a good horse when lie sees it," remarked General Silverton.
Co ptain Grant of Galena entered the military service of his state at the breaking out of the civil war. and was a temporary clerk In the AdJutant-GeneraTs cffioe at Springfield, where the author noted him as "modest as a ghi, and, except when called upon or drawn out, disinclined to talk." It Was then that Governor- Yates discovered hli worth and
utilized it by placing uim in command of a lot of Insubordinate soldiers that formed the I!lst Illinois volunteers. He made him colonel. "Many times I have_ heard Governor Yates, in public speeches and In private conversation, boast that 'these fingers signed the commission that gave Gen. Grant to his country and to the world/ "
Brimful as the book Is of this unique sort of intimate personal history, and Incidentally uf political life, there is plenty to interest those who like to recall the days that led to the making of the Republican party and the troublous political years that immediately preceded the Civil War. Its valuo is greater in this way than as a “Story of the Prairies."
