*	Some statements* In ah article on “ Children’s Christmas Amusements,’* in The Nineteenth Century, written by Mr. Edward Cooper, have stirred up a great deal of discussion In London. "With its main argument, which IsTperfectly sensible, we have nothing to do. but Mr. Cooper’s assertion that the children of the present hour do not care for Lew/s Carroll’s Alice books Is disquieting-. Mr. Cooper knows a Httle girl whose only opinion on this subject is that.
" Through tlie Looking' Glass " is stupider than "Alice in Wonderland.” Certainly no children's book rinde his day has had the rogue t>£ Lewis Carroll’s, and we are bound to believe that Mr. Cooper i-ests his assertion on the opinion of :an^ exceptional little girl if hot an exceptionally stupid‘one. -A", ■ ■ ^	/-	\	-	<•	f
