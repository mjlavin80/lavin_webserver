Altogether a reader who likes a jolly grood book, cheerful, witty, slangy, generally unexpected in its turns and always humorous in its point of view, and especially a reader who likes a little curious outlandish embroidered languago sometimes, cannot ilo better than to choose for his companion of an evening which miffht otherwise bo dull, Mr. Jackson s " Helen of Troy, Now York."

This very lively and entertaining book does not contain much about Helen of Troy, New York, whose surname is llel-mer. The .scene shifts from London to tlie country residence of the Marquess of Horsham, and tlie actors, barring Miss Ilciiner, who makes only occasional entrances, and a German Freiherr of excellent Prussian military figure, arc all as English as possible. The thing has a sort of tans of “ The New Arabian Nights **
of Mr. Stevenson, a prankish irresponsible air, combined with a style decidedly precious and deliberate. Strange words In familiar places and vice versa, concatenations of idiom and idea, which are very ingenious, yet someUmes strain the attention.

First Molly Vane, who, like Mr. Arden, has a taste for amateur dramatics; then Daisy Arden, sister to Paul, and a remarkable nice girl; then Maud Sefton, sister to niy Lord Billinghurst. an equally nice girl and more lively.
