Scamp. the story of whose life is told in this volume, was just a plain dog of the streets when he was picked up and I sold to the man servant of a Miss Gill : and found a home In a suburb of London, where there were plenty of rabbits and I grouse and starlings, and other creatures | created for the entertainment of dogs. There was a soft, roomy bed for him in puppy hood days, and a softer and cozier lap for him to He In at such times as Yds mistress found It convenient to pet him in the intervals between the schooling j that made a first-class retriever out of | him, and so gave him a cnance to set out in the hunting field with his mistress, her brother, and his friends. The latteT insisted that Scamp had blue blood in him because of the skill with which he took to the work of the field, and there was every prospect of a long and happy life ahead of him.
But one day Scamp went after rabbits ! on his own hook, got caught to a. trap, was rescued by poachers, taken to town, and finally sold to a counterfeiter with a crippled son. Then there was a long spell of life in a dingy tenement in a crowded city street, varied only with occasional outings on the Thames, in one of which Scamp saved his crippled little master from drowning after the boy’s father had become exhausted in efforts to rescue him, after their punt had heen wrecked at Henley. Following was a period of life at the “ bicycle shop " of the counterfeiter, with a visit from detectives in the master's absence, and Scamp's futile efforts to try and save the master by telling hirr\ about these strange visitors. Then there was a raid on the counterfeiter’s
<kn, an escape through, tlie sewers and the dirty waters of the Thames, the final capture of the master, just as he was about starting to the Continent, and Scamp's desertion and short aftw life of misery in the London streets and in the dog pound.
After this Scamp passed through the hands of several owners of the poorer villainous class, until finally he was bought from a poacher by a head gamekeeper, and there came once more joy and
comfort to the life of the little canine. More hunting of rabbits and grouse, of squirrels and rooks, perfection in his work as a retriever, and, finally, almost idolatry for Scamp after he had saved his little master and mistress from death by fire which raged on the moors as a result of mischief on the part of the former while out in the woods ** playing Indian." Later, while out after rabbits, his acute nose saved his master from injury at the hands of a band of poachers, and then a series of incidents that made life very strenuous for the active Scamp. All these terminated in a pitched battle between a party of poachers and the gamekeeper, in which both Scamp and hfs master were severely wounded while protecting the preserves of a neighbor. That neighbor turned out to be the man who married Miss Gill. The latter, of course, recognized the Scamp of her girlhood days, nursed him back to life and strength, and then gave him a home where he could always enjoy the pleasures of the moors, the woods, and the meadows, and hunt all the rabbits and birds he wished to, while reveling in the delights of the country life he loved so well.
A dozen very prettily colored pictures make the book additionally attractive for the children lor whom it was written. Scamp was just a dog. The author has not attempted to endow him with human or supernatural attributes.
