Yol. IH. of the “Souvenirs sur Mme. de Maintenon,” containing her letters from St. Cyr, has just been published in Paris. Tlie book is edited by the Comte de'Haussonville.who has written a preface and a sketch of Mme. de Caylus’s career. From the day of her retreat to St. Cyr, she kept up a correspondence with lier nlcce through letters *' which were almost journals.” In them she describes her daily occupations and preoccupations, and one finds *' judgments on the events which marked the first years of the Regency, of which it is impossible not to recognize the sagacity-'*
In spite of her obvious piety, it is evident that not this alone caused her to end her dnys in religious seclusion. Her “ petites fievres " nlso had something to do with her going to SI. »'yr. Throughout tlie book Mme*. de Maintenon shows herself interested in politics, society gossip, and tlie business of Church and State. She writes, ** It is true that I cannot be Indifferent to the state uf personal jif-
fiiirs,” blit Inter complains that ** the solitude is less bearable than ever, ' She blames her nieee lor keeping her in touch with the world, hut adds that her greatest joy is lo receive her letters.
in almost every epistle reference is made to some charitable acts, and she frequently writes that jjlitr fuars that sue nuty not
bo able lo continue these because " the payment of her pension ” is so irregular. The letters are full of clever sayings, good advice on temporal and spiritual matters, and expressions of sorrow with the misfortunes of her friends. The writer complains that she must see so many people, taking pleasure only in the occasional visits of one or two. but it seems that she never refused an audience to any one who asked for it.
