After weeks of waiting the admirers of Gounod’s 44 Romeo et Juliette ’* tvere rewarded with a performance of that opera last evening:, only to# see it interruptec. by the failure of the principal tenor voice after an ineffectual struggle through the first act, and the substitution of an Ain-
tried and unrehearsed Romeo, wlio made
a valiant attempt through the next four. Under the circumstances it was not surprising that the performance should rest under something of a burden. Mr. Saleza had sent word in the afternoon that he would be unable to sing, but was unwisely persuaded to undertake it. It is a character in which he shows his powers to the best advantage, and laboring though he was under the handicap of his vocal helplessness, he disclosed fine traits of ardent and ecstatic passion. After that act Mr. Conried came before the curtain to,announce that Mr. Saleza had been affected with 14 a sudden hoarseness,” and that Mr. Francisco Nuibo had consented to undertake the part.
Mr. Nuibo has been a member of the company since the season began, but he
has appeared hitherto only in Sunday night concerts. He is an opera singer of experience, however, and is said to have been the David in the Parisian production of *4 Les Maitres Chanteurs,” and to have sung with Calv§ in some of her recent appearances in Paris. All this, however, did not stand him in much stead in undertaking RomSo without rehearsal and, so it was reported, without having dined. Fate, under these conditions, could harm him, but they are conditions)that should make for indulgence. It only need be said that neither in voice nor m presence did he come within reasonable distance of the stature of Gounod’s elegant and distinguished hero, but the audience evinced an encouraging friendliness toward his efforts.
Mmo. Eames reappeared in the part of Juliet, in which she presents a ravishingly beautiful picture and sings with much charm. Last evening she may have felt a share of the weight that lay upon the performance, for there was neither quite the brilliancy nor quite the fervor, in her voice and style that have marked ! her performance in the past. Mr. Plan-yon w:is promoted from the worldly dignity of the house of Capulet to the spiritual aristocracy of Friar Laurence, clothing it with becoming pontifical impressiveness and singing his music with superbly beautiful voice and style. Miss Marguerite Lemon made a pretty and creditable attempt as Stephano, which she would have bettered by pitching her voice a trifle higher in accord with the orchestra. Mr. Journet was the Capulet and Mr. Parvis appeared for the first time as Mercutio. Most of the other parts were in familiar hands, and Mr. Franko conducted. There were several new scenes ill the stage setting which were marked improvements over the old ones.
