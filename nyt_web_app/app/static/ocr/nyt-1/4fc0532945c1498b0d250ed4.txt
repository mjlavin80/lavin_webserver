the philosopher may find fooa for laughter in his cheerful disposal of his case when he set fire to Concord woods while cooking fish for his dinner. Calmly observing the flames when they had burned over a mile of ground, though up to that time he “ had felt nothing but shame and regret,” he said: "Who are these men ■who are said to be the owners of these woods, and how am I related to them?

Mr??. Mary P. Wells Smith is writing a book in continuation of her " The Boy Captive Of Old Deerfield.” The boys of her town stop her in the street to find out whether or not they are to have a second volume. A very pleasant thing to me,” says she, " is that even boys I do not know look at me in such a friendly way when we meet, as if I were a comrade, while from boys I do know comes a friendly hail from afar, * Hullo, Mrs. Smith.' There is no manner of doubt about the American boy’s interest in historical fiction if it has Indians in H.'f~
