Joel Chandler Harris, author of “ Tar Baby, and Other Rhymes of Uncle Remus,” &c., has made an Intimate study of the negroes and has had many experiences. He relates the following:
At first I used to think that I had (o try experiments on them to brine out their characteristics, but I soon found that it was sufficient to simply chat with them <ina wn,tcli them. I reiuftmber on** time when I narrowly missed driving1 all the negroes off the plantation. I £ith-crecl a few of them together one night and read them Burns's ** Tam o' Shan ter/’ eliminating the dialect as far as possible. In two hours the story had spread all over the plantation, and in two days it was taken for gospel, and local gospel at that. I had to show them tho book with all the " misspelled " words In It in order to prevent a general exodus.
