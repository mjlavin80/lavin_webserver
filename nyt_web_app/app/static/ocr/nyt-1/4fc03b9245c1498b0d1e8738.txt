A: P0PULAR HISTORY*
The First Volume of a New Work Edited by Elroy McKendree Avery**
THOUGH reasonably full, critical, and even Iconoclastic Jn -many respects, beautifully and expensively gotten up, this -work in twelve goodsized tomes is Intended to be a popular history of these United States. “In this work,” the author assures us, "I have tried to meet the wants of men and women of general culture rather than those of professional historical students.” This becomcs plain from the manner of treatment. There are no footnotes, although a compendious appendix and a very full bibliographical list, arranged by chapters, are given. Short poetical selections or mottoes are Interspersed in the text. The style is easy, flowing, sometimes conversational. Many graphic anecdotes or storiettes enli\ en the serious matter. Above all, there is a plenitude of Illustrations, maps, portraits, &c., aiding the understanding and assisting the memory, and*many of these are excellent. To judge, then, from VoL I this history bids fair to become popular In the best sense of the term. It is certainly not dry—parts of it read like a stirring romance. As to the Innumerable points In controversy—and, let us remember, nearly everything pertaining to prehistoric America and to the age of earlier discovery Is In dispute—the author’s usual method has been to state the various positions fairly and succinctly. In many cases passing lightly over discrepancies and but seldom deciding outright.
Now and then he goes perhaps a trifle too far In his impartiality, as In his version of the two papal bulls of 1403 regarding the Spanish and Portuguese claims in the •* Indies,” where he has apparently made no attempt to verify the different accounts by actual reference to tho Vatican archives, quite accessible as these are. Rather amusing, by tho way, the manner In which Spain and Portugal, by reason of this and successive papal bulls, and by mutual agreements, " divided the world" between them, to the utter exclusion of France, England, and all other
powers.	■
In the matter of the early Norse expeditions. the author maintains that the preponderance of proof Is to the effect that these hardy adventurers never got south of Greenland, and never set foot on the North American continent. Certainly, there is not an iota of absolute and clear evidence in support of the JSorse claim.
In the rather detailed account of the doings of Columbus, before and after his discovery of America, the author’s cautious method of stating facts is particularly apparent. He has gone very deeply Into the sources, from tlie meagre contemporary ones down to the very latest ones, and there is no such thing as a consensus of opinion as to a number of vital points, including some that, a few years ago, were assumed to be settled for good. The version of the second voyage of Columbus is based in part on original sources only very recently become available* It is of interest to note that the death of Columbus, in Valladolid, on Slay 20, 1500, created so little stir that Peter Martyr, a professional chronicler, failed to record it, and that even Jn Spain itself it did not becomc known until four weeks later.
As to John Cabot, the author arrives at the conclusion that there Is nothing to show the exact location of his landfall— whether in Labrador, in Newfoundland, or elsewhere—and that there is only warrant for his having landed somewhere on this North American continent, In 1-107, !. [
e., years before anybody else did. Furthermore, Cabot (like Columbus, a Genoese by birth) certainly was commissioned by King Henry VII. of England. Of the mystery of John Cabot's permanent disappearance in 1403 the author offers no solution.
Of special intorest is what the author has to say in explanation of the name '‘America,*’ how it originated and came to he at last adopted (Pp. 234-237). There are sundry early statements given, some of them in support of Amerigo Vespucci’s claims, others flatly contradicting them. But, at any rate, there seems to be no doubt that a German geographer, Wald-seemuller, proposed and applied the name of America first of all to the two continents, north and south. The facts in the case, it seems, have been brought out clearly no later than 1001. It was not, however, until 1541 that (in Mercator's Map) the name America was generally adopted for the “New World.”
AVliat Prof. Avery has to gay of Las Casas, the “ Protector and Apostle of the Indians," is of special note* Las Casas's wonderful '‘History of the Indies” remained unpublished until 1873. His is another historic figure of that period about
which the most divergent reports have been made, and what he really was— whether a mere blind fanatic and religious zealot or a great and good man—Is even to-day-not settled,	^	.
Incidentally, too, it may be said that our author, by dint of balanclrg exactly the most trustworthy accounts, tears away much of the traditional glamour from the figures of the' early Spanish, French, and English discoverers and conqulstadores; Gomara, Bobadllla, tho Cabots, the Pm-zons, Amerigo Vespucci, Ojeda, Roldan, Ovanda, Bastidas, Nino, and Coso. faring particularly badly. To put it plainly, the author shows unmistakably that these men and most of their fellows, w’ith scarcely an exception, were a scurvy lot deceitful, greedy, lustful, cruel, utterly selfish, unreliable In word and deed. But, in sooth, who can wonder at it? It was an age of iron men.
Tho question of. the Introduction of negro slavery In America is gone Into very carefully, both regarding tho West Indies. South America, (Including Brazil,) and this continent of ours, and the whole matter Is settled on tho basis of unexceptionable authority.
It deserves to be mentioned, though* that in reading this first volume of Prof. Avery’s work the most astounding thing, after all, is to see how little of tho earlier history of America Is really settled. There aro few points, even among those popularly considered planted firm as the rocks and taught in nearly every text book In these United States, which are really accepted without reservation by later and latest students and specialists. As a rule, It Is this way:	Against ten assertions,
differing more or less among themselves, there are a scoro of counter-assertions or modifications. And many, all too many, of our cherished anecdotes and pathetic little tales have thus gone by the board. It Is really too bad. And even of some of tho pretty little stories which Prof. Avery has retained we shall probably have to take a tearful farewell in years to come. The great stores of Spanish contemporary documents particularly, documents liid away In moldy, mildewed convent libraries and only now beginning to see the light, seem destined to play havoc In tills line. It Is hard to write a “ popular" history under such circumstances.
The chapters on the North American Indians and their peculiar type of civilization are very enlightening1, and tlie appendix, with its lull list of Indian reservations, &c., helps this out further.
Among the features of this Vol. I calling for special praise, the technical makeup must not be forgotten. The size is very convenient. The paper is excellent. The type is dear and large, and there is a broad margin, with notes. The binding is handsome, and the illustrations aro both many and highly artistic. The portrait of Columbus, which forms the frontispiece and which is taken from the painting In the Marine Museum In Madrid, is as authentic as any and very fine. Tlys fac simile signature attached to it is from the letter of Columbus to the Spanish sovereigns, Feb. 6, 1502.
