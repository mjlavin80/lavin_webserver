Iix Mi*. Archer Butler Hnlbert's rccont volume entitled “ The Groat American Canals," one of liis series oil " Historic Highways,” much attention is given to the history of the Eric Canal. The early navigation of tlie Mohawk presented > many difficulties. Little Falls, with roaring rapids, interrupted navigation. There 1 were portages, anil sledges were used lo carry merchandise over the swampy grounds. Later there were sleds, which would transport some kinds of vehicles, As early as 17fiS Sir Henry Moore sug-j gosted that improvements be made for the navigation of the Mohawk and a route was surveyed. Until 1790 tho boats were transferred to vehicles, the batteaus measuring not rnorc than one and a half tons. To go from Home to Schenectady and return took nine days. ElUanah Watson seems to have been the first to undertake the improvement of the Mohawk. From 17SS to 179:! ho was surveying the routes and urging on his plans. In March, 17!>2, tlie Legislature passed an act “ for establishing and opening lock navigation within the State.** Subscription books for the stock were opened in New York and Albany, but subscriptions were not forthcoming. The means to begin the work were found, however, and in 1703 " the Mohawk River Improvements " were begun, employing a force of three hundred men. Finally, in 1795, tlio canal, which passed around the Little Falls, was opened for business. It was 4,75- feet long, and contained five locks, each having a lift of about nine feet. Many objections were raised to tlio cutting of the canal, and one was that it would cause “ the fish, to wit. Shad, Herrin. Totally to Abandon the North River.*' The expenses of keeping tlie canal in repair were so heavy that no dividends were paid before 1S13.
To Gouvcrncur Morris the country is indebted for originating tlie plan of u great canal. When Morris was in England and Scotland in 17!Ki ho was looking-at the Caledonian Canal, and he wrotts homo his impressions of the advantages of a canal system for the State of New York. Do Witt Clinton's memorial of 181G gave the first true impetus to tho Elio Canal. ** The Erie Canal,*’ says Mr. Hulbert, " was born in the act of April 15, 1S17." On the Fourth of July of that year the actual work began. In IS£f the canal was open from Rochester to Schenectady, and there were 220* miles open to navigation. In 1824 the grand canal was completed.
