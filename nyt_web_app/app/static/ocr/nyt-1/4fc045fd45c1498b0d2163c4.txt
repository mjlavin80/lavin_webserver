THE CROMWELIi OF VIRGINIA. A Story of Bacon's Rebellion. By Edward ft. Ellis, A, M-, Author or " An American KinR.” llmo, Pp. 380. Philadelphia.: Henry T. Coates & Co. $1.
In John Esten Cooke's pleasant little ** History of Virginia. ” is a very lively anil entertaining account of the pictur-! esfjue affair called " Bacon's Rebellion,*1 I when in 1G76 Sir William Berkeley, a gentleman of elegant manners and his Mu-jesty Charles II.'s Governor o£ that colony, was set at naught and driven from 1 his capital by an impetuous young man who had many of the best people at his back. The uprising was a prophecy and forerunner of the Revolution of 177(1, and had for causes grievances not dissimilar. Using (and rather abusing) as a basis Cooke s text, (itself derived largely from tho contemporary relation of *' T. M. of Stafford,") Mr. Ellis has written a boy’s story of the typical sort. Bacon figures in it; Sir William Berkeley figures In it. The picturesque speeches of both are taken from Cooke’s account with expurgations of oaths and such evil matters. Some passages of description are adopted almost word for word from the same , source. But the hero is the author's own invention, a wonderful New Englander called Peleg Clearwater, a wrestler and shot beyond compare, who has figured in previous juveniles by the same hand. Peleg throws a huge Indian quite over his li?ad and rescues Bacon from Governor
Berkeley's minions. Two hoys, one a Virginian and one a New Englander, cousin and guest of the first, are Peleg’s disciples and admirers, and stout adherents of Gen. Bacon, the patriot. Boys may be entertained by the wrestling bouts and other incidents, but as history made pleas- ; ant for the juvenile palate the book is open to criticism.
