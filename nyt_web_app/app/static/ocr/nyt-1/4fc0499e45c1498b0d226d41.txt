Palmistry and Second siEht-
Practical Palmistry " is the title of ** a clear and common-sensc explanation of the science by means of which every one may read his own character and foretell his own future and fate," which " Kcl-ro ” (Charles Yates Stephenson) has written. and which E. P. Dutton & Co. are to publish In this country. He feels ■* very strongly *’ on the subject, and says in his hvt reduction:
That palmistry undoubtedly is a science and an art I firmly believe every intelli-e<mt and deep-thinking man and woman would aisvpt-. if they would only take the trouble and pains to devote a small portion or their time to investigate, with a cenuinclv unbiased mind. * * * If this is not an interesting subject for the most thought less I am no jndge of human nature	to	imagine i( Is a clever thing
to attempt to strangle by ridicule one of Ooil's most interesting studies ami sciences is the action of a fool.	Any
feregious ass can turn lo ridicule the most religious or scientific subject, but this form of ridicule is but a sign of his own ignoram'o. and In tWs instance nn ii'Unlt to the Divine Spirit who has placed the«e marks in men's hands. * * * I sav^all who will take the trouble to study :.he subject may understand, and 1 hon-*“!tlv say will believe, the truth of the science. As for myseir, the more I study men's hands, the more ignorant I appear to mvs«*lf when. I see and prove the divinity there is in it.
TTollowing the explanation of the forms of the hand, the " mounts." the different lines. &c., are treatises on clairvoyance jind psyt-hometry. Tho book contains sixty-eight full-pase plates.
