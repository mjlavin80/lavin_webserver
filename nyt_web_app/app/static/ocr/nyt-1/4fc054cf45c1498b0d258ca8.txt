Tho principal aim of this book is to furnish a convenient collection of facts that will facilitate the study and the teaching of tlie American labor problem. * * * Where it was necessary we have sacrificed both interest and general social philosophy In order to present concrete facts. We believe that the gravest differences of opinion about the labor problem, and the most dangerous misapprehensions j-rc caused by tlie failure to view the pro! lem broadly, to consider Its many phases ant? ramifications. The labor problem is greater than the problem of industnnl peace. Impelled by this conviction we have preferred to cover a broad field imperfectly rather than a narrow field in detail.
