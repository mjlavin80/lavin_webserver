“ The Boy’s Own Book.”
I.
rWic York Titticx Rook Review:
Your correspondent Mr. Frank II* Vlz-etelly is in error In assuming that '* Tho Boy's Own Book," asked for by Mr. George Ashby, is identical with " Tho American Boy’s Book of Sports and Games."
The two are entirely distinct, " The Boy's Own Hook ’* being published in tlie fifties. I think, by Francis, (I>, S.?) It is a thick duodecimo, evidently a direct reprint from the English, with odd old-fashioned border and corner pieces to each page. One of its peculiar features was a series of diagrams of calisthenic positions ulmost like skeletons. The phraseology and many of the words, if I remember correctly, were so thoroughly English :is to be partly unintelligible to a young American boy.
"The American Boy’s Book” was issued about 18(U. as stated. It was an octave of more modern form and was made over from an English book, the Illustrations, in particular those of -yachts and
