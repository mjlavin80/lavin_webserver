Arthur Jinlson Brown's *’ New Forces in Old China *' has fur its object the description of those features which h« thinks aro to effect changes in China, and this will he dm- to Western truth*, Western politics. and Western religion. I>. C. Boulger's words aro: "The grip of the outer world has tightened around China. It will either strangle her or galvanize her into fresh life." Think of the magnitude of China! It covers an area of V—W,1'->1 square miles. China is one-third larger than all ICnrope, with the I'nlted States and Alaska, and there is room enough to spare to throw fn sev- , era! Great p.ritains, As to population, it is staled to he 43i,(XM),(MH>, but the data may not be trustworthy. The actual total, however, is overwhelminpr. Some one has written that “ every third person who toils under the sun and sleeps under God’s stars is a Chinese." Centres of population where there aro cities with over lOO.Ow are numerous. There Is a nrnvincr, Honan, with about the area of Missouri, which contain:; a population of	Dwelling	on tho Gov-
ernment. the author writes " that official corruption is well-nigh universal.'*
Offices with merely nominal salaries or none at all are usually bought hv the payment of a heavy bribe and held for u term of three years, during which the incumbent seeks not only to recoup himself, but to take us l.irge an additional sum as possible. And the weakness of the Government and the absence of an outspoken press leave them free from restraint. China is the very paradise of «*mb(»zzlerd.
As to morality. Mr. Brown declares that it could not he worse. In Christian countries it is bad enough, though ostracized by honest people and condemned by the law, but in China *' Buddhism puts immorality in its temples, nnd the Government supports il." The Chinaman seems to be indifferent toward human suffering. A man may be dying In the public street, and no one will make the least effort to befriend him. What does a Chinaman believe in? Mr. Brown declares that each individual Chinaman has three religions, and is at one and the same time a Confucian, a Buddhist, and a Taolst. Ills faith is an Incomprehensible mixture of all tho three systems, lie is always under tlie dread of imaginary demons. The devils are supposed to walk stj^iight forward, and object to turns in their paths, and aceordingly the credulous Chinaman builds his house with many queer slants in it. so that Uto fiends will have trouble fn penetrating It. Most of (he faults of the Chinese the author sets down to Confucianism.
It has lifted the CIiine.se from the level or barbarism only to place them almost immovably on a plane considerably lower than Christianity. It has developed such a smug satisfaction with existing conditions that millions are well-nigh impervious to the influences of the modern world.
•	*	• It leads to a reverence for the
past that makes change a disrespect to the dead, so that all progress is made exceedingly difficult, and society becomes fossilized. Whatever is is right, and custom is sacred.
Mr. Brown traversed vast por'.tons of China, and used for transportation ivh:>t Is called a “ sliendza,** a mule litter. The comfort in tlie method depends on the character of the mules. On certain occasions he was the guest of liign personages. Chinese food he hardly likes. Some of tho table customs are not prepossessing. At a grand banquet, two bowls made of brass are placed beside each guest. You are to take some wat^r In your mouth from the smaller bowl, nnd to cxpectomtc it in the larger one. Sorro of the dishes were stewed sea si ups with ginger root and bean curd, and stewed fungus with reed roots and gingc-r; another was chicken boiled in oil, pork swimming in a great bowl of its own fat, stewed fish stomach and egg soup. Our own ways and manners are severely criticised by Chinamen. It Is because we eat such vast quantities of meat in huge chunks that Europeans ** smell so badly.” And what Is more shocking is they even sit down at the same table with women, and the latter are served first, reversing the order of nature. As to the change In China of how it is to come about, the railways are giving tho helping hand. The time is not so far distant when the Chinaman was satisfied with a wheelbarrow as a means of locomotion. He Is becoming acquainted with innumerable things from the West, which enter into Ills, domestic life. Now-ndays, on a Chinese bridge you may soo , posters declaring the excellence of American cigarettes. As to the railroads, there

arc still racial prejudices directed toward them, but these are in a measure being removed. When the Gormans built the first railroad from Tsing-tan to Kiso-chon, the track rati over some graves, and the company had to pay i’lrec Mexican dollars for every grave thus desperated. The Chinese resent Kurope;* n aggression^. and why should I hey not? There never is presented an opportunity for K°hl.ili!ig "I1 Chines** ground that is not carried out by Kuropenns. Moin.*y indemnities are settled With huge lilies of china. Mr. Ilrowu writes that there i.s not so much dread of either Kngland or Germany as iherc is of France, and particularly Kussia. notwithstanding the victories of the Japanese. No ill V.'i’l is felt toward them to-day. but the Russian methods an* detested.
That there is a reform movemenL in China is probable. The author says that some decades ago a Chinaman who was educated abroad, on his return was certain to be imprisoned. Hut a recent edict of the Emperor directs ** the Provincial Governors to select young men of ability and to send them to ISm'ope for spcei.tl training, with the object of their occupying positions of trust on their return. There have been made great changes in the examination of the literati. Ihey aro required to become acquainted with other matter than the old legends of the past. According to the best authority, there has arisen a large demand for Western books. The millennium of China is still In the far distance. For the missionary the outlook Is more encouraging. Never before have larger crowds assembled, intent on bearing the Gospei. In our treaty with China the following important clause may be read:
Missionary societies of the United Males shall be permitted tn rent and to lease in perpetuity as the projiert> of such societies, buildings or lands in all parts of the empire for misslonaij, purposes. and. after the title deeds have been found in order a ml duly stamped by win local authorities, to erect such suitable buildings as may be required for carrjlng on their good work.
If the betterment of the Chinese is to be brought about it will be due to the merchant and the missionary. The one must be the adjunct of the other, and one of the most hopeful of signs was when in December, 11**.*!, the United States Senate unanimously ratified tho treaty which secured an " open door ’’ in China for Americans. The advance China may make may be likened to that of a glacier. It is slow, and there is much disintegration. What may happen in the next hundred years no man can prophesy. Mn Brown’s volume deserves general reading.
