ROF. L. C. MI ALL of tho University of Leeds is a well Known	naturalist.	in
'* House.	Garden.	and
Field ” he presents a number of short studies in natural history. There is no attempt to be consecutive, and he writes concerning whatever for the moment strikes his attention. The object in view is to instruct teachers rather than pupils. You may come close to the solving of nature's secrets In two ways, *‘ by the habit of observation and the habit of experiment." It is not necessary to go afield for study, as there is plenty to learn in your own house. Prof. Miall declares that indoor life is so peculiar that no animal or plant of ordinary habits can endure it. The air of the house is not pure. There are odors arising from the human breath, from cooking, tobacco smoking, from half-consumed coal gas, nnd even from decaying wood. It was much worse, perhaps, in the times of our grandparents. We are not as much afraid now of fresh air as our forebears were. There is hot so much dread of draughts as there used to be. We have teamed that the chances of recovery from consumption rest very much on living in the open air. Take a healthy green plant and place it in the dark side of a room, and it will sicken and die. It wants both the light and the sun. The air of a house is charged with dust. You will see the motes dancing in the sunlight. The idea of a revolving human abode may seem to be the freak of a crank, but certainly there would be sunlight at will if the day was clear. There has been hygienic progress, and yet there Is much to be desired.
Prof. Miall introduces here an amusing study of the inmates of the house othef than the human beings. There is the dog. He must have come into the abode of man of his own accord. He may have put in a first appearance as a thief or a parasite, but in time he fully established himself as servant and comrade, “ and there is no other domestic animal on the same footing." The cat is another thing. It seems quite true that the cat never consorted with man of his own free will. Put not your trust in cats, for the cat cares more about the house than about her master or mistress. She has never lost the power to procure her own food; she has still many of the instincts of a wild animal. It may be tru^ that many caged birds are captives stupefied by loss of liberty. But there are exceptions. And what concerning the rats and the mice? They are robbers. In the «Um past there may have been none of these aggressive creatures. When the early Briton built him a one-storied house, and the floor was the true ground, the mice and the rats had no chance. There might have been mice in the barns, but no rats. With more elaborate building, joined with wider commercial relations, the rat was introduced. Naturalists think that the rat came from India or China. *' Even as late as the twelfth century we had no rats, and it Is said that there is no ancient name for the rat in any European language." First came the black rat— ** this was the rat, or ratton, of Old England, the rat of the witchcs in ' Macbeth ’ and of Piers Plowman." We are seemingly indebted to the Russians for the modern brown rat. If any one were fortunate enough to catch a true black rat, he would very much oblige som'e curator in a museum, for it is a much-desired zoological specimen.
Some of our Southern readers familiar with the mocking bird have heard his continuous song, but have they ever asked themselves, How does he manage to keep it up? Take the skylark, so justly lauded by the poets. The vocal ism of the bird is marvelous. He is on the full flight, and yet keeps on his song. Why cannot a man run and keep on singing or even shouting? It is because as wc say, *'his wind gives out." ** Active exercise quickens the inspirations,” and in time we can hardly breathe at all. Supposably with a very much quickened action of the heart there is a greater demand for oxygen for the blood. If It is not furnished there are chemical changes such as an oversupply of carbonic acid, and hence temporary blood-poisoning. How does
the skylark manage, moving at the utmost speed and singing alPthe time? It cannot be conceived that the bird sings both wEen it inhales and exhales. The reason why the song is apparently continuous Is because the lungs of the birds differ from those of men. The lungs of the bird are prolonged into capacious air sack?, which contain far more air than the lungs themselves. * There must be spaces - within thfej body of the skylark, too* which ‘are receptacles for air. These great air receptacles seem to act like the windbag/.of some old-fashioned musical instrument, say, a bagpipe, .and thus the

What Prof. Miall writes concerning the j bookworms (anobium domosticum) is of much interest. The bookworm will bore into old furniture as well as books. There is one instance of the anobium having gon? in a straight line through twenty-seven folio volumes. Many insects attack books other than the bookworm. Thi_* cockroach is a devourer of bindings, and is apparently insatiable. Anobium is to bo loss dreaded to-day than in the past because paper has not Its former relish owing to the use of chlorine as a bleaching substance, and also for the reason that paper is no longer made from nice rags.
Why do Insects fly? Most insects ** pass the chief part of their lives as larvae or grubs, and do all their feeding and growing in this stage." When the insect takes to wings, it has a better opportunity to lay its eggs on the plants or trees which it selects.
It would evidently be far safer. If many generations are to be reared in succession. that the eggs should be laid a few together on a number of trees. Now a creeping insect could not manage this: it would exhaust itself to no purpose in seeking new plants.
The author entirely discards the old fable that strength is in proportion to si2e or that a cockchafer Is really more powerful than an elephant. It seems that the proportion of muscular strength falls as the bulk of the animal increases. Everything has to do with the build of the animal, for ar"horse is expressly fashioned for the work he has to carry on. ■
One paper of the most entertaining kind treats of the chalk hills in England. Bitter have been the disputes as to their formation. Now all scientists agree on this, that the chalk hills are composed of materials laid down at the bottom of the soa. But what about the many curious things found lower than the chalk? We have much to learn in geology, just as in astronomy. When we compare tho coming of man with the age of these chalk hills the progenitor of our race seems to have been born only a minute or so ago.
It is possible, almost certain, that when man first entered Britain it was still joined to the Continent. There were no Straits of Dover. The sea, fretting the chalk cliffs on the side of tue North Sea, and also on the side of the Channel, would make just such a shallow trench as now separates Dover from Calais.
The human hand, the face, the glowworm, the barnacle, the house fly, the spider, teeth and scales, various trees nnd their foliage, are among some of the many subjects treated by Prof. Miall.
