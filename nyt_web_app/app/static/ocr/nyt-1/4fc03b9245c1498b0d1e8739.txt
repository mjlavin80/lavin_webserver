A COUNTRY DIARY.
groigni
A Quaint and Droll Book About Eng= Iish Rural
PLEASANT hoar or two may I bo spent in reading " Pages from a Country Diary." How ! old tho writer may be wc j can only guess. Maybe he Is past the prime of lif<\ since bis ritlin^ days nre over, but yet he ran shoot nnd fish and take pnrt in the simple festivities of English country | life. Ho has an apt guardian named Belinda who watches over him. and as a good wife, scolds him for his imprudences. When recovering from an attack of grip lie is informed that there were wild ducks near. lie trudges through the marsh, and would have bagged the frame had it not been for his fox terrier, who, having followed the trail, bruited at the very moment when he had drawn a bead on the ducks. Then they flew away. Of course ! sagacious FJdindn remarked that “it served him right." and for u punishment made him swallow quinine and kept him prisoner for some time.
A delightfnl raconteur is the author, and his stories arc short and to the point. Ho is well up in sport and writes well cf fox hunting and salmon and trout fishing. Without pretensions of the Gilbert While character, he is proficient in natural history. Of course he is conservative, and j inclined to favor tho ways and manners 1 of the past Occasionally, accompanied by Belinda, he pays London short visit, and tells of the aspect of the great metropolis. The <7iieer superstitions of the country folk occupy his attention, but he scarcely laughs at tlicm. He is one of the county Magistrates, and tells feelingly of some of the eases brought before him. Fond of cricket and outdoor games, he ;	attends all tlio country mootings. IIo is
afraid that golf is exercising a destructive influence on the wickets. The football of to-day he has not much liking for.
:	Some	of	this	gentleman’s theories re-
I	lr*ting lo sport are peculiar. He has no
!	liking for the woman who shoots. Ho
writes ihnt should he ever meet a woman with a shotgun he would at once go home, because lie would be in mortal terror of being shot, and also because he does not consider shooting an amusement for women. He declares that ** in all i	field sports there exists an inevitable
i	modicum of purely unintentional cruelty,
that is to say, of willful infliction of pain

on tlie lower animals." Battue shooting, as practiced in England, is a wholesale slaughtering business, and closely allied to pot-hunting. Of rook shooting he says that it is a form of amusement for which he lias very little affection. Fancy a rector with a gun shooting the poor fledgling moles. We can hardly imagine an American clergyman so belittling himself. Cub hunting, or the chasing of immature foxes, is not a nice sport.
Mr. Somers is at variance with tho theory that salmon do not feed in fresh water. The absence of pink at the fox hunting meets is deplored. The author has no liking for kliaki, but wants to see a?ai:i the gay coats of yore. It would hardly be thought that in intelligent Kng-
U’.nil the services or the "dowser," the man with the divining rods, would lie called in to determine tho presence of water. The dowser's services were wanted, however, and in Mr. Somers’s presence iie did his trick in three places, Wlu-ru he had indicated an abundance of water, when serious digging was carried out. not a drop was found. Strange to say. just where the dowser had declared there was no water. a:i ample supply was found. That is a good yarn concerning the i orkshiretnan who was supposed to be near his end, who on seeing his daughter removing a ham from the copper in which it had been boiling, asked for a slirc. The daughter refused, saying: , “Ham's not for thou; ham's for funeral."
If over there was a proper occasion to grumble it is when a man's smoking room is disturbed. It happened during *• that infernal Spring cleaning time.** He declares that the place “ smelled painfully clean.” Then, what was worse, all his books had been dusted. Will a woman ever be made to understand how much pain may be caused by the mislaying of a favorite pipe? To men of a certain age the transplanting of dear old pieces of furniture is nothing short of heartrending. Belinda tossed out a cupboard and consigned it to the lumber room. However. with womanly curiosity she overhauled tho contents of the cupboard, and in it there were found an early edition of tho “ Compleat Angler ” and a number of Gillray’s caricatures. Alas! ‘‘some spoilt child of a former generation " had ruined them.
Now. when there is so much being printed concerning the discovery of masterpieces, this story from the diary is worthy of repetition. Mr. A. had succeeded to an unolo's property in Ireland. He had supposably inherited two “ most beautiful three-quartcr-length portraits, most unmistakably by Rom noy, but unsigned.*' Of course tho signatures to the pictures were looked for. They were
wanting. The frames were of the most hideous character.
A. took the pictures out of tlie frames, to find that tho portraits had originally been full-length ones, but had been truncated to their present size by some unskillful hand. Full of wrath. A. hastily summoned his late uncle's old butler, and asked him if he know how this had comc to pa^s. Is nt the picksliurs? " replied Dennii* unconcernedly. " Share, they wahst wanted now frames, and the mas-thcr had thim iligunt gould ones standin’ impty, so he Just tuk the shears nnd cut ! the porthraits down to fit thim!”
