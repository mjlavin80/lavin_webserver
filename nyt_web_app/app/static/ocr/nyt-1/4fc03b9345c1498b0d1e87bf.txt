DISRAELI'S NOVELS
The projectors of what is called the " Empire,** and might perhaps more properly be called the ** Centennial ” Edition of Disraeli’s novels, have had a stroke of good luck upon which they could scarcely have counted. We assume, at least, that they could not have known what an advertisement their author was groins' to get, contemporaneously with their excellent reprint of the old novels, by the posthumous discovery and publication of a new one, written when the author was no longer a youth struggling for notice, but an old man who had received all the publicity and promotion that the human being: greediest of those things could possibly desire. Of no man was Goethe s saying ever truer that what a man desires in his youth, that he shall have to fullness in his old age. Certainly the posthumousness of this present explosion cannot have been due, like the belated publication of so manj memoirs, to any timidity upon the part of the author or his representatives. Nobody would think of repeating against the man who not only wrote buUjived “ The Wondrous Tale
of Alroy," what Johnson said of Mallet’s edition of Bollngbroke: ** Sir, Bo-lingbroke was a scoundrel and a coward. Ke was a scoundrel for charging a blunderbuss against religion and morality, and he was a coward because
he did not dare to puli the trigger himself, but left a guinea to a beggarly Scotchman to pull it after he was dead.” It was not " religion and morality '* but the characters of his contemporaries that " Dizzy ” was “ after.’* Uut nobody ever suggested that he lacked courage to say all that he had to say about them while he and they were alive, and, for that matter, to the faces of such of them as came lr. his way. Courage is the one quality which the English political and social adventurer cannot at all afford to be without.
Meanwhile, it is lucky for those persons of the new generation who have
yei Hie acquaintance of the novelist to make, nnd who may be moved to make it by tne excitement attending the posthumous publication, to be able to make it under such particularly favor- i able auspices as are furnished by the Empire Edition. Wa have already called attention to the " key " to the |
characters, which is as necessary to an i "v	I
understanding of the novels as the like kev was to the famous reports of Par-liame:,t in Tho Gentleman's Magazine before the Parliamentary reporter had a recognized or tolerated existence. The fact would of itself serve to distinguish Disraeli’s novels and put them in a class by themselves. For though man> novelists have introduced real characters into fiction, and some writers with the intention of having them recognized, 110 other novelist did this on such a scale that every one of his books needed the key, and that without it the reader missed so much of the interest and so much more of the fun. They ur** social and political satires of w hich the force as well as the sting re- j sides in their personality, and thus 1 they belong to the class of lampoons or j pasquinades. In intention th; y were like the versified satires of the eight- | eenth century, though to be sun? Disraeli used a highly polished stiletto i where most of his poetical predeces- I sors had used knotty clubs. His cari-
cature no cloubt lent itself in "turn to caricature. One ot the luckiest parodies in the language is " Codlingsby.” though to be sure it took Thackeray to do It, and the extravagances of the original are rather reproduced titan exaggerated.
For a sober and critical estimate of the Disraeliaii novels readers may very safely consult Mr. Gosse’s critical introduction to the Empire Edition. The essayist is here quite in his element and at his best. It was in the nature of Disraeli to arouse excessive sentiments, whether of sympathy or of opposition. A really judicial consideration of his literary work is very rare. Mr. Gosse does it evident justice, not overlooking defects or extravagances by any means, in particular not overlooking that the writings were to tlie author not his main work, but merely incidental and ancillary to his political career, but also not overlooking the clevernesses which some critics are driven by natural antipathy to ignore. Mr. Arnot’s biographical preface is almost as good in its way as Mr. Gosse’s critical introduction, and quite as necessary to tlie reader who would understand his author, giving as it does, along with the " keys,” such subsidiary knowledge as is requisite. If there is to be a ** boom '* in Disraelian writ, as a consoquence of the publication of the posthumous fragment in Tiir Nrw York Timks, beginning Sunday, Jan. ii2, the publishers of the " Empire Edition *' (M. Walter Dunne, In this city, and the Cambridge Society) have admirably qualified themselves for taking advantage of the same.
