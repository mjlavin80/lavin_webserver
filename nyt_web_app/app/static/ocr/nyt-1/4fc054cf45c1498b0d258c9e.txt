Mr. Crockett declares that he know four children, presumably his own, who would not ^ read Scott. That seemed to him a pity, and lie set about devising a way of leading the colts to water. He collected tlio children about him and told them
stories from. Scott's novels, using his own words in tho tolling and beginning1 with ** Waverley.” I’n-scnUy, he says, the young people previously so unappreciative became perfect gourmands of Scott In the original. In the volume before us, therefore, Mr. Crockett applies the same method to other people’s children, and prays for the same result. First you read a bit about *' certain small Pharaohs that knew not Joseph,” how the eldest said she couldn’t read the novels, the second objected because In one whole volume of " Rob Roy ” there “ wasn’t no Rob Roy nor any fighting in it," the youngest declared that “ books wifout pictures Is silly." Then Mr. Crockett tells about Scott and the unwearied hand that wrota and wrote and wrote and so persuades Uls flock to listen to a retold M Waverley/' which he divides into sir tare* with interludes about how the children took them, and titles like “ The Baron and the Bear,” and "Black'Looks and Bright Swords in like fashion the author deals witll •*Guy Manncrlngr,” “Rob Roy/' " Th* Antiquary,” selecting in each case, the parts which he judges will most interest tho audience he is trying to reach. Mr. Crockett, as many know, is not a bad story teller on his own account, and he retells Sir Walter in better fashion than most could do it. Of how well he does it, remembering the aim he has, nobody
is a competent critic but the perverse children who decline to read Scott. ‘
It Is surely worth while to have these youngsters try the plan; both for the children’s sake and for the sake of the elder who grieves to think that tHe fliio old romance upon which he' fed and. grew fat, in images Irom .which he expresses so much of the poetry of his own lire, means'nothing at all to hlsr offspring. Whereby the elder feels but tho more poignantly the yawning of the-great gulf which is fixed between youth and'age,'the old, and the new; x
