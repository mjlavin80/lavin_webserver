MARINE a library of about r».(KXi volumes dealing with tho history, exposition, biography, and criticism of the arts of expression from which all ideas actually aiding the evolution of art 01* contributing anything to the better understanding of a painting, a statue, or a building have been extracted and placed in chronological sequence and in logical relation one lo another, and you have the schedule upon which M. Relnaeli of the Institute of Prance has built his " Story of Art Throughout the Ages: An Illustrated Record," now translated by Florence Sim-mends. (New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons. Pp. 3113. Svo. not.) We prefer to say that he has taken ideas rather than facts. The complete essentials of the latter are necessarily included in the former term, particularly when applied to the arts of expression. M. Reinach’s book seems to excel all others when examined frtini the point of view of inspired condensation. In order that this und other things which we snail say concerning its usefulness and value may not be considered superlative, let us at once describe the scheme, scope, and arrangement of the work.
Beginning with a brief discussion o£ the origin of art as a social phenomenon, M. Reinnch indicates its beginnings in the stone and bronze ages,, in Egypt. Chaldea, and Persia, and in the Lievant, and its continuailon and development through the five Greek periods and through the Etruscan and Roman periods, down to the time when the Influence of Christianity Inspired various ideals which were separately developed through Southern, Central and Western Europe until they drew into distinct form of local significance. The Renaissance in Italy through its Independent development in the schools of Siena, Florence, Vcnice, Rome, &c.t and where certain of its most exalted phases found expression through tho groat individual artists who were schools in themselves, we have sketched in rapid feverish style with salient features properly emphasized. The Renaissance in France, Flanders, and Germany Is treated of in the Fame manner. Then come the Italian decadence and the Spanish school, and what might be called the second Renaissance In the Netherlands, In France, and In England, during the sixteenth, »**vcnteenth and eighteenth centuries, and the book closes with a review of "Art in the Nineteenth Century."
There are about 40,000 words In M. Reinach’s encyclopaedic survey of art. and nearly 000 Illustrations, reproductions of the best examples, accompanying them, and each of the twenty-ip*e chapters is followed by a bibliography. including tlie best books in all languages. An Idea of the number of mere facts that the author has presented may be gathered when we say that the index :o the book contains l.r>00 odd items. One thus realizes how eloquent is the word fabric, used Tor Ideas with which the author has buflt his essay. That he has produced a readable and rapidly moving narrative— rhetorically colored and thoroughly coherent—and not simply a series of tables and lifeless schedules, is a fact which gives him a high mark in literary construction and execution. The book Is a fine example of vivified data, composed
by a man of knowledge, judgment, and of a finely schooled imagination. There Is not an essential element in the development of the arts of expression that has been overlooked. There is a monograph in almost every paragraph, frequently In a single sentence.
Of the educational value of such a survey, eitner as an Introduction to tho various departments of the subject or as a reference book, there can be no possible doubt. It gives In concentrated form what it would take the most diligent and gifted student weeks, perhaps months, to cxtract from the great collection of books, the facts and ideas of which form its framework. For the mature historian, connoisseur, or critic It can hardly be less than a refreshing synoptical reminiscence, or a faithful compendium. It may be a great deal more.
W. B. Lethaby in his excellent essay on “ Mediaeval Art *’ (New York:	Im-
ported by Chari Scribner’s Sons. Pp. 31.1 $2.) sets the period of his subject between the yeats 312 and 1350, or from ths peace of the Church to the eve of the Italian Renaissance. Although the author writes with easy familiarity and, takes into account the supposed limited knowledge on the part of his student readers, he gives scholars something to think about. TJnlik^ Reber, he groups all Mediaeval art around two. styles, the Byzantine and the Gothic, ai?d he finds the evidence of Persian, Egypto-Sara-cenic, and Moorish forms in each. What many writers have considered to be the requisite elements In the definition of each style—as for' example the balance of thrusts in the Gothic-Ae. regards from ■the utilitarian* point of vlcw, as construe-'

Andrea Verrocchio has long been considered the great enigma of the " quattrocento." How could the same imagination which created and wrought tho ■* David ” in the Museum of the Iiargello, tho equestrian statue of Colleonl at Vcnice, and the group of “ St. Thonvis Examining the Wounds of Christ," have duvised and fabricated	the numerous third-class
eculpturcp, "fibauches." and drawings which have been ascribed to the same man? In late years Berenson and other connoisseurs have gone far to solve the problem; they have identified as the work of pupils much that had hitherto norne the name of the master. And now Maud Cruttwell gives a survey of all recent research on the subject. (" Verrocchio,” Imported by Charles Scribner's Sons, subtracts more items from the Verrocchio catalogue, but restores to him at least two pieces of sculpture that had boon taken from him—the enthroned Madonna In the Pis to i a Cathedral and the head of the horse in the Naples Museum, which, traditionally ascribed to Donatello, is now' believed to have served as a study for the Colleonl statue. Verrocchio’s authenticated contributions to fame are few in number, and his tiahie— such as it is--in popular history of art Is not due so much
to them as It Is to the fact th;*t I^onardo
was his pupil. In examining tlie sculptures, paintings, and drawings attributed to him, a pleasant guide for the amateur connoisseur is to remember constantly that Andrea Verrocchio was a painter of great delicacy before he was a sculptor., and a goldsmith and carver of miniatures before he was a painter. His proved works all scnm like magnified slatuettas. Such characteristics should be sought out in what has bemi doubtfully unsigned to him. But Miss Cruttwell*s book is not for the aspirant, but fnr those connoisseurs who believe that Verrocchio has not yet received his just due. It is a book of technique and of learning. It carefully weighs former evidence and Is fortunate to confirm some nf it and to controvert some of it by documents not hitherto published. The illustrations, while of Intrinsic value, have been primarily selected as “ exhibits."
The revival of interest in the English artists of tho eighteenth anti early nineteenth centuries has of late called forth elaborate monographs on Romney, Constable, Reynolds, and others. Taking advantage of this interest, Walter Scott, the London publisher, began the biographical scries of The Makers of British Art, the latest addition to which is a volume on Gainsborough, by A. E. Fletcher (New York:	Imported by Charles Scribner's
Sons. $L23 net.) The half-tone reproductions of the examples of Gainsborough’s art are sufficiently significant, although- by no means extensive or distinctive. The appendices, containing full data In regard to the artist’s works, are all that could be desired. Tlie book is popularly written, yet not without authority, and the critics cited in auxiliary judgment have long been approved and accepted, and Gainsborough's position as the founder of English landscape painting is left undisputed. His influence on subsequent British and Continental art is emphasized and Its future possibilities conjectured.
The application of art to utility which the various arts und crafts guilds have
done so much to revive has at length
found encyclopaedic expression in a
work which covers the department of ornamentation in everything from sculptured and carvcd implements to glass windows, furniture, and bookbinding. ('* Ornament and Its Application," by Lewis F. Day, New York. Imported by Charles Scribner’s Sons, $3.25 net.) The reader of present-day successful art magazines must long have been conscious of how rapidly the utilitarian idea of art has become a successful successor to the “art for art's sake” theory. Examples of art applied to practical uses have been prolific in number and wonderfully varied in nature and design. The fantastic conceptions recently brought forth under the auspices of that much misused term 11 art and craft '* will not be found in Mr. Days book. His examples are drawn from the time when art and utility went hand in hand, and he does his best to expound the secret and necessity for maintaining the alliance if the greatest usefulness and possibly the highest art are to be achieved. His illustrations, whether drawings or photographic reproductions, are'cbnvindng. examples of his principle—, from the* coffee-pot, bowl, and piece of I furniture to the carved door and. painted panel.'
