The documents In the volumes treat of matters civil, military, and commercial. The struggle for maritime supremacy has begun, and the efforts of the Dutch, English, French, and Portuguese are described. Trade with the East is active and amounts to 5,000,000 pesos a year, but I it is feared that the Dutch will secure 1 too large a share of the profitable busi-I ness, and efforts are to be made to drive away the Dutch and English from the eastern seas. The Jesuit chronicler at Macao tells that, although in China persecution of the Christians has diminished, in Japan the missionaries are badly treated. There have been earthquakes on many of the islands. There is constant friction between the Audiencia and tlie Governor. Certain religious orders are declared''to be domineering and self-willed. The immigration of Chinese and Japanese, it is declared, Is becoming too large, and the Governor believes that it should be restricted. There is a memorandum of the prices of various goods coming from Canton, and mention is made of ** fine porcelain and fine dishes,” Volume XIX. begins in 3.620 and concludes in 1621,
In the twentieth volume the trouble between the religioiis orders is described as on the increase. Governors complain to the King of encroachments on their privileges. "With the Governor, the Jesuits are the most in favor. There is an alliance between the English and the Dutch, and the commerce of the Philippines suffers. There is a strange account of a Chinese vessel, an ally of the Spaniards, and the capture of one of the enemy's ships, which was laden with sugar. Evidently the Chinese captured and horned the enemy’s vessel, and Jho chronicler writes with great glee that the Chinese, pouring melted sugar on the enemy, "sent fourteen or Dutch in a conserve to hell.” Tho differences between the Audiencia and the Governor still continue, and he writes: *' The religious also make the Governor’s life a burden, and their exactions preveflt the Indians from serving the Crown. Tho Dutch know better how to deal with the natives; they exempt the latter from tributes, personal services, and religious instruction,” There Is a most dramatic inci-
dent told in the twentieth volume. Dona Catalina Zambrano is the wife of tho Governor of the Philippine Islands, and is not honest. She has a lover, Joan de Messa Suero, and Dona Catalina, disguised as a man, leaves the palace to meet him. The husband, fully armed, goes to the rendezvous and kills his wife. Her paramour supposably escaped by jumping out of the window. The chronicler concludes in these words: " The Audiencia found almost 200 notes from tlie Governor’s wife in Juan de Messa*s possession, and in hers a great number from him. A report was made of all and sent to his Majesty. It was the first instance In which a so common person had an alliance with so powerful a lady, who wa3 here as is the Queen in Espana.”
