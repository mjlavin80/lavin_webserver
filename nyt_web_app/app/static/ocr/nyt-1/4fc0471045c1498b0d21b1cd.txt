-Gen. James a rant Wilsons Book About the Novelist’s Two Visits to the United States.*
VERYTHING which has to do with	the two	visits of
Thackeray to the United States has beert collected by Gen. James Grant Wilson. A topic of this character has no restriction as to limits, for there is	much to	be told	concernnig
Thackeray long before 1852, and after 1850, all closely united with his life and literary labors, Dickens's first visit to this country was in 1842, and he came in the hope of bringing about international copyright and was disappointed. His second visit was In 1868, and his readings from his own works brought him In hand* some pecuniary returns. Between these two visits	came	William	Makepeace
Thackeray, in 1852 nnd 1855. His first course of lectures had for its subject the English humorists; the second course, the Georges. It was in 1852 that Thackeray decided to visit the United States to deliver the series of six lectures first given
in London and in other cities of Great-Britain during the previous twelve months. There	is still	preserved	an
amusing letter of Thackeray’s addressed to his fast friend. Richard 'Doyle, con- | ceming a first lecture, to be delivered at Willis's Rooms,	London,	May 22, 1851.	;
Thackeray calls it " his tight rope exhibl- ! tion," and he makes tje following requests:
When you sec	me put my hand to	my	I
-*atch chain, you	will say.	" God bless	my	|
soul, how beautiful! " 'Vhen I touch my I neckcloth, clap with all your might.
' When I use iny pocket handkerchief, burst into tears. tVhen I pause, sny Brav—ah—ah—;ih —vo through the pause. No money returned. Babies in arms not admitted.
Thackeray sailed from Liverpol for Boston on the Canada. Oct. .‘10. Among his fellow-passengers were James Russell Lowell and Arthur Hugh Clough. It was four years before that, on reading “ Vanity Fair." Lowell wrote to a friend:
I wish to say how much I have been pleased with Thackeray's " Vanity Fair." He has not Dickens’s talents as a caricaturist, but - hr draws with much inure truth. Dickons can take a eharacter to pieces and make us laugh immoderately at the comic parts of it—or he lakes only the comic parts of it—ay boys lake ihe honey-bag of the b«*e. destroying tin* whole insect to get tn it. Hut Thackeray ean put a character together, lie has mure constructive power. D. is a satirise!*. T. a satirist. I don't think D. ever mad** anything equal to Bccky Sharp. Rawdou Crawley, too, is admirable.
Among the first to welcome tlie novelist was Prescott. Thackeray's opening lecture in New York was delivered in Dr. Belle ws’s Unitarian Church. The audience was large. Among those present were Irvin and Cooper, and the former said that the lecturer seemed ** a very castle of a man." His success was wonderful. He lectured in Brooklyn before his departure for Boston. In Boston hr made many friends. Concerning his stay in Boston, this is found in one of his letters:
A word 1 know will tell you how happy I am, what a many, many friends I have found. 1 have found Beatrix Esmond, and lost my heart to her. and what a fortunate venture this is likely to prove to me. Last night was the first lecture in Boston—twelve hundred people, I shoulo think—and I left behind me near a thousand pounds in New York, which Baring's house will invest for ine, so that my girls will be very considerably the better.
There had arisen the Idea that Thackeray would write something concerning the United States. This rumor he dispelled. He had been so much struck by the kindness of his reception that he wrote to Mrs. Procter.
As for writing anything about this country—about the friends I have found here, and who are helping mo to procure Independence for my children, if I cut jokes about them, may 1 choke on the instant. If 1 can say anything to show that my name is really Makepeace and to increase the source of love between th« two countries, then please God 1 will.
Nothing can be happier than Curtis's
description of the lecturer.
His huge figure filled the pulpit, and the desk was raised so that ho could easily read his manuscript. He stood erect and perfectly still; his hands thrust into his pockets, or the thumbs and forefingers into his waistcoat pockets, and in that deep, melodious and flexible voice he read his essays. No purely literary lectures were ever half so interesting. As he moved on. his felicitous skill flashed out the living form of each man he described, like a torch upon a statue.
The second course of lectures was even more successful than the first. Fields tells an amusing incident of Thackeray's riding home after a lecture, and " thrusting his long legs out of the carriage window, in deference, as he said to his magnanimous ticket holders." In Boston he was a guest of Longfellow, and he wrote "I had a very pleasant lilil** party-kin at Cambridge at Longfellow's, where there was a madcap fiddler. Ole Bull, who played most wonderfully on his instrument.” Longfellow, who had heard the lecture on Swift, said that Thackeray played round the theme with a lambent
flame that	a	little "sometimes.”
The lecture tour was extended through the leading cities of the Southern States. In April; 1S33. Thackeray was on board the Europa, bound for England.
The second visit began m October, 1B55, and ended April, 385(1. His subject wag '* The Four Georges." N. P. Willis wrote: " Mr. Thackeray's lectures have all been well attended by overflowing audiences— overflowing in numbers and appreciation."
Many are the incidents recorded having to do with Thackeray during his second visit. Supposably he was fond of good food. He was dining in Baltimore, and terrapin and canvasback ducks were served, and there was a particularly choice brand of champagne. Then, forgetful of bouillabaisse, Thackeray said, “ Assuredly no Britisher ever sat down to a more delightful dinner, andHhat’s a fact." Those familiar with "Vanity Fair*’ may call to mind how at the conclusion of the volume there is a picture of Becky Sharp, and Joe Sedley, a sick old man. Is seated. Behind the curtain stands Becky with a dagger in her hand. ITnderneuth the print there is the single word "Clytemneatra." Now what does it mean? Was poor stupid Joe to be murdered? Thackeray was asked what it represented. His answer was that he did not know. It is not necessary to discuss Thackeray’s pictorial art. His instinct was good, but his execution distinctly poor. There were never worse horses drawn than by his pencil. Nevertheless some of his illustrations are singularly impressive. There is his Lord Steyne, a perfect cynic, even If the Marquis has abnormal calves. Mrs. Ritchie assures us that the picture was not intended for Lord Lausdowne, and (he lady adds, •‘*1 suppose my father may have boon told that the picture was like
Lord Hertford, and thought it best to suppress It; or perhaps the publishers advised him to do «« ■'
When In lS5t> Thackeray took charge of The Cornhill Magazine, or rather created it, he wrote to al least four of his American friends asking for contributions, they were Fits; Greene llalleck, Washington Irving. Longfellow, and John Lothrop Motley. Mr. Wilson thinks that George William Curtis was also asked to give bis help, but not one of them gave him their i aid. The author is nf the opinion that this 1 editorship was a great mistake on the part .
of Thackeray. "The harness galled him and the drudgery of the work wearied ! him. it was a constant trial to his generous nature to be compelled to decline . contributions accompanied as they fre-fluently were with piteous appeals.*** Anv-how. as long as The Cornhill was connect- • ed with his name it was a marked sue- i cess and highly remunerative. Once when ; anted Which of his works ho liked the best his reply was, *• Well, I should like i to stand or Tali by * Ksmond,’" It had ! been lhackeray's intention to pav the ! I nited States another visit, and Canada was to have been included. Hi* wrote to 1 this effect to both Bayard Tavlor and Longfellow. *■ But it was not to'be.” He i died Dee. ist. 181Of all the tributes de- I scriptive of the sorrow of the English- j speaking people the one written by Henrv Kingsley is the most tender and impressive. Across the lines separating Federal :*nJ? Co“ federate, he sny s. came the news
*	Poor Thackeray is dead."
At the conclusion of the volumes there is a bibliographical list of the writings of Thackeray published in the United States, and the urst is "The YeNowoiush Correspondence,'* issued hi Philadelphia ir £18 by Carey * Hart. Then fallow lhackerayana, or the books referring to Thackeray, and innumerable mentions of him in periodicals. The illustrations m the work are of the verv best. Here are all the portraits of Thackerav, numbering not less than twenty-six. As to typography and general make-up, the volumes are to be deemed as among the best achievements of the American pres*
