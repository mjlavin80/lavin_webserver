at-hand study of Russia and its institutions, which has already excited much interest in Europe be- ; cause of its frankness; Prof. Miall*s charming volume of essays on “ House, Garden, and Field,” which is not a sentimental " nature book," but a work of practical value, and Thomas C. Dixon’s latest novel, *' Tlie Clansman,” which is a vivid and thrilling story of life in the South in the worst part of the Reconstruction period. Some Northerners may have a few of their cherished ideas of American | history rather badly shaken when they read this i book.

But quite apart from its historical j point of view, “ The Clansman ” is a brisk, interesting story.
