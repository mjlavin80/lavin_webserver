New York Times Saturday Retieto of Books:
It is to be regretted, of course, that a reader such as Mr. George W. Taylor must " give tip in despair’* “ trying to interpret '* Edwin Markham's mind i^nd meaning in the intense and exquisite poem “ Virgilia," One can be sorry for such readers; but, after all, it doesn't very much matter. Perhaps this is the way Stephen G. Clow felt when he read the poem. Mr. Clow, who publishes books at the authors' expense, might have been suffering from an attack of literary indigestion when he wrote his criticism of “ VirgiHa," In Thb New York Times Book Review of July 29. He selects two stanzas from Tennyson's " Maud *’ —lyrics written as a detached song, purely for their singing quality, and not an essential part of the poem's movement and progression. "With these he undertakes to challenge John Henry Christie’s comparison of “ Virgilia" to the older poet's production. Readers of Mr. Markham’s work who are open to its beauty, and who therefore are not obliged to tlry to " interpret M the poet's “ mind/* will quite agree with Mr. Clow in His objections to any comparison of the two poets. ** Virgilia *’ neetts no precedent to support its rare beauty of style and simile, its strength of expression, its passion of unrest, its measureless regret. Shaken by
a srief’' beyond words* it sends tho great heart question out into the wild universe, to strike upon hearts that comprehend— hearts that understand its burden and heroism, its fine fervor, its ecstasy, its triumph when
There in the world-grief my own grief humbles.
My own hour melts In the days to be— There Is no doubt that Mr. Clow never heard either a. peak, or a soul's peak, speak. In fact, we should judge that the gentleman never had seen a peak touched with ^he faint glow of dawn, or flushed by the red of setting sun—or plunged in the fury of a storm—phenomena familiar to the region in which Edwin Markham was bom and reared. And as to such an ecstasy as that which would express it! self from the soul's most lofty heights— 1 well, probably Mr. daw Is. more at home on the more Bumble eminences given over ! to climaxes ot criticism,
