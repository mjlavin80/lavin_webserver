Bacon, entitled " In the Land of the Gods,*’ and especially illustrating Japanese loyalty to the Emperor, and Japan’s firm faith in a future life perfectly continuous with this.

Keller has made numerous illustrations in color. Mr. Henry James’s “ English Hours,” with some seventy pictures by Mr. Joseph Pennell, contains his ** Portraits of Places ** and “ Transatlantic Sketches ” and four new papers.

" The One Hoss Shay " will renew Its youth with sixty-six pictures by Mr. Howard Pyle, and lastly comes “ Two Bird Love** in Mexico,’* by Mr. William Beebe and Mrs. Beebe, with fivescore photographs of new birds.

Blaine," in the American Statesman Series; Mr. Ferris Greenslet’s "James Russell Lowell," which will contain much new matter, and Mr. Edwin Mims’s "Sidney Lanier,** promise rare attractions.

Mr. Richard Le Gallienne’s ** Odes from the Divan of Hafiz, *' the other voluhie of poetry published this week, is, according to the preface, made from the prose translation of Col.

The book is as tall as a royal octavo, but narrower, and is bound in green boards, with a white cloth back and gilt title. The publishers are Messrs. L. C. Page & Co.

Already two of this firm’s holiday illustrated books are nearly ready—Francis Mlltoun’s " Cathedrals and Churches of the Rhine," and Mrs. Julia De Wolfe Addison's "The Art of the National Gallery.* The former, being illustrated with eighty full-page drawings by Miss Blanche McManus, would be both delightful and valuable if it had no text at all, but the author summarizes a vast number of legends and traditions connected with the churches, and carefully notes the distinct- , ive architectural features of a large num- ! ber, so that the reader can judge the ' validity of his opinion that the churches of the Rhine constitute a distinct species. I Mrs. Addison supplements the gossip j about painters and subjects always to be foUnd in her descriptive books with some account of the less familiar art processes represented in the National Gallery. The Illustrations are In duograv-ure, and, as far as is possible, without misrepresenting the scope of the gallery, painting's unfamiliar to Americans have been chosen for reproduction.

The extension and rearrangement of their Boston quarters effected by Messrs. Houghton. Mifflin & Co. less than three years ago was followed by such an increase of business, especially in the educational department, that a much greater change has been imperatively necessary for some months, and has now been effected partly by adding all the space in the upper floors of the adjacent house to " No. 4," and partly by clever rearrangement of the old space.
