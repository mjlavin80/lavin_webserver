Veto York. Times Saturday Review of Books:
I have just rend Edwin Markham's ** Virgilia.” In the criticisms of the poem that I have sien no one seems to have pointed out the extraordinary resemblance it bears to Swinburne’s " Triumph of Time." In the latter, the disappointed lover, after long and highly figurative rumination on what “ might have been,” also betakes himself to the sea for solace. The metrical movement of the two poems is somewhat similar, though they differ in the stanza forms employed. Then, too, Mr. Markham has used some of the Identical phrases that are found in the other poem. Perhaps the similarity is intended, so that the poem may be taken as a paraphrase, in some sort, of the earlier one.	WILLIAM	C.	DORN	IN, JR.
