A new work by Dr. Thomas Carter, 1 author of " Shakespeare, Puritan and j Recusant/' is being prepared at E. P. ; Dutton & Co.'s for immediate issue. It 1 treats of *' Shakespeare and Holy Scripture, with the Version He Used.” The author's aim has been to find out how tar ; the English Bible Influenced the thought i and formed the vocabulary of ** the greatest of Bullish writers." The citations from the plays, which are considered in the order of tliefr supposed composition, from ** Love’s Labour's Lost ’* down to M Henry VIII./* are from the First Polio; while the Scripture references are from | the Genevan Bible of 15l>8 and the Genevan N^w Testament of 1557, where the archaic spelling is retaisfid; while some j other references are from the authorised i version of 1611. The first two introductory chapters treat of Shakespeare and tlie Genevan Bible *r and " Shakespeare and Puritanism." Dr. Carter writes concerning the dramatist's knowledge ot the i Bible:
j • • % The spontaneous flow of Scriptural ideas and phrases which are to be 1 found everywhere in the plays reveals the fact most clearly that the mind of Shakest>eare must Indeed have been ** saturated ** with the Word of God. He most readily expresses his mind in Biblical ! phrase or Illustration. Not that he aJways ; , quotes with a religious object in view; on the contrary, he Is often unmindful of the ! meaning or association of the words, and becomes so daring and indiscriminate in , bis use that he shocks the sensitive mind, fie may be said to use Scripture on any and every occasion to dignify the thought I of a King, to point the Jest of a wit, or ! to brighten the dullness of a clawn.
*	* * 1 have studied every line in the plays In order to trace oat how far this Indebtedness <to tlie English Bible) ex-| tends, and after careful comparison have i come to the conclusion that the Genevan : Bible was the version used by Shake-I speare.	,
