HE sale of Shakespeare’s works continues to be
tbe wonder of publishers, English and American. One of the former has recently paused to mention again the figures and to recall the variety of editions, which Is as remarkable as the number of copies ^sold. No fewer than seventeen different editions of all sorts either have just been completed or are at the present time In course of issue in England alone. One of these Is reported to sell at the rate of 250,000 copies a year. Truly, Shakespeare seems to be more than ever & “ best seller.” He even keeps his hold on immortality, thoag’h Immortality end best selling do not always go together; and keeps It notwithstanding Mr. Bernard Shaw and the aid and comfort which Mr. Howells genially gives him in the September number of Harper's.
