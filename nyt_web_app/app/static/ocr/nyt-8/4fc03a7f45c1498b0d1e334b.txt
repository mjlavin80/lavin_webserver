ANCIENT couches and beds of the Greeks, Etruscans, and Romans are described in the *' Studies in Ancient Furniture,” by Caroline L*. Ransom*, Fellow of the University of Chicago, (Quarto. Pp. 123. Numerous plates. Cloth. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. $4.r>0 net.) The author visited ths museums of TSngland, France, and Germany, and other places in Europe for her material. She examined beds and couches j and foraged in ancient literature and inscriptions. The ancient sources in which Information is imparted concerning furniture of early times ure considered in the introduction. Then there ure descriptions of the materials, technique, and ccntrcs of manufacture of the sleeping and lounging couches; interlaced filling of couch frames; couch furnishings—mattresses, pillows, valances, and draperies; closing with a study of the style of the different periods. Here is what a bed in the first half of the sixth century looked like:
Arriving at the beginning of the sixth .century, we have a fair amount of material as to Corinthian beds on the largo craters which are the culmination of the potter’s industry in that city at the clos_' of Its long early era of prosperity. Both ; turned and rectangular leiys abound. The i turned legs are not of the simple Attic I design seen on the Dipylon vases, but are ( heavier and more elaborate. * * * All ; the beds are draped, so that the union of legs and supported portion is invisible; as there is no additional height at the he id, it Is improbable that they had head rests. The rectangular legs vary in pattern, and are of great importance as showing the earliest examples, still in an undeveloped stage, of what became later the most popular and widespread design for elegant chairs and couches.
The piciorial work of this volume Is of the best, revealing the designs of the ancients, as it does, through line drawing and reproduced photographs in half-tone. The ftontispiece is a colore J reproduction of an Etruscan couch made by G. Simafs.
: Besides the illustrations in the text, there ar: twenty-nine full-page plates especially given up to the artistic del ails of the beds and couches studied.	The correct
artistic stage-manager no less than the cabinetmaker of ample, means and genuine historical and aesthetic tastes will find in ‘‘ Studies in Ancient Furniture *' a book for his work table which will obviate j much time and labor spent at museums and libraries.
