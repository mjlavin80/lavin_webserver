This is the revised editfon of Mr. Philip Van Ness Myers's “ Mediaeval and Modern History," (Boston: Ginn & Co., $1.50) which was first published several years ago in two volumes under the titles " The Middle Ages ” and " The Modern Age." | The present volume has been considerably ; abridged and is designed as a companion volume to the author’s recently revised j “ Ancient History.’’ The author has taken as the standard for his method of narration three observations of Buckle, Lord Acton, and Seeley respectively. First that “ The real history of the human race is the history of tendencies which are perceived by the mind and not of events which are discovered by the senses." Second, "Historical facts should not be a burden to the memory, but tin illumina- I tion of the soul." And last, ‘‘ History ought surely in some degree, if it is worth anything, to anticipate the lessons of time. We shall all. no doubt, be wise after the event; we study history that we may be wise before the event."
Beginning with the fall of the Roman Empire, Mr. Myers has endeavored to include every event of historical importance to the world down to the late international peace conference at The Hague, The book, being designed mainly for the student, is provided with an extended bibliography, index, and pronouncing vocabulary, maps, illustrations, and a full table of contents.
