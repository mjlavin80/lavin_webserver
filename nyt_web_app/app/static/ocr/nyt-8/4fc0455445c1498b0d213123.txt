Instructions are given in F. C. Snell's book, “ The Camera in the Fields:	A
Practical Guide to Nature Photography,” (L2mo. Pp. 256. Illustrated. Green cloth. New York: Imported by the A. Weasels Company. $1.25,) for photographing birds’ nests, the birds themselves, reptiles, animals, insects, and plants and flowers, as well as landscapes, opening the book with a cenfideratiun of the apparatus and the work in the “ dark room."
The object of the little book has been to provide *' an elementary and at the same time practical ” volume for the purpose of guiding’ the earfy efforts of those who are setting out to use their cameras in pursuit of this new and fascinating form of nature study. It deals only with those subjects that are available to the ordinary average workex. No subjects have been described and illustrated here that cannot be found by the student working in the country, or the rity person who is able to get out into the country at intervals. Besides telling how to " snap '* the subject in Its native haunt, Mr. Snell also gives suggestions for photographing it at leisure at home among artificial surroundings.
The numerous illustrations are in halftone, and show woodland views, birds and their nests, spiders, butterflies, reptiles, mice, fish, caterpillars, bees, &c. .** The Camera in the Fields ” goes far toward proving the uselessness and hindrance of firearms in natural history study.
