HAT the critic lias no influ- j once worth, speaking of is 1 the opinion of M. Smile ; Faguet of Paris, though his own criticism ranks deservedly very high for penetration, delicacy, sound Judgment, candor, and independence^ He IB the author of a dozen volumes of “ studies ” ranging over the French literature of three centuries; he Is a professor of high standing, and in the recent volume of “ Propos Litt&raires ” in which he announces the paradoxical opinion we have cited, he shows that he keeps a watchful eye on the current product of French writers of most various tendencies and gifts, examines it with eare, and comments on it with both soberness and grace. In short, M. Faguet is a devoted, richly endowed, trained, and greatly esteemed member of the class of workers to whom he denies serious influence upon the opinions of other readers.
Why, then, does he follow so assiduously his impliedly barren occupation, and how, especially, has he secured so large a circle of constant readers as unquestionably he possesses ?	The
first question he does not directly answer. We left to infer that it is an instance of the operation of the law of which Herbert Spencer makes so much* M. Faguet pursues the work of the critic primarily because he has found great and increasing pleasure in the exercise of his marked capacity for criticism. Of course, there are the ordinary inducements of a profession in which he earns his income and attains a reputation. But the tendency of faculties . that are strongly developed to get themselves used, the tendcrcy. Indeed, to drive their possessor to activities always more pleasurable, as time and practice add to their force, is sufficient to account for the vocation of our author. As for his readers. M. Faguet confesses to a respectable number of them. He may not influence them, but he interests them, and he admits that indirectly he does them good. He finds the taste for reading criticism growing in France, and does not altogether like it, It seems unnourishing and " un peu hyzantine." He would prefer that people should read authors more and critics less. Rut he sees how it has come about. The public read criticism, not to form opinions, but for the same sort of pleasure they get in discussing books, plays, pictures. It is an extension and enhancement of their Interest in current things, and a book of criticism appeals to them not through its treatment of authors commented on, but for itself.
In a way our friend is right enough. The printed discussion of books is necessarily much the same as the oral discussion of the same subject, has the same attractiveness, and similarly satisfies the curious mind- If it were not so, there would not be among all fairly educated peoples the numerous publications of which Tete New York Timf.s Saturday Review is a modest type. How tnuch criticism has to do with public judgment of the works criticised, who can say? Unquestionably books rejected and contemned by th^* critics are widely read, and vice versa. But~ also certain
books sell largely of whic& 'most educated persons have never heard, A reasonably intelligent man certainly could not read M. Faguet without receiving suggestions he is hound to consider. *It is inconceivable that public opinion fs not Influenced in some degree despite the fact that we cannot at all accurately say In what degree. The present writer, for instance. Is a veteran and hardened lover and student of Montaigne with some very rooted ideas of the work of that illustrious Frenchman; he finds a perceptible difference in his enjoyment of Montaigne wince reading M. Faguet s criticism of him. And bo it goes.
And M. Faguet admits an " indirect ** influence for the critic which Is quite sufficient incitement for the work. Criticism may count as literature If it gives reality to beauty. It may have its part in raising men to the feeling of beauty, the one supremely disinterested feeling, and may unite them one With another in that feeling. It Is, indeed* ** r»rt rOle encore trSs grand.**
