That One Book.
New Yorlc Times Saturday Review of Books:
In regard to the one book. It seems to me that if a man found himself about to be cut off suddenly from communication with the civilized world for life, with timd1' to make a quick selection of one book only, that he would have a very pleasant and profitable future assured him if that one book were a copy of Montaigne*s Essays.
