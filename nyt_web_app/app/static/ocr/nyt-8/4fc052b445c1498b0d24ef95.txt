PHILOSOPHY IN PETTICOATS.
MRS. JIM AND MRS. JIMMIE. By
Stepfaea Conrad, auttur of ’ ‘ The rfeconj Mrs. Jim.” Svo. Pp. vl -296. Cloth Boston: I— G. Page & Co.
SINCE the appearance and success of *‘ David Hamm '* we have, of course, been treated to any number of homespun philosophers and philosophies. Mr, Opie Read created his imitative Jucklins, whose pranks and sayings he is about to continue. Now i i comes Mr. Stephen Conrad and gives | us " Mrs. Jim and Mrs. Jimmie." The , former lady, however, possesses what | [ few of her feilow-philosophers can be said to have—a touch of that human attractiveness which lenis some degree of charm to the every-day incidents upon which she comments with not a . little of insight and humor.
Throughout a variety of very real situations, she and Mrs. Jimmie exert an altogether felicitous influence on the community which they adorn. Mrs. Jim is rather garrulous, but combines with her attractive personality good pense and powers of observation) ex-ceptionaily keen. She exposes, with mild scorn and amusing satire, Individ-uaj and social shams and follies, while Mrs. Jimmie fills in the stops and gaps of her stepmother's recital.
How uncertain practice may be wildly subversive of Lhe soundest theory is shown in the opening chapter. Plain Mary Jane Higgins enters the fcitate University and comes out “ Miss John Maree." She nnd^rtak-^ to mold the plastic childish mind. Njid her working model of Pest j.1 ?zzian principles on class day fails uf everything except general discomfort and special decorative effects in the line of palms and a poll parrot.
Later ja, it appears how in zeal for the superficial features of education thf*re may be dan^r of neglecting the fundamentals. We are introduced to a graduating class whose members achieve aesthetic effect as to class colors and stage settings, but are so unsound orthographicalTy that they misspell " achievement ” in the class motto.
“ Beyond the Alps Lies Italy M is chosen as thesis by a shiftless young woman who, for sociological reasons, might better have been reflecting on the theme " Beyond Marriage Lies the Wash tub.” The uoetry of Keats Is interpreted by a nop'jlessly prosaic Dutch girl, and ** Character Building " meets a stumbling *block in the person of a particularly stupid boy orator.
