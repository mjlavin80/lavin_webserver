New York Times Saturday Review of Boohs:
Recently X have been reading* some ex, cellent things by Henry James and foun*l no insuperable difficulties in the way of his expression, but charm in its fineness and ingenuity. He is a delightful artificer of words. Although his style is not exactly rich and weighty, it scintillates with a kind of whit© light, showing by its characteristic Involution or qualifying phrase the- very nuances of a nimble intellect. It is pleasing, alert, brilliant, but lacks or selectly avoids the familiarity of humor. His example is particularly important as teaching, it would seem, thai literature is essentially a fine art, and not an industry.
Perhaps he might be compared In prose with Swinburne in prosody. They- both unravel and weave with splendid art and dexterity the skein of language into patterns of a piece complex but beautiful. The fabric Is light, spun to a thinness, y-et it shimmers with silver, if not always with golden spangles. It is an-advance on our Doric speech.
I Those- who have a taste for the choice 1 and distinctive in writing, with an occa* I sional subtllty to test their own equipment, will be amply rewarded for the stress of attention, appreciably good, that they may sometimes experience in read-r ing Henry James.	E.	M.
