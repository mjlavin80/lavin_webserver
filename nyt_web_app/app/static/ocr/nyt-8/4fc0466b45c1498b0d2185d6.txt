I T N support of this contention an impressive phalanx X from the past and present of literature is summoned into the Jist ot decadent poets. Not only Baudelaire—the original “ decadent " to wbom Tbeo-phlle Gautier first applied the term—Verlaine, Maeterlinck, and Poe are decadents. 14 Shakespeare of the sonnets, Apuleius, Henry Vaughan of the spiritual poems, some of the Church fathers, Donne, Quarles in certain poems. I>e Quincey, Keats, Pater," all are decorated with the title that is so generally viewed askance. The definition is Indulgent, and the list is skillfully chosen; perhaps the omissions are still more skillfully chosen. At any rate, we do not see
-	certain names that most characteristically represent the school of literary decadence. That is, deterioration—deterioration of thought and idea in strength and power, and toward the unhealthy and morbid, and that artistic deterioration which consists in esteeming chiefly the manner of expression, the technique. The great men that are put into the list we quote are really too much honored thereby. They had vital and poignant ideas to express, not merely a manner of speaking, and therefore {hey are not decadents.
