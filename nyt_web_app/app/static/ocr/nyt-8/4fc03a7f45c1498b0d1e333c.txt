4* The English Lakes,” fifteen In number, ranging from the lordly 'Windermere and Ullswater, ten and a half and nine miles long: respectively, to Lowes-i water and Rydalmere, which hardly exceed the larger tarns in area," are described in the new book by William T. Palmer and painted on seventy-five full pages, by A. Heaton Cooper, about to be published by the Macmillan Company. The volume, the author points out at the beginning, treats of the English lakes ! rather apart from those elements comprised in what is known to be the lake I district. It has been his-object to describe In plain language the " harvest of perfect pictures ” that has remained from his wanderings of " a long series of years.” In his introductory chapter he gives “ a few words" concerning accommodation and routes, and some other general hints to the traveler.
Of all the lakes, Windermere is first described, along which .the author sails in a steam yacht, and then there are chapters on *• Wordsworth's Rothay." " Rydal and Grasmere," " Esthwaite Water and Old Hawkshead," " Coniston Water,” i “ The Moods of Watswater," ** The Glory of Ennerdale," “ By Soft Loweswater,"
1 " Crummork Water,” " Buttermere," " The Charm of Derwentwater," " Bas-senthwaite," “ Thirlmere from the Main Road," " Haweswater and tho Birds," 14 Ullswater, Home of Beauty," and ** Mountain Tarns." In the course of his | chapter on Ullswater, one oC the most , beautiful lakes in England, the author 1 relates an “ experience." He writes:
My finest experience of Ullswater was on a Summer evening. • * * After storm, calm—and refreshment and peace at eventide. From westward pour the generous,
I kindly beams of light, pouring out new life to rain-dashed fields and woodlands.
*	* * Boats are now astir on our Ulls-! water. * • • Look above: the mountains
■	shoulder, to great frowning heights, but I the marvel of all is the sky. There seems no firmament, no bound to the ranging eye. • •	*	Star-drift,	in	soft,	luminous
puffs, besprinkled the great violet dome, i * • • How the frail light glows!
