i E. V. Lucas, the well-known Lamb authority, has written in two volumes what is believed to be the first complete “ Life of Charles and Mary Lamb,” and G. P. Putnam’s Softs expect to publish tt the second week in September. It has been Mr. Lucas’s aim to collect Into one narrative all that has come to light since the issue of Talfourd’s " Finil Memorials,” and he gives the story of the Lambs in their own words, as far as possible, so that his part, he writes, will be found to be less that of author than of stage m-in-ager. It has been an easy matter to collect this material, the author points out, owing to the letters which have been preserved by the Lambs's friend3 and Elia’s own habit of autobiography.
There are a number of illustrations, Including some pictures of Lamb and a reproduction of the head of Sumuel Salt, modeled in wax by Lamb’s father. At tfte epd of Volume II. is a series of four appendices containing a note on the portraits of Lamb, a reprint of the " Poetical Pieces ” of John Lamb, Sr., and an account of Lamb’s principal " Commonplace Book ” and of his library. The index contains a chronological table of Charles Lamb’s life.
Mr. Lucas in his preface deplores the want of a public memorial to Charles and Mary Lotob. Outside of the tablet to Lamb. Cowper, and Keats in Edmonton Church the English people as a whole have done nothing in the way of ** a national expression of admiration or love for one who was at once perhaps the sweetest, sanest, and most human of English prose writers.”
