R. HENRY JAMES gives to
-	the world in print this . month, both, of hig recent public utterances,' ** The Lesson of Balzac M in The Atlantic Monthly and “ The Question of Our Speech M in Ap-pistons' Boo Movers' Magazine. The ! full text of thte last, as It was delivered to the Biytt Mawr graduates In June, is supplemented in the magazine by some passages not then delivered. Much has been made, in sport by some, in wrath by others, of a few striking, but disconnected phrases in this homily on the misuse of the voice and the mis-| pronunciation of words in American speech. Xt is well, therefore, for both Mr. James and his wrathful or sportive critics, to have the whole document In an accessible place.
E discover the author of *• Hie Golden Bowl” standing, in the light of occasional- mentor or casual guide, before a number of young women who have finished their schooling and are, in the stereotyped phrase which, for once, Mr. James does not disdain, on the threshold of life." They have already had pressed upon them, as he says, many admonitions on the question of culture. He chooses to urge upon them " a coherent culture " in re! gard to language, “ its modes of exn-ployraent, its usage, its authority, its beauty.'* He speaks thus, however, as one conscious of a 44 certain indecorum “ in breaking the silence surrounding “ familiar securities and sersoitles.** He urges upon his young and presumably sympathetic hearers the need of a speech “ worthy of its great human and social function," developed, delicate, flexible, rich.

0073 vocal tone, Mr. James contends, is a representative note of an achieved civilization. Other nations have a tone standard. We have none, and cannot have one without the " definite preliminary of a care for the tone.’* The elements of life in this country militate against the growth of such a care. Millions and millions of supposedly educated, supposedly civilized persons of both sexes in America persistently speak badly.
This is Mr, James’s observation, and who can deny It? Most of us have bad voices, which might be bettered by cultivation. Those of us who are born with good voices are apt to misuse them. Our national use of vocal sound, as Mr. James expresses it, is slovenly.
He specifies, among popular errors of speech, the misuse of the letter ’* r.” the dropping of terminal letters, and the employment of the superfluous " 9 as in “ somewheres else," “ a good ways off,” &c.—which he holds Is persistent among reasonably refined persons. Hut his chief charge against us is that we, as a people, fail to recognize the value of tone In speech.
THE charge Is well founded, and we, as a people, ought to take it to heart and strive to remove the grounds. But the making of It might have been more direct and consequently more effective. Like most of Its author’s recent utterances, thlB is Involved j in a play of words, which is bound to 1 obscure much of its meaning to all but a fortunate few. The elements of life 1 in this country are tending, if not to good speech, at least to simple and understandable utterance. The people talk “ United States ” sure enough, and in nasal or guttural tones, with many infelicities of inflection and pro-nunclatloru But they can understand ! each other, and they also understand simple English. A reformer’s language should be direct, simple, and forcible.

BUT thf1 soundness of Mr. Jamrs's argument Is unquestionable, while his circle of ardent admirers will find his manner of setting it forth wholly admiral ie. His essay on “The Question of Speech ” is, indeed, a literary exercise of rare charm fur those who hold the key. Fancy, though, how some of those Bryn Mawr girls must have suffered that June day!	}
