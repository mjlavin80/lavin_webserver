ERHARDT HAUPTMANN remains, in spite of some recent falling off, the most vital figure in German drama.
11	Elga,” written *' hastily/* the author Informs us, (and we can well believe It,) in" 1894 but only recently published, is an inferior work. Yet, when we compare it with the best ot Us* second-rate men, there 1b a difference. He Is not here inspired, but neither is he a play-grinding machine. In “ Elga ” the author (we have no equivalent for the useful synonym " Dlchter’') ttfiows again his range ; of mood from the so-called realistic to .the so-called romantic. The mediaeval * setting Is, however, in the main, responsible for the atmosphere of non-every-dayish-ness thaC"*m further consideration, proves to be somewhat fictitious. The play Is founded on Grillparzer’s 41 Das Kloster bei Sendomlr.” The stage device of planting, as it were, the main drama within the limits of a dream—a feature taken in this case from the original story—is evidently attractive to Hauptmann, in spite of the peculiar difficulties which it involves. His unfailing sense of drama has utilized it in the final “ curtain n to striking effect. A monk, formerly Count Starschensld, conducts the stranger knight to rest in the ancient tower of his convent, and the sleeper dreams of - the murder formerly there enacted of Ogtn-ski, the lover of. Starschenski’s wife Elga.
Stripped of her trappings Elga is one of those willful dames, beloved by certain writers, who appear ° gowned/' as the fashion columns say, in various guise, debased copies, as it were, of the figure of Helen of Troy, in whom we* scarcely recognize the splendid prototype. Elga has as much reality as the rest, and, like the rest, is an effective ^stage figure. If the writer were a ** new author " we should admire the sense of terror and overmastering doom, produced—something after the manner of Maeterlinck—by short, crisp sentences, echoing repetitions, dark hints, and dimly lighted rooms.

IT were to do injustice to Hauptmann to dwell j longer on his work, which for the moment has not so much sig-niticance as that of some younger men. Among these Richard Beer-Hofmann has won for himself a conspicuous place by his
verse tragedy “ Der New German Graf von Charolais.*’ Version* Now that our shy, un-©f Old	bidden English poets
Englinli are emerging phalanx-Flays.	Wise upon the thea-
trical boards, it is interesting to note a contemporaneous German borrowing of material from our earlier drama, together with a recrudescence of poetical plays. " Der Graf von Charu-lais" is founded on Massinger’s " Fatal Dowry,” as “ Das gcrettete Venedig " uf Hofmannsthal is an adaptation of Otway's " Venice Preserved/* Beer-Hof-inann has all the engaging faults of inexperience. He is full of ideas, of emotion, sensibility, and a generous openness to influence, and, like all beginners, extravagant of material. Charolais'* father, a warrior and Generaf of renown, cut off oy a chance shot just as is about to be proclaimed, leaves It is son. the hero of tne piece, to an inheritance of debts. The creditors claim the General's corpse, according to the ancient Burgundian custom, and Charolais offers his living body in its stead. The President of the court, overcome by tue Count's filial piety, offers himhis only daughter, Desiree, In marriage, and, with her, wealth which will satisfy all demands. The drama follows Massinger fairly closely until the

her prototype Beaumelle, already corrupt before marriage, but has come to her husband heart free and innocent, accepts her cousin Philip as a lover In a moment of sudden Passion. Charolais pursues them, as in Massinger, slays Philip, and sends for. the father to sit In judgment upon his daughter. The development of the final scene 1b a vast improvement on the original. Charolais denounces his wife in passages full of fervor and dignity, and at length brings her to take up the dagger against herself, and so tHe piece ends, avoiding the anti-climax of Massinger's conclusion oh a note of almost triumphant fatalism.
Hofmannsthal was not so well advised as in the case of his “ Electra M in choosing Otway’s play for adaptation. To challenge comparison with Otway needs, indeed, no great daring. On the other hand, it would go hard with a writer who could not derive some inspiration from Sophocles. And, on the whole, " Das gerettete Venedig ” suffers from being based on the dead English classic Instead of on the living Greek. The adapter has, however, cleared away some of the garbage from his original.
The relations of the principal men, Pierre and Jaffier, the would-be savior of the State, are strengthened, and the drama as a whole Is knitted more closely together. Hofmannsthal is, however, unlike Hauptmann, a poet first and next a dramatist. As a ** Kiinstler des Wortes ** he is on a very high IeveL

COMING to playwrights of mort humble aspiration, we must mention |	Ruederer’s prose comedy, *' Die Mor-
genrtite/* which has had a deserved success on the Berlin stage. It treats of the Bavarian revolution of 1848, the hero, Xaver Singlspieler, (an ardent youth, innocent of " life,”) being a revolutionary of the type that lends itself easily to dramatic treatment. He ventures into the palace of the Griifin Landsfeld (Lola Montez) to denounce her face to face as

Too late he 'fipds himself duped, and withdraws preparing to take vengeance on the perfidious woman, In the meantime the King has yielded to the demands of the populace, and sentenced Lola to banishment. She seeks Xaver, not for protection, but to utter her last defiance, and she is dragged from the Marderbriiu Gaststube, the meeting place of the Cheruskia, by her one remaining faithful adherent, just as Xaver staggers from his hiding place with a revolver. He shoots blindly into the air while the mob is pressing into the house, and Lola Is hustled out through the back way. It is a spirited piece, a true comedy, full of action and bustle, the work of a skilled playwright with no mean powers of observation of character.

Nothing could he simpler or more natural." Thus begins this brilliant study of the soul of u tyrant. At first sight " Unrat ” is merely an unpleasant type of schoolmaster, and the novel might be supposed a veiled treatise on education, but the meaning does not lie on the surface. The “ tyrant,” who cannot gain his bojrs’ respect, though he can command their outward obedience, follows them into a low resort, and there makes the acquaintance of a dancer, the “ Kiinstlerin Frijhlich."

But Lohmann alone remains free from the tolls, and is the means of finally bringing the " Unrat ” couple themselves to destruction. It is & hideous picture of depravity—not to be taken literally, though the " Unrat ” type is probably to be found In embryo In many slrhilar positions. It is not a book for babes, but It “ gives furiously to thlrik.”

PROBLEMS of a less trenchant sort, touching the community rather than the Individual, are the subject of " Schloss Ewich *' (—'* Ewig **> by Kurt" Aram, whose able criticisms In the Frankfurter Zeitung, <tc., are well known. His novel Is a practical embodiment of the modern cry, Back to the Land/' Despite the actuality of the,topic there Is something old-fashioned In his Rousseau-like doctrine of the return to " nature." It is a moot point whether town life does not develop the spiritual side of man to an even greater degree than pure M nat. ure/* The author, of course, is In part Tiae aware of this, but hts motto Return would appear to bo M Take to care of the body, and the soul Nat are* will take care of itself/* a doctrine for which there is much to be said. Baron Joachim invites his nephew and protegg to Schloss Ewich In the hope that Its attractions and those of the Baron’s daughter Regine~ may bind him permanently to the spot. Albrecht is a town lover and flaneur. He is unspeakably bored by the country simplicities, (house^ parties and the like are ^apparently unknown,) *of which the highest pleasure Is to ride over the estate in the morning, and to read the German classics, or listen to Uncle Joachim’s (it must be owned) somewhat prosy disquisitions In the evening. A chain of small circumstances; culminating in a long day alone with Regine, ends In a cold-blooded Beductlon of his c&usln. He returns to town, leaving Regine to her fate. She becomes a mother, and, encouraged by her parents, seeks out Albrecht, and insists upon a formal marriage union, for the sake of the child. He unwillingly consents, and returns to the bondage of Schloss Ewich, expecting to find means to dissolve the tie, should it prove Insupportable. A few months, however, suffice to make him not only passionately in love with his wife and deeply attached to his child, but even absorbed In the affairs of the *' Gut," and ready to succeed Joachim in due time as the benevolent " squire." The story, as such. Is in many respects aosurd. Nevertheless, it leaves a distinct impression, from the purposefulness of the writer. There is truth In the presentment of the frank brutality and animalism of the peasants which shocks the more refined sensuality of the townsman, and the contrasted picture of the vulgar
entertainment that passes for “ life ” In
\
Berlin. The vagabond, Woldemnr Schulz, who lurks in the precincts of the Schloss, with the hope of revenging himself on its inhabitants for the wrongs he has suffered at the hands of society, stands, we take it, for a specimen of the wreckage of “ town ” life—a man of education and even some original breeding, who has drifted gradually downward through serf-indulgence. His elfish endeavor to stir up mischief between employers and employed, and his strange erotic vein of poetry, makes a fantastic note which harmonizes well with the unusual and original method of the book. The writer seems to be much concerned with the effect of town and country upon sex relations. He appears to advocate a certain frank following of “ nature ’* in youth, irrespective of conventional moralities. On the other hand he admits and admires the spiritual relations of a faithful wedded couple as exemplified in Joachim and Frau Ruth.

OUR next writer, F. Huch, Is a phrase-maker and a seeker for words, but his affectations are well done; he 1c an artist of the type of Beau Brummell, not of the highest kind, but acceptable for a change, and useful as serving to show the capacity of the language. M Wandlungen *' relates the further history of Wolf, (all his persona are described only by their '	y'fore-names,) his frivolous
wife, Alice, a lady of doubtful origin; his daughter, Cornelle, by a former wife, and her lover, Hagen, whose previous life was related in •' Gescbwlste/* Hans MUller, whose poem ** Der Garten des Lebens" we reviewed recently, shows a gift of narration In his " Buch der Abenteuer.” The stories are grotesques, for the most parv, sometime? gruesome, sometimes merely fanciful, but always related with sustained effect. Perhaps one of the best is the '* Historische Novelle,” in which ^an Imaginary account Is given of the murder of Marat, the object of the narrator, a companion of Napoleon in exile, being to illustrate the different aspects of M truth.” Jakob Wassermann constructs the verities of history In his own manner In ” Alexander in Babylon.” It is labored like most historical novels. The more successful portions are those in which the author has drawn the most on Imagination in the portrait of Alexander’s halfwitted brother Arrhidaeus. The weakling, born to be a servant, but jealously aspiring to rule, Is, alas! too familiar both In fiction and reality at the present day. It Is, however, skillfully developed here, so as to harmonize with the facts of recorded history, wbil^ it gives the author opportunity to exercise himself upon readily handled material. The ” real Alexander,” like the " real Napoleon/’ defies the skill of all the novelists. ** Der heillge Hies " of Ludwig Thoma, an amusing story of Bavarian peasant life, serves to pass an agreeable half-hour. The genuine peasant, or, rather, the *’ genuine workingman," Is still more profitably to be studied in the sketches " Aus einem Arbeitcrleben,” by Carl Fischer, whose " Denkwlirdigke^ten eines Arbeiters ” (Part II. appealed in 1904) form one of the most remarkable autobiographies ever written. Readers who are deterred by the bulk of the ~"Denkwiirdlglteiten,” though the latter are well worth reading In detail, will find something of their essence in the sketches. They are artless, like the pictures of a child, but they have the prime quality of sincerity, and record the vision of an eye unspoiled by “ teaching.”	’
