, Mr. Eggleston has written another novel, exactly like all the rest of his nov-| els. Those who read Mr. Eggleston’s | novels must by this time know the characteristics of the series quite by heart. The hero is a man with a fine business | head, an incorruptible integrity, faultless : morals ■j-nd habits, and, in brief, all the I earmarks of the prig. The heroine has much sincerity, and at the same time is a stickler for all the refinements which used to be required of ** the delicacy of an elegant female." There is a villain or so, too villainous for words, and something about the civil war carefully calculated to flatter both sides and offend neither.
The story takes as raw material the somewhat adventurous career of a Commodore of a cotton-buying fleet penetrating into the Southern bayous of the Mississippi in the last year of the war and combining huge profits with extreme peril. The Commodore, Hugh Marvin by name, called a native of Kentucky, is upon one of his scouting expeditions and frying his bacon overnight when a beautiful girl in tattered garments dashes out I of the wood and begs him for food after which the two converse as if they had just been introduced in a middle-class parlor. Hugh takes the girl northward with him on one of his boats and gives her an asylum with his sister at Cairo.
For the rest there 13 a courtship of an Ineffably stiff fashion, some didactic talk about fine horses and the reading of good books, the intervention of the villain to outrage the ** delicacy ** of the lady and arouse her pride, and an lnter-re- ; lated story of a grafter who improved in the most approved style a Government 1 contract to " rebale " cotton.	.
