A biography of Benjamin Robert Haydon, the English historical painter, has been written by George Paston, author of “ Little Memoirs of the- Eighteenth Century," &c. E. P. Dutton & Co. will shortly bring, it out with the title “ B. R Haydon and His Friends.” The volume I opens immediately with- the story of Hay-don’s life, which began at Plymouth in January, 17SG. Extracts are given from Haydon’s journal, which he kept throughout his life. While yet a boy he had a ** passion ” for historical painting. He studied continuously anatomical works, and drew from " dry bones and dryer muscles.” He was just eighteen when he came across Sir Joshua Reynolds’s “ Discourses,” and he immediately decided to go to London to study. After a hard fight with his parents he finally left his home in May, 1804, for the metropolis—“ thinking only of London—Sir Joshua — Drawing—Dissection — and High Art.”''
Haydon knew many celebrated people, including Wilkie, Sir Robert Peel, for whom he painted a picture; Browning, ' Keats, Leigh Hunt, Wordsworth, Wellington, Sir George Beaumont, and others, in the London art and fashionable cir- . cles of the time. For six years his father. . supported him, but upon the sale of his first picture this was stopped, and Haydon borrowed his first sum. During the rest of his life he was in debt, and when in June, 1846, he committed suicide he owed his friends and others about £3,000.
The present book has a number of illustrations, among them two or three portraits of Haydon, pictures of Wordsworth, Napoleon at St. Helena, Mis» Mit-ford, and two or three other reproductions of his paintings.
