Professing to be the record of a family as it moved from Us earlier settlement in Illinois to a new home in Oregon in the days when journeys of that sort wcr£ performed in " pmirie schooners,” this book contains, no doubt, a number of true incidents connected with an actual journey or journeys across the plains. The author declares, at all events, that she desires lo give a true picture of the time of which she writes. She dwells especially upon the tragedy of the patient mother of a family who was forced to leave upon the downward slope of life her own friends and aging parents to follow her husband to the new country. She impresses upon you the essential selfishness of the husband, whose adventurous and ambitious spirit leads him thus to break with old associations. In this story the masterful man goes on to his destiny, while the wt:m:in fades away and dies upon (he journey—at the end of which, of course, the man consoles himself with a new wife, flow ever, the idea conveyed is rather tlun human nature will have it so than that there Is anything- radically wrcng with ihc man in the case.
The ssiory goes into vast and dull detail about domestic matters and Introduces a cloud of kinsrolk over whom the women, aflcr their manner, yearn and make thomsuJvi-s unhappy. You read also about the harboring of a fugitive slave, afcout a wicked husband who, in his rage and grief upon the occasion of his wife's presenting him (for the second time in thirteen months) with twins, became a murderer of his own child; about a mother and daughter who are running away from the daughter's husband, and about a " Mormon woman.*’ There are stories, too, of hardship and death by the way, and there is a romance invented for the benefit of one of the daughters of the emigrant who is just growing up to be beautiful while the family is on the march. She gets lost from the wagon train ovxr ni^ht and meets an aristocratic Englishman living the simple life of the exile. It need hardly be said that the book is one which possesses no value as a novel, though it may Inspire Interest as a ct'rlosity. rot of literature, to be sure, but of story writing.
