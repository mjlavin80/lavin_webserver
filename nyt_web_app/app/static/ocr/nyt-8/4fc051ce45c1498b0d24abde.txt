Its Employment Generally Avoided in Hibles Printed in the United States.
New York Times tiaturday Review of Book*:
OUIi correspondent Mr. C. H. Caffin in to-day's issue cites an alleged " usage in the Bible ” of " an ” before " h.” If this proved anything it would prove only that this usage prevailed in Kngland at the period when the King James translation was made. The Bible consulted by your correspondent was probably printed in England or by representatives of Knglish
printers in this country. For many decades the Bibles printed in the United States, mostly' if not altogether, have avoided the usage as unfamiliar, archaic, and un-American; and the Revised Version published in 1880 reads ” a habitation of God,” “ a house not made with hands,” “ a horn of salvatton.” We must learn to spell soap " sope ” and make numerous other changes in language if we are going to substitute the usage of Kngland of three hundred years ago for the language spoken and written in America to-day; but let us not lay the blame on the Bible, but on its foreign printers.
