ATctc York Times Saturday Review of Books:
Say, aa my friend the President would remark, your last issue of The New York Times Saturday Rbvikw of Books was “ bully.” In opening my paper that section fell out and attract! ed my attention instanter. I read it I through, from " Alexis de ” to '* Edwin I Bjorkman ” before looking at the main | sheet to find out whether Komura had ! decided to charge $500,000,Ml to $1,000,000,000 for licking the Russians. George Taylor and Stephen Clow go for Edwin Markham pretty strong, don’t they? Well, perhaps (be careful of the aspirate) Edwin deserves it. and it may j do him good. He is a little apt to cut more hay than he can cock up in symmetrical heaps and straight lines, but he writes so much that occasionally he emits an Idea and clothes it in un-mlxed metaphorical garb.
Say. " Cunctator ” seems able to sit up and take notice all right on the " an ” and " h " question. I just dote
on these literary scraps, but It is a little tough on the other feller ** sometimes. I know Rudyard, (by sight.) I rode on a stage with him from Shelburne Palls to Ashfield. Mass., once, and he was on the front seat talking to the driver. Jolly Bill Deming. Th»*re wasn’t much to call forth the divine afflatus in Bill’s conversation, but at the same time Rud gave evidence that he was a (or an) tolerably well-Jn-formed literatus. How's that? Say. I imagine even Paul (who wrote to the
Ephesians and, so far as history states,
“ never got no answer would have been pleased to learn that a Vermont pastor thoroughly coincided and In- j dorsed all his epistolary utterances. , and so you, my unknown but highly ! esteemed friend, may get a complacent shiver of that " Well done, thou,” &c., feeling in being fra.ikly told that you, in getting out your July 29 issue, have ** done noble." More oower to ye.
