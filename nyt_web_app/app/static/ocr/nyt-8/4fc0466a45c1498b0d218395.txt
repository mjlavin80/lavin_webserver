BOSTON NOTES.
Noah in Pictures—Sea Power in 1813 j —The Foolish Almanac for 1906.	,
■* all the Old Testament personages. Noah, thanks to the manufacturer of toys, is the most familiar to the modern child, but during the Christmas holidays he will becomc even more familiar, for Mr. E. Boyd Smith has made a book in which the patriarch s story is retold in twenty-four colored pictures so abounding in imaginative humor that both children and those who long ago put away childish things will return to them again and again. One of them shows a little assemblage of the patriarch's neignbors us they listen to his explanations of his mysterious conduct. One, with fingers lapping his upturned palm, scientifically demonstrates tht impossibility of a flood, another, chin in air. evidently declares that it is all ntinsonse, and, besides. he nas known it for jears; an humble little woman prayerfully implores m*-rcy, another, obediently follows her lord, who bids her to tome along and sfs wli.it the old fellow is saying now. and a sly in* r-ry-eyed humorist grins the grin i-f th** . augur at Noah, in enjoyment of th:> n- w ! scheme for advertising an excurs'un boat. Then there are the pictures showing the animals going in two by two, and otherwise, when a hen stops the profession of fowls in order to obtain information as to where she is and why, and a strik<-of the builders with the walking delegates stating terms from afar off, with fingers in air; there is the elephant gazing from a porthole and '■• inking at the dinosaur and fguanodnn.	other	creaturts for
whom aceommoo.. as have not been provided; atid also there is the picture of the interior, not long after the embarkation, j	with the polar bear flattened rugwise on
1	th-‘	deck, the monkey limp and exliaust-
■	ed;	the giraffe twined around a post; the
1	cat	hung hammock fashion by her feet,
and Mrs. Noah sweetly asking Noah whether he does not feel better now. and getting an answer of truly modern amiability. The book stands first on the juvenile list of Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co.. but it will no more be left to children than Mr. Herford s picture books have been.

The second book, “ Lonely O'Malley/* by Mr. Arthur Stringer, is to be classed with the boobs ” about,” rather than " for " children, for its hero is the scourge of the town In which he lives with his idolizing mother. This book is illustrated with pen and ink drawings by Mr. Frank J. Merrill.

Capt. Mahan's “ Sea Power in Its Relations to the War of 1812” is to be brought out by Messrs. Little. Brown & Co. in two octavo volumes, each with its photo-gravure frontispiece and eight full-page plates in half-tone from drawings by Mr. Stanley M. Arthurs, Mr. Carlton T. Chapman, and Mr. Henry Keuterdahl. As a part of the author's great work on •' The Influence of Sea Power upon History " the book is wider in its scope and much more interesting than histories of the navy, and it includes an immense quantity of information about privateers never before brought together and much never before published. The chapters entitled " The Antecedents and Causes of the War." *' The Approach of the War."
** The Campaign of 1S14.” and " Maritime Operations External to the United States” contain much to revise popular mlscon-ceptions ou their respective subjects.

Among the books for boys *' Camp Fires on the Scioto." written by Mr. Charles S. Wood and published by the W. A- Wilde Company, promises very well, for it describes the work of the early surveyors;, of whose hardships the late> generation have small conception. This firm has also in preparation ** Sunday School Problems," a book of plans for Sunday school teachers and for Sunday school officers, those hard-working organizers who. nobody but they can guess how, so direct tbe efforts of amateurs as to obtain visible effects. The author is Mr. Amos R. Wells, and the aim of thfc book is not criticism, but assistance to the teacher, the most important thing, in his estimation, being " to get Bible wisdom into scholars.”

A pretty blending of legend and fairy tale appears in '* The Roses of St. Elizabeth." a little story by Miss Jane Scott Woodward, published by Me^strs. L, C* Page & Co. The heroine, daughter of the caretaker at the castle of Wartburg, once St. Elizabeth’s home, learns the story of the saint from the ivy and roses in the
castle yard.	,.

Luce & to., this Winter will add the. ■' Foolish Almanack for 19p6i" with ^stro-no'inlcal and meteorological knowledge, instruction as to Insignificant persons born on certain days, and battles of no account to any one but the war correspondents; calendars of many races, not to be confounded with racing calendars.
and other miscellaneous matters either unknown or misapprehended. It Is to be illustrated by Mr. Wallace Goldsmith, whose theories of the solar system and j of stellar possibilities are truly amazing. I

Mrs. Daniel Lothrop, who is traveling tn England with her daughter, writes that she has been staying with Matthew Ar-notd's sister and dining with Canon Rawnsley and Mrs. Rawnsley. During her residence at The Wayside she has n&tur-ally familiarized hfereelf with every detail of the small library of Hawthorne biography, and it was to her that the little book on the Hawthorne centenary owed its completeness. Now she finds herself received in England as an exponent of the Hawthorne legend, which is pleasant enough, although hardly expected, as her literary career did not begin until long after the death of Hawthorne, and her acquaintance with Concord dates from an even later time. The centenary seems to have revivified British interest in the former Consul at Liverpool-
