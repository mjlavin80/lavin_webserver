FROM READERS
The “ Literary Scrap.”
Xcto York Times Saturday Review of Boohs:
Like your unconventional but none tho less interesting E. P. Hadley, I confess to a love of those literary ** scraps ” with which The ,Nbw York: Times book Review is flavored every week. . Whether this is due to a depraved taste, or merely to that lingering trace of the. °ld Adam which, we are told, lurks in all of ug, I cannot say/ but I am free to Assert that while I invariably devour the contents of your book Review, including the advertisements and those small-type "Queries ” which strain my eyes, there is no.feature of it that I relish more than the letters

from correspondents who KaVe time, talent, and courage to grapple^ with Kipling's grammar, the elusiveness of Henry James, the poetic quality of Edwin Markham, and kindred subjects. Surely tho writers who are abje to elicit so much enjoyable comment from what may be called " the reading public ” have furnished the best justification of their work.
If Mr. Kipling had called his story '* An Enforced Habitation ** it is not likely that his use of the article would have caused the slightest 'mental disturbance on the part of his supersensitive readers. I recollect that the sticklers for accuracy were equally annoyed when he published his great poem “ The Recessional,” They felt that they had caught him napping then ■when he wrote The tumult and the shouting dies,** and great were their jactitations because of their stfperlor knowledge. We are told there is great joy among the African pigmies when they find a lion asleep, but the difficulty arises in deciding who shall awaken the king of beasts.
To'my way of thinking Kipling is too big to be dworfed by small things. In this fit resembie-s his great countryman Shakespeare, whd could afford to write “ There is pansies, that's for thoughts/' Wouldn’t a poor devil of a modern “ minor poet *' gag at that and at many another phrase of the Master Workman of the English language?
Great mirds set the pace, and it is not for the hoi polloi to doubt but to admire.
I	read Kipling’s story with delight, and my pleasure would have been none the less had he called it " An House in Merry England." It was the stuff, and that's what counts.
Of Mr. Henry James I am less tolerant, not because of any lack of appreciation for his splendid work, but for the reason that, it seems to me, he descends to trivialities in correcting the English speech of Americans. If Mr. James felt called upon to do mission work for the mother tongue where could he find a more inviting field than In England? I grieve to say it that nowhere on God’s green earth is the English language more barbarously misused than in England. Take London, for example. Who is a greater offender against the canons of correct speech than the cockney, and it is not the coster or his class which is the most guilty in this respect. Then there’s Lancashire. Where can you find worse English than there? Certainly not in I^ew York or Philadelphia or Boston. And as for our schools, Bryn Mawr included, they are wells of purest English undeflled as compared with those of England. Mr. James's indictment of our English speech will not hold good for the reason that we treat the language much better than it is treated in its native land. Now, in saying this I do not presume to disparage Mr. James’s treatment of it. Right or wrong. I regard him as the greatest prose writer of our day—a master of English expression. It is true he sends me to the dictionary quite frequently, but I can say with the man who nearly broke his neck riding a spirited hunter over high stone walls, " ft Is worth it.” Meantime, Mr. Editor, do not discourage the literary scrap.”	NED	NKWCOME.
