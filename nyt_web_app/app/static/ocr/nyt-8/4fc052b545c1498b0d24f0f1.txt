SOME time ago we had occasion to point out that Mr. (or Herr) Houston Stewart Chamberlain, author of that striking German work, “ Die Grundlagen des Neunzehnten Jahrhun-derts,'* which owed mur.h of its vogue to the outspoken praise of Kaiser Wilhelm, was indebted for some of the ideas expressed in that book to Comte de Goblneau's "Essai sur I’In€galit6 des Races Humaines.’* Mr. Chamberlain contends for Aryan supremacy in the affairs of the world. Gobineau;"toot favored the Aryans, whom he called fils ae rot—sons of Kings. If his theory is correct, comparatively few Aryans of this epoch are enjoying their birthright.
Comte Gobineau was the French Minister at Eerne when he wrote his famous book, which doubtless would havi: been considered indiscreet, in the circumstances, if many persons had read the book. Later, however, Richard Wagner proclaimed Gobineau’s fherit to his own countrymen. Doubtless Mr. Chamberlain, a devoted follower oi Wagner in all his social and philosophical views as well as music, took up Gobineau under Wagner’s influence.
There has been lately in Paris «. rather noteworthy revival of interest fit Gobineau. A writer in the literary supplement of The London Times goes so far as to declare that his ‘* Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races ” Is " the literary gospel, the esoteric inspiration, of M. Barres and the French Nationalists." M. Robert Dreyfu3 has published " La Vie et les Proprieties du Comte de Gobineau.*’ His prophecies, bv the way, were frequently striking; ns when he doclared as long ago os tat middle of the last century that the Japanese were already Europeans and tht Russians realjy Asiatics.. That $eemed then an amazing paradox.	.
Jacques Morland has published a volume of selected passages from Gobineau, with a study of the writer. Final-

He was - an engaging personality, a Gascon by descent, a Parisian by birth, t a son of Odin in hie own pleasing fancy; an agreeable conversationalist, a graceful writer, always a man of tho world. He wrote for the Revue des Deux Mondes and the Journal des Defeats, Tocqueville enticed him into the diplomatic life in 1S4S. His last post was at Stockholm in 1872. The review of his life and his republished works, from which we have already quoted, (printed in The London Times Aug. 11.) contains this passage:
The Comte de Gobineau held a briet for the 6lite. According to him humanity was divided into four categories— blockheads, brutes, scamps, and the sons of Kings. These royal souls were alone of count or value in. the world, the lower ranks of the hierarchy existing merely to afford them, as It were, a humus to grow in. The Fils de Rol are always, or almost always, Aryan by race, for the Aryan is your only race i*oyal. The very name comports the root Ar—“ qui signifie honorable, par excellence,” and tho German Ehre. Honor, courage, virtue, beauty, force, talent, energy, and dignity are the birthright of the Aryan, and would be unknown to the Semite, Mongol, Finn, Tartar, or negro, but for the fact that no race is pure; -some drop of the base discolors the bluest veins of heroes, and some roypl red mixes with the yellow scum of China, But the superior race is superior by reason of its larger proportion of true Aryan stock. To keep this treasure pure is the whole duty of mankind, the world’s great effort being to continue a past which the future may not hopb to copy, yet may to some extent preserve. For your real King's son is immortal; he dies, buLhis incorruptible atoms recombine, and from their ashes royal souls revive. Alexander is dead and turned to clay, but who is this, in his likeness? Napoleon. Plato disappears; but look at Raphael, listen to MozartI And why weep for Michael Angelo when you might understand Beethoven? Thus (or.somewhat in this wise) did M, de Gobineau moralize on the eternal return on earth of sach immortal spirits as were Aryan in their race and royal by their essence. Naturally, these princes of the elect, superior to mere mortality, are not subject to the ethics of our dust. Right is right and wrong wrong for the mere man: but wrong may very well be right for the children of the King. And here we recognise a theory familiar to readers of Nietzsche—the two ethics, the masters' code and the law of slaves. Nietzsche and Gobineau had, at one time, in the shape of Richard Wagner an illustrious point of contact. But with all his art and skill M. Robert Dreyfus has not made it entirely clear whether Nietzsche adopted the theories of Gobineau or whether Gobineau conveyed the ideas of Nietzsche.
. He was something of a historian, with slight regard for proofs, with sublime contempt for facts; something of a wit, always witn a hint of the jester, Go-I bineau’s contemporaries did not take him seriously, and he is now chiefly Ini teresting as an exponent of certain dis-tingulshing traits of the French character.
