David O’Conor has translated from the German A* Blunck’s book of " Lessons on Form,*' (4to, Pp. 124. Many illustrations. New York:	Bruno Hessling,
G.	M. B. H.,) written and drawn at the special request of the Prussian Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The lessons were prepared with the object of initiating the student into what form and ornament mean, and were arranged otirefully. In his preface the author shows how tho student in drawing could be shown to look at his work as not merely mechanical. He writes:
•	* + Instead of allowing- the pupil to struggle along mechanically he should be taught froftr the very first lesson that the exercises he attempts to draw have a form. He should be taught to see this form and to understand it, to compare it with other forms and no£e the difference.
•	* * He begins to develop an intelligent Idea of what form is, his artistic senses are touched, he begins to see that all which he draws is employed for a purpose—for ornament.
And Herr Blunck, who, bv the way, is a well-known German architect, proceeds to explain the series of examples of forms presented on the hundred-odd pages. He shows and describes geometric, natural, and artistic forms; forms of ornament as such and applied ornament, bands, non-free endings and free endings; supports and borders; limited and unlimited ornament for plane surfaces; cartouches, shields, coats of arms, emblems, and symbols. He shows how to draw flowers,
] scroll designs, tassels, columns, supports, wreaths, garlands, animals, crowns, shields, &c.t all of which he explains in the twenty pages preceding the drawings. For the student of artistic decoration occupied with the study of how natural forms' are conventionalized, the volume wlil prove a handbook of much interest ' and of constant help—both as an inspiration and an application.
