j	Airs.	Humphry Ward's Visit
Utica (N.	Y.)	Observer.
The New York Tiwks Sattjuday Review contained in Its list Issue an announcement that Mrs. Humphry Ward woukl visit this country soma time before the close ot this year. We count this good news. Mrs. Ward divides with George Eliot the honor of being the greatest woman novelist England has produced. She leaped Into prominence as the author of " Robert Elsmere/’ and has since maintnined the h’gh rank that was forced upon her by writing " Lady Rose’s Daughter,,f M The Marriage of William I Ashe," and other first-class novels. If, as Tfte Times hints, she may incorporate . J a little American background in tne ' scenery of her next novel we may be j sure it will be well done, because in the first place Mrs. Wart! is no mere caricaturist and her fine and elusive wit does not lie in the direction of ma&ing
fun ot a whole people—as Charles Dick-., ens's did, •	*	* Surely, we shall unite in
welcoming Mrs. Humphry Ward, and we will read with pleasure and profit whatsoever she may have to say of us, pro-vlded it is written in the same frank -spirit that has made her English char a;* actera so lovable^' -
