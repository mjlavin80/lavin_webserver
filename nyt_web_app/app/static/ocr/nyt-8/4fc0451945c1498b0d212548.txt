IF a grown-up person's memory of what a real boy is actually like is to be trusted, then the boys in this book aro very boys indeed. The author says they are the boys he knew In his native New England town—often with not even their names changed—and most readers will be quite willing to believe that the whole thing is history. The company assembles, in the first place, about a shed where “ Skinny" conducts a mercantile emporium, in which various soul-ensnaring articles are cunningly displayed and sweet fern and rattan for cigarettes, sweetened water, and the like are exchanged for nails and other negotiable hardware. After that follows a .great battle with snowballs, the town boys against the students of Phillips Exeter Academy, ignominiously named “ stewed cats,*' and the next la a " party,” at which one of those same ** stewed cats '* carries off the belle of it all, especially beloved of “ Fatty/’ That act of piracy leads, of course, to a challenge formally delivered, and after an elaborate season of traiping to a dreadful encounter behind the schoolhouse between Fatty and the offending “ stewed cat"—an encounter with seconds, sponges, „raw beefsteak, and all the proprieties of such occasions.

Other chapters tell of great games of glorious war, adventurous fishing excursions, and of the launching of a wonderful flat-bottomed boat built by the boys. Still others tell of a fair got up by these same boys, with races and a Wild Man of Borneo, and a real bull fight, or something very like Jt, and of how three of the most ambitious and adventurous toolc a flyer in horseflesh.
It seems pietty safe to say that anybody who is still a real boy, or anybody who was once a real boy, and in those boyhood days lived or even longed to live as a real boy should, will read Mr. Shute’s new book with audible chortling delight. Again the illustrations—and that is a rare thing enough—are perfectly in the spirit of the text, and aid immensely the general cheerful effect.
