THERE is a flavor of flattery In the title ** The Rhymers’ lexicon ” Rhymers, of course, need a rhyming: dictionary; but true poets, muse-inspired poets, need none. They lisp tn numbers, for the numbers come. But the plain, everyday rhymers need help—entirely apart from that needed by their readers; and this help Mr. Loring offers them. We coi.fess that, owing to a slight acquaintance with various foreign languages, living and dead, we have been able to find rhymes whenever, in the past, we needed them; and that never but once, as a rhymer, did we seek help from a rhyming dictionary. Then we did not find the desired rhyme and had to recast the poem. In spite of this fact, however, we are ! sure that we can recommend this book to those who need it; and even poets, real [ poets, might find It useful to lend to their rhyming friends.
To the average non-rhyming man or woman, Mr. Saintsbury's introduction and Mr. Loring’s preface will be acceptable and Interesting. The former discusses English prosody and versification; the latter rhyme. His explanation of the arrangement of the volume opens the subject of the sound of words. He stands up for rhyming *' girl ’* with " c-url ’* on historical grounds—‘* great poets have so rhymed the word and ventures to be a little facetious; “ As pronounced by those careful in vowel sounds, the word is un- ! mated—and what would song writers— | nay, even poets—do without a partner , for *gfrl *? *’	j
Mr. I^oring says that ** there are about 1 sixty monosyllables and words accented I on tho last syllable which appear to be rhytneless "; and he names them, from “ aitch ” ^o " wolves.** We are pleased to find ** brusque,” ** conch,” ** fugue,”
“ poulp,” and ** sixth." Altogether an able book, full of aid to those who make rhymes.
