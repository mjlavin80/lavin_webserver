The lLver-Inte res ting Dispute About Criticism—Hot Weather Con troversie
HE President of the United States, in spite of the Jack of any provision to that effect in our Constitution, has as much right as any private citizen to exercise the function of the critic and commend books in prose and verse to the attention .of his fel-low-men. Mr. Roosevelt's impulses prompt him to quick action in matters of art and literature as well as in affairs of state. We remember well a letter full of generous appreciation he wrote to one of our poets in the very thick of a heated political campaign, To the lasting credit of the poet let it be said that he never made the letter (which might have been the means of selling: many of his books) public property, but keeps it carefully guarded among: his private t-apers. Tears hence his literary executor will have it incorporated in his 14 authorized ** biography. The latest subject of the President's literary enthusiasm is Mr. Edwin Arlington Robinson, whose* volume of poetry, (Mr. Roosevelt objects to calling it " verso,*’) “ The Children of the Night.*’ (published in 1807,) he has commended in. The Outlook. We cheerfully pass along the good word and cordially congratulate Mr. Robinson on his good luck. He is still a young man, (in his thirty-sixth year.) and will
*
doubtless be encouraged to write many more books of verse for the edification of a people enlightened as to their worth by a Chief Magistrate who is also a popular hero. As for the professional critics who have hitherto failed to recognize the gifts of Mr. Robinson, they have only themselves to blame if they do not now hurry to “ get on the band wagon." By the way. for this dropping into the ** United States language *’ in commenting on the commendation of an American poet by an American President we have no apology to offer. The subject is not one to be dismissed in a few words of effete English.
