Mist orical M naccurncies i II Fiction.
Keic York Times Saturday Krrietc of Ifook*:
Some remarks of Henrj' James scoring the modern novel writer raeeV with my warm approval. But, cui bono, if the people will pref -r trash and historical inaccuracies to sound, good, truthful books? What an immense sale “ Monsieur Beuu-c;Lire " had! Yet it wns an impossible book, with an impossible plot, the main feature of which was an attachment of the daughter of the then Duke of Somerset (it is Wintersct i;i the book) for a barbt-r, a valet, a gimbk r. l>o th“ I^nlie-* St. Maur look for their niale.s among that class of people? [Do we have classes In this country that one may ask this question ?—Editor.1
' Now take “ Dorothy Vernon of Ilafl-don Hall.” This book is full of historical inaccunicies. 1 have a friend, a lady of culture and refinement, a widow of a Minister Plenipotentiary, a lariy versed in Krenrh and Spanish as well as English.

CoL Gage was Governor of Montreal for some years before he was sent to Boston. In'Canada he wtis a thoroughly respectable officer	and a	gentleman
greatly respected by all. Why, when he goes to Boston, he becomes a sot, a libertine. and a gambler—can Mr. Chambers explain the inconsistency?
Mr. Chambers portrays I^ord Dunmore : as a cowarS, a roufe, an effeminate fop I or coxcomb. What	warrant	in history

the finest colony in the empire. Yet
