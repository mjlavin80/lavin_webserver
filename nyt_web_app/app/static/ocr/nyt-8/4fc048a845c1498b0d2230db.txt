HERE has been some criticism of late of American historical scholarship because
* *
so little attention has been devoted to the investigation of European subjects. Just prior to and (taring the civil war so much was done in this direction that the late Edward A. Freeman was accustomed to speak of "the American “ Historical School,0 (National Review. ISG4.) Prescott. Motley, and John Foster Kirk composed the group of brilliant writers and students of whom Freeman spoke. Prescott and Motley are so well known throughout Europe and the United States and have been so generously rewarded that one wonders why they have found so few imitators. Kirk*3 “ Life of Charles the Bold M appeared at such a time that few of his fellow-citizens could read him; his name is scarcely known in his own country. But Kirk has not deserved so ill a fate; and Motley has received more at the hands of posterity than he really won. His theme and his glowing partisanship
earned for him many a laurel that could not be grleaneJ to-day. And Prescott, too, holds a high rank —some say the highest in American historiography. Why, then, has Europe been left entirely alone for nearly a half century?
The answer to this query Is to be found In the fact that since the day of Motley and Prescott a mighty convulsion has so changed the feelings and ideals of American students that the older continent has been forgotten. (This is not meant 1o apply to our armies of tourists.) Under the stimulus of the Nationalist victories of the civil war we have developed “a school" of students of our own history: John Fiske worked anew the ground of George Bancroft; Parkman explored the Northern and Western frontiers in such a way that he was able to give to-» the world what is,.perhaps, up to the present time, the finest piece of historical writing ever produced on this side of the Atlantic; Henry* Adams wrote an equally important history of the Administrations of our eariy Republican Presidents; the great Southwest has been treated in a masterly way by H. H. Bancroft: and during the past decade Mr. James Ford Rhodes has given us an account of the civil war which renders superfluous further effort in that field for some decades to come. These are brilliant achievements, several, perhaps all of them, surpassing the works of Prescott and Motley. One subject alone remains untouched—the Old South and ' its magnificent struggle to found a unique and picturesque civilization on American soil. But the time is hardly ripe for a full and fair portrayal of this most § enticing of all our historical themes.	.
Our own history, short as it has been, has absorbed. the attention of American students. Even In the universities there has been a marked tendency to concentrate a large share of the teaching force and talent, to set candidates for the doctorate to work, on the home field. It is practical, utilitarian, and the American likes always to see the tangible good that will result from his work. It Is, however, time that we turn again to Europe, the source ot all our institutions. Recognizing this weaker side of our historical endeavors, the American Historical Association at its New Orleans meeting <1903) established a liberal prize to be awarded annually to i the author of the best piece of investigation in European history. . And now the question of founding a school of historical research in London not unlike that of Prussia In Rome is-being discussed.
It is, then, with agreeable surprise and unfeigned delight that we welcome the first volume of Mr. David Jayne Hill’s “ History of European Diplomacy Mr; Hill is the American Minister to The Hague; he is besides an accomplished scholar long-associated with some of our best educational Institutions. It Iff in harmony with the best traditions- ot our foreign service, that such men aa the lamented ___~

; / %The plan of the author of the volume
I -r in hand is to produce a history of Kuro-v- pean diplomacy beginning with the de-:>~cay1ng universalism of the Roman Em-C'.pire and closing with the complicated
-	international relations of our own day. This Is indeed a formidable task. It is one that needs to be done. So far as the reviewer’s acquaintance goes there Is no Buch work in English, and the French and German investigations of the subject are not apt to be translated. Mr. Hill, unlike most students of diplomatic history, looks for the foundations of the subject in the customs and methods of the early Roman Church. Hitherto we have been accustomed to look upon the Congress ot Westphalia as the dawn of European diplomacy, Which date is similarly assigned as the beginning of international law.
.. The first chapter of the^present volume treats otTthe organisation of Europe under the Roman Empire and the last portrays for us the dramatic overthrow of Boniface VIII. by Philip the Fair of France. The intervening subjects are interesting indeed, as.they must ever be to him who wovVt know the origins of the present dominating civilization of the world. As the Roman power gradually gave way, a special and vital institution sprang up, the Roman Church. This organization
*	of the early followers of the Man of Galilee first appears in history as a simple .philanthropic agency; before the middle of the eighth century it claimed to be the source of all earthly author- , ity, and in the year 1300 Boniface VUI. declared, and the world in general admitted the claim, that he alone was Emperor, that every human being was both in spiritual as well as temporal things subject to his will! This growth, this distortion of the purposes of the founders of-Christianity, was attained almost exclusively through diplomatic -^activity. Hence the main theme of Mr. Hill’s volume is to show how the Church, under the guidance of the Roman Bishops, accomplished ?uch results. Incidentally the constructive work of Clovis, Charles the GrbHt, Otto L, and the Hohenstauffens is described. And in his hasty survey of these ** mak- i era ” of history the author reminds one of the brilliant work of Mr. James Bryce on the Holy Roman Empire. Besides the clear, lucid statement of ■ these portions of the work we are pro- i
1° vided with admirable chronological ta- , Wes .of the Popes, Eastern and West- ! em Emperors, Kings of the Goths, J Franks, the English, and the French.
The author does not take anything for granted, but goes direct to the so'urces, giving satisfactory lists of these at the end of each chapter. The principal, in fact, nearly all of the authorities cited have been published and are to be found in the larger libraries of Europe and this country. The M Codex Theodosianus,” “ Monum*mta Germaniae," “ Pontificum Romano-rum,’* &c., with other scarcely less Important publications, are constantly drawn upon. However, the archives of the various Governments have also rendered their share of information and guidance, The bibliographies of these sources, as well as of the literature of diplomacy, with the accompanying comment, will undoubtedly prove helpful to the investigator.
IDEALS IN DIPLOMACY.
DIPLOMACY has a bad reputation in the minds of most men; a diplomat is one who ** lies abroad for his country,” some one has irreverently ! Bald. And judging from the tortuous ways and the astounding deeds of the greatest of diplomats, Talleyrand and Bismarck, for examples, the world is not far wrong in its estimate. However, it is riot the purpose of the author to make any sort of defense for the members of his calling. He simply and truthfully says at the outset:
More than any other form of history perhaps that Of diplomacy brings into prominence In its plenitude the psychological element, the constructive value of human plan and purpose. It reveals the mind of an Individual, or the sagacity of a group of statesmen, graspIng the conditions of a situation in which vast combinations of force may be thwarted by other combinations, and
■	' V	■	I
the interest of a nation, or civilization, itself, secured by a sound public policy.
And any one who bears in^mind the real purpose and work^of Talleyrand at Vienna or Bismarck in dealing with the Schleswig-Holstein question will disabuse his mind of the externals of the subject and agree entirely with the above serious and thoughtful statement. After all, it is not alone force— so much lauded in our day—that wins the lasting victories of civilized socioty, but ideals; witness the history uf Japan since 1852.
A noteworthy feature of this •-.areful study is the account (P. 15Z^on) of the entente between the Papacy and the Empire as embodied in the Constitution of 824, as Mr. Hill feels justified in calling it. The imperial missus resident In Rome, his functions and his privileges, is the important product of this -M Constitution.” All parties concerned admitted without question that the right of supervising the civil government of the Eternal City rested with this representative of the distant master; the imperial missus or legate lived In the Pope’s palace, heard appeals from the courts of justice, and guaranteed in the name of his sovereign that every citizen should be judged ac-
cording to the law of his choice—Roman, Frankish, Lombard. This had been the work of the great Charles; it was ordained in the most solemn manner as the irrevocable right of the World-Emperor in the Pope's own city. But the events of succeeding years, and more particularly the shrewd diplomacy of the successors of St. Peter only show the futility of written constitutions or of the most sacred compacts when the interest of nations or the will of powerful personages runs a contrary course.
Otto I. and his missionary conquest of the Slavs are viewed under a rather different angle from that of the regular historian of those topics. This policy was resorted to consciously, says Mr. Hill, not to make the heathen Christians so much as to create a new basis for the German monarchy, Just as the Irish-English missionaries to Germany had laid the real foundations of the empire of Karl Martel and Pippin. Otto’s plans and dioloma/rv wore directed toward a single end—the coun-
terbalancing-of the power ot the Barons of South and West -Germany with thtvt of the powerful Bishops and. Margraves-whom he appointed to rule in the new region.,. But his own son—the Archbishop of Mainz—acting In conccrt with the Pope stanchly opposed this scheme. They would not have expansion at the expense of the- Slavs If this meant any weakening of the spiritual arm; they preferred,- as has so often been the case,' ,the narrow limits of the present kingdom to a broader empire in which the Church was not the ruling factor. Otto “went to Italy,”.as the Germans say, because the Church was determined to tie his hands at home. In other words, domestic policy dictated foreign conquest—a similar state of things to that which In the United States led to the wars with . Mexico and Spain. The analogy continues^ for the subjugation of the papacy and the annexation of Northern Italy which followed, finally brought the ruin of these expansionist leaders of the tenth t*entury.
THE POWER OF THE POPES.
THIS large structure of Otto collapses two hundred years later and for a while the Popes support the world upon their broad shoul-
ders. Meanwhile the towns of Northern Italy, learning from crafty Venice and priestly Rome the lessons of diplomacy—the balancing of their enemies against each other—assert their claims for local independence. Treaties are made, leagues and federations are consummated; the old universalism of Rome so long dominant in the policies of Emperors and Popes is undermined before either of the great contestants is aware of it. A new “ idea,” as the historian Ranke would say, had appeared—that of local autonomy, of national integrity.
As this notion becomes prevalent in the various parts of the Christian world the policy of the tiara is modified to suit the exigencies of the new situation. From the days of Innocent HI. to the close of the period under consideration, even to our own times, the Roman Pontiffs maintained that they were the only rightful sources of authority; this authority, coming from God direct to the Papal mind, was only another way of asserting infalii-
.	.	-V-'	'	"	'	‘
bllityy the theory of to-day. If Rome be the centre from which alone the will of the Creator emanates, then no earthly potentate may dare lift his arm against the Holy Father, or pursue a counter policy to that of tlie Church. Hence the declaration of Boniflce that all Kings were but the agents of his wJIK The ideal of the. Church was that the States of the world were only members of a vast federation of which the Pope was the lawful head. Italy, however, ought, according to this view, to be the patrimony of St. Peter. In this way the Idea of Italian unity, so often dreamed of, was to be worked out. In pursuit of its great scheme of universal domination the Church had extended its system of diplomacy to all parts of the world, had sent spies to reside at the seats of Government, had bribed the counselors of Kings, committed arson and murder whenever an opponent could not otherwise be disposed of. But the national States of the West—the outgrowth of the brutal feudal anarchy—declined to submit themselves to the Popes. Philip the Fair, supported by Edward I. of England, dealt a death blow to the Papal policy in 1303; the aged Pontiff was seized and carried away a captive. All his plans came to an abrupt end; the scat of the Papacy itself was removed a few years later to Avignon. Local, autonomy, whether of a league of towns or of feudal States, had triumphed. Modern times had dawned. The arts of diplomacy began to be cultivated in the rude Courts of the .West; the lessons of the Church were soon learned and its methods imitated. The nations now send representatives to the various Courts, and it was soon a matter of doubt whether the Papal Nuntius, the Venetian Ambassador, or the national Minister were more skilled in veiling his real motives or driving hard bargains for their masters.
VENETIAN DIPLOMACY.
MR, HILL has shown that a careful study of the history of the
Church yields a rich harvest of custom, example, and precedent, that Rome was the teacher of diplomats as well as of priests. And next in importance in the realm of mediaeval diplomacy was Venice. The Venetians, like the Popes, having won their greatest victories in this way, laid great stress on this branch of their public service. A law of 1268 attests the correctness of this assertion: Ambassadors were not allowed to be accompanied on their missions by their wives lest state secrets should leak out; they must, however, take their own cooks to avoid being poisoned; no present could be received without the consent of the State. After 1288 each envoy was required by law to file a written report of his ministry with the Keeper of the Archives. Later it was made unlawful for an Ambassador to hold conversation with strangers or to write letters on political questions addressed to persons not connected with the Government. So severe were the regulations that it became a difficult matter to obtain the best men for the foreign service. Fines had to be imposed upon the appointees who refused to depart for their posts.
After the opening of the fourteenth century the Western powers sent representatives regularly to the Courts of their neighbors. And this may perhaps be taken as the beginning of modern history. Certainly it marks as different a view of things as other events which have been said to open ; the new and later period.
To sum up: Mr. Hill planned a com-	'
prehensive work. While the reviewer	I
must speak ffom the standpoint of	'
the lay reader and student of history in general, he feels safe in saying that this new work will at once take rank as the best in its field. It was carefully thought out in the first instance, „ and then executed in the most satisfactory manner. Neither the special student nor the educated reading public has ground for complaint. The author’s style is clear, direct, and im-	[
pressive rather than florid and rfce-	'
torical. His marshaling of facts and	I
proof; his mastery both of the details of his theme and of the broader lilstor-	]
ical perspective; his admirably sane	J
and judicial poise of mind all conspire to give his work a solid and substantial rating which few if any American students of European history have attained.	WILLIAM	E.	DODD.
