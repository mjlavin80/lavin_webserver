New York Times Saturday Review of Books:
TO say that I am interested in the dispute about jour poets Is to express It mildly. It seems to me that no man of sense can disagree wilh the definitive conclusions of Mr, plow. I am glad to see so doughty a champion of the imagination enter the lists against the petty versifiers and poeticules of this im-poetical and unimaginative age. What
man of Imagination, Indeed, can find pleasure in the mawkishness of a Markham, of a Moody, of a Doyle, and of the other degenerate poetasters who would pass for poets? To rid us of this multitudinous and pestiferous spawn is the aim of the New Criticism.
Tet some of your readers would call these blbbering balladIsts, these flies on the back of Pegasus, these darkenera of ! speech, poets! Hah! Verily this Is an uu-tomobflious age. It is more. It is a photographic, realistic age. Happily the time is past when men shall find either pleasure or profit In the inane stuff that a few inconsequential schoolmen ~ call poetry. Imagine foam crumbling! Can a liquid crumble? What shocking taste! No won-1 der your vaunted poets are so neglected. Their " barbaric yawp " shudders over the roofa of the world. Well may they shriek. It is their death cry. Pegasus has been changed for the automobile. The skyscraper Is the tower from which sounds, even now, the deathknell of romance. The magazine is but the receiving vault where I Verse (for more" than value received) Is deposited preparatory to its interment In ! the limbo of the everlasting, j Macaulay's unanswerable arguments, so cogently supplemented by the logic of i Mr. Clow, are surely not refuted by the buskined dramaturgicals of Marlowe; nor j by the shivers and shrills of Shakespeare; nor by the barbarous bellowings of that blind and baited bull, John Milton; nor by the irreverent rant of that reckless libertine Byron; nor by the hectic ardors of the •■Auriferous Keats; nor yet by the foam and froth 3f. the nebulous Shelley; nor, finally, by the tintinnabulations of that arch-alllterationallst the too assiduous Algernon'
Personally I believe, nay I am convinced—and I suspect Mr. Clow in his heart of hearts agrees with me—that the last poet died long before Tennyson!
After all, Homer is the only poet—the alpha and omega! And even the best of Ifomer now lies bur/ed fn a Scotchman's Lhistled phrase* Sic transit gloria mundi!
But to hark back to the martyrdom of Markham. Verily, this versicle " Virgilia ” is an ague of alliterations. The images also are obstreperous monstrosities wallowing in a chaos of oblivion— from wliirh, thanks to the scientific spirit, they sfhall never emerge save as fossils, to be laid, with, the bones of the esrtinct dodo, upon the shelf, In the laboratory of the past.
Thanks to the scientific spirit the day of the maudlin, moony, melancholy line is over. The pestilence that under the '*eil of Romance stalked through the gilded purlieus of civilization is a coffined corpse. And none so poor to do it reverence! How are the mighty fallen!
For once be candid with yourselves, ye admirers of the acrobatic Markham. Can you Imagine foam crumbling? Can you photograph it? To be convinced, Mr. Clow and I must have that photograph. Nothing else will satisfy the scientific spirit. Come, come—you must materialize! A crumble of foam! Homer in Hades—has it come down to this?
Then those lines about the trees clapping their hands and the hills skipping like lambs. This is too utterly utter—almost	as bad as the	badness of a certain
bard	whom I shall	leave	to	the tender
vivisections of Mr. Clow.
To mention the absurdities of the modems	would fill the	Book	of	Doomsday.
For	instance, that	line	of	Marlowe's
where the steeds “ blow the morning from their nostrils.” How disgusting! Then ponder that '* white unravished bride of quietness,” the "Grecian urn" of the dream-drunken Keats. How empty i>nd hollow! What a pother about a funerary urn anyhow! And that *' beaker full of the warm South—full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene, with beaded bubbles winking at the brim.” Call for the South nt Sherry's and they will charge you up with moonshine. Can a bubble wink? TTna it eyes that it wink so wickedly?
Fuliy as absurd as the foregoing la the rustling verbiage of Markham. Take these lines from^" Lincoln
And when he fell in whirlwind he went down,	1
As when a kingly cedar green with boughs Goes down with a great shout upon the hills	■
And leaves a lonesome place against the sky.	-
Fancy a cedar shouting! How hilarious- ' ly ridiculous! Markham la the limit! Mr. I Clow will. I am sura, agree with met* , Truly, than a poetaster there is nothing I
