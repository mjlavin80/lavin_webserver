"An Invitation to a Journey," Auguste Br£al, author of ** Rembrandt/' &c., calls his little volume on “ Velasquez/* (In the Popular Library of Art. 16mo, Red limp leather. Pp. 236. Gilt tops. Illustrated. New York: E. P. Dutton & Co.
,) which has been translated from '* an exacting1 ** French text by Mme. Simon Efcissy. And he further explains that It is " neither a treatise on aesthetics, nor an historical essay, nor a catalogue. nor even a guidebook," and does not recommend It to the tourist who*mig'ht wish to i take it with him on his visit to Velasquez's pictures. M. Br6al does not at* tempt to describe any of the Spaniard’s work^t nor tell their meaning; should he do this, he writes, it would be unnecessary to see the pictures, and. because he believes Velasquez’s pictures ” extremely curious and passionately interesting to look at," he has given in his book neither a “ metaphysic of painting, nor a history of Spanish society In the seventeenth century, nor even a biography filled with j revelations concerning Velasquez."
I There are also two or three portraits of the artist by himself. As a piece of book-maklng ** Velasquez ” is in perfect keeping with the dainty yet Impressive style of its predecessors Jn The Popular Library of i Art. ■
