** Unmlxed,” Not ** Mixed.”
New For* Timet Saturday Review of Books:
1 Mr. E. P. Hadley declared in a letter , last week that your issue of two weeks I ago was simply "bully.” So say we all!
; And I want to say further that any week ! I can get more bcokish joy out of The New York Times Saturday Review than I can get elsewhere for twice the money. Long life to you!
But I differ from Mr. Hadley in one point. As one of the renders and admirers of Edwin Markham's books of verse, I must dissent from Mr. Hadley’s merry-andrew thrust at our poet's work. After some smiling banter, he makes, the statement that this poet sometimes clothes his ideas “ in unmixed metaphorical gn.rl>. This implies that Mr. Markham sometimes mixes his metaphors. Now this would be a serious fault in him, if it wt re true. But it Is not trne. In a careful reading of his poems, I have not come upon one mixed metaphor.
