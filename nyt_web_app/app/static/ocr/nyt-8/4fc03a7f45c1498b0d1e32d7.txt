Hew York Times Saturday Review of Books:
The discussion on this subject recalls a literary controversy of the days of Ainsworth and G. P. R. James as to whether " a ” historical romance or *' an *’ historical romance was the more correct expression. It was decided in favor of the last, as being not only more euphonious, but more in accordance with the best usage. Both the ** n ” and the “ h *’ are to be sounded, but both with a somewhat softened inflection, as in the Scripture term ** an hundred,” which no one would dream of pronouncing *’ an ’undred,” but ■which loses much of its force and dignity when modernized into *' a hundred." If this decision is correct so is ’* An Habitation Enforced."
