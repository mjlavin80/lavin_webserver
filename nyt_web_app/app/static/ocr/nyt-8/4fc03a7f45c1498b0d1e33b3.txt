OL. HIGGINSON is engaged on the memoirs of his grandfather, Stephen Higginson. who was Naval Agent of the United States in the days before the Secretary of the Navy existed, and was employed in naval business for some years afterward. His was a life to tempt a biographer. In I7G6, at the age of twenty-one, he sailed from Salem as Captain, leaving his newly wedded bride at home, and when the Revolutionary War came ten years later he became a privateer in the casual, yet entirely businesslike, New England manner. Boston remembers him j in later years as her leading merchant and ship owner, and in literature he appears as the writer of the Laco letters, published as “ Ten Chapters in the Life of John Hancock," and also ot a " Defense of Jay's Treaty." He served in Congress, aided in organizing the State defense against Shays, and lived until Col. Higginson was five years old. so that their two lives span the years since Cul-ioden.

Marion Harland* a " When Grandmamma ^ Was Fourteen *’ is a. book to delight dreamy girls. The heroine’s tribulations while learning that the real world differs from that which she makes of poetry and • novels are very real, but the author’s gvratest success is “ Mr, i-'rederic Sed-ley.” He was ' made tip of “ sections of Mr. Edward Dunallan, Sir. Charles Grand-esc a, Ivan hoe, and William Wallace, cemented and. riveted with . material from minor heroes who figured in Godey’s Lady's Book, and he made Grandmamma indifferent to commonplaco boys.” Also, he said *' my love ” like the mothers in Mrs. Barbauld's works, and gave uncommonly good advice. Observers of fashionable foibles will note in this book a reminiscence of the " Grecian bend.” a device of the days between 1S40 and 1850, when tall women were sincerely pitied as unfeminine of aspect. The book Is to bear the imprint of the Lothrop Company, making a link between their novels and children’s books.

Now and then the *' Directors of the Old South Work ” publish a literary curiosity as a leaflet, and this week the Lowell Offering for October, 1845, appears in this guise, lacking a sketch entitled “ The Maniac Mother," and a chapter of a serial story entitled "First Love, Alas J " The omission of this matter is to be regretted for it shows a side of character quite as truly representative of the New England of that time as the solid common sense and sober verse which delighted Dickens and Miss Martineau. This number contains a New York letter in which the writer praises the people of the city as " so free and social,” and the “ facilities for travel," whereby one may go three miles for 6d. while in Boston you must pay twice as much/ but dislikes the.streets, finding them “arranged more for the accommodation of the New York porkers than of any other circle of aristocrats.” In the Tombs she saw Babe the pirate, and from the Battery the steamer Great Britain, a ** six-masted vessel, 300 feet long and painted black from stem to stem."
