Byron’s Standing as ' a Poet -
S'eta- York limes Saturday Review of Hooks: >
There are some writers who, feeling completely satisfied with their_ own -clear-understanding’ of the meaning of vV-hitt .they have committed on paper, take It for. granted that all their readers will readily understand it in p. like manner, I think* th.is carelessness on the part of the former is very unfortunate, as it is the /means, no doubt, of causing the loss to .the latter of much pleasure and instruction; and more, it is the very cause of that *' misapprehension ” which in turn tempts the iLyman to go " into print ” and say things which are responsible* apparently, for the very suffering those writers complain of.
If I mistake not. The New York Times Saturday Review of Books is not intended solely to be read by gifted authors who can guess at a glance just what a writer intends to say and does not say it; but also for the pleasure and edification of Its very numerous non-professional readers.

And 1 this "being so, is it not folly to expect that such a reader could, even in the slightest degree, make any one understand -the '* difference between -German and English -tone -values and cadences/* or to make .any one appreciate the many poetical beauties of the latter language, and espe-; cially the writer in question/ who is ap' parently a warm admirer of a poet (Heine) who detested all thlngrs English? Such being the state of affairs, -the readier is to "be pardoned if, observing that | said writer has set himself up as a cham-tpion of a celebrated French poet,- he has i his doubts about his quali^cations JEor » .that self-imposed task- And further, if the reader ascertains from good authori-i ties that this very French poet and his brilliant contemporaries, Vigny, Hugo, i Lamartine, Sainte-Beuve, Gautier, and others, as well as some of the best prose | writers of the time, George Sand included, all followers of the Romantic School, were more or less admirers of the poetry of the very poet he—the writer—has termed ** rhyme-smith/* is he—the reader —to be blamed lf( according to his power of understanding, he feels that could Alfred de Musset speak from his grave he would hasten to disown in no uncertain .words a champion guilty of such a trav-
