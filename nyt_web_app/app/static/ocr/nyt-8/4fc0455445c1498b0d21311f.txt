New York Times SaturxUzj/ Review of Boobs:
Before a long- word beginning with “ h ** either may be used—the English in general preferring ** an.*' the Americans “ a.” Thus we may say '* An historical event," or *'A historical event"; "an habitual drunkard,” or “a habitual drunkard,** and be equally correct whichever form we use. 1 Furthermore, in England. among the cult- | ured classes (wh) consider a misplaced j " h ” an unpardonable sin) many words have the initial “ h " silent, In which It is commonly sounded in America; as, hu- | mo(u)r. Still further, as in America so in England, there are m§.ny local variations of pronunciation, even in the best usage, affecting such we^j£ letters as , " h ” and " r,'* Increasing or decreasing their phonetic value; and even more than in America every man does that which is right in his own eyes in the matter of spelling, so that, were It not for a hard and fast tradition among the typesetters,
; we might find in English books a spelling and punctuation that would not only amaze, but appall us.
To apply all this to the concrete example before us: One may say with equal correctness “ A habitation " or “ An habitation,'* Kipling, moreover, uses a soft, purring pronunciation (witness his use of
" r ") in which " h *' and '* r " are barely audible, so that for him to say ** A habitation " would involve a disagreeable hiatus. “ Cunctator’s *’ contention that the '* n ** is silent is silly, seeing that the ** n ’* is added to the indefinite article for the express purpose of being pronounced. Biblical usage is also wide of the mark. The Bible—I say it with all reverence—is not a model for story English. Its many semi-archaic and obsolescent forms come well Into sermons, meditations, and poetry, but cannot be used in the ordinary prose of tbe day without the appearance of irreverence or at least of youthful pedantfcism. Kipling's close familiarity with the Bible is seen continually in beautiful expressions and sublime thoughts, but his judgment of the fitness of things is too nice, his artistic sense too keen, to allow him to use Biblical forms or models of expression, when they are out of pla.ee. as in the title of a story such as " An Habitation Enforced.”
IY do “ Cunetator *’ and the others darken counsel by words without knowledge? The law governing the use of “ a ” or " an ’* before ** h ’* is very clear and well known.
