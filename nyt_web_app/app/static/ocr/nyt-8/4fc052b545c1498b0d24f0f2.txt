The Rev. Dr. Joseph E. Hayne, a colored clergyman and physician 6f 78 Irving Place, Borough of Brooklyn, is the author of an interesting pamphlet designed to prove that the ancient Greeks, and all the Celtic races as well, were descended from the Amonian or Hamitic race. His arguments- are forcible and are backed by Ingenious classical and historical citations. He claims that “ the Black Man," as he calls him. is not of an inferior race, and that his ancestors were leaders in thought, learning, and scientific achievement. He points out ~to men of the negro race that there are only a few more than 10,000.000 Jews In the whole world, and that that race has triumphed because of its race pride, its confidence, industry, and frugality. He urges his own people to follow that good example. The pamphlet, which is eminently readable, may be obtained from the author- (25 cents.)
