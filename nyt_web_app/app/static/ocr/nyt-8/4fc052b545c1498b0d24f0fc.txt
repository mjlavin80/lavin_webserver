Ifeto York Times Saturday Rcvicto of Bocks:
)U published In your Issue of the Gth Inst, a long notice of Alleyne Ireland’s " Par Eastern Tropics.” Though the reviewer discovered evidence of ** feeling- ” and " prejudice " on tbe part of tho author against the Americans, be thought his criticism of our administration in the Philippines was ** corrosive," and left us in a ** deplorable situationthe latter observation relating in part to alleged " coquetting with	Aguinaldo and hia revolutionists,” and	what followed. But since Ad-
miral Dewey testified and President Schurman delivered bis luminous address on the subject in 1902, even Mr. Ireland's counter-statements and insinuations should be powerless to deceive many of his readers. On the educational part of our administration, on which he is critical—and vulnerable—I have space to merely hint at the facts.
In derogation of statements of Secretary Taft, he asserts that in the percentage of school enrollment to population we are surpassed by several British colonies. citing Barbados, with 7 per cent., and British Guiana, with 3 per cent.—as against 2.3 per cent., with which he credits the Philippines. As to the latter, the latest statistics, Autumn of 1904, credit us with 3.7 per cent.—50 per cent in excess of wnat he states; further, he goes to the antipodes for his British percentages ard tnkes most insignificant examples; for Barbados i^ one of the Windward group of islands, and in 18SG the whole group had less than 313,000 inhabitants, and British Guiana bad less than 233,000. Why avoid taking India, Britain’s greatest Eastern dependency, with a population, excluding the native States, of 'more than 230.000,000? Jt would have been appropriate, as to difficulties encountered, and remedies suggested or selected for meeting them. A great Order in Council of the Government of India of March, 1904, printed in Calcutta, elaborately discussing education and civil service examinations, (I have it before me,) shows this low (1.9) percentage, and those proposed remedial measures. It says that ** four villages out of five are without schools," that the educational methods operative there result “in a development of the memory out of all proportion to the other faculties of the mind"; and that "the Government has determined to give assistance in the form of scholarships to selected students to enable them to pursue a course of technical education under supervision, in Europe or America."
How familiar and homelike this seems! The Government in India " has determined ” to do this. In the Philippines we have already done substantially the same. I Exhibit B, attached to the last report of ! the Philippine Department of Public In- I struction, is the report of the Superin- . tendent of Philippine students in the I United States, to June, 1904—students sent j out under provisions of Act No. 854 Of the ■ Philippine Commission, passed Aug. 28, | 1903, which act fixed 100 as the number to be sent out the first year. The ex- i hlbitajso shows where they were placed. As might have been anticipated. Prof. i Bernard Moses of California, formerly , one of the second Philippine Commission, I and President Schurman of Cornell, Pres- | ident of the first commission, have been especially active in placing these students in California and Eastern institutions. One important consideration Mr;' Ireland seems not even to have thought of. Time j Js not of the " essence" of his " con- , tract." Barbados' and British Guiana I have been at peace for decades; so has i India. Per contra, it is only three years since a condition of peace was proclaimed In the Christianized parts of the Philippines. ' Maintenance for a few years of our present increase will place us ahead of Barbados, while our present percentage is now Just about double that of India arid British Guiana. India teaches vernaculars in a way we do not; she has a vernacular literature—important histories, and a vernacular press that was so virulent during the Governor Generalship of Lytton that he tried to suppress it. There is none tn the Philippines; so we teach English there; for, as Prof. Bernard Moses says, children " with only stjch means, as may be provided in Taga-log or Blcoi have still practically no* access to sources of Information regarding the worldwhile .“the boy.who in his* school days has learned the. language of a civilised nation, -even if he- has learned nothing else, has put himself en rapport with civilisation.” : :
Mr. Ireland’s^VIew is different. -The fact, that the natives are. eager tOi learn .'English does not affect his preconceptions—it Is a theory,.not a condition. . That we are them the language of the . self-governing nations Js in his view a mis-tqW as he believes - the ideaj .form ot government for Eastern, peoples. Is, a be-
nevolent^desj^Qtism—goYe^nII^ent•by.Eu^o^ peans.; His Idea is .illustrated J>y .Sarawak,. whichf-he. cites—wlth^Jts ..much-talkednDf, i&ja Brooke»' who/, sixty-tfcr^e.year3 ;ago*. obtainod. tho, gpvernmentVbfJt from' the' jSultan of Borneo^-a .prcfcc^ngiJn^B^ch*;

has written a lucid book about it all, in the index to which, under the word ** Sarawak," one finds " development necessarily slow.” And naturally! There was nothing to Inspire the people, about 500,-
000,	to make it other than “ slow.” Then, he finds our roadmaking a discredit to us, though we have been at It but three years, and some progress has been made-steel bridges built, &c.
But what about India? Gen. Chcs-ney (in ** Indian Polity ”) says the Northwest Provinces, which were ceded to the English partly in 17S1, partly in 1801, had a soil peculiarly well adapted to roadmaking, but that till Sir James Thomason became Lieutenant Governor of tha\ province, in 1&43, India was practically a roadless country; that then Dalhousie came, and pushed construction, though mail carts did not begin to run from Calcutta to Delhi over the i first great ** trunk ” line, up the Ganges valley, till 1850! And does Mr. Ireland suspect that Americans have had any hand in the development of India? Let me cite him this extract, from Sfr Richard Temple's " India in 18S0 ”—Sir Richard, distinguished as former Governor of Bombay, Lieutenant Governor of Bengal, and Finance Minister of India:
" Tramways have been introduced into the City of Bombay by American enterprise and are managed with that skill which Americans everywhere bring to bear on tills subject. They are very successful, and carry thousands of passengers dally, European and East Indian, as well as natives." (Second edition, London; John Murray, 1881.)
