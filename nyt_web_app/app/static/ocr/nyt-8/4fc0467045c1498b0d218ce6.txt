THE. FLOWLR GARDLN
M Roses and How to Grow Them *’ and Other Books on Domestic Floriculture.*
Written for The New York Tmsa Satu^u^at Esvusw
of books by MABEL OSGOOD WRIGHT.
DOZEN years ago, when the flood tide of a general return to nature and outdoor living began to be felt the entire length and breadth of the land, a renaissance of popular gardening came with it. Not but that individual Americans have . always loved their little gardens and the wealthy have had their pleasure grounds and greenhouses,
’
but as a factor in our life and a positive influence. X, do not believe that the general interest developed in the last do cade has obtained since Colonial times, when the flower garden was not only one of the resources o^the women of the new land, but a ‘fiBflfe with the past that fixed the stamp of tradition forr ever upon the new earth.	.	.
With the renewal of gardening there followed ah output of books upon the subject, mostly good, but tew indifferent, the chief fault In many of them being that in their enthusiasm they strove to cover too much ground, and by their very profusion of suggestion and advice confused the amateur for whom they were intended. Now the situation is clarifying and the monograph, the classic medium of exact science, wherein each plant Is treated as an individual, is appearing with us.
Th i s form has been used for many years by the various Roards of Agriculture, and the Cornell Experiment .Station has issued many valuable and exhaustive little pamphlets on the Dahlia, (named after Dahl the botanist,) sweet pea, aster, &c. These, being in paper covers, are liable to slip away into the daily drift of newspapers and become lost, so that the promise of a series of monographs of important flowers called M The Garden Library.” written from “the home point of view and practically illustrated by photography,, is very welcome, ** Roses and How to Grow Them,” the initial volume, being a skillful r6sum£ of various papers that have appeared in Country Life in America and The Garden Magazine, especially those of such au-' thonties as Dr. Huey, Aaron Ward, Leonard Barron, and Henry Hentz. Jr. To begin with, this volume, coming at midsummer, when the stress and hurry of planting is over, is particularly seasonable, for whosoever would grow roses with even a modicum of success must think out the location of Ills rosebed carefully and prepare the soil seriously well before the appointed time for planting. Which Important function, to my mind, as far as the hardy species are concerned, should be performed In Autumn, as the Spring season in these latitudes is apt to be cold and wet, and deep planting, such as hybrid perpetuals (especially when grafted) require, must oft cm be delayed until the rash of work has-bo\r;un.
To tho?e who desire roses and yet know nothing about them this little volume will be an especial fccon, so precise and unveiled by the drapery of unnecessary words are the instructions. Especially valunble are those upon soil preparation, for the eye of the novice is invarLaMy drawn toward- the glowing picture in the catalogue of what he wishes to plant rather Uian to the consideration of tho how and wisen ot the matter* This latter consideration is treaUd in the first chapter, " Roses—When* Where, and How to Plant." the topic being sorted out, as it were, and dreelaaired under the subdivisions of: The . site: test e^to&ure; making the test of other condl-tions. wliy Jow ground is to be avoided; the soil, preparation; must be well drained: manure; laying sut of beefs: pieparing to flant on a lawn; soils for liffcrcht groups: treatment of newly arrived plants;

-	The ideal site4 for a rose garden is -airy * but sheltered, (especially from the biting winds of Winter.) open to the sun some part of the day, quite free from the influence of large or growing’ trees, and preferably a little above the general level ox the rest of the garden. It must not be the lowest spot* A southern exposure is desirable, and, if it is necessary to make a choice, the rooming sun Is best. Partial shade will do less harm to dark-red roses thp-o to rosea of other colors. Some protection from high winds is good, but not at the cost of having a close, stuffy location.
The beginner Uprose growing will do well. to. weigh carefully the advantages and disadvantages of available sites. The soil may be poor and unsuitable. We can change that by taking away the present soil and filling in with soil from the meadow. Drainage and shelter can be provided, but if an error has been made in the site, all these accessories will avail little.
Then follows " The Routine of Work," ** Pruning," “ Insects, Diseases and Spraying/’, “ The Rosarian’s Calendar,” “ Roses for Cut Flowers Under Glass," "Types and Races.” " Roses for Special Purposes,” " Roses of American Origin,” as well as an intelligent index, a quality often lacking in like situations. A very pertinent and localizing touch is given to the volume by listing in the chapter on " Roses for Special Purposes " the species particularly adapted to widely separated localities, viz., roses for Chicago, the Qhio and Missouri Valleys, Oregon, New Jersey, Ontario, New York, &c.
Only one slip have I detected in this excellent little volume, but that might
r
prove sadly disastrous to some novice following the directions literally. Under the topic of grafted and ungrafted roses and the directions to remove the sterile wild-briar suckers from the former, this statement is made:	The
briar leaf has seven leaflets instead of only five, as in the garden rose.” Questioning this statement as too arbitrary in the case of a flower of such mixed ancestry and frequent cross-hybridiza-ticn, I quickly disproved it by going to the garden. Madame Plan tier shows both five and seven leaflets on the same plant, (an ungrafted one;) Anne de Diesbach the same difference, the crimson rambler always has seven, Ru-gosa seven to nine, the double pink thornless seven, Coquette des Alps often seven, Clothilde Soupert seven, and so on. Hence the distinction between the grafted and wild shoots must be Judged by the peculiar texture of the leaf and position of growth rather than by number of leaflets, a knowledge obtained only by patient observation.
ANOTHER ROSE: BOOK.
WHEN this volume has been duly digested the rose lover will be
in the mood for ” The Amateur Gardener’s Rose Book,” translated from the German of the lamented Dr. Julius Hoffman by John Weathers, F. R. EL S., N. R. S.
From the literary standpoint a book conceived and written by a single author imbued with his subject must always have greater Individuality than a compilation. Such is the case with the present volume, which opens with a scholarly and interesting classification of roses, to which Part I. is devoted, the following seven parts being given to “ Raising and Culture of Roses in the Open Air,” " Propagation of Rones,” “ Forcing," “ The Different Forms of Cultivated Garden Roses,” " The Raising of New Roses,” "Enemies of the Rose,” "Alphabetical List of Roses,” ” Index."
The German standpoint, while differing somewhat from the English for the very reason of climate, more nearly approaches our own, but the point that makes this volume a necessity to the amateur beginning his collection of roses is the twenty beautiful colored plates, the original paintings by Hermann Friese having been reproduced by Hochdanz at Stuttgart, under the supervision of the artist. These represent the highest grade of-iithographic art, giving the novice a true conception of the species portrayed, totally at variance with the lurid and exaggerated monstrosities of the usual plant catalogue. The colors of the more delicate and elusivcly tinted species are caught with remarkable accuracy. Belle Sie-brecht, Katserin Auguste Victoria, Grace Darling, and Franziska Kriiger being among the number, so that the possession of these pictures will not only give the amateur a knowledge of types, but of species as well, while this

Its less-.expensive American'cousin.

PAR WESTERN GARDENING. .
CS. HARRISON, President of the Nebraska Park of Forestry Society, has put out a most-vigorous and convincing volume on the importance to farming folk of including the cultivation of beauty with their other crops, under the title of “ The Gold Mine in the Front Yard." It is-a somewhat primitive and simple little book, emphasizing the crying necessity of beautiful outdoor surroundings for the home, yet vitalized by an earnest and Impressive quality lacking In more ambitious efforts. Through the pages devoted to the cultivation of well-knownr flowers and shrubs runs a little sermon against the greed of the actual dollar in the farm life and the lack of appreciation of many things that the dollar can buy. A few quotations will best show the point of view:
' Farmers complain that their children do not like the farm, and as soon as they can they will leave it. What wonder! I knew of a man worth $75,-
000,	with a large, well-stocked farm— not a carpet on the floor—not a rocking chair in the house—no book^—no mag-
tractF instead of'the livid hue that has
~ 1U r- .	-	<	,» v‘ ^1 •: -•	t
been used. ' Why~Is not more attention paid ito the physiognomy of the book by the printer outside of the; large centres? One thing has withstood all the freaks and fads of time—the pure white or vellum-tinted papers and heavyfaced type of the first printers.
M EXPERIMENTS WITH PLANTS.”
*
TfTFi third of the series of botanical textbooks planned several years ago by Prof. L. H. Bailey has now been issued, “ Experiments with Plants,” though by W. J. V. Osterhout, Ph. D.f of the University of California, (an institution rapidly coming to the front In original Investigative work*) instead of by Prof. Bailey himself, who was the author of the excellent books, 44 Lessons with Plants ” and “ Botany/’ that inaugurated the series that the present volume admirably supplements. Primarily* it is a book for the classroom, but it is also adapted by its fresh, crisp presentment of the subject for the general reading ot all those interested in plant breeding and modem horticulture. The subject of plant breeding as practiced by Luther Burbank, has now developed from a craft
.recent t^ooks upon the same topic more ‘beautifully illustrated and printed, but none more suitable* from thoroughness of treatment, photographic Illustration, and me Jerate price to do Its work in the schools for which it was intended.
Dickerson’s chapter on “ The Relationship of Moths and Butterflies/’ shoWS& classification and ancestry, is particularly illuminating and worthy of study l>y alU interested In this subject, so. Intimately related to the subtleties of floHculture.	M. O. W.

UNTIL lately no portrait of Marie Corelli has been published. Our artist’s sketch is taken from an authorized portrait, however, which, though undated, has only lately been put forth. Miss Corelli’s work recently, has been confined to social essays. In Pearson’s Magazine she has, been severely criticising English	Its “ functions,’* she says, *' are unquestionably the most wretch-
ed of their class, but chiefest among all the lugubrious, dispiriting methods of taking pleasure sadly is the ‘ garden party ’—the centre of this terrible illness I am speaking about, * Balls on the Brain.* The garden party is the infection place where one sees one’s neighbors at their lowest ebb of inanity. One’s ears are compelled, willy nilly, to collect the worn-out shreds and patches of the most utterly senseless conversation ever perpetrated by decently educated persons.”
azines or pictures—not a tree in the yard or a shrub or a flower. It- was grind, grind, grind for dollars from morning till late at night. The three daughters were lured away. The five hoys ran away, and all but one became vagabonds. *	*	*	When	the	whole
world is so full of beauty why should it be entirely ignored on the farm?
*	*	* The preparation of the ground
is the preparation of the owner.
One great drawback to the adornment o,£ the home grounds (of the farmer) is penuriousness. For Instance, a good strong rosebush, well rooted and ready for business, is generally sold for 50 ccnts. But the economical woman says: “That is outrageous. I can do much better than that. I have a catalogue and price list of a firm that will sell twelve choice kinds for $1: and they will come by mail, too, so that I shall save the expense." She sends for them and gets the twelve tiny things that should have a microscope sent along with them. She plants them, giving them ordinary (A* even careful attention. If she saves one out of the number she will do well, and that will probably be a poor, sickly thing, and it will take about three years to bring it to proper size. So she has paid out her ?1 and lost' three years. The mail order system is a great drawback.
The publisher would have pleased us better had he selected good white, paper for the printing of this emphatic
akin to the marvelous to a subject of general study, criticism, and from some standpoints a cause of apprehension for the future identity and purity of plant races.
The illustrations, to the number of over 250, are very lucid, and the wording of the table of contents itself should be a sufficient introduction to a book that opens an endless field of thought and study to student and pedagogue alike: “ The Awakening of the Seed/’ M Getting Established/' “ The Work of Roots,” “ The Work of Leaves/’ “ The Work of Stems/* “ The Work of Flowers/’ “ The Work of Fruits/' ** How Plants Are Influenced by Thdir Surroundings,” “ Plants Which Cause Decay, Fermentation, and Disease,” and ” Making New Kinds of Plants.” Under the magic of the author’s touch plant life assumes a new significance and an individuality akin to that c-f humanity itself.
