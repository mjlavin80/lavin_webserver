The Treasury has something over $475,000,000 in silver dollars in jtri vaults, against which certificates are outstanding:. It has $7,631,000 hi certificates, $19,302,000 in free silver tiollars, and over $3,000,000 in silver bullion* or $32,000,000 besides the silver dollars pledged to the redemption of the cev-i tificates. If all the fractional coinage that can be absorbed were issued there
would not be a particle of danger ot j ; * j any disturbance anywhere. It would be i
entirely feasible to coin all the stiver dollars demanded for that purpose without lessening in the slightest de- j gree the security ot the certificates. That security now does not rest on the fact that there are silver dollars in the Treasury, but on the fact that the Government is bound to maintain all sorts of money at par and must in some way manage to exchange gold for silver on demand. But Congress, though repeat* edly urged to do so by successive Secretaries of the Treasury, will not allow the silver dollars on deposit in the Treasury to be coined into fractional coins.
It is not the fear of inflation that prevents. Far from it. There can be no inflation by fractional coins, for they come back automatically the moment there ceases to be an active demand for them in actual exchanges. The trouble is that there is still linger-1 ing In the minds of Congressmen, and especially in the mucilaginous minds
*
of a few Senators, the superstition that what was “ done for silver" thirty years ago must not be undone in the smallest degree. The vast heap of semi-fiat dollars, on which paper has been issued, which paper is kept in circulation solely by the certainty that it will not be redeemed In silver if the holders happen to want gold, is surrounded with a sanctity which would be ludicrous if it were not a source of
m
serious possible danger. By every silver certificate paid into the Treasury and canceled, while the silver for it is coined into fractional currency, danger would be lessened and public convenience would be served. Let us hope that at the next session of Congress lomething may be done.
Amid the general activity and prosperity there is one place where business is dull to the point o'f stagnation, one important factory that is shut down because there is no demand for its products, one enterprise devoted in a very special sense to making money
*
where money cannot now be made, and where operations have been indefinitely suspended. This is the Mint of tho 7Tnited States in Philadelphia. There is no present offering of gold for coinage either from home or from abroad, and the policy of the Government as to the coinage of silver, determined1 by the ac tion, oi inaction, of Congress, is such that, though there is a distinct call and a r^tjier pressing need for the manufacture of fractional currency, the Mint has no raw material available. Oomm^ntins; on this situation. The Philadelphia N’oj'th American says:
it is almost incroriiblo that Congress should continue its policy toward silver. At present it has hundreds of millions of dollar comb worth less than per cent, of face vMue us metal and which the Government must maintain at par. Every dollar recoiued into small denominations lessens the obligations of the Government and increases the circulation. It fs
