Some Literary Fancies of Stevenson Taken frorfc a Reccnt NBook of Extracts from His Work.^
E surprised himself by a sudden impulse to write -"tfbetry—he did so sometimes, loose, galloping: octosyllabics in the vein of Scott—and when be had taken hisi place on a boulder, near some fairy falls, and shaded by a whip of a tree that was already radiant with new
leaves, it still more surprised him that he should find nothing to write. His heart perhaps beat in time to some vast indwelling rhythm.of the universe-'
“ T^URNS, too proud and honest not to |j work, continued through all reverses to sing poetry with a light, defiant note. Beranger waited till he was himself beyond reach of want before writing the Old Vagabond or Jacques. Samuel Johnson, although he was very sorry to be poor, "was a great arguer for the advantages of poverty ’* in his ill days. Thus it is that brave men carry fhelr crosses, and smile with the fox burrowing in their vitals.

1 COULD not finish “ The Pirate ’* when I was a child, I have never finished it yet; " Peveril of tlie
Peak ” dropped half way through from my schoolboy hands, and though I have since spaded to an end in a kind of wager with myself the exercise was quite without enjoyment. There is something disquieting in the considerations.
I still think a visit to Ponto’s the best part of “The Book of Snobs": does that mean that I was right when I was a child, or does it mean that I have never grown since then, that the child is not the man’s father, but the man? an^that I came into the world with all my faculties complete, and have only learned since to be more tolerant of boredom ?

THE accepted novelist may take his novel up and put it down, spend days upon it in vain, and write not any more than he makes haste to blot. Not so the beginner. Human nature has certain right; instinct—the instinct of self-preservation—forbids that any man (cheered and supported J*y“the consciousness of no previous victory) should endure the miseries of unsuccessful literary toil beyond a period to be measured in weeks. There must be something for hope to feed upon-The beginner must have a slant or wind, a lucky vein must be running, he must be in one of those hours when the words command the phrases-balance ^themselves—even to begin. And having begun, what a dread looking forward it is that until the book shall be accomplished! For so long a time the «*lant is to continue unchanged, tne vein to keep running, for so long a time you must keep at command the same quality of style: for so long a t*™6 your puppets are to be always vital, always consistent, always vigorous.

ALL literature, from Job and Omar IChayyam to Thomas Carlyle or Walt Whitman, is but an attempt to look upon the human state with such
largeness of view as shall enable us to rise from the consideration of living to the Definition of Life.

TO write with authority about another man, we must have fellow-feeling and some common ground of experience with our subject. We may praise or blame according as we find him related to us by best or worst in ourselves; but it is only in virtue of some relationship that we can be his judges, even to condemn. Feelings which we share and understand enter for us into the tissue of the man’s*char-acter; those to which we are strangers in our own experience we are inclined to regard as blots, exceptions, inconsistencies, and excursions of the diabolic; we conceive them with repugnance, explain them with difficulty, and raise our hands to heaven in wonder when we find them in conjunction with talents that we respect or virtues that we admire.	^
TO pass from hearing literature to
reading it is to take a great and
dangerous step. With not a few,
I think a large proportion of their
pleasure then comes to an end; “the malady of not marking ” overtakes them; they read thenceforward by the eye alone and hear never again the chime of fair words or the march of the stately period. Non ragioniam oi these. But to all the step is dangerous; it involves coming of age; it is even a kind of second weaning. In the past all was at the choice of others; they chose, they digested, they read aloud for us and sang to their own tune
the books, of childhood. In the future we are to approach’ the silent, Inexpressive type alone, like pioneers; and ihe choice of what we are to read is in our own hands thenceforward.

THERE is no quite good book without a good morality; but the ' world Is wide, and so are morals. Out of tw*) people who have dipped into Sir Richard Burton's •' Thousand and One Nights,’’ one shall have been offended by the animal details; another to whom these were harmless, per-UStps even pleasing, shall yet have been shocked m turn by the rascality and cruelty of all the characters. Of two^ readers, again, one shall have been' pained by the morality of a religious memoir, one by that of 4* The Vicomte de Bragelonne.” And the point is that neither need be wrong. We shall always shock each other both in life and art; we cannot get the sun into our pictures, nor the abstract right (if there be such a thing) into our books; enough if, in the one, there glimmer some hint of the great light that blinds us from ^fceaven; enough if, in the other, there shine, even upon foul details, a spirit of magnanimity.

THE most influential books, and the truest in t^ieir influence, are works of fiction. They do not pin their reader to a dogma, which he must afterward discover to be inexact; they do not teach a lesson, which be must afterward unlearn. They repeat, they rearrange, they clarify the lessons of
life; they disengage us from ourselves.
they constrain us to the acquaintances of others, and they show us the web of experience not as we can see it for ourselves, but with a singular change— that monstrous, consuming ego of ours being, for nonce, struck out. To be so, they must be reasonably true to the human comedy; and any work that is so serves the turn of instruction.

LANGUAGE is but a poor bull’s-eye lantern wherewith to show off the vast cathedral of the world; and yet a particular thing once said in words is so definhe and memorable that it makes us forget the absence of
the many which remain unexpressed; ftke a bright window in a distant view, which dazzles and confuses our sight of Its surroundings There are not words enough in all Shakespeare to express the merest fraction of a man s experience in an hour.
OR take the case of men of letters. Every piece of work which is not as good as you can make it, which you have palmed off imperfect, meagrely thought, niggardly in execution, upon mankind who is your play-master on parole, and in a sense your pupil, every hasty or slovenly or untrue performance should rise up against you in the court of your own leart and condemn you for thief.

THERE is a kind of gaping admiration that would fain roll Shakespeare and Bacon into one, to have a bigger thing to gape at; and a class of men who cannot edit one author without disparaging all others.
THE fortune of a tale lies not alone in the skill of him that writes, but as much, perhaps, in the inherited experience of him who reads; and when I hear with a particular thrill of things that I have never done or seen, it is one of that innumerable army of my ancestors rejoicing in past deeds. Thus j novels begin to touch not the fine dili ettanti but the gross mass of mankind, when they leave off to speak of parlous and shades of manner and still-born niceties of motion, and begin to deal with fighting, sailoring, adventure,
death or childbrith, and the ancient outdoor crafts and occupations, whether Mr. Hardy wields the shepherd’s crook or Count Tolstoy swings the scythe, lift romance into a near neighborhood with epic. These aged things 1 have on them the dew of man s morn] ing; they lie near, not so much to us,
, the semi-artificial flowerets, as to the trunk and aboriginal taproot of the race. A thousand interests spring up In the process of the ages, and a^.thou-sand perish: that is now an eccentricity or a lost art which was once the fashion of an empire; and those only are perennial matters that rouse us to! day, and that roused men in all epochs of the past.

EVEN women, who understand men so well for practical purposes, do not know them well enough for the purpose of art. Take even the very best of their male crea-
, tions, take Tito Melema, for instance, and you will find he has an equivocal air, and every how and again remembers he has a comb in the back of his head. Of course, no woman will be-
-	lieve this, and many men will be so polite as to humor their incredulity.
