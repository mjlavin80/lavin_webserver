The life of certain members of the So- • ciety of Friends in the trying times which preceded the coming to America of William Penn, furnishes the material for this story of seventeenth century England. The author uses as background the horrors of the Plague and the Great Pire and ihe rigors of that prosecution which the disciples of George Pox suffered at the hands of magistrates and others in authority. The tale itself concerns Lhe life and loves of two young women—one of whom appears upon the scene as a mysterious changeling’ at the tender age of six months. She grows up dark-haired and saucy, while a fair little Quaker girl -who mothers her blooms into the staidest kind of womanhood. The staid one is beloved by sturdy Hugh, the Squire’s son, a serious youth who becomes a Quaker himself and gets thrown into prison for his pains. The saucy one has two admirers, both very dashing young men, and cne of them rather an unscrupulous wooer. He would have carried the lady—she is called Polly—off after the manner of the buccaneers of old if the other dashing young man hadn't arpcared out of the 'mist in the nick of time.
It is a long story, and, as befits a Quaker story, rather slow—though there r.re adventures^—even personal encounters, a daring rescue from a quicksand in which a tplendid black horse figures, and the hearty caning of a rude fellow. Also, of course, the reader must encounter a lot of " thou "-fng and " thee ”-ing and the sort of serious, soulful talk of religious matters which naturally falls among an earnest sent the members of which are daily suffering insult and prison and death for conscience sake. However, neither the saucy Polly nor her admirers are Quakers. America comes into it, too, and 'William Penn and his merry Majesty Charles 31.
