A FOOL.
Maurice Hewlett’s Strong Novel of Eighteenth Century Italy-*
RANCIS-ANTONY STRELLEt, Esq.. is, without doubt, a fool; and because, folly has ever managed to .do greater mischief than has wickedness, he gets himself and divers other persons into not a little trouble before his ill-guided bark gains a peaceful haven, j But he is a lovable fool, with a heart in his bosom and a conscience of his own, with many of the qualities withal which | so endear the erratic knight of La Man- , cha to all who have journeyed or who ever shall journey in his company. j “ Fool as I have been, and fool as I j have declared myself upon the forefront : of this very book,” says Francis Strel-ley, “ I have never said in my heart,
■	There is no God but much and loud- j ly have maintained the affirmative. J And although I have been sadly, wickedly, detestably errant from His way, there is one divine precept which I have never failed to keep, and that is,
•	Lrove one another.1 All other affections, additions, accidents, accessories of men. however, from the lowest, which is money, to the highest, which is Polite Education. I have been able to discard without concern or loss of self-respect,” and again:	”	There is
one thing which we cannot afford to lose, even if we lose life itself in keeping it. And it is a thing for which we pay so dear now and again that we cannot value it too highly. I mean our self-respect.”
' Fired with the high resolve to atone for a grievous fault, this young Englishman leaves his studies in Padua and takes “ the road in Tuscany.” He looks with clear and candid eyes upon I the Italians of nigh two hundred years i ago—peasants, priests, nobles, women of high and low degree, and very frank is he in his revelations. Dire disasters ! befall him again and again, and he finds at the end that the results of his boyish passion for his tutor’s young wife have been too far-reaching to permit expiation. Happily, he has in his , journeyings a quick-witted companion, who rescues him alike from rash promptings of his daemon ” and from foes without.
Mr. Hewlett’s public can easily imag- ,
8	ine	the charm of this wandering under
his	guidance, with his intimate knowl-
edge of locality and people, his picturesque description, his marvelous delineation of character, his style terse, forceful, throbbing with color and rhythm.
To the Anglo-Saxon mind Fra Pala-mone is painted almost too black to I	be	credible, and Virginia is wise and
eloquent beyond her years and station —still, as to that, one remembers Juliet. and Mr. Hewlett knows his Tuscans, The distinction between immorality and unmorality is finely shown in the contrasting characters of the two women dominating the story, and the fact that genuine innocence is the strongest armor of defense is finely brought out:
It is not to be pretended that we kept good company. We were outcasts and were thrown of necessity among those who had been cast out. But the standards of life vary with those who live, and I never could see that a man was less of a thief because he thieved from a throne, or less a profligate because he debauched a Princess. * * * I believe that I saw a great deal of iniquity, for the taverns and gaming dens to which I sometimes (^sorted for shelter or entertainment were filled with desperadoes of all sorts—deserters from the army, thieves, coin clippers In hid-mg, assassins elect, women of the town, and even worse. But while I expect my reader to believe that I never sinned with them, I shall find him harder to convince that I was never invited to -sin. Such, however, is the fact. * * *
I I met these unfortunates upon the common ground of civility, conversed with them as equals, and was not only respected by them for wh£fc*I was, but came myself to respect them in feplte ■ of what they were. *	* i learned,
with astonishment, that ’with the most deplorable degradation of life there could consist an ability to share the interests of the most refined persons.
So far as an absolutely artistic portrayal of life can -have a thesis, that of •• The Pool Errant is the celebration of the virtues of the ,’£uscan peasantry, in which Mr. Hewlett hft3. a stout and Tolstoyan faith:	.
So have I found it always in - the dear country of my adaption; that it

takes prosperity, never misery, to corrupt ittf native simplicity. The lower you descend in the jscale of human attainment the greater the hopes you may conceive of what humanity may be permitted to attain. The poor drab, the world’s hire for the price of a rushlight, the lurking thief, the beggar at the church door, the naked urchin of the gutter—these, though they live vrtth swine and are of them, have the souls of children new and clean from God. Neither malice nor forethought of evil, nor craft, nor hatred, nor clamor, nor the great and crowning sin is in their hearts. A kind word, a touch, a kiss, redeems them* Thus they, whom the tyrants of Italy have enslaved, are in truth the very marrow of Italy, without whom she would never have done anything in this world. And the sorrowful verity is that slaves they must remain if Italy is to live on. For prosperity, which fattens their bodies, chokes and poisons their souls. * * *
This is, I am now convinced, the true philosophy of life—that labor is a man’s only riches, and food, shelter, rest, and the satisfaction of appetite his means whereby to grow rich. In other walks of life the practice is reversed, and labor is looked upon as the means, appetite and comfort as the end. Inconceivable folly! since labor alone brings health, and health content.
And so our hero renounces his inheritance and casts in his lot with the lowly of Lucca. *' I did this deliberately,” he declares, “ having found out by hard experience that money was the bondslave of lust and rank the breastplate of inanity.”
He justifies his renunciation of country and of position in a closing chapter of such force and beauty that it entices to copious quotation. But space forbids, and, after all, it is unjust to the noble passages in which the book abounds to tear them from the living whole. The fit place for Mr. Hewlett's jewels of thought is in the fine gold of their setting. “ The Fool ErrantM is not only a story of intense interest and a literary achievement of a very high order, but it demonstrates the possibility of facing every fact of life with an unashamed frankness and without a tinge of grossness. Mr. Hewlett's novel of eighteenth century Italy is as chaste j as it is strong; it is the old story of j the fearlessly firm grasp of the nettle; ! not written, certainly, with an eye upon " The Young Person,” but none the less tonic and clean.
And the " Fool ”? With all his crassness, all his blunders, his limpid sincerity of intent, his detachment from things material lift him to the level of “ God’s FooL” He is a wonderful creation. which Mr. Hewlett himself has never surpassed.
