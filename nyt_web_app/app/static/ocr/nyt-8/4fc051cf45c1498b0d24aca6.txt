Edward Hutton’s new book, " The Cities of Umbria," is being hurried through the press, and E. P. Dutton & Co. will publish it next week. It will be elaborately illustrated in color, and will form the first volume of a series on Italian cities. In his preface, Mr. Hutton, who . will be recalled as author of ** Frederic Twedale,*’ “ Italy and the Italians,” &c., describes his Journey from Florence to Perugia, and the different cities by the* way. He gives his impressions of Perugia In the first chapter:
*	a * There is something of a great ! dignity in her isolation on her hill-top, which is, after all, not the last low spur of the Indestructible Apennine. but the deposits, age after age, of the Tiber flowing toward Rome and the sea. And even as long and long ago the Tiber left her, so that now even after the fiercest storms or the deepest snows she hears nothing of his terrible song, so at last the world, too, has faflen away from her, leaving her alone on her beautiful hill, surrounded only by elemental things —the sun, the moon, the stars, and the unch;ingiDg mountains. * * • She is so proud on her mountain, overtopping the soft green hills of her Umbria, for within her immense horizon no other city, ruddy or white, is like to her. * * * And though In early morning this exquisite landscape is delicate and fragile and half "hidden in mist, at sunset it has something of the largeness of the evening earth, and a majesty of silence and repose, that is as it were suggested by the beautiful gesture of the mountains.
Leaving Perugia, be goes to AssisL. then to Spello. and then to Foligno and Mont-efalco, TrevI, Spoleto, Nami, Todi, Orvi-eto, Urbino. and some of the smaller towns. He also writes on the Umbrfan school of painting, and on ** Umbria Mystica "—Joachim di Fiore, St. Francis, St..Claire, the brothers Bernard and Ellas.
