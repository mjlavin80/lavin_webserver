MU KEJVESON GOWER'S book should serve aa a text Cor the , moralizer. It is interesting- as " goo a Summer reading "—that Is aUk It is a catalogue of names great and famous In England and on the Continent; it contains some Quotable passages; it has some new anecdotes; it is
*
never dull; it is never absorbing. It might be called “ Memoirs of a Mere Existence,”
Frederick Leveson Gower was bora with a silver spoon in his mouth, if any one ever was- He was the third son of the first Earl Granville,, and from his earliest- years found his way made easy. He got through Oxford, and ate his way to the bar; he became Judge’s Marshal to two Judges In succession, „ went as secretary to his brother to the coronation of Alexander IL of Russia, and was precis writer in the Foreign Office until he got tired; he sat in Par-Uoment for two constituencies from 1852 to 1857 and from 1S59 to 1885, and declined the Postmaster Generalship offered by Gladstone. But he did nothing* he was nothing, he is nothing, and There is not a word to show that he is not entirely satisfied with himself.
He has compiled his book from memory since he reached his eighty-sixth year, avoiding- references to politics because he kept no notes, and dare not trust his memory for details. He tells some good stories and tells them well; and they are all good-natured. If Mr. Gower had not been good-natured* probably he might have done something or got somewhere; as it is, he has lived the life of a-pet housedog, and lived it perfectly happily.
One thing he did: In 1874 he helped found the National Cooking School in London, which in thirty years has had 100,000 pupils and given diplomas to
1.700 teachers of cooking. That undoubted ly must entitle him to a credit mark. But otherwise his life has been a mere animal existence, useful as a “ terrible example.” It is astonishing that a man with his advantages, backed by wealth and rank*, should ; have made so little of his life, and then cared to exploit its vacuity. Charles Grevflle, his second cousin, did as little as Mr. Gower has done; but he kept journals, which have become classical, and afford the best inside view of British politics and society in the early Victorian era. Mr. Gower has not done : even that.
