This little book ts an answer to the oft-repeated question, " What's the postage? *’ It tells not only what the postage is from Here to There, but also what it Is on about every kind of thing that goes through the mails; it tells wbat Is unmailable, explains why certain matter is sometimes not delivered, and Indeed, if ft doesn’t tell everything about the Post Office so far as one needs to know, we have not found out that fact. The only thing that can make it more useful than it Is now would be an accurate letter scale, ‘ and that one must not expect in any sort of a book.
