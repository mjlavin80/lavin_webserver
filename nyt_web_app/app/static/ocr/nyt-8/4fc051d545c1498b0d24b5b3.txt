RUSSIA	TIME.
Mr. Villari’s Careful; Stody^’of'the .Czar's Country and His Con-elusions About Its Fata re-*
" Russia Under the Great. Shadow” Mr. Villari has
\ : . i . • ■
. written an excellent account of the Czar's empire In wartime. He spent many months In the' country and conversed with
A “	♦	•	'
persons in all walks of life, and
though his description of conditions is t ■ ■ - . ' saddening:, his conclusions drawn from what he saw and heard are optimistic. I “j Unless all the auguries should prove false,'he sums up in his preface, ** the j war In the Par East should mark the transition of Russia from the Middte
i
Ages to the twentieth century, from the
! Eastern to the Western world, from barbarism to civilization.” And he makes ! this interesting comparison and warning:
But we must not expect to see the resuits immediately and to see Russia settling down under a liberal Constitution i within six months. The English Revoiu-! tion lasted from 1640 to 16SD; that of France from 17S9 to Ifllij—almost to 1871; that of Italy from 1821 to 1870. Russia.
| too, will probably have to go through a long period of turmoil and unrest before I she can find lasting peace.

THE cause of the coming revolution
Mr. Villari finds in the defeat of |	Russia by Japan. ** Russia, after
having remained almost untouched by modern ideas, unaffected by the three I great movements that have molded European history during- the last five centu-| ries—the classical Renaissance, the Refor-i mation, and the French Revolution—is at
*	last awakening to the need for radical changes in consequence of this war,” The people were willing to be governed by " an Iron autocracy and an oppressive clique of reactionary bureaucrats" because they believed that only In that way could they enjoy nn almost omnipotent ' military prestige. But the autocracy and j the bureaucracy have not " made good ** in the only test for which they were I adapted, and the reason for their exlst-, ence and continuance has gone. The feel-
■	Ing that old-time methods of government have broken down, and the serious economic crisis which the war has caused, unite then to turn even the Russian mind
toward reform.
On the face of things. Mr. Villarl's optimism seems ill-grounded. Yet, underneath the evil conditions of the day. good reasons appear for it. Those reasons are scattered through Mr. Villari’s book—
! Russia's Immense resources, foreign capi-; tnl, foreigners settled in Russia, especially the Germans; the Jews, the Poles—these : are some of the reasons that help the author to his optimistic views of Russia’s future; these, and the actual awakening of political life among the Russians themselves.

MR. VILL.ARI went to Russia in July of last year. The ship he sailed on 1	*' was very characteristic of Rus-
: sian commercial conditions. Although ! flying the Russian flag, she was bu'lt at ! Dundee, her Captain was an -ungrlishman. i and her owners a firm of Baltic Province . Germans.” Somewhat to his disappoint-I ment, as he had carefully left books of reference behind, the customs examination was very perfunctory. “ My few books were not even noticed, and I greatly regretted not having brought more.'1 In St. Petersburg there is hardly anything that can be described as really fine or imposing. There are some fine shops and a few handsome buildings, but these are dwarfed by the width of the open spaccs. ” The group of palaces along the Neva and round the Admiralty arc large and ugly; the Winter Palace, in its yellowish pink hideousness, stands out even among royal palaces as a monument of monstrosity.’*
Those who are interested in social problems should go to the Narodny Dom. Jt i is one of those magnificent examples of , lavish imperial charity so common in Russia, but like many similar efforts not altogether answering to the purpose for which it was intended. It is a huge building on the Petersburg Island, given by the present Czar to the Temperance Society i with the object of providing fhe workingman with rational amusement unaccompanied by alcoholic beverages. The building is splendid; it has an immense well-lit and heated central hall, where concerts are given; a theatre, large airy dining rooms, where on a spotless paper table cloth, which also serves as a bill of fare, you can have all manner of good food served by smart waiting maids at reasonable charges. On the walls are notices from which you may learn what you spend per annum In vodka [potato brandy) if you drink ten kopeks a day, or twenty, or thirty. Outside is a large garden, where you dine in Summer and listen to the band. A1I this luxury may be enjoyed for ten kopeks. [5 cents,] including concert, theatrical performance, or variety show. But the Narodny Dom is a long way from many of the workmen’s quarters and factories; the tram costs money, and to walk Is an effort, and above all the workman can hardly con. ceive of enjoyment without vodka. So he prefers to go to the nearest gardens or

spirit shop, or.to stop at home. The l>om -1b- not empty, but the- majority of its ■* ‘habitues are not ^workmen at all. The. workmen are few and far between, and do not seem to be at .their ease.	-

ST. PETERSBURG, . however, Is not Russia; Moscow is. it has the Krem- ‘ lln, M truly a -thing of beauty unlike.'?! anything else la the .world/’ and the. old;; Tfitnt Gorod or Chinese town, ‘Swhich : gives a true glimpse of . old Russia, the -Russia of the early Czars, of the Tartar ■ Invasion, of Ivan the Terrible—not the Russia of Imitation which Peter . the _ Great and others flattered themselves was Europe.M
Russian as -it is, Moscow is also typical of another phase of Russian life—the for- 1 eign element. Throughout its history Russia has been largely made by men of non-Russian blood. To Moscow numbers of English nSerchant-adventurers flocked ever since 1533; there were numbers of Italian, German, and other craftsmen and artists In Moscow during the sixteenth and seventeenth and eighteenth centuries* and soldiers of fortune won many of Russia's most celebrated victories. Moscow is now the most important manufacturing centre in Russia and one of the greatest commercial emporia in Europe, nearly every Russian industry being represented there. One remark in Mr. Villari’s chapter on the economic situation should interest holders or prospective holders of Russian securities. It Is true that Russia " has always paid the interest on her debt punctually—even In the case of the English bondholders during : the Crimean war/' yet '* the Russian Government, If we .are to rely oh estimates (printed in The London Times in I March last J seems to be in the position j of a company which can only pay the interest on its shares by making further j issues.”

RUSSTA, above ail other countries, says Mr. Villari, is cursed with an intellectual proletariate, for there a-re many thousands of students barely able to pay their college fees, and unable, for lack of clothes, to attend the courses in bad weather. Those educated men and women overflow the liberal professions and become the active agents of revolutionary propaganda. At present most of the universities and colleges are closed because of the part taken by students in recent disturbances.	'
Mr. Villari traveled off the ben ton route of tourists, sailing down the_,Yolga and studying the growth of industrialism. Ekaterinoslav, the fifth manufacturing ccntre in the empire, Is a purely business town. ** Rows upon rows of tall chimneys rise up. a continual rumbling of machinery fills one’s ears, the atmosphere Is thick with coal smuts. There Is no beauty and no picturesqueness, but there is an air of genuine activity and business which is rare In the Czar’s dominions.” He gives us, in a chapter on the Russian working classes, some curious statistics. For example, 16.G men are needed for
1.000	spindles, while in England 3 suffice; in some of the Polish mills and at Narva the number has been reduced to 6. For
1.000	mule spindles 7 Russians are. required to -.47 Englishmen. The schools maintained by the factories—those owned by foreigners—are better than thore of the State or the Church. Working hours are now eleven and one-huif a day; some owners have tried an eight-hour day, but not successfully. The insurance against accidents is three times as high as in ' England and Germany because of the carelessness of the Russian workman.
Mr. Villari’s conclusions, after studying the economic results of the war on Russia —taking into consideration the fact that the total reduction of business due to the war, before the strikes of last Winter, had been estimated at over onr-third of the country's trade—is, as we said, optimistic. " I have little doubt/* he says,
" that with her vast resources and the many good qualities of her people, Russia will eventually emerge into a great, prosperous, and well-governed nation, which will contribute much to the comfnon good of humanity. But the people must first be educated, intellectually, morally, and politically, and this wfll take many long years, and before the goal is reached the country will have to pass through much trouble and suffering.”
