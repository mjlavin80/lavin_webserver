Dr. Sidney L*. Gutiek, author of ” The Evolution of the Japanese and the White Peril,” has been appointed to the Chair of Systentotie Theology in Doshisho, (the Christian University of Japan.) In preparation for his new duties he has just completed a tour of visitation of the leading divinity schools of this country, and has now sailed for Germany to make a careful study of the methods there. He will spend the coming Winter among the English and Scottish theological Institutions. His books were read by the Japanese Minister at Washington, Baron Kaneko, at the suggestion of President Roosevelt. The former declared that ** the Japanese would always welcome such bj-aaxJ-mi-aded missionaries as Dr. Gulick, who could see his people as they really were, on both their strong and weak sides.’*
