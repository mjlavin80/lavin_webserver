2»eto York Times Saturday Review of Roofa:
Nothing that I hc.ve recently read has so interested me as your comments recently upon the inquiry of " A Perplexed Reader of History." and I can hardly avoid the query; Are y&u Justified In of-i fering the advice you did that she may I as well give up trying to read history*’? j This, too, in face of her expressed desire to bring Into strong light " the pictures of virtuous men.” For you to approach 1 so laudable a purpose in the spirit manifested seems hardly credible, and I feel like exclaiming *' Et tu. Brute "t Shall we. then, give up trying to arrive at a , truthful conception of the characters of ! the men who made the history of the times in which they lived as their deeds are portrayed by the cbronologlsts contemporary with them, and of the relation ! of those deeds to present conditions existing in the world?
The comments of contemporaneous writers, who have left their marks upon the 1 pages of history, may have been severe when relating the deeds of the evil men you name, but we must admit that be-i cause of their presence they are credible witnesses. Should we not then accept their estimate of those men and their actions rather than that of later writers, who, affetfted by the softening influence of time and generally with the object of establishing certain points of view, weave halos out of distant mists with which to crown as heroes these men of such evil repute in their own day? Why try to save Danton with the faint damnation of a negative? Why try to rescue Robespierre from his fate because of his belief (if, indeed, he had such) in his own righteousness? Wfcy try to form a galaxy of heavenly harpists from a lot of undoubted tyrants who. to satisfy their own *' excellent intentions,” steeped themselves in blood with no thoughts for the feelings or the rights of other men? Prom some narrow points of view it might be well, were it possible, to erase from memory the deeds of all despots and fanatics of the past. Better perhaps to clothe them with eternal night than with the figment of a selfish and self-condemning righteousness. But from a higher viewpoint, with a wider vision, and with the ethical principle of the Golden Rule as an actuating guide, we can surely bring the Jtves of such men Into a clearer contrast with that of those wbose good-will and beneficence shine down upon us from the contemporary records of past ages with ever-Increasing brilliancy to light up the pathway of the strenuous but unseirtsh worker of today. Such contrast would teach us how best to avoid the errors of fanatics and the crimes of the wicked and so better enable us to promote the cause of peace, humanity, and right living.
