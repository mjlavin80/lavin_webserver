.the arch of that.cave-I write from per-,, sonal knowledge, for I'have 'entered it. So did some officers of the United States phlp Tuscarora in the seventies. So has Louis Becke, the Australian^ writer,- who-has swum ifito that cave, not once, but a score of times. I met Becke In Paris three 1 years ago, and asked him what he thought I of Mr. Bullen's story. ‘ He said ** Hum! Ha! 11 looked out of the window, and. began to talk of the pigeons in the Place de la Concorde. ■	.	.	i
Now .1 .think that Mr. Bullen might at least have admitted his acknowledgments of the description of the cave to such (in " unknown ” writer as William Mariner. “For there is prima facfe evidence that Mr. Bulleh has plagiarized, not only frpm Mariner, but from other authors—among, them, one of the officers, of the ,Tusca-rora or Jamgstown, (I forget-which.) Mr. Bullen may have- entered that cave, but. not in a boat. And in, conclusion I would suggest to Mr. Bullen, who has .written a book entitled “With Christ at Sea," \o seriously meditate . upon these . words, spoken by the late Prof. Mahaffy of Dublin at a lecture on medical literature:
“To appropriate the work of a colleague or to utilize it with that scanty acknowledgment which amounts to deliberate reticence, is a form of vice not the less odious because the culprit generally escapes with impunity.”	■

' .YriP York Times Saturday RciHcw of Hooka:
| I read with interest a letter which, under the initial;* of C. F. A., appeared in your “ Prom Readers " page July 13, on the subject of Herman Melville's “ Moby Dick,” and Mr. Frank Bullen's quoted remark therein, vhat “ he did not think much of the melodramatic features of the book.”
Let any American whaleman take side by side Melville’s “The Whale; or, Moby Dick," (as his book was first entitled.) and Mr. Bullen’s “ Cruise of the Cachalot,” and compare the two works, and then jurtge if Mr. Bullen has any right to speak of Melville as being melodramatic. The major part of Bullen’s book is true, but he has spmied the effect of his tale by narrating in detail two " incidents " that never occurred. One is the story of the “ nigger " mate, ** Mistah Jones,” seizing Captain Slocum in his arms and jumping overboard with him to death,
l.et the whaling records of Salem, New London, Now Bedford, Sag Harbor, and other New England ports be searched, and see if there is any mention of this tragic affair? Then the story of the killing of the whale in the cave under the cliffs of Vavau in the Tonga Islands. (See Mariner’s Tonga Islands,” published in London in ISIS, and Byron’s poem " The Island ” for a description of this well-known cove.) The terrible night that Mr. Bullen and his boat's crew passed in that dread cave with a whale in its " flurry ” and hordes of sharks is exciting reading—but, i alas! It is a fairy tale. No boat, even at I the lowest tide, could possibly pass under
