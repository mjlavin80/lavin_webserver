Mr. James Montgomery Flagg, an artist whose work is not aJI in the field of caricature, by any means, has just published another book ot nonsense rhymes and comic pictures. It is called ” If: A Guide to Bad Maurers.” CL.tfe Publishing Company. 75 cents.) Mr. Flagg Is his own poet and here is a good specimen of his verse:
! if you chance to be an artist and a person says to you.
As though it were a sensible remark,
** I don't know anything of art. but know just what I like.**,
You may answer, " So do monkeys In the park! ”
The pictures are full of character and original humor.
