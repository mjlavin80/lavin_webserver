IMMUTABLE RUSSIA.
But It Does ftiove, and _its Htstorj-Indicates Approaching - Changes.*
ROF. ^IILYOUKOV has written a strong book—one that will not appeal to the general reader, but will reach rather the serious and thoughtful. It is a sort 'of clinical study of the situation in Russia, a diagnosis of the case, with a full prognosis ana a suggested cure for the existing evil afflicting the bc,dy politic. It is not a political pamphlet written for the occasion, a book hurried to market to meet the current demand lor information en things Russian; but is the M result of years of study devoted to the explanation of the Russian present by the Russian past.’* Its very form has been modified even in the making. Says Prof. Milyoukov: "The contents of the book are essentially the same as those of my lectures on 1 Russian Civilization ’ delivered during the Summer of 1903 at the University of Chicago,” and his Lowell Institute lectures of December, 19(M, are reproduced in effect. Thus the author speaks out of the fullness of knowledge, not simply because there is a present demand for Russian news that can be met with
pecuniary satisfaction.
THE TWO RUSSIAS,
The author divides the Czar’s domain in Europe into “ two Russias, one quite different from the other; the one the Russia of Leo Tolstoy, the other that of Plehve. The former is the Russia of our ‘ intellectuals,' and of the people; the latter is official Russia. One is the Russia of the future, as dreamed of by members of the liberal professions, the other, an anachronism, deeply rooted in the past* and defended in the present by an omnipotent bureaucracy. The one spells liberty; the other des-
-	potlsm/' Of the latter he says: " I admit that Plehve was only a reductio ad absurdum; but this only because autocracy itself is reduced ad absurdum by the very trend of life. If it is to survive at all, there is really no other means of keeping it alive than the policy of Plehve. We are now witnessing an attempt at welding autocracy and liberalism/’ The rescript of the Czar 'instituting a national assembly— with a string—is a proof of Prof. Mil-youkov’s insight. “ But the country at large,” continues the author, 'Vs tired of object lessons, and no longer seeds them. The people ask for political- reforms which imply a negation of autocracy.”	#
Just as Plehve stands for absolutism,
bo Tolstoy stands for liberty; not because the liberals agree wholly with him, but because " his name stands for Russian opposition, and will continue so to stand as long as it remains a synonym for liberty in general—liberty as the absolute negation of the existing order of things.” Recalling Andersen’s story of the Emperor’s new clothes, which only the wise could see, and how the little boy cried out: " The Emperor has nothing on! ” Prof. Milyoukov adds:
Thus it is with Russia. Serious men for years and years have worn a state robe whose beauty was clear only to a few conjuring wiseacres; o.nd millions of men, groaning under the burden of its cost, have mournfully kept silence, until an untoward ?vent has come, like the child in Andersen's tale, to tell the whole world that the wisdom is counterfeit and the wearers of the robe are " naked." This event is the war.
Well, the only advice we can ;_ivo to these people is: Put on new clothes, and do it as soon as possible.
A PROCESS OF CHANGE.
In his final chapter Prof. Milyoukov sums up his very detailed argument. He asserts that " in every aspect t f her life Russia is in process of change the very theory of her immutability is itself a product of change. “ that even as a theory this idea had no -'Xistence until a certain, quite recent time," but is merely *' the joint product of a romantic theory of nationality and the practical need of the present Government for self-defense.”
Russian Orthodoxy, invoked to prove Russian immutability, Prof. Milyoukov decides, is the creature of the State, maintained only by restrictive measures and active persecution; so it is no witness for the changelessm-ss of Russia. Autocracy is a survival of the fittest, dating from the end -jf the
fourteenth century,1 and\has no'juridical basis other than a reference to thfe powers of the * predecessors * of the Muscovite monarch, who, in fact, did not at all possess this authority; and j another reference to the sanction of | God, which could be extended to any ^orm of political power.” Autocracy, the author claims to have shown, is '* a material fact, not a political principle/’
In the eleventh hour, and 'Viot till t then, an attempt was made to apply the principle of the immutability of national life as an argument for the preservation of autocracy. But no serious proof for this argument has ever been submitted. And thus it Is, even.-after centuries of existence, that no* legal and moral tradition of autocracy can be found to exist either in institutions or in minds; and so nothing is opposed to its overthrow except fn® i mere tact of its being there, in full j possession of power. As a matter of , fact, autocracy had been changing from an institution inherited from the “ forefathers ” into a theocratic institution; even further, from a theocmtic power on Byzantine lines into a bureaucratic monarchy on European ilnes; again, into a manifestation of the absolute “will of the people'*; still again, from that absolutism of | Hobbes into a mediaeval monarchy of j Montesquieu; and finally into a national institution sanctioned by the ipere fact of its long exiitence and by the supposed quality of its being immutable.	,
The existing political form, then, according to Prof. Milyoukov, owes its solidity to the force of inertia, and to such measures as it has had to take in self-defense; and these very measures £rove how small are its rfesojrees." The Russian Government, at earlier times, had the choice of making itself free or of making itself autocratic, and chose the latter course. There was nothing to make it choose otherwise; the nobility was, as it is, wholly dependent on the Czar for its existence; there was no bourgeoisie, and the trad- | ing and commercial class depended on the Government even more than the gentry.
FEGHTIXG FOR FREEDOM. |
The educated classes of Russia—edu- j cated by the Government despite itself, J that its Europeanization might advance—compelled the emancipation of I the serfs. Political freedom is the second achievement of their programme, j In attaining the freedom of the serfs they made use of the social danger to ' the country, steadily increasing as serf- ; dom grew daily less bearable. They | are making use to-day of a similar weapon in their fight for political free- | dom. Of course, says Prof. Milyoukov, i this educated class is, not politically homogeneous, and the opinions held by its representatives differ widely. Radicalism is the first form of Russian political opinion; from that, as they struggle, men become liberals—mere liberals; utopian ideals vanish, the educated are working in harmony one with another, to provide an immediate cure for sick Russia.
What that cure is Prof. Milyoukov defines thus: “ Political representation, and guarantees of freedom of belief and speech, of association and of public meetings, liberty of the press, a strict regime of law and the free course of justice, which implies the repeal of arbitrary edicts, the abolition of extraordinary tribunals, and a habeas corpus act—security from arbitrary arrest and domiciliary search. There is
no general opinion as to the kind of representative institutions wanted, but ; a medium current may easily be found.
| The great majority will be glad to have I wbat was once claimed by the liberals i of Tver, a constitution consistently 1 democratic, including universal suf-! frage and a single chamber legisla-j ture.”
” History may have its whims/’ con-^ eludes the author; " but it also has its i laws; and if the law of Russian history is progress, as we have tried to demonstrate, politick reform may not be avoided." It remains to be seen ; whether the assembly created by the
■	Czar this month is a tull yielding to the law of history, or an attempt to ; avoid its operation; in either case, i however, its creation supports Prof.
