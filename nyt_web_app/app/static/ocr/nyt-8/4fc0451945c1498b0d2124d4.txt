Mr. Bain professes to be the translator ; of the Hindoo Boccaccio, who is an anony-mo us person* and he says the original | manuscript was given him by a grateful I Brahman to whom in time of plague and famine he had done an infinitesimal service- However that may be. and there are many	learned footnotes	and scraps	of
i	Sanscrit to prove it, the	stories have	an
j undeniable charm both of matter and of language—the latter of course full of flowers of speech and those infinite crooning repetitions which are characteristic of Eastern literature, though most old wives’ tales and folk-lore and lyric poetry share something of the same quality Hindoo !	poets,	it appears, since	the moon with
I them Is male, get over the difficulty in, volved in that unpoetical sex by person -ifying	his attributes, or	they divide	his
^ disk into sixteen parts culled digits, and i then they call a beautiful woman “ a digit of the moon/’
And thus comes the name of the first
story In Mr. Baln*s book, Itself a cord upon which many little stories are strung and itself a sixteenth part of a much larger work, entitled '* The Churning of the Ocean of Time." By the terms of it, a certain great King ruled once who was learned and wise and able in all matters— save that he hated and utterly avoided women. And his Ministers, fearing lest their lord should die without an heir and the kingdom come to grfef. plotted to throw lovely women in his way. But the King was Immovable— even decreed the banishment of every female who should presume to enter his presence or Infest hi3 walks and rides. This until there came to the royal city a painter who showed the King a picture. That picture represented a woman so beautiful that at the sight of her mere Image
the heart of the misogynist Tnelted	within	$
him and he swooned away.	^
The original, it appeared, was a Princess tt who caused all her suitors to remain In * her palace one and twenty days and * propose to her each day a riddle or tell a story with a question in its taiL If she failed to answer one single riddle or ex- > plain the meaning of one single story she < would yield herself—otherwise the suitor J was to become her slave. The sequel tells how the King and his dearest and closest ^ friend journeyed to the court of this lady and relates the stories the friend told and the wise answers the Princess returned him while the King sat limp and speech- r less in the blaze of her beauty. There are Ji only nineteen stories, and all are short and ingenious. Some of them are beau- j tiful and some quite as old-worldly frank [ as those of the Decameron or of the f Arabian Nights.	-
Another of Mr. Bain's stories	which	Is	'
also a string to hang little stories upon, is called a " Heifer of the Dawn." It tells , of how quaintly, sweetly, and wisely a certain Princess wooed a King, (with whom she was about to conclude a political marriage,) the Princess assuming for the purpose the disguise of a waiting maid. Another story is "The Descent of the Sun." another is called “ In the Great God’S * Hair."	J „
The present edition is the second of a volume which will certainly repay reading.	•
