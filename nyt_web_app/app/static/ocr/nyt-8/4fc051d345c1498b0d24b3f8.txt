temperature and precipitation axe given for the years 1801-190^ inclusive. They show that the-average rainfall in the Atlantic coast region was 46-71 inches, and In the Central. Lake region, only 34^4G inches, ’the ehapfer on ‘'Minimum Precipitation in New York ” shows that in some parts of the State the annual precipitation amounts to only 23 or .‘i0 inches.
-	At Penn Yon, for example, the average precipitation over a period of thlitfy-eight years- has been 27.93 inches, while in 1834 the total for the year vas only 10.Q6 „ *- _ inches. f Mr. Rafter shows by tabulations t^at the difference between the land sarface evaporation of the Genesee River, “.a deforested " area, and the Hudson River is about five inches. Mr. Rafter says that rainfall and “ run-off" are in constant relation, and his conclusion is that, knowing the amount of -either one of these lectors and the height of ground water, one may approximately compute rainfall from run-off or the converse, a conclusion that should prove valuable in water supply investigation where rainfall records are available, but gaugings of streams are lacking.	•
The rivers of New York State are classified and described in detail- Lists of all the streams that have been gauged are g3ven. and attention is directed to the fact that generally the run-off has been overestimated. The discussion of floods is Interesting, and for some of the material that has been Included the author has been indebted to the report of the Water Storage Commission.
Mr. Rafter states that there are six elevated points or water centres from which gravity supplies may be taken to all parts of the State without excessive length of conduit. The question that will have to be answered in future is where to obtain upland supplies from these localities so as to leave the lowland streams free for sewage disposal. It is considered that the population of New York State in the year 2,000 will be not less than 20,000,000, and when this time arrives perhaps 20,000 square miles of the State will be suburban area, with sewers and water supply in every street. It is certainty an interesting question as to just how the problem will be met. The author states that there is an upland water supply sufficient for 50,000,000 of people, even with the moderate collection of 400,000 gallons per square mile per day.
In the chapter on " Development of Water Power in New York " the author criticises the Government’s policy of favoring the commercial interests of the State at the expense of manufacturing industries. It is stated that there has been no development of manufacturing as would have taken place under proper conditions. Census statistics of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island are cited in comparison with those of New York* The popular idea is that this State ranks first In population, manufacturing, &c.. but it is shown that comparisons can only be made legitimately by using unit areas and not total areas. If we compare New York with the other States on this basis we find that the value of the manufactured product of Connecticut is one and a half times greater than that of New York, of Massachusetts three times greater, and of Rhode Island three and a half times greater. The same causes have naturally affected population. If a liberal policy had been adopted in encouraging the manufacturing industry, the population in 1900 Instead of being 1,250,-I 000 would probably have been 11,000,000 or 12,000,000, with a corresponding increase In wealth and Industries due to such an excess of population.
In the chapters on Inland waterways.
State canals, ship canals, barge canals. Canadian canals, &c>, a very good description Is given of the origin and trend of the State canal system. It is Interesting to note that in 1790 the cost of transporting freight from Seneca Lake up to Albany
