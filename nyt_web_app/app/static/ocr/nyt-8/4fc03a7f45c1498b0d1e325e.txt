A’eu: York Titnis Saturday Rcrtnc of Books:
Will you publish a short list of, say, ten or a dozen humorous books that one can appreciate and enjoy as one does "Pickwick,1' "Tons Sawyer," "Huckleberry Finn," and *' A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur ’* ? I ;un nauseated with the silly, mediocre novels put forth by the “ great army of present day novelists," and which are “ well reviewed ‘ In every newspaper, pamphlet, magazine, one can look at. I am utterly weary of continually meeting the same people under different guises. A few weeks ago I purchased " Tommy Cartaret," and after reading three chapters 1 put aside the -book in disgust. In the first half dozen pages one is introduced to an ingratiating (?) old male flirt who seems to be a great favorite with the ladies (in the book, forsooth.) and who, before we have read ten more pages, is found allowing his son (who is the athletic young man " with the lounging gait " we meet every where, > to bear his guilt. 1 have no idea how the story ends, nor do I care. I shall not ; finish rt.
My experience with ** The House of Cards " has been but little better. There wq meet the same athletic young man and a “ blindingly ” beautiful young girl,
(I wish we could see such In real life.) I i have "not yet finished thi£ book, nor have ! I much courage to go on. I believe, how->■ ever, that the hero dies in the middle of ! the story, which Is a great comfort, so I
! may finish ft.
And may I add a word of complaint against the size and the atrocious bindings which we are compelled to take if we decide to purchase a book. The size Is altogether too large. When one is compelled to do almost all of one’s reading on a train, a small book that can be slipped into the pocket Is what Is wanted.
The new Stevenson edition which the Scribners are publishing is most excellent in every way. Wh^do th^y TK>t issue all the bobks they publish in this convert* lent form; afid why* Should not other publishers follow 'sttft? Ijghtwfelght paper, small size, Is what most readers woji* in
tyoolcs*	*	'	"	~
Mxnfct the bindings: T would Just men-t|on’ one—-namely, •* Miss BeHard’s Inspiration,” (although this * crHlctettt iff ecpjal-iy applicable to nearly all new books.) I stopped at my bookstore to purchase this book, and found it* so balky *ad-In sac h a cheap. Inartistic dross that 1 would not take It.	F\ E. ROGERS.
