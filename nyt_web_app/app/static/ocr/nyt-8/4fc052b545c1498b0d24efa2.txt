Only Tbree Montlis to Write ii Light Sovel.
George Barr M«-Cutcheon says that , three months is ample ] time in which to write any light novel. Con- | seqoen1 his next one may be expected ! in I he Fall. A character study or a prob- j lem novel, such as “ The Sherrods,” he admits would take longer. A short story ; he considers presents difficulties altogether riisproportioned to its length, unless. indeed, a short story be one episode, one link in :t chain, virtually one chapter in a lor g story. Something of this kind is now claiming his attention—a humorous character study, a series of stories all of which concern one Anderson Crow, a blundering country detective who is filled ’ with the pride of office and believes him- , self to be a second Sherlock Holmes, yet though is fine theories are invariably misitikf’- through accident or the help of fre-nds ne generally succeeds in his cases.

Henry- Jnmpn’s View of Jane V ii n 11- n.
Jane Austen, with all her light felicity, U-ave,s us hardly more curious of her process, or f»f i'- experience in her that fed it, than Th<* brown thrush who tells his story from th* garden bough; and this, I freely conf< s, in spit*1 of her being one of those of Uir shelved and safe, for all time, of whom 1 should have liked to begin by talking; one of those in whose favor u.si rimination has long since practically operated. She is in fact a signal instant * of the way it does, with all its embarrassments, at hist infallibly operate. A sharp siiort cut, one of the sharpest and shortest achieved, in this field, by the general judgment, came out, betimes, straight at her feet. Practically overlooked for thirty or forty years after her death, f i'e perhaps really stands there for us as . \e prettiest possible example of that r<Leuf ication of estimate, brought about by some slow clearance of stupidity, the hall century or so is capable of working round to. * • * The key to Jane Austen's fortune with posterity has been in part the extraordinary* grace of her facility, in fact of her unconsciousness— as if, at the most, for difficulty, for embarrassment, she sometimes, over her work basket, her tapestry flowers, in the spare, coo* drawing nam of other days, fell a-musing, lapsed too metaphorically, as one may say. into wool gathering, and her dropped stitches, ol these pardonable, of these precious moments, were afterward picked op as little touches of human truth, little glimpses of steady vision, little masterstrokes of lYnagi ration.—Prom

prtately be compared.
He Is sui generis, without antecedents, and also, so far as his most admirable and individual qualities are concerned, without successors. In one sense, it is true, he has exercised a deep and wide Influence on European fiction. He was the originator of one melodramatic scene
which is now part of the common stock of the novelists of all countries. The respectable malefactor who publicly confesses an old sin in a situation of pomp and circumstance appears for tbe Tirst dme in " The Scarlet I^etter. ” He reappeared in " Les Mis£rabies.*' in " The Deemster," in " The Silence of Dean Maitland." and elsewhere. But the scene, as rendered by the imitators, savors of the limelight. From Hawthorne's pen alone it derives the cold beauty as of frosted silver. To say that is perhaps to say that he has not been imitated because he is inimitable.
It is also to say that he is a great writer; but there remain one or two reasons for declining to rank him quite with the greatest. His two weaknesses were “ provincialism "—we know Americans hate the word—and a tendency to sentimental compromises. The latter vice Is illustrated even in "The Scarlet Letter,’* which had a happy ending altogether " out of the picture,” and destructive of the Aeschylean effect apparently intended, and in fact produced, in the earlier and more impressive pages of the work. The " provincialism '* we find not merely in what Hawthorne wrote about England but also in what he wrote about Rome. Rome, though he wrote very beautifully about it, was really too big for him to understand or even to feel. He never quite ceased lo be the New England tourist, j shocked by the nudities of the Vatican.
; and bent upon discovering the obvious. That is bound to be one of the impressions left after the perusal of “ The Marble Faun”; and that is one of the reasons why we cannot agree that Hawthorne quite holds his own in the very highest class. The failure is not in his prose style but in his mental grip of thing- LiiMjnn Academy.

G««rg« Meredith would seem to .itave been the master that Mr, Swinburne imitated, whether subconsciously or not. There are many tricks ot style rctitlnla- : cent of our most cultured novelist. But tbe story is told by means of correspondence* a method which has long been abandoned by modern writers as unsuited to the tastes of the day; the date is of that most uninteresting period of the mid-Victorian proprieties; the plot is practically non-existent, and there is no obvious conclusion.

Literature and Statesmanship In
England and America.
The recent death of Mr. John Hay points one curious contrast between English and , American public life, j In our own country for more than a century many of our I leading statesmen have been accomplished j men of letters and students, if not au- j thors, Such were Fox, Canning, Lord ■ John Russell, Lord Derby, BuVwer Lyt- I ton. Disraeli. Gladstone, Lord Salisbury: and the tradition Is maintained by Mr. i Balfour. In the United States tbe line of j literary statesmen almost died ojit with j
the Fathers of the Republic. Hamilton, j Jefferson, Madison, and Adams left no successors at the White House and the Capitol. The great Presidents and pttrty leaders have been men of action, pure and simple, like Lincoln, Grant, Blaine, and Conkling, McKinley, and Mr. Cleveland. Mr. Roosevelt, it Is true, writes books; but in this, as tn other respects, he has broken through tradition.
On the other hand, the American diplomatists are frequently literary men. Such were Bancroft. Motley, Lowell, Bayard, and John Hay; and such is now Mr. Whitelaw Reid, with whom Mr. Hay was long associated in the editorial conduct of The New York Tribune. If Mr. Morley had been an American he would probably have been Ambassador tb London or BeT-lin. And if Mr. Whitelaw Reid had been an Englishman, he would certainly have been a Cabinet Minister long agb—Sidney Low in The Ijondon Standard.
Valor of Flinders Petrie’s “ Hiatory of KRTpt."
The surface had been previously scratched over, but real root-research began in Egypt when he first took up the work of exploration. Not a bone is missing in the skeleton of facts which now awaits its fleshing iu many a book to come. Gradually but surely verifiable history Is taking the place of misappropriated mythology and legendary lore, and henceforward the study of the past will not be so much a matter of the higher criticism as of deeper digging. The era of the excavator has but just begun, and already spade work is superseding guesswork, and dead Egypt with a H\ing tongue is once more speaking for herself.
One of the most important and. to Prof. Flinders Petrie, most perplexing .*• finds." as chronicled in the present volume, la the newly discovered	Inscription	on	the
Stele of	Merenptah.	Merenptah	is	the
supposed Pharaoh of what la usually
termed “ The Exodvs." meaning the coming forth of the Israelites 2,000,000 strong from the land of Egypt, according to the history in the Book of Exodus. It is well known that the Egyptian monuments have no record of " Israel In Egypt '* a.s an ethnical entity. And the only mention of the name of Ysrarl or Israel on any monument is to be found on this Stele of the Pharaoh beloved by Ptah.
But. if	these were	the same people as
those of	the Hebrew	" Exodus,"	the	de-
liverance of the Israelites from Egypt is turned into the deliverance of Egypt itself from the Lybian confederacy of raiding barbarians, among the horde of which the Israelites were a hardly distinguishable unit There is nothing, however, in the inscription to corroborate the story told in the Pentatexicb. On the contrary, the Israelites mentioned by Merenptah instead of going up from Egypt as a cbn-quering army of 600.000 fighting men never really got to Egypt. They were laid waste, their seed was destroyed, and they were driven back from the borders of the land in wreck and ruin hv th** victorious Pharaoh. Merenptah.
At the moment of his TocquevlHr, centenary it may not be uninteresting to recali Morley. a conversation on the subject of de Tocque-ville between W. E. Gladstone and Mr John Morley, recorded by the latter as ! having taken place on Dec. 22, 1893. Gladstone had spoken of de Tocquevitle as “ the nearest French approach to Burke." to which Mr. Morley added: *' But pale and without passion. Who was it that said of him that be was an aristocrat who accepted bis defeat? That is, be knew democracy to be the conqueror, but he doubted how far it would be an improvement.*' To which Gladstone retaliated

Robert Brow rift o be rt Browning's tng for instance,
performed in later life the t'x.-traordinttry f^at of going through his rather abstruse poem of " Surdello " and plaelng at the top of each page a single line of motto, which virtually told the story of the somewhat unintelligible page below.

Both his son and his sister assured me when I saw them in Italy that he could be easily induced to do this by any one who was puzzled, and always justified It on the ground that the thought was the thing important, and all else was secondary If any nf yuu who are lovers of Browning will read for instance in the original edition nf * BelL** and Pomegranates ' the exquisite song beginning, " You'll love me yet.’ you will see an almost ludicrous change by which, in later editions, be comVnried the puzzled readers of two verses which were originally rontim.'ous, by putting a full stop between them, as hi* reader^ had done, and so spoiling both the thought and tbe sound. He admitted the charge, when I reproached him with it, and readily promised to alter it back again, which it is needless to say he never did There is also a great tendency under the same rircumstances In Browning to put in further illustrations which exasperate the older readers. His beautiful pair of poems, " Nfght " and " Morning, 1 are instances of this.

The attempt that Is About Jflrncn being made to restore
the monument to
*
James Thomson at Diy burgh Abbey is not likely, we are afraid, to meet with an en rhusiasxie re^^nse, " Jr'xumv ” Thomson i*» pretty well forgotten by the present generation. Does any one now read " The Season? " or ** The Castle of Indolence ” ? Vet there was a time when people did rp ad them, and Thomson had an un* ^haileng"d reputation; so much so that nobody was at all surprised Wben they put up a memorial to him in Westminster Abbey. Such critics as Hazlitt. Johnson, Coleridge, and Sainte-Beuve have paid considerable attention to him. Hazlitt
thought him the best of our descriptive po^tp; Sainte-Beuve said he excelled in large pictures and general effects: " II y a de la masse chez Thomson." Wordsworth, Shelley, and Byron were influenced by “ The Sessions. ” and Haydn set some ol the frigid blank verse lines to music. All the same, most people will now find them unreadable.
But one poem of Thomson’s has secured immortality. Rew people remember that he wap the author, or parti author, of the verses of ** Rule Britannia/’ In 1740 a dramatic masque called “ AJfred," by Thomson and Mallet, was produced, in which the song “ Rule Britannia " occurs. Mallet, who wa? not an over-scrupulous person, ga\'e it to be understood that the verses were his. But there is little douht that they were written, in whole or in part, by James Thomson.
The author of “ The Castle of Indolence ’* was a characteristically indolent man But he lived a faJrfy prosperous eighteenth century existence. Bom \in 1700, the son of a Scotch minister, he came to London In 1725, became a tutor to the son of a nobleman, and in 17:>0 published ** The Seasons ” by subscription, getting :tK7 subscribers at a guinea a copy. Modem poets would be glad to do as well, especially as Thomson's guineas bad per-"haps three times their present purchasing power. Then he wrote the tragedy in which occurred the unhappy line, " O, Sophonisba, Sophonisba, OJ ” promptly turned by parody Into ** O, Jemmy Thomson, Jemmy Thomson, O! After this Thomson got one pleasant little sinecure post alter another, including that of Surveyor General of the Leeward Isles (the duties performed by deputy), which brought him £300 a year. So he settled down snugly to a life of lettered ease in a house, with a garden and a couple of fields, at Kew Lane. Here he wrote “ The Castle of Indolence" and £ome more dramas; but unfortunately, taking a boat one cool night at Hammersmith, when heated by walking from London, he caught a fever, and died in the forty-eighth year of his age.
The best work on Thomson Is In French, .'Professor L£on Moret’s " Jazne&fThdmson, ;sa Vie et ses Oeuvres,’' uhichr^appeared >in 189a. There is also a German moao-‘graph by Herr Sehmeding In ISfO, and a good edition of £he Poems, witJva Memoir,

If Mr. Laurence Bin-yon were a painter he could not be more concerned with the color and form of things seen. His most distinctive poems axe renderings of things seen—“ London V is-tons ’* and Oriental pageants. The ** London Visions " are renderings of the picturesQueness of London, some done with the artist's eyes wide open, others when he is in half dream; the Oriental pageants have taken color and shape before him as he has read and brooded of the pomp and splendor of the life of old time in Magna Graeca and Syria and Persia, A man living in London, even if he be a poet, cannot escape present-day problems, and Mr.	Binyon	has	determinately chosen to
write	often	of	London of to-day. A
fourth of all his poems, a balf of those of his maturity, are of London; but it is not London that fills his highest, happiest dreams. These are of English seashore, of Montenegrin mountain, of Syrian deserts, of pageants in Antioch and Car-manian vales, of Arthurian romance. * *
*	• A flower to Mr. Binyon is apt to be a thing of beauty, or a symbol of beauty.
and nothing more; not, too, a primrose or a foxglove whose mention would make the definite appeal of a thing known and loved. So seldom does he name a bird that it is a real surprise to find that he does know a thrush and can speak definitely of his " dewy notes.” I state his neglect of the little things of Nature not as a defect, but as a limitation. It is not the way of his masters, Tennyson and Wordsworth, but of his more remote master, Milton, who wrote before Englishmen were wholly awake to the beauty of England, and of his chiefest master, Keats, like Milton a cockney and like him a man who lived too little out of doors.— Cornelius Weygand in The Sewanee Review.
