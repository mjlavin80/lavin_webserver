PROF. HEILPRIN has produced an Interesting monograph on a remarkable freak of nature. The eruption of Mont Pel£e and the obliteration of St. Pierre, Martinique, occurred in May, 1902In a little more than a year thereafter the volcano had formed a new cone,
, through the apex of which it had pushed what Mr. Heilprin calls a " tower.” This was '* a gigantic core of rock, nearly 1,0(X) feet in height at the time of its greatest development and 350 to GOO feet thick at its base.” The cone and the tower were about 2,350 feet high, and the apex of the latter was 5,020 feet above the sea. Of its appearance Mr. Heilprin writes: '* None of the grand scenes of nature which I had seen before—the Matterhorn, the Domes of the Yosemit£, the colossus of Popocatepetl soaring above the shoulder of Ixtaccihuatl, or the Grand Canon of the Colorado—impressed me to the extent that did the view of Fel&e’s tower from the crater rim.”
The tower was first seen by Mr. Heilprin as simply a “ needle" about Aug. 24, 1902; in May, 1903, it had grown until j JV.200 feet above the sea; but on May 31 it lost 180 feet of its summit. It grew up ag-ain at a rate of from 20 to 30 feet a day, but from time to time lost further portions of its apex. Mr. Heilprin believes that the tower was " merely the ancient core of the volcano that had been forced from the position of rest In which solidification had left it.” Its ** burnt-out/’ | *' scraggy,” and ” slaggy ” appearance makes him doubt that it was of recent growth. After reaching its maximum recorded height in May, 1903. the tower, despite frequent re-growths, began to disappear in July, 1903; by the middle of that month it had lost permanently 400 feet, and in August another 100 feet.
The extension and destruction of the tower afforded a remarkable chance for the study of volcanoes* and many scientific men availed of IL From Southern Mexico in the west to the Lesser Antilles the eruption of Pel£e was accompanied by seismic and volcanic disturbances. The earthquake at Quezaltenango. in Guatemala, took place on almost the exact day that Pel6e first seriously manifested its new activity; and the volcano of Izalco, in Salvador, whose energies had been quiescent for some time, started on a new period of eruptlvJty almost immediately afterward. Mr. Heilprin agrees with others in thinking that the earthquake at Quezaltenango may have started all the trouble. He thinks that a subsidence of the floor of the Caribbean basin prduced tbe pressure which caused the eruption of molten rock material at separated points over so wide a portion of the An- j UUes.	i
Mr. Heilprin’s book is excellently print- j ed and illustrated with twenty-two photographs, those of them relating directly to the tower and the eruption being remarkably good.
