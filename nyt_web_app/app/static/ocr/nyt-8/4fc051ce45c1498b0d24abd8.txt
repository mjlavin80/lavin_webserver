in 1887. Neither of these compilations is what lovers of poetry required, a “ Golden Treasury,” to use the title that Mr. Pal grave made
-	both current and classical, of Swinburne’s verse. For it Is what that same PaJ-grave, with that sureness of critical appreciation which showed itself not so much in what he said about his poets as in the selections he so unfailingly made from them of their best, described as " the brilliant lyrical gift " of Mr. Swinburne that alone needed or deserved the honors of an anthology in order to give in manageable compass the measure of his poetical claims. Mr. Stoddard’s selections included his poet's essays, to use the selector's words, “ In the narrow province of Greek tragedy " and “ in the broad world of the English drama,'* as well as ” in the enchanted region of romantic verse. ” By attempting so much he would have beclouded and confused Swinburne's performance as a lyrical poet, even if his selections had been such as perfectly to represent It. which they were far from being. He was obliged to make, in the first place, much too big a book, a volume of over six hundred closely printed and double-columned pages. The poet's own selection must be dismissed as, upon the whole, an illustration of paternal fatuity. Rubinstein, ■ when tie was asked which of his own songs was his own favorite, made frank and hu-

the same volume. * From " Atalanta "in Calydon ” there is only one selection, «The Death of Meleager,” to the exclusion of the choruses, “When the hounds of Spring ** and' “ Before the beginning of years," which Dr. Payne quite rightly and indeed inevitably includes, to the exclusion of the author’s favorite. In Mr. Swinburne’s ^selection of thirty-nine pieces thpre are but six Included in Dr. Payne's selection of seventy-three, and one has to Own that Dr. Payne's rejections are. all made on good critical grounds. In one article only does the autocritic give a useful point to the disinterested outsider, and \hat hint the latter has neglected to take. That strange piece of allegorical autobiography, “ Tha-lassius,” Dr. Payne gives in full and under that title. Mr. Swinburne gives rather less than the first half of It, very rightly considering that this part is the success of the poem, and changes the title to " A Fosterling.” There is very much of Swinburne's work that justifies and requires excision, and upon which the judicious anthologist is only withheld from the free use of the pruning knife by tenderness for the feelings of a living poet But in this case the rule “ Volenti non fit injuria ” eminently applies. And the space saved would have more than sufficed ‘to let in “ Ilicet ” and the " Ballad of Frangois Villon," the two most glaring omissions of which one takes note in Dr. Payne’s selection. How could an anthologist bring himself to omit this, for one example:
In deep wet ways by gray old gardens i Fed with sharp Spring the sweet fruit hardens;
They know not what fruits wane or grow;
Red Summer burns to the utmost ember;
They know not, neither can remember The old years and flowers they used to know.
Or this, for another:	,
Poor splendid wings, so frayed and soiled and torn!
Poor kind wild eyes, so dashed with light quick tears!
Poor perfect voice, most blithe when most forlorn,
That rings athwart the sea whence no man steers Like joybells crossed with deathbells in our ears.
DR. PAYNE’S OMISSIONS.
THE omission of the ” Villon ” is explicable, if not justifiable, for the inclusion of it would have contradicted Dr. Payne's thesis that Swinburne really sings habitually, as Horace said he sang, for once in a way, " virginibus puerisque.” Mrs. Grundy and Mr. Podsnap cannot possibly have anything to do with Villon or with Swinburne’s ballad about him. But the omission of the " Ilicet ” is inexplicable or any ground which will save the selector’s appreciation of poetic quality. It is redundant, of coursc, but so is everything in Swinburne. The Horatian maxim might be extended in his case to advantage, to " com ”—" prematur in nonum annum.” in which case much that we have would have been suppressed and the residue have risen in value in the proportion of the Sybilline books or even a greater. It is probably within bounds to say that there is not one of Swinburne’s lyrics that would not gain by compression, and not only by such concision in the planning as the poet alone could apply, but by sheer truncation of the finished product. " The Forsaken Garden " itself would be better off without the extrinsic tag of the last stanza. " The Sundew ” itself is a verse at least too long. The judicious reader-aloud of the ** Ave atque Vale ” itself will skip the hot carnality of the fifteenth stanza. A selector who felt himself at liberty to operate freely the file or the knife the poet has failed to operate could not any more excuse himself for omitting the last five verses of ’* F£-lise ” than he could excuse himself lnr including- the previous fifty-odd. The wonderful facility of the poet, wh-n taken in connection with his imi»atieni < of even autocriticism, has its reveiis*-s *n tempting him to this fatal dilution. Similarly, there are four dispensah]-- ! stanzas (we think not more) in th*j 1 twenty-four of “ Ilicet.” But on tiuj other hand, one of fun T-inir-nUTl attributes which make for the admission i of Mr. S\\'^n±>urne to the company ot the poets 01 all ag^s is the vividae:-s j and the constancy of his visio.i of mortality. He is tremendously impressed by it and it is always with him. No ma.tter what almost blasphemous bravado he may from tim° to time indulge himself withal about “ man by
day standing equal with his fate/* he knows better or he feels better. It Is his abiding conviction of the helpless-' ness of man in face of his fate that most of all makes him a ** serious *' poet. Ko man is more keenly and more constantly aware that In very fact a man " is a bubble that breaks in a moment on a river that rolls forever.” And bo, the conception of self-nothingness ” being, according to one philosopher, ♦* the grandest we can have,” ' and being that which renders most men voiceless and a favored few voiceful, in the-presence of the ocean or the stars, the poet who has it is a poet in virtue of having It. It is by this that our present poet tends to redeem himself from the reproach of mere virtuosity. It is by this that he can claim kinship with the Greek dramatists and the Elizabethan dramatists and the Hebrew prophets, whom he himself with accurate insight classifies with the great poets. And no more complete or poetical expression has he ever given to this haunting sense than in this poem of Ilicet.” It is even a vindication and a magnification of his strictly poetical power that when the imagery of the poem is reduced to prose propositions it is Impossible to make more out of it than the truism than when a man is dead he is dead.
VAICE OF* THIS ANTHOLOGY.
WE seem to be quarreling with the anthologist. Nothing could be further from our intention, as nothing could be more ungrateful, to the point of indecency, He has undertaken a most desirable piece of work, and it ought to be said early and loud that he has acquitted himself of it in a manner that is almost impeccable, so far as the work of selection is concerned. The ex-
■s.
ceptions we have noted are almost the only exceptions, the only sins of omission, we have to note. It is as good an I anthology of Swinburne as we can ex-j pect during the poet’s lifetime, and while compression and excision involve vivisection. Moreover, the notes are exactly what the reader desires and needs. There is a great -deal of research in them, for which the editor omits to take credit to himself, holding, apparently, that the business of an editor is to edit, but for which it is on that very account more incumbent upon the grateful reader and reviewer to give him credit. This is a very admirable piece of work. It is a pity that the publishers should not more intelligently have seconded the editor’s efforts for the popularization of Swinburne. The type is excellently clear and the page attractive. But the volume Is portable only jn a satchel, and not pocketable, as a volume a little narrower and a little thinner, even at the cost of making it a little taller, and using a little finer type and a little thinner paper, would be The “ format M of the Golden Treasury is an admirable example, containing, one supposes, much more matter in fifty pages fewer and in a more convenient shape.
Surely no poet stands more in need of an anthology than this poet. His productivity is almost unexampled. In our time quite unexampled excepting by Browning. It is a question whether Swinburne’s tale of “ lines ’’ is not numerically equal to that of Browning.
If It be anywhere near equal, it Involves far more labor. For in this immense body of poetical work there is scarcely one hobbling line such as the
-	elder poet would willingly admit. Provided Browning made his meaning clear he was not solicitous to 41 beat his m.u-sic out,** as Swinburne always and everywhere shows himself to be. Granted, as one must grant, his prodigious power of Improvisation, It remains true that for forty years Swinburne has labored in his vocation of verse, to say nothing of his avocation of prose, which In sum would fairly account for a life of lettered ease. But the Nemesis of his facility has overtaken him. In mere bulk, the package which Tennyson transmits to posterity is not comparable with the poetical baggage of his contemporary Browning or of his successor * Swinburne. Two moderate twelvemos hold it all. And even Tennyson in a manner outlived his vogue. Nobody is ashamed of not knowing about “ Becket ” or M The Cup." But “ Poena” overtook the younger poet earlier, by reason of the facility in which the reading public thought It detected dilution, and found negligible his output after the second series of the M Poems and Ballads.” It Is the piety of Dr. Payne which shows that the later product is not negligible, by exhibiting judicious selections from it. In the preface to the collected edition of his poems Mr. Swinburne himself rests his claim " as a lyric poet In the higher sense of the term '* upon the two odes, one strictly and the other loosely Pindaric, *• Athens *’ and “ The Armada,” and neither is known or was known before Dr. Payne’s pious undertaking, to hundreds, if not thousands, of readers to whom the earlier lyrics are familiar in their mouths as household words. Before these odes appeared, the one in 1881, the other in 1889, such readers had renounced the pretension of " keeping up ” with the poet. Surely, it Is a pity—as to the ” Athens,” at least, a great pity. What English poet, Swinburne or another, has done anything better in its kind than the opening " strophe ” ?
Pride have all men in their fathers that were free before them,
In the warriors tnat begot us freeborn pride have we;
I But the fathers of their spirits, how i	may men adore them.
With what rapture may we praise who bade our souls be free?
Sons of Athens born in spirit and truth are all born free men;
Most of all we, nurtured where the north wind holds his reign: Children all we sea-folk of the Sala-minian seamen,	-	,	I
Sons of them that beat back Persia , they that beat back Spain.
Since the songs of Greece fell silent, none like ours have risen;
Since the sails of Greece fell slack, no ships have sailed like ours;
How should we lament not, if her spirit sit In prison?
How should we rejoice not, if her wreaths renew their flowers?
All the world Jls sweeter, if the Athenian violet quicken:
All the world is brighter, If the Athenian suh return:
All things foul on earth wax fainter, by that sun’s light stricken:
All ill growths are withered, where those fragrant flower lights burn. A11 the wandering waves of seas with all their warring waters Roll the record on forever of the sea fi*jht there,
When the capes were battle's lists, and all the straits were slaughter’s.
And the myriad Medes as foam flakes on the scattering air.
Ours the lightning was that cleared the north and lit the nations,
But the light that gave the whole world light of old was she:
Ours an age or twain, but hers are endless generations:
All the world is hers at heart, but mpst of all are we.	'
** purple patch ” about “ the Immortal Influence of Athens M at the end of Macaulay’s review of Mitford’s History of Greece comes to the memory for comparison at once, and is as speedily dismissed as not being in the same class. The ingenuity of the comparison of England with Greece In sea power and In poetry is lost sight of In its justness. (Naturally, the poem was written before the German lines held the transatlantic “ record.”) This, one says, is what Mr. Kipling ” wishes to say ” In *4 The Seven Seas,” but would doubtless be the first to own that he could not say like that. The only precedent for the effectiveness of these lines, in the same meter, a foot shorter to the line, is In the great swing of Mr. Myers's best verses in ** St. Paul.” But the whole passage, in its success of declamatory sonority, recalls Byron at his very best, and, to our sense outdoes him at his very best. Mr. Swinburne Is very severe on Byron. His essay showing how Matthew Arnold had exaggerated his meaning in allowing to Byron ** the splendid and imperishable excellence of sincerity and strength " is one of the most suggestive and interesting of his productions in prose. He allows to Byron, finally, the praise of an accomplished rhetorician and orator, and not of a poet, properly speaking, at all.
*	He is very exigent about rhythm. A false quantity afflicts him as a false note afflicts a musician, and he makes justifiable fun of the misplaced accents in Byron. His ear is so squeamish that he finds that Tennyson has " no ear,” or next to none, and that the “ Commemoration Ode ” of Lowell, which we are in the habit of citing as the best piece of verse that has been done in English on this side of the Atlantia Ocean, has something of thought and rtiore of eloquence, but of the quality specifically called poetry none at all. To be sure, when Mr. Swinburne delivered that judgment he may reasonably be supposed to have been resenting the judgment of his own poetical ppjvers, which Lowell gave in what is not one of the happiest of his estimates, just as it was the unjust crudity of Emerson's dismissal of his poetical claims that induced the British poet to define Emerson as •* an impudent and foul-mouthed Yankee pholosophaster,” a description from which posterity will find some difficulty in recognizing the original.
SWIIV'Bt’Rt\K AS CRITIC.
BUT upon any question of the technics of English verse Mr. Swinburne’s deliberate opinion must be accepted as that of the first living authority, and one would be fairly safe in saying, of the first authority who has ever lived. Certainly there is none of his contemporaries who is as well qualified, by sensibility plus equipment, to hold a chair of poetry in general, or of English poetry in particular. Not a strain of the music of English verse has ever escaped him. Nobody else so keeoiy enjoys the Elizabethans, even the minor Elizabethans, or knows so much about them. That does not exactly strike us an a good reason for including in the anthology the sonnets he wrote about those poets, so obliviscible, excepting by himself. He said, most poetically, and once for all, what he had to say about the Elizabethans in that b^au-tiful apostrophe to Marlowe, " In the Bay.” Why should the anthologist no on and dilute and attenuate that wonderful Impression, even if his /> i *t was ill-advised into doing so, by reprieving the specific sonnets, which the reader 1 must have both as minute knowk i^e as the poet and as inflammable nn imagination in order to appreelat^V To be sure, these sonnets are at worjt surplusage. If they do not rrow<l .. it better things, we may receive them with tranquillity, even with grati'ude. But it happens that the sonn -I <m Carlyle and Georfre Kliot crouds out the sonnet on Newman and Carlyle, “Two Leaders,” which one is inclined to rail th'' best sonnet Mr. ftwinhurno t\er wrote, and which at least is entitled ti* extrude any on#3- of the sonnets vhieh Dr. P:\yn'’1 has included, and whu h, moreover, tends to make pood the thesis of h:s introductory essay, that his poet’s cl lims are intellectual as v\ ell as technical.

poetry derives from his reading of ♦Swinburne is not that the poet is a great intellectual furee in his generation. (*• in truri wise. it is the judgment of WalltMisicin. " (]uam parva sapien-tia.” “ Go. my son, and see for yourself with how little wisdom poetry may be written." Swinburne, in spite of his redundancy and his tautology. " a hundred words where one right one would do,” as Matthew Arnold wrote in a private letter, has '* temperament ’’ equal to that of any poet who ever wrote English. Temperament and technic. Together, unless indeed the second be a consequence of the first, they will carry a poet far. There are “ holes *’ even in his technic. It is an old re-mark that, though he can “ speak th<2 speech ” in many modes, it Is denied to him to speak it *' trippingly on the tongue.*' Dr. Payne 'judiciously calls attention to Swinburne’s hendecasylla-bics,	*
In the month of the long decline of
royes
in contrast with Tennyson’s essay in the same meter: •
O	you chorus of indolent reviewers: but without making the obvious remark that the aerial daintiness of Tennyson's \ ersification was as much out of the reach of his junior as the stately sonority of the junior’s lines was out of his own. Violinists say of Ysaye,
” What a pity he has no staccato ’’! and lovers of poetry may equally say of Swinburne what a pity he has not that phase of verbal magic, having so much t lse.	/	_
A much more serious abatement is what we may call the defect in Swinburne’s conception of love and of women. It is the antique, the pagan, the classical conception, and in his earlier ballads he made the mistake of trying to adjust modern romajitic poetry to it. That poetry, sprung from so widely different a a conception, will not be adjusted, and the modern reader finding modern love songs set to the conception of the fourth book of Lucretius, is proportionately shocked. Dr. Payne omits all these insincere and factitious erotics, which did so much to hinder the earlier acceptance of Swinburne, much more than was done by his wrongheaded conception of republicanism. But Dr. Payne and his client ought to “ get together.” Whereas he holds that these erotics are the aberrations of an irresponsible adolescence, the poet himself, in the preface of these very months to the collective edition of them, declares that, concerning them, he has ” little to regret and nothing to recant.”
He does not even recant
Ah, where .shall we go then for pastime.	,
If the worst that can be has been
done f
If the poet had emulated the frankness of Byron, and owned that his purpose in these things was to make the British matron " sit up,” he would have disarmed much of the criticism that has befallen him, and which he invites by “ making the disorders of his nonage his own. through* an after approbation." But when his editor invites our attention to the intellectual importance of his client it is time to draw the line. When Dr. Payne says that Mr. Swinburne has a wider range of intellectual interest than any other poet of his time he evidently merely means that Mr. Swinburne will write about anything. And when he goes on to deduce a body of doctrine from “ Hertha" and the " Hymn of Man," he exposes his client to the remark of the historian John Richard Green, on the first appearance of the poet: “This man has a greater command of poetical diction than anybody since Shelley: but he can’t think.”
SWINBIRNES VIRTUOSITY.
BUT he can feel, and he can sing. Such virtuosity in English verse has scarcely ever been before. Even the English heroic couplet, stiffened and formalized from Dryden to Johnson he can transmute into something rich and strange and under his hand, in “ Anactoria ** and in Tristram ” it takes on movement and fluency and life. And that means very much. Mr. Swiuburne himself has said that there never was such a phenomenon as a poet who had a great command of harmony who was a great verbal musician, and who had Nothing else- His own works go far to prove his own words. It is true that, quite in the sense in which he declared that Tennyson had M no ear,*’ he hliir-self has “ no eye/* that it Is the rarest
really visualized and made real, as we may find in Tennyson a thousand. It Is true that his “ criticism of life,” apart from his abiding consciousness of death is very nearly negligible. It is true that of that '* sympathy ” to which Mr. Swinburne rightly attributes the greater part of Wordsworth’s poetical power he himself has very little. His own " words that bring tears swiftest ** it is not given to him to utter. Beyond admiration we seldom go in reading him. That *' description suffused with sentiment ” which is the staple of the best English poetry of the nineteenth century he only exceptionally, as in “ The Sundew," attains.
■	- And, when he becomes tender and touching, or comes nearest to becoming so, he seems to do it bjfn*1 sacrificing his virtuosity, insomuch that his most successful essay in that kind,
“ Of such is the kingdom of Heaven,” might appear !n a monthly magazine, with the signature of Pocta Minor, or even Minima, without appearing to be technically above her class. But it is also true that there are spirits so constituted that they find a practical refuge and consolation from the ills of life in the cadences and assonances of noble verse, and that these come back to them in Lime of trouble with a healing power, like “ the music of all meaning,” even before the meaning is made plain, even after the meaning is analyzed and found to be not prosaically much. Such spirits are not finely touched but to fine issues. And to such spirits the “surge and thunder” of Swinburne’s verse are a real benefaction, and the admirable selection which Dr. Payne has made of it a permanent possession.	M.	S.
