IF Mr. Christie has the clafr'audient ' sense' • developed be will surely hear tho reverberation of loud “ Amens" from readers to his masterly refutation of Messrs. Clow and Taylor’s attack on “ Vlrgilia." He and Mr. Hart have smitten them hip and thigh, but it remains to be seen if they are vanquished. The salve upon my own smart was very grateful, for I had been wounded by the nasty gnat stings. We have mutual ownership in any ^poem which gives expression to I the deep emotions of the soul, and I was scarcely less hurt than If tho poem had I been fashioned by my own brain. For I was fresh from Its reading; it had caught me up and swept me along Irresistibly on it? mellifluent lyrical measure into that strange wild comradeship with the | ocean’s great sympathetic unresting soul , where the lover finds surcease of his hopeless passion and takes up the burU<*n of life again. In such a mood an adverse | criticism is like a needle prick upon the optic neive. In this spirit every poem ' 1 should be at first approached, and those who read the cuttings and slashings first and the poem afterward have my sympathy.
Mr. Christie declares ttuit though these \ j critics write with clearness ai;d Drevity ; they are as " blind as bats on the poetry side of the brain.’* There is an army of ; such, and in view of this tho wonder is that any poet lias the fine courage to send out a soul and brain creation nurtured with lits heart’s blood Into the world alone, to be pecked at by daws, bedaubed , by pitch, and all that fine blending and fusing of subtle thought forms in the j brain’s laboratory torn Into fragments and trampled upon. I 'have seen such man- ! i gling of fine poems by crude critics as j would make the blood curdle. No wonder the fine sensitiveness of Tennyson writhed , , under the cheap criticism he was called upon to bear. For myself, f could not l write a poem if my life depended upon it, therefore am I zealous for justice to those ! born with the poetic insight? j *' Live and learn." I have lived to see Tennyson's “ Maud " stigmatized by M. j Li. B, Nells as “ dismally dull and dolefully dawdling.” Listen, you lovers of " Maud ” and wonder, and if you have not looked over the poem for a year or two turn to the- volume of the Laureate i anew as I have done and give your mem-cry a twenty minutes* refreshment. Why, j you run the whole gamut of human emo-< tion and passion as you pass through the swift transitions of thought and versification. I do not envy the mun or woman who can read passages in ** Maud ** with, out a lump in the throat or a tear In the eye and that mystical thrill which accompanies high poetic art. M Absurd sr-mi-rnentality: " Sentiment there is, and line I sentiment at that, but what of the hitter arraignment of the social order raging madly through the first part uf the poem —what of the infinite pathos of the crazed lover driven to insanity by the mark of Cain upon his brow, thinking he is half dead and half buried, and his pitiful babblings.
0	why have they not buried me deep enough? * * •
1	will cry to the steps above my head.
And somebody, surely, some kind heart
will come,	*
To bury me, bury me Deeper, ever so little deeper.
“ Absurd sentimentality! M Let us pray for deliverance from such criticism.
