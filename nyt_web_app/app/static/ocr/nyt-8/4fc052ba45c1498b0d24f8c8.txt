less satisfying excellence of each of them to convince one of the unusual versatility of his talents. and of his altogether enviable capacity for intimate knowledge of widely
different subjects. Whatever his theme, he brings it before the reader with somewhat extraordinary vigor, clearness, and impressiveness, enlisting the syms.- _iiies and enchaining the interest /n a powerful way that is rare even among the masters of story telling. Beyond all else, his people are real, or have the semblance of reality; their surroundings are of the same quality, and all that happens to them usually at least seems as inevitable as Cate. Hut in his latest book, “ The Game,” in which, in addition to the most dainty cf love idyls, he has essayed to portray what the prize ring means to participants and spectators and what it stands for in the general scheme of things, Mr. London seems for the first* time unaccountably out of his element and outside of the verities. There would seem to be no obvious reason why he should not know more about prizefighting and prizefighters than about the almost inaccessible Klondike, yet Joe Fleming will persist in seeming to be a product of the imagination and no more a real prizefighter than ** The Virginian " was a real cowboy, while every word in ** The Call of the Wild " rings true to life—for people who do not know too much about dogs.
In the first place the player of “ the game ” is not very well typified by a stripling, "girl cheeked, blue eyed, curly headed, with face like a cameo," and possessed of the numerous other superlatives of refinement with which Joe Fleming is invested by his creator; ncr surely would any " game ** be con-sid? red of the authentic, professional, or grown-up variety in which such a stripling was matched against a savage “ bruiser ” like John Ponta for the amusement of clubs offering five and ten dollar rurses. j The story cf the fight itself, in which youthful agility Md coolness prove for a time more than a match for bulldog ferocity and endurance,	is vivid and
,	thriliing enough to stir	the blood of
?ven the most listless of	readers, but,
perfect as it is as a piece of writing, cue very much doubts whether the kind of popular sentiment most commonly present at prizefights would ever be on the side of any but the winner, whatever the physical beauty Df his antagonist, or however sweet his boyish smile. Still more one gently doubts in this particular case that a blow delivered by Ponta on the point of Fleming's chin could throw the latter upon the padded canvas floor of the ring with enough force to smash in the whole back of his skull, as Mr. London describes.
But as the prettiest and saddest sort of a love story nobody can find any fault with “ The Game," and as that is probably the standpoint from which most people will view it, it stands the best of chances of being soon in the list of " most-called-for novels.” It is only of the last tragic days of the love of Joe and Genevieve that Mr. London elects to tell us, but he has put into that brief space, in the simplest of words, a whole lifetime of happiness and grief. Joe is a real lover, if not a real prizefighter, and Genevieve is a very real woman in her uncomprehension of her sweetheart’s devotion to " the game " and her jealousy of this rival in his affections.
*■ The Game ” is illustrated by Mr. Henry Hutt in a manner that clothes Joe and Genevieve in a style befitting the smartest of smart sets, though he is represented by the author as employed in '* Hansen's sail-loft ’’ at $10 a week and she as presiding over the soda fountain of a cheap candy shop. The book is also- decorated by Mr. T.
