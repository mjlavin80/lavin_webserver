OW we see how complex, how many-sided, even how contradictory, is the sentiment for nature which our own literature inherited from the South. Into it, from the North, poured the shadowy waters of the early Celtic and Saxon poetry, and with the supreme gift of romance our endowment is complete. From this fresh infusion we learn to love nature with a profounder sympathy. The beauty of landscape in its sweeter moods is easy to recognize, and so is the vastness of it all, sweet or bitter, compared with the small and harassed lives of men. But it needs a more tender insight to find positive beauty in barren places, tormented by rain and wind, in places where nature is desolate and hostile. This la^t homage
which was wanting to Landscape landscape was freely In . given by a race whose Literature, genius dwelt in devious recesses of the spirit, where strange fancies were easily bred, and not in the pure Greek sunlight, in which everything misty and undetermined speedily floated away. Thus is added yet
another attitude toward nature, the attitude of a friend, full of delicate sympathy, who sees a life in nature as changing and baffling as the life or men. as real, as easily discernible, with the same power of making beauty out of pain and disaster. The intimacy between these two strange lives is now complete. They are interwoven so closely with each other, the spirit of the trees and hills affects tho mind of man so keenly and continually, that it is impossible to believe that the influence is not mutual. Man's life rises and falls, upon the bosom of the earth, arid earth herself must be conscious of the sympathy that flows from one to thev other. And here once more we return to the pathetic fallacy that man so hardly, consents to surrender. Not for long can he steel himself to admit that he lives alone upon the globe.
Every one of all these varying moods mis left Its mark upon our modem feeling for nature: and poetry, that subtle current, the enchanter who takes all the discolored seeds of the mind and gives them back as pure and shapely flowers—poetry has fastened upon them all. Moreover, for us our own poetry does more than this, for beyond the mere region of thought it introduces the whole world of the associations of language, the colors and odors that group themselves round a word, enriching it in some perfectly incommunicable way with much more than its bald original meaning.—London Times.

Under the title " EH*
A Fictitious SchweizerischAmazone,”
Literary & firm of publishers at
■	Amasoin.	.	*
;	Bale has just reprinted a
! story very popular on its first appearance 1 in 1S2L In some two hundred pages Regala Egli tells us how she, a simple Swiss 1 maiden, began her adventures by marrying Florian Engel, then a Sergeant Major in the Swiss regiment of Diesbach. His valor soon gained him promotion, and he |	fought in all the battles of Napoleon until
1	he died a Colonel on the field of Waterloo.
1	Nor did Hegula discharge any less nobly
j	her duty toward her adopted country. She
bore her husband twenty-one children, only nine of whom died in infancy. Of her three daughters, one married Gen. Perrier, who fell In the battle of the nations at Leipsic; one Muret, the aide de camp of Gen. Desaix; and tbe third became the wife of M. Prame, the secretary of Gen. Mo uton Duvornet. That they should have made such matches was natural enough, for her sons nearly all obtained commissions in Napoleon’s legions. Two of them were killed at Marengo, two at Waterloo. Another died " manful under shield ” at Toulouse, another in the Peninsula, and a third at New Orleans, Two others followed their Emperor to St Helena, while their mother also bled for France* Dressed in a becoming uniform, she followed her husband to the field' in nil his campaigns, was more than once wounded, and stood over the bodies of him ana their youngest son at Waterloo like a lioness at bay, defending them, pistol in hand, against the English and Prussian plunderers. -Is it not astonishing that Napoleon should not, before his downfall, have sought out and rewarded such a mother of heroes? _
A writer in the Revue Critique explains this seeming omission. He has looked into the records and finds that Regulars story is a tissue of lies from beginning to end. The regiment of Diesbach was never quartered at any of the places-where she' says Jt was, and it never bore on its strength a Sergeant, Lieutenant, Chef do Batsilion, or* Colonel named - Florian - EngeL Nor was there any. one named Engel among Napoleon's very limlted staff at SL-Hfelcna» nor any . General namea Perrter, nor an e3do-de cam^ r.amed: Mu-
ret. All the other names given by Re-gula, wherever it is possible to check them, turn out in like manner to be fictitious, and we ar^T here fore reluctantly driven to the conclusion that the whole history 'was what would have been called in those days " a bamboozle and a bite.” What one would like to know is why these stories of Amazons spring up aftor every great war. Sergt. Wheeler, in his recollections of the Indian mutiny, tells ms how at the relief of Lucknow a lady dressed in men's clothes sat up in a tree and fired on our soldiers until brought down by a Highlander. So, too, during the late unpleasantness in Sbuth Africa we were always hearing of women found fighting in the Boer trenches. Are these legends circulated to make Tommy Atkins and his Continental equivalents more gentle to the fallen—a duty toward which, to do him justice, he does not require urging—or is there something in the ballad of Mary Ambree that appeals powerfully to the military mind, but escapes the lay critic?—Pall Mall Gazette.
Tbe Abolition of Punctuation.
Now, finding that much of what was considered essen-
tially the duty of points can be accomplished in display without them, we are led to question the real efficiency of punctuation marks even in close-set matter of the regular page form.
Points are small. In order to see them
at all easily we have found it necessary
to give them extra space. The comma,
therefore, by virtue of the width of its
own body and the space placed after,
usually subtends a blank in the matter wider than the space between the other words of the line, except there be a semicolon or a colon, with either of which even greater space is provided. After the period at the close of a sentence it is customary to drop in a small quad and Invariably to begin the nest word with a capital. What marks to the reader’s eye the close of a sentence, the dot or tli? space followed by a capital?
Have we, then, been tricked? Have the points been doing the work appointed them, or have they been taking all the glory of performing the duties of punctuation while, like some men in good official positions, delegating the real work to those who are never mentioned, but who are its only assurance of success?
There seems certainly to be a question as to the thorough efficiency of punctuation points even in text. If it is true that dependence on points alone for punctuation is impracticable, we have opened le-fore us a problem the solution of which will carry on the evolution of typography to other changes, shocking at first, no doubt, to the public and the conservative printer, but which must of necessity take place if we are to develop oui* work with anything like scientific spirit—Frederic Flagler Helmer in The Printing Art.

tion. The least critical of us can see that the enthusiasm which the name of Hugo continues to evoke is out of all proportion to his importance as a literary force. Balzac and Flaubert—to name no others—were both greater from that point of view. Such ceremonies as take place in their honor,
however, are of a cold literary character. Ceremonies in honor of Hugo have all the splendor and solemnity of acts of public worship. The reason doubtless is that in Hugo every Frenchman feels that he recognizes the magnified image of himself. To those who are not in sympathy, his resonant eloquence may suggest the hollowness of the drum. To his countrymen he appears as the clear-cut exaggeration of the French type—the average Frenchman magnified to the heroic scale. Their attitude toward him, therefore, whether they read his works or not, has a close likeness to that of many Englishmen toward Gladstone.—The Academy.

it is doubtful whether his motive was anything deeper than a vain childish delight in gauds. “ He was the sort of man,” one of his enemies once said, “ who was capable of riding behind his own carriage in order to prove that he kept a negro in his service.” A certain Irish aesthete once appeared in the stalls of a London theatre wearing a jeweled brooch in his long hair; but he was anticipated in this respect by Ttifeophile Gautier, whose many-colored waistcoat was always the most conspicuous object in any theatre which he entered, and even by Disraeli, with his rings outside his gloves, and his green trousers. It is said that M. Paul Bourget also wore green trousers when he was a denizen of the Latin Quarter, but that was in the days of poverty and early struggles, and perhaps he had no others,—The Academy.

The assumption is that In sucti u case the author must be the sole judge of the acceptability of his story.

A
Prophetic Pnnsnige from Jules Verne.
The sad story of tbe loss of the French submarine enables us to exhibit the novelist as prophet. The catastro-' phe is described, almost as it must have happened, in “ Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea.” Thus: “The air could not be renewed in the interior of the Nautilus. An Intolerable weight pressed upon me. This feeling of distress affected me in a violent degree. I yawned enough to dislocate my jaws. I panted In endeavoring to inhale the burning fluid so necessary to respiration, and which became more and mpre rarefied. A mortal torpor oppressed me. I was powerless, almost unconscious. My brave Conseil, similarly affected, and suffering as he did, never quitted my side. He took my hand, he gave me encouragement. I heard him murmur:
** * Ah. if 1 wore not obliged to breathe,
1 should be able to leave more air for Monsieur.*
" Next day my breathing was oppressed. A sensation of dizziness oppressed my brain, and I went about like one intoxicated. My companions were affected in the same way, and some of the crew had a rattling in their throats.
" Soon after, the manometer indicated an ascensional movement I lay, halfsuffocated, on the divan in the library. My face was blue, my faculties suspended.
I saw and heard nothing. All idea of time had left me. My muscles refused to contract.”	,
The difference between, the two stones is that Jules Verne’s invention has a happy ending.—London Academy.
Evil
Characters
In
Fiction.
There have been many striking rebellions against the conventional idea of a hero, of which undoubtedly the most brilliant and delightful was Fielding's •• Jonathan Wild the Great but its success was largely due to the inimitable irony of the novelist, who could set forth ail the doings and iniquities of his jail bird with an ironic air of putronage that kept the narrative light and breezy, and yet never led to the mistake of confounding good with evil. Any one has but to read and compare this with Smollett s " Count Fathom ” to see the difference between the master and the journeyman.
Smollett understood what was wanted to be done, and attempted to set forth the character of his hero by means of light and sarcastic touches; but the result we must consider a failure. Smollett’s'hand was too heavy, and his discernment was not sufficiently delicate to draw a strict line between daring that might even be reckless, and coarseness that was simply disgusting. The defect lay in his own mind; we could cite numberless incidents to show that the disgust excited "by an episode arises seldom, if ever, from the episode Itself, but from the method of treating it. • * * There are many modern novels that are a hundred times more injurious to those who read them than the coarscst fabrications of the plain-spoken writers of the eighteenth century. Thackeray, following the example set by Fielding and Smollett, also made an unmitigated scoundrel of his hero, and produced what in some respects is the most powerful of his novels. In deference to modern susceptibilities, however, he en-dowed--B«irry Lyndon more with the vices
■	of the gambler,-the drunkard, and the bully than those of the absolute libertine. It was an experiment that deserved to be a success, chiefly owing- to its breaking away from the ordinary convention, by which the novelist ’wearies one by insisting on the ^virtues of the Ijero.
