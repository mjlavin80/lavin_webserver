Mary HaKlock Grecnwaldt’s ^iudy of “ Pulse in Verbal Rhythm.”
Nett) York Times Saturday Review of Books:
NDER the caption of “ Pulse in. Verbal Rhythm/* Mrs. Mary Hallock CJreen waldt, wife of Dr. Frank Green -waldt of Philadelphia, who is a pianist of considerable celebrity as well as a musical composer and contributor to musical periodicals, ha« published a very clever brochure which is suggestive of deeper thought than she has chosen to express, and the object of this communication is to bring’ some of it to light.
The author received her instruction in Germany, the home culture nursery of musicians, where she studied for seventeen years before coming to America. She was bom in Syria, and her mother was an Armenian, her father, Samuel Hallock. erstwhile Vice Consul at Beirut, and son of Homan Hallock. missionary printer to the American Bible Society and the inventor of the Arabic type which is now in practical use by all the Orientals of Asia Minor.
In her contributions to ’’ Etude ” and “ Poet Lore " Mrs. Green waldt has attracted the attention of scientists by her advanced thought; as, for instance, in this new lucubration, she touches on the value of time or rhythm not only in music and verse, and in the technique of the public speaker and the march of the soldier, but she shows how immediately it affects the comfort of mankind as well as the duration of life, entering as It does into many of its aesthetic phases and its mechanical operations. Cadence is as essential to the comfortable prosecution of the latter as a normal heartbeat is to health. Let the steam engine run without a governor and its pulsations run wild. Kjaculate words beyond the metrical limit and they blond into unintelligible sound. One must speak slowly in order to make a deaf person hear. By analogy, a portrait magnified to gigantic proportions destroys the likeness. All exaggerations disturb i h- rhythm of balance or equilibrium In music variations which uphold i!:<	! i ling and <lo not distort the
furm n i - i- to lh- restricted to regulation limits. T<> linger over sentimental verse is as natural as it is to canter over a rollicking: barcarolle or to repeat controversial words with rapidity and force. Quantity differentiates not only the measures but the moods of the versifier. Just so this rhythmic beat confronts the physician when he feels the normal pulse.
Applying this logic to human culture, we discover that educated persons speak -with deliberation, while the illiterate and untutored talk fast. Dr. S. Weir Mitchell has bt-on able to ascertain by the use of a time measuring instrument called a metronome that The fastest talkers in the I'nitcd States Senate reach a speed of four and a half syllables a second, while
for a single minute an excited negro or Jrisnwoman •>n the witness stand can maintain a speed of eight syllables a second for a full minute.
That morft practical of all rhythms, the pianist, (the author claims.) is often called upon by her lines to play fourteen to sixteen noLes a second, while the utmost that the tongue can do in that line is to reach eight syllables. Nevertheless, she fails to say by way of illustration whether the hand or the tongue of an irate pedagogue reaches the 10 to S rate of speed in dealing with an obstreperous youngster ?
Mrs. Greenwaldt has certainly touched the pith of her postulate when she assumes that one supreme heartbeat animates the whole of creation. It controls the swing of the tides, the precession of the fKiuinoxcs, the recurrence of day and night, the march of time, and the chronic passing of the generations of men. It is ,rii unremit-iing throb! It is hi-ard in the cricket on the hearth, in the rasp of the death watch in the wall, in the peep of the frogs, the drone of the be**s. in the cantor of the horse, in music, physics, and poetry’: in the rub of the washtub, the swing of the scythe, the clink of the apvil, the throb of the dynamos, the monotone of the revolving screw of a steamer; it is imminent in all of them. In long- poems aJid in nearly every import.- nt short one in the English language, thero is a regular cadence—a three-eighths rhythm, with one-eighth j omitt**<1—fur example:	I
" As 1 pandered weak and weary."
" Hnw sweet the moonlight slet ps upon the hank'"
One (ierrnan writer compiles a table of thf wo! Id's poetiy. draws a hunger curve and a thirst eurw, and asks why there is so miuli p<n-try that deals with drinking ,-ind so littl*1 with <-atinp. Hut why should it not be so? Man dallies with cheerful m<*re than with serious moods, and his hilarious retrain in inspired by a stimulant which accelerates th*j heart action and so quickens the rhythm.
Mankind as a unit keeps time to the sweep of a communal baton. Of course, there are stumbles, discords, and variations, according to the animating refrain, whether it be fast or slow or al)e-
gro; a jig1 or a'dead marcfi, a deuxtemps, a bop, or a glide. Huroan moods are inspired both from without'and within; but it the trend be happy the life will be happy, or vice versa. One thing is certain—any one with heart trouble (arryth-mla; cannot be Jolly all the time.
This subiect might be pursued, psychologically as well as physiologically. Into • the realm of the occult. The field is wide open for discussion.
