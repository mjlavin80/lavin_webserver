HE publishers of this book have done well in reprinting it. The history of all of our older towns is worth recording in accessible form, and that cf the old border villages of Massachusetts especially so. Sylvester Judd, who must not be confounded with the author of " Margaret/’ died in 1SG0, and his book was published in 1SG3; it is a storehouse of the history of the Connecticut Valley. Near at hand to Hadley are Deerfield, famous for its Indian massacre; Ashfield, Granby, Amherst, Northampton, Hatfield—half a score of towns dating from before King Philip’s war, and Hadley has its own fame. The Indian wars of Massachusetts always involved the Connecticut Valley towns; and they have always had a history of interest far beyond their commercial importance. But for years Judd’s history has been out of print. Th£~ new edition will find a wider field than the first met, and should create and fill a demand for itself.
With Judd’s history we can have little to do here. Mr. Sheldpn's introduction, however, demands attention. Hadley is famous as the hiding place of two of the three “ Regicides " who escaped to America at the Restoration—Edward Whalley and William Goffe—and especially as the scene of the story that makes the latter, “ a man of very venerable aspect, and different from the inhabitants in his apparel,’* appear suddenly when the Indians were attacking the town, organize the Inhabitants " in the best military manner,” drive back the savages, and then disappear. He is, from this, called ** The Angel of Hadley;" and his story has been repeated a thousand times by historians, novelists and painters. It falls to Mr. Sheldon, however, to tear the myth to tattprs. to show that it could not have happened, and did not happen, and to trace the gTowth of the story from its first suggestion in Governor Hutchinson's ** History of New England '* to its final home in President Stiles’s M History of the Three Judges.”
The attack on Hadley is described as occurring on Sept, 1, 1075; but none was made then. The doings of the Indians between Aug. 2-1 and Sept- 14. 1675, are related day by day by the Rev. Solomon Stoddard, minister of Northampton, in a letter dated Sept. 15, 1G75, and printed by Increase Mather in his history of the war, published the next year. The story, as Mr. Sheldon proves, is purely legendary.
Mr. Sheldon discusses, too, the journeys of the two men; how they got away from Boston in time to escape the King's officers, and fled to Hartford; how there the authorities warned them in time, and delayed the “ poursu-Ivants " three days before they decided they had no right to give them warrants to search for the fugitives. The Regicides lay hid near New Haven and Guilford for three years, and In October, 10G4, fled by night journeys to Hadley.
Whalley died about 1074, and is supposed to have been buried in Mr. Russell's cellar. In 1080 John London swore that Goffe was in Hartford, and Gov. Andros of New York on May 18 sent the news in haste to Gov. Leete of New Haven. But the letter was not delivered to Leete until’ June 10! Leete replied to Andros that he acted at once, and Issued a warrant. But Goffe was
not found.
Goffe’s last letter—for £>e had been corresponding through friends. Increase Mather among others—was dated April 2, 1079; it asked for news of his wife and family, which so far as we know he never got. And except for the failure of Andros’s attempt to capture him that is the last known of Major Gen. William Goffe.
M The greatest hero of Hadley, however/* Mr. Sheldon maintains, “ was not Goffe or Whalley, but John Russell, minister of the town.

est pitch of patriotism, he patiently wrought in darkness and silence. Through the anxious days and lingering nights of more than ten years he bravely stood within a hand's breadth of the gates of ignominious death. He never faltered for a single hour, nor ever sought to shift upon another the burden and responsibility. Month after month. Summer and Winter, year after year, zealously watching and guarding his trust, John Russell was virtually a prisoner within his own hamlet. Under his very rooftree he was secreting Whalley and Goffe. These two men were now proscribed; a price was set on their heads, and a swift retribution awaited any who might relieve or con-I ceal them. Any neglect of precaution, any unforeseen mishap to the prem-i ises, any single case of misplaced confidence, and both he and his guests I were surely doomed to nameless tort-1 ure and death. Of necessity there must I have been those about him in the secret; but none failed him, though each knew that a single whispered word would bring a rich reward. 1 AH honor to these faithful souls.
In 1G72 Mr. Russell refused a position of honor that would have taken him twice a year to Boston without expense on account “ of the special worke where withal stand charged," but in 1G85 he went to Boston—probably his M special worke" came to an end with a second burial in his cellar.
