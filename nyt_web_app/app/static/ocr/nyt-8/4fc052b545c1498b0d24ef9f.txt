Plunge your dread sword irito the Spoiler's den.
Hurl down into the far^s of the thieves The blaze of Its intolerable light.
Fail not, for in your failure Freedom fails.”
Scores of such striking passages could be cited from either of Markham-s books, as well as scores showing the most delicate aerial beauty, the “ sudden, soft, hill-stilled, far-falling wood.’’
I should like, however, in closing to say that the measure and ripple of Mr. Markham’s “ Virgilia ” seems to me in perfect taste and harmony. Can not a lyric run and break in a hundred forms as the grief or Joy of znan‘s heart takes a hundred shapes? And as for a peak's " speaking ” to which Mr. Clow so vehemently objects, has that hard-to-pi ease censor read his Psalms where the hills rejoice and praise the Ixird? Has he read his Byron where " Jura, answers from her misty shroud*'?
In comparing this poem, •Virgilia” with ** Maud,” does Mr. Christie mean so much to compare the versification, (for the manner of the poems is very different.) as to compare the treatment of the theme of the disappointed lover?
In " Maud ” the hero goes to the Breton coast, to the wars for surcease of sorrow. In *' Virgilia ” the lover goes to wild nature, to the stormy sea, to be alone, but returns to forget his woe in alleviating the woe of the more wretched—the destitute of our great cities.
Here we have a legitimate comparison, and a final resource of sorrow more Christ like than Tennyson s.
Is there in any sea poem a more comprehensive, a more tenderly pitiful and soul-answering word or the sea than this that comforts the lover here on the surf-tormented shore?
** The sea is the mother of songs and sorrows.
And out of her wonder our wild loves come.

Once upon a time a disturbed donkey catching sight of the reflection of the moon in a roadside pool drank up the water and went on his way triumphantly heehawing that he had drunk up the moon.
So the doughty Mr. Clow has settled It that poetry is no more and poets extinct.	.
t Any one having a feeling for literary values must chortle at the thought of the cocksure Macaulay, the statistician, the cyclopedist, the mechanic, being set up as a ** thrillometer ” for the measuring of poetry.
Look at the chop-stuff Macaulay wrote under the name of poetry, and put the
extinguisher on that tallow dtp that would

set standards for the' stars.
Take any of .Matthew Arnold’s ", touqh^-stone ” lines (and Arnold1 knew and wrote poetry) and test some of ^he H^es. *o* jbdwin Markham, w^ibse verse Mr. Clow this week harpoons In your columns. Do not the Markham lines ring pure gold to any one not congenitally deaf to the Incommunicable music of real poetry?
Are not these Imaginative and majestic lines from "Our Deathless Dead?”
