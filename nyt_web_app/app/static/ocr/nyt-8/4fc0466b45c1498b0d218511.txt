FOR the last eighteen months and more readers of Collier’s Weekly have enjoyed not only much graphic correspondence from the seat of war in Manchuria and its contiguous waters, letters of striking significance and apt description from Tokio and St, Petersburg, but also a vast number of fine pictures — photographic elaborations and addenda, as it were, of the text. But all the pictures sent by the photographers from the field of battle or of diplomatic and political activity were not used in The Weekly; now these, together with a careful selection of those that were used, are brought out in a folio volume consisting of about 500 full, half-page, and quarter-page plates occupying 256 pages. With the pictures is a brief, dispassionate running narrative of the war, together with Capt. Mahan’s scientific commentary on the battle of the Sea of Japan,
Those who remember Harper’s Weekly pictorial history of the civil war, Issued forty years ago, will be interested to compare it with the Collier publication of the present day, if only to appreciate the strides that scientific and artistic photography has made in the intervening time. With all dife praise for the ability of artists to seize and elaborate the propitious moment and the skill and ingenuity of wood engravers to produce striking and suggestive reproductions thereof, from the point of view of truthfulness and trustworthy sequence of events, “ A Photographic Record ” stands unequaled, we believe, as a pictorial chronicle of a great war. The opening scenes of the struggle, the departure of troops, their transportation by land and sea, the farewells at train and boat, come to us graphically from the Russians as well as from the Japanese. Scenes from the battlefield show
the armies drawn up or lurking under cover ready to annihilate each other; and there are snapshots of bursting shells and fields swept by infantry fire, as well as these same fields after the storm of battle has passed and the Red Cross nurses have begun their work.

Then there are scenes in the hospital, and of burials and of the armies resting from fatigue or at play. Technical pictures of warships and of fortifications, as well as illustrative views of groups of officers and men are not omitted. The frontispiece Is a bird's-eye view of the entire seat of war.
When the authoritative history or histories of this struggle come to be written this folio of pictures will prove an incalculable aid to the reader in- understanding the conditions that obtained where the battles were planned and when they were fought, and tho appearance and character, even, of the foemen who engaged In them. Readers of Collier’s are already aware of the artistic and informing points selected by the artists before they snapped their cameras; and now the results of their good judgment have received the very best mechanical treatment and are reproduced in half-tone plates on heavy calendered paper in a manner which reveals to the practiced eye unequaled skill In engraving and to the general observer the most satisfactory pictorial result.
