IN his recent book, “ Addresses and Other Papers,” Dr. Keen of the Jef- ( ferson Medical College, Philadelphia, gives some idea of the surgery of the civil war.
The surgery of that time was very slm-pje—cold water dressings or simple cerate spread on lint made by patriotic women by scraping one side of old linen sheets or table cloths, or, to encourage suppuration (for pus at that time could be “ laudable **) the ordinary flaxseed poultice. An amputation stump was always dressed with a Maltese cross of lint spread with cerate. What we did not have was almost more noticeable than what we did have. Among our blessings, however, were ether and chloroform. We had. however, no antiseptics, for antisepsis was as yet undreamed of; hence erysipelas, pyaemia, and hospital gangrene were rife. The total number of cases of pyaemia reported was 2,818, at whom 2,747 died, a mor-tallty of 97.4 per cent.
Wounds of the abdomen Involving the viscera were almost uniformly fatal. There were no haemostatic forceps. We had no refractors by which we could get * a good view of the depth of a wound. We had no hypodermic syringes at the beginning of the war; we had no aspirators, and. what Will astonish my younger readers, we had no clintcaJ thermometers: our , only means of estimating fever was by touch.
