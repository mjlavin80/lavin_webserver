LIKE LORD BEACONSFIELDf Cardinal Newman left his papers in the hands of a timorous and i procrastinating literary executor. Pat her Neville,
^ who died lately, was expected to write the authorized biography, but in fifteen years he did nothing more than put the documents In order. Now the biography has been taken in hand by Wilfrid Ward, a distinguished English Catholic, and biographer of his father, William George Ward, a prominent figure In the Oxford Movement, and of Cardinal Wiseman. Mr. Ward’s book, however, will be long In the making. Meanwhile, we are to have this Pall a book of the addresses made to the Cardinal when he received the red hat. in 1878, and his replies, together with an introduction and addenda by Father Neville. A new, authorized biography of Ca'rdlnal Manning, by the Kev. W. H. Kent, a member of the community founded by Manning at Bayswater, London, will be publishec before the end of the year. This will contain much new material, including the suppressed paper on the Jesuits and the correspondence on that subject with Gladstone. There is also a diary kept by the Cardinal during his wife's fatal illness, of . which the new biographer has been permitted to make use. She was Caroline Sargent and she died thirteen years before Manning entered the Catholic Church-
