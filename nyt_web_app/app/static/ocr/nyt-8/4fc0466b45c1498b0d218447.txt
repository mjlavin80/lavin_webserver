New Venture of The London Times in the Field of Book Selling—Its Circulating Library.
HE London Times has, on what appears to be a considerable scale, gone Into the business of selling1 books and running a circulating library of the sort on which the English reading public so largely rely for their supply of books. In its contracts with the publishers of the books which it proposes to sell or circulate it is stated that The Times stipulates not only for tbe discount accorded to the large dls-
the opinion, if not the conviction, that it would in the long run and on the whole be profitable. If it shall turn out that way, It will probably be continued and expanded and the example will be followed others.

THE world has wagged along under it not without a certain progress perceptible when we compare sufficiently widely separated periods, and we are Inclined to think that the way will not be abandoned within a time worth while trying to predict about. There has long been a conflict between the
trfbuting agencies, but also that a certain amount shall be expended for advertising in its columns, and that no like arrangement shall be made with any other newspaper for a fixed time; this was stated originally to be five years, but to have been reduced to one year.

The criticism by The Saturday Eeview of London showed something like a recrudescence of the '* bitter and brutal ’* wit for which it was once celebrated. Our own Publishers* Weekly seizes the opportunity to discuss the possibility that The Times will enter the publishing field also, for which' it predicts insurmountable difficulties, and it makes a running comparison of the present venture with tbe policy of the department stores in the matter of bookselling not flattering, as may be assumed, to the newspaper. But The Times is by no means without defenders.
