According to the fancy of the author of this tale. King Louis of Prance had a lovely garden sot apart for his royal pleasure and almost forgotten by him. And into this garden came a maid, very beautiful, young, and innocent. The gax-, dener (whose wife was her tire-woman) j let the maid walk there because it was a pretty place for a maid, and for a long time neither the King nor any one else had ever entered it. However, one day the King did enter the garden and saw the maid. After that the romance grew of itself—creeping along the paths and over the lily beds—the maid deeming the kind man who came and talked to her there “ the King's poor cousin ”—which was the monarch’s way of describing himself to her.	-*
While the garden air thus is heavy with platonic sentiment there are plottings outside in which figure Anne of Austria and his Eminence Cardinal Richelieu. Also bold young St. Mar leaps into the garden and makes love to the maid—encounters the King and fights a duel with him, not knowing that he is the King. Exactly what comes of it all need not be set forth here, but obviously little earthly good can come of it. There are some impassioned love words uttered and there are eager embraces and kisses and all that, and there is a deal of talk of being an honest gentleman and behaving in that character.
