! THE DHYAD. a Novel. By Justin Huntly I	McCarthy. Pp. 313. New York:	Harper
& Brothers. $1.00.
MR. JUSTIN HUNTLY MCCARTHY has always harked back to days more or less remote for the scenes of his romances, and In " The Dryad " his readers are asked to follow the fortunes of a French gentleman of the thirteenth century, who, while strollingr through the JSleuslnian Woods on his way to Athens and his father's Court, fell in love with a nymph named Argathona. The tale proceeds merrily with all the regulation para-phemalia necessary to a thoroughly mediaeval setting, while, as for the strange woodland maiden, who insisted that her father had died on the Plain of Troy by the hand of Paris and dated her own-memories back to Zeus and the other Olympians, she and her remnants of supernatural powers are treated in an everyday sort of way that would be disturbing if probability played a more important part Jn the other elements of the story. But when ordinary humans successfully use love potions to erase his entire p;tst history from an intelligent young man's mind and fill its place with a whole new set of ideas, it does not seem so very extraordinary that a dryad, whose mother had lived and died with an oak tree after the proper dryad manner, should be able to fling to pother earth with convincing violence offending gentlemen who doubted her age and ancestry, or that, when she j wag about to be clapped into prison, she I could invoke a rushing wind to her aid to ; put out the lights and disappear to her greenwood before they could be lighted again. One might wonder just what lan- i guage a dryad would speak In mediaeval j times. Mr. McCarthy settles the matter by making his Argathona able to converse 1 with everybody in their own tongue and yet with a vague difference that puzzled everybody and made them wonder how they could understand.	I
Rainouart and Argathona meet early ! In the tale, just at a time when Rainouart has been filling his head with visions from ** The Romance of the Rose,’* and, as the dryad fits in with all his visions he loses no time in beseeching her in the most impassioned manner to give up her immortal youth to become his mortal wife. Before the deed can bl; accomplished by a convenient anchorite, however, a certain gay and unscrupulous Duchess of Thebes, also journeying through the Eleuslnian Woods on her w^y to Athens and Duke Baldwin’s Court, experiments upon Rainouart with a love philtre, and with such success that when he comes to his senses he is in his father's palace and preparations are in progress for his marriage with the Duchess.
How easily and wonderfully Argathona prevents that—all her doubts about the desirability of loving a mortal having vanished when he vanished with the Duchess—Mr. McCarthy related in Eng-I lish that is certainly queer enough to be as archaic as he probably intends it to j be- The gay French life that went on in the Attic Capital when the Franks were in possession of the land is skillfully presented, and with such a wealth of dramatic coloring that one is quite certain the author will soon be turning his story into a play, offering great triumphs to the stage manager and scene painter. And if it all end3 conventionally with Argathona's adoption of the Christian faith and a wedding at the anchorite’s cell, it Is still a very readable tale after its own unreal fashion.	•
