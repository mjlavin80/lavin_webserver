A series of epistles written by an English public school teacher to a friend, now dead, who went to Madeira for his health, comprises the volume which G. P. Putnam's Sons expect to publish at the end of this month or the early part of September, with the title. “ The Upton Letters," by '* T. B.'* They treat ot many phases of English life, religious, social, and intellectual. As their writer says in his preface to the volume, they were returned to him upon the death of his friend, who suddenly departed this life a few days after expressing the wish that they be published. “Their interest,'* he says, " arises from the time, the circumstance. the occasion that gave them birth, from the books read and criticised,
the educational problems discussed; and thus they may form a species of comment on a certain aspect of modern life and from a definite point of view."
