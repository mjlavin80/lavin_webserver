Arthur Sidman's “ York State Folks,” which has been seen throughout the country tor several seasons, was produced for the first time in this city at the Majestic Theatre last evening, and apparently pleased a large and friendly audience. It is a bucolic drama of a very familiar type—or one might say of several familiar types—compounded of elements that have served many times before, and, being well tried and useful, may always be counted on to please a miscellaneous if not too sophisticated assemblage.
There is, for example, young Martin, the son of a hard-hearted old father. He loves a girl other than of his parent’s choosing. The son, having* lost at cards, 1b befriended by this girl’s father, a sweet-tempered old organist, who advances him tho money to pay his debts out of funds entrusteJ to his keeping by (the township. When settling time comes the money is. of course, not forthcoming, the shadows gather about the young people, and the old organist is at the mercy of the relentless old Martin.
Then the youth develops a strength of character not to have been suspected from his previous actions. Ordered to choosc between his father and the girl he loves, he very heroically forsakes the parental roof, and	in the final	act wo	find him
on the eve of his marriage, hardly daring to hope that tho stern parent will repent and come to the wedding. This, however. old	Simon Peter	does, with a	re-
sultant happy certain for everybody.
A story	so trite seems hardly	worth	reciting in	any further	detail.	It is	set
forth in this play with no remarkable skill, but the character types characteristic of the bucolic drama are •‘"fairly
amusing, and. as aforesaid, the affair provides an entertainment that many people will like. In that it no doubt serves all the purpose for which it is intended.
Conspicuous in the cast are Ray L. Boyce, who plays the oid organist with some sympathy; James Lackaye. who ha^ some good moments as the hard-hearted father, arid Harry Crosby, genuinely amusing as a rustic beau. Leila McIntyre, the " ever-loving little girl " of last Summer comes into view now as a full-fledged little leading lady. She acquits herself with credit.
MURRAY HILL REOPENS.
m
Charles Bowser's Company Seen . •’ . . i^Papta-’s Boy/'
At the opening of the Murray Hill Theatre for the season last night Frank W. Lloyd, According to the programme. “ introduced ” Charles Bowser’s Comedians In " Papa’s Boy.” and not the least remarkable feature of the affair was the hardihood exhibit eel by Mr. Lloyd in introducing either the '‘comedians** or the play. Even Mr. Lloyd has no adequate appellation for the latter, for he says it Is " a musical comedy or a comedy musical,” and when the manager is in doubt who shall judge?
All	through	three dreary	acts,	filled
with	a lot of	old stage business,	inane
jokes, and mediocre songs sung by voiceless vocalists, the “ comedians ” do things to Papa’s Boy. Harry B. Lester, who plays the boy. has written a lot of songs for the piece, and therefore he is allowed considerable latitude in voicing them,	even to	the extent of	trying	to do
what	every lithe young man	attempts to
do these days—imitate George Cohan. The result would have been ludicrous if it had not been so dismal, but a large and persistent claque forced two encoeres upon a weary audience, and the sad fun was allowed to go on.
Charles Bowser used to be a comedian of parts, and it is pitiful to see him cast in with a lot of players like this, who have no chance to do anything with the material at nand and with no likelihood of being able to do anything with any sort of material. In the whole conglomeration the only bright spot was the intelligent portrayal of the part of the mother of “ Papa's Boy " given by Florence	Edney.	At no time was	there
much of a plot in evidence, and what little there was was entirely lost sight of when the specialties were dragged in by the heels. It is not even likely that Skaneateies or Painted Po5t will stand for ” Papa’s Bov.’* It is quite certain that^ New York will not. The cast follows:	*
Professor Bluffem............Charles Bowser
I.	B. Crankie........................D. J. Sullivan
Dolly ..............................Harry B. Lester
Jack Flyboy .................W. J. Samuels
Captain Doolittle............G. R. Raymond
Mrs. Crankie.................Florence Edney
Mrs. Doolittle...............Sue Belle Mead
Polly ...............................L»oie Arnold i
Madam Tiptoe ........................Elizabeth Hess

“WOODLAND” AT THE GRAND.
The Savage Musical Production P/eases a Large Audience.
** Wooland,” the musical fantasy which Henry *W\ Savage produced last season, opened	the	season	of the	Grand Opera
House	last	night.	There	was not an
empty	seat	on the lower	floor of the
house,	and	there	were few anywhere.
Every spectacular feature that helped make the play run so long at the New York Theatre is again present.
Greta Risley has the rOIe of Lady Peacock, formerly played by Emma Carus. Helen Hale is still the pretty little Jenny
Wren, and Harry Bulger is funny man extraordinary. His song, " No Bird Ever Flew So High He Didn’t Have to Light,*’ Is perhaps the most popular in the play.
*' Woodland ” will stay at the Grand Opera House this week.
CIRCLE IN A NEW GUISE.
Opens as a Combination House with " Wine, Woman and Song.”
The Circle Theatre reopened last night
as a combination house. The attraction
was *' Wine, Woman, and Song,” and it
decidedly amused the audience.
The feature of the play is the plunge
over Niagara Falls of a barrel with a
man supposed to be Inside. The Falls
formed the background.
The barrel dive was prepared for by
introductory remarks on the part of the actors and actresses, who prophesied dire results for the barrel's human contents. Then at the proper moment a man in the wings heaved a barrel up in the air and sent -it across the scene. It fell out of Bight behind a fence, and' the great dive
* ' * * ' j • was over. Presently the man from the* inside appeared,1 wet and scared*
HERE’S A BOY STARLET.
Joe Santley Takes Most of the Honors in A Runaway Boy.”
The opening of the Metropolis Theatre
In the Bronx last night was a triumph for
little Joe Santley. He was the starlet
in “ A Runaway Boy/’ The gallery was
crowded with worshiping boys of about
Joe’s age, other seats were filled by their mothers, and all the standing room was taken up by men and women intermingled.
" A Runaway Boy v has few dull moments in it. The object of its maker was evidently to protide a thriller, and he succeeded without a doubt. The audience spent half the flme holding its breath and the other half in letting it out in gasps of admiration for the hero or hatred for the hero’s enemies. The other actors did what they could for themselves, but Joe didn’t leave them many laurels. He was the whole thing.
" A Runaway Boy ” will be at the Metropolis Theatre another week.
WEST~FND REOPENS.
Early Theatregoers in Harlem Out in Force to See “Texas.”
The "West End Theatre, in Harlem, opened its season last night with “ Texas,’* a melodrama of the prairies. The same thriller brought pleasure seekers in droves to the Fourteenth Street Theatre last season, and last night the Harlemites turned out In force to the revival-
Ernest Allen played the part of Texas
West, the ranch owner. He was the
greatest favorite with the audience. Florence Lester appeared as West’s daughter, and Hattie Foley as his wife. The cast, as a whole, is the same that presented the melodrama in New York last Winter.
DAVID BISPHAM RETURNS.
More Anxious to Ta*ik of His Concerts Than HJs Marital Troubles.
David Bispham, the opera singer, about whose marital troubles there has been much said recently, returned on the Campania yesterday. Although his questioners were more anxious to know of li^s reported reconciliation with Mrs. Bispham than of his concert plans, discussion of the latter was distinctly more to tho singer’s liking. He did not want to say anything about whether he and his wife would patch up their difficulties.
“ Is it true, Mr. Bispham,” lie was asked, *' that you are going to be reconciled to your wife? ”
*' I would rather not discuss that,” replied the singer. " I think that private affairs are not proper to be discussed by me for publication.”
When he was asked whether he was going to Philadelphia, where his wife is
now, Mr. Bispham again refused to say.
“ I am about to enter on a forty weeks concert tour,’* he said. ” The tour will take in all the large cities from the Atlantic to the Pacific Coast.**
As to whether he would sing in the Con-ricd Metropolitan Opera Company Mr. Bispham was non-committal.
Mr. and Mrs. Bispham have been separated for about eight years. Twice the husband has appeared as plaintiff in divorce proceedings, both times unsuccessfully. With Mrs. Bispham in Philadelphia are their three children.
