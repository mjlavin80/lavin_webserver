AMOD£HlN poet In the modern poses of a lover of -beauty and contemner of morals and pecuniary obligations Is the figure which makes this novel interesting. Daniel Lester (that poet) Indulges hts luxurious tastes at the expense of his wife's Income and of his friends in general; he consumes vast quantities of rich food, and pleases himself with fine feelings and high emotions; he is exceedingly benevolent where he can persuade somebody else to bear the cost, and he writes poems, of one of which he says, ““It shall haunt men’s memories for a month and they shall talk about it to the women they take In to dinner." In the beginning j of this story Daniel rescues at Mo-
i	naco a young woman who Is about to commit suicide. Taken with his own ( fancy that she is “ a sea anemone," (for j she is beautiful,) he resolves to befriend her. He takes her home to his adoring | wife, rescues her from a socially impps-sible_ mother, and finds her a place as governess to My Lady Beauminster's Oriental dogs. Much of the story relates to this Lady Beaumlnster, who has chosen to marry for money rather than love, and Is not perfectly satisfied with her bargain.
The lady being now a widow, with vast possessions and still beautiful, and the soldier lover of her youth having come home from his wars all glorious, there are dreams, which, however, are frustrated by the ** sea anemone.” For the old soldier falls in love with the waif. Then there are plots and tragedies. Of course there is a great singer mixed up in the matter—there always is in these romances —and perfidy and madness and secrets kept that should have been told. That part of It is all familiar ground.
The merit of the story lies in the first part, and particularly in the artistic perfection of the character of Daniel Lester, pleasant, contemptible, self-indulgent, but of “ a large selfishness..” It really seems a pity (though no doubt art cries loudly for it) that the author has seen fit to present Daniel with a tragic end.
