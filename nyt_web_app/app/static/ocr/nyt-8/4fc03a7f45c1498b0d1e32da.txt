The single book that would satisfy me for a month in the wilderness is F£n*»-lon’s " T616maque." It is remarkable for its exquisite style and the beauty and purity of its language. Tho young Prinoe is one of the most delightful characters in all literature, and the adventures with which he meets are, to say the least, in- „ teresting. The chief reason, perhaps, for choosing it Is that it suggests so much. Constantly, for one cause or another, I am reminded, when reading it, of what I know of tho history, institutions, and literature of three great peoples of antiquity—the Jews, tho Greeks, and the Romans.
