We have had fiome difficulty in fixing the limits within wbicb we should confine ourselves In tills Work. •	% * "We made
ft a point to determine the botanical Identity of every plant mentioned to this volume by giving the scientific name of the species to which It belongs* Before commencing the description of any form of cultivated vegetable, we are careful to state, with strict exactness, the place in botanical classification occupied by the wild type from which that form Is considered to have sprung. *	*	* We have
taken care not to give any names that &re not really In common use and well known, and have avoided mere translations. * • *
1 ^Vherever we bave been able to seize any prominent and reaJly permanent feature in the characteristics of a variety * * * we have been careful to brLng it consplcu-i ously into view. *	•	*	A part of each
description on which we have bestowed much attention is that which refers to tbe seed. In addition to noting the character of its external appearance, we have been careful to state, as precisely as we could.
| its actual size and relative weight. * * *
I FinaJJy. we conclude the article devoted , to each plant with a few remarks on tbe i uses to which it is applied and on the -Parts of the plant which are so used.
This, from the preface by the authors of “ The Vegetable Garden.'* MM* VII-morin and Andrieux of Paris, gives an idea of the plan of the "book. The Eng! lisb version has been published under the I direction of W. Robinson, author of 44 The English Flower Garden," “ The Parks of Paris," &cu, and bears the imprint here of E. P. Dutton & Co. There are many i Illustrations in tbe book, showing the dif-i ferent vegtables which may be cultivated
