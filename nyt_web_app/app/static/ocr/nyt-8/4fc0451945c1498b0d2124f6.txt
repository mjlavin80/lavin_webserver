R. EGERTON R. YOUNG, already a member of the guild of " dog book '* authors, has this year turned his Northern experience to account by writing ” Hector, My Dog: His Autobiography." Hector is not a denizen of the Far North from which Mr. Jack London's dog heard the call of the wild, but of a more southern region, wherein the cold is not so intense as to brutalize either man or dog. but is sufficiently severe to force them into a state of mutual dependence, and to bring out something like human qualities in the animal. Hector is not only with his master on the trail and in camp, but also shares his labors in field and garden, and comes under his roof to surrender himself completely to tho children's whims and to be their faithful guardian. As the book is intended to teach children kindness to animals, the dog Is necessarily endowed with a supercanine understanding. and is to be classed with the filially minded gentleman on four legs who is the hero of ” Bar Sinister."
This book will be the first published in the Autumn by the W. A. Wilde Company, appearing Sept. 1, but a little later its imprint will appear on ” A Soldier of the Wilderness," by Mr. Everett R. Tomlinson, the third volume of the Colonial Series, in which Peter Vande Bo-gert is the ht*ro. Abercrombie's defeat and the fall of Krontinac are the chief incidents, and the book brings Peter alive through the year 17oS. On the list of Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. Mr. Tomlinson is represented £>y ” The Red Chief, '* a i-tory ot Theyandanayea and the Cherry Valley massacre.
If any one should be able to estimate the possible evil influence of the fairy tale upon the infant mind it is such an historian as Miss Eva March Tappan, who so successfully practices the art of making history interesting, but Messrs. Houghton. Mifflin & Co. will issue a volume of fairy lore from her hand entitled *‘ The Golden Goose,'* and containing seven stories from ancient Scandinavian sources. So conservative parents may continue to tolerate Bluebeard and Cinderella in the nursery.

In addition to the five novels already announced this firm will print Miss Persia Mather’s *‘ The Counsels of a Worldly Godmother ’* and " The Wizard's Daughter ** and others stories by Mrs. Margaret Collier Graham. One of these stories. “ The Face of the Poor," will be found in the September Atlantic, with " Th« Three Gifts,” by Miss Florence Converse, and the first chapters of ” Blue Peter," a brief serial by Mr. H. M. Rideout, but the greater part of the magazine will be devoted to serious topics. Mr. William Garrott Brown’s ** The Tenth Decade of the United States ” will resume the place in the magazine from which it was absent in the current number. President Pritchett will discuss the question " Shall the University Become a Business Corporation? ” and two papers will be devoted to the Federal Government; Mr. N. S. Rossiter writing of *" The Problem of Federal Printing *' and Prof. \V. Z. Ripley taking “ President Roosevelt's Railroad Policy ” for his subject. The literary papers will be " Marriage Vows ” by Miss Repplier, ” Ultimate Questions ” by Lafcadio Hearn* Col. Higginson’s “ History in Easy Lessons,** " A Theory of Poetry ” by Mr. Henry Timrod, and ” The Career of the Joke,” by Mr. J. A. Macy.

Messrs. Dana hastes & Co. are preparing a new Pocket Shakespeare,” literally of pocket size, very light, whether bound in cloth or leather, and ludicrously cheap. The introduction and notes are by Mr. Israel Gollancz, and the title pages have pretty wood-engraved borders. Among the books which the firm is preparing for Christmas, the first to be published will be ** Tbe Art Lovers* Treasury/’ a pretty white and gold volume illustrated by fifty half-tone versions of famous pictures And statues. The author is Mrs. Carrie Thompson Lowell, a Portland (Me.) lecturer on matters of art, and the plan, and to some extent the substance of the book, is taken from her lectures. It is a collection of poems describing pictures, and poems which have suggested subjects to painters, and its scope includes mythology and sacred and profane history. The poets represented range from Homer to imitators of Mr. Markham* but nearly all are Judfcfously chosen. The author's descriptions and criticisms are simply expressed and unpretentious.

ately. It is one of those stories in which the reader is permitted to deceive himself almost to the end. but is enlightened and contented by tbe final event. Mr. Frank Waller Alien's " Back to Arcady,” a Kentucky idyl, is almost ready, but there is no mystery in its double love story, one half told in direct narrative, the other by delicate hints and the artfully unconscious revelation of the narrator.

This firm will also publish Mr. William Henry Johnson's *' Sir Galahad of New France,” a story of the French and Spanish colonies in the days before the English landing. The heroine is an Indian girl of the type revealed to Sir William Johnson and Castine. but now apparently extinct. The author will be remembered as the writer of “ The King’s Henchman.” ” The World’s Discoverers,” and other fiction and history for youth, published by Messrs. Little, Brown & Co.
The last-named house is preparing a novel by Miss Frances Squire, who appears on the list of Messrs. H. M. Caldwell & Co. :is the author of a book for children.	Her novel is entitled '* The
Ballingtons,” and draws its prominent characters from two families, in one of which the husband holds the purse, in the other, the wife. Both of the wedded pairs have married for love, and the changes wrought in their relation by the conditions under which they live form the moving power of the tale.

Among the firm's juvenile books will bo ” Men of Old Greece,” by Miss Jennie Hall; four stories, one telling of Leonidas and the training which led to Thermopylae; one of Marathon, Salamis, and Themistocles; one of the runner sent to Sparta for aid against the Persians, and, lastly, the story of Socrates and the rebuilding of the Acropolis.

Wells Smith's Old /Deerfield Series will be continued by ” The Boy Captive in Canada,*' the story of Stephen Williams, the child who spent a WTtnter in Canada with his Indian captors.
Before the appearance of this book the W. B. Clarke Company will publish ** Heredity and Environment of John Williams.” by the Hon. John Sheldon of Deerfield, whose acquaintance with the Case of the ” redeemed capture *' is probably more minute than that of any other person. The volume of " Poems,” by the late Arthur Macy, will appear simultaneously. STEPHENSON BROWNE.
