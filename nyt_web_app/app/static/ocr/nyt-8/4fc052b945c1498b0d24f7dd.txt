HE number of people who profess the creed of Islam has been estimated at two hundred millions, and although they speak many tongues their educated men learn Arabic and read the works of famous writers of the past or subscribe to newspapers which ure printed in Arabic. It is hard for us to realize how large a portion of the human race regards this language as the only proper vehicle for literature and bow great is the quantity of works of fiction, history, and geography, in poetry and artistic prose, which are found in libraries as manuscripts or have already appeared in print. "We are apt to think of Arabic as a bygone literary language, and the speakers of its various dialects as people without a future who are destined Vo disappear at a comparatively near date before the Europeans.
The writer of this history, however, be-heves that Islam “ will endure for many an age to come." and Arabic literature will not wane provided it foregoes the use of unusual and archaic terms, and freeing itself from the intense artificiality of the old writers seeks limpidity and simplicity of expression.

The old grammarians who wrote in I^alin have indulged in willful obscurities, but their straining after a show of learn-edm-Ks is child's play compared with the intricate foolery of which old authors who wrote in Arabic have been guilty. An author of Yemen who died in 14^1 and wrote " Vnwan al-Sharaf al-Wafi." is a classic example of the mind that enjoys the most difficult way of imparting knowledge. Each page is divided into seven columns of writing, three broud and four narrow, the broad alternating with the narrow, each being a separate treatise. Thus the centre columns contain a tieatise on law and the narrow ones between, which must be read separately, are treatises on history and grammar, while the two narrow ones on the outer edge:;, " composed of single letters which form the beginnings and endings of the columns next them,” present, when read from the top downward, an intelligible meaning of their own—in other words, they form acrostics.

language, the successive pulsations of the said metre.” Literature in Arabia sprang from the desert; not from the towns. Poetic inspiration was ascribed to possession by the Jinns, mischievous spirits that inhabit solitary places. The Jinn inspired in the poet the idea of bantering the enemy of his tribe, with the underlying thought that the satire would do the foe harm, would *■ hoodoo ” him in fact, as it was repeated in the camps from mouth to mouth,
THIS belief in the destructive force of satire and cur^e was particularly strong at one time in Ireland, whose ancient literature is full of allusions to the power of Incantations made by fa~
mous bards. There is the classic instance of King Cahir, who lost hie throne because a wicked nephew caused " blemishes " to appear on his face by the power of his satire. A blemished King had to forego nis rule. Other poets exercised grievous tyranny over chieftains and their vassals by threatening to satirize them if they dared to resist the seizure of women and cattle or the quartering of the poet's nmowers on their clan.
Many parallels between the ancient Irish and Arabic tales will be noted by the folklorist. The famous combat between Cu-ehulifn and his son by the Scottish enchantress Aoife is found in the Romance of the Bcnihitftl. The coal-black son of the Princess Al-Khudru, daughter of the Sharif of Mecca, is about to slay his father, whom he has met in battle, when the mother interferes and explains the situation This is the Sohrab-Rustem epi-rod** in thf* ShAh-Nama of the Persians.
