He it was, also, who wrote “ Naught venture naught have;** though John Heywood wrote practically the same phrase. And Shakespeare's “ Fast bind, Cost find” ("The Merchant of Venice”) is the equivalent of Tusser's earlier “Safe bind, safe find,** applied by him to the hanging of clothes to dry on washing day.
We all Know that Mr. Kipling's reading been extensive and richly varied. He a literary fondness for the occult, the cryptic and remote. He also loves the melody and majesty of the Elizabethans and the translators of the .King James Bible. He has so developed bis natural gifts tbat he has become a positively great artist in the use of words, while his powers of observation seem now clearer and more comprehensive than ever before.
KIPUING AND TUSSER.
IN reference to the current entertaining and informing dispute in our columns of correspondence relating J to the form of the indefinite article in j the title of Mr, Kipling’s delightful • story in the August Century, ** An Hab-ltatlon Enforced,” one of our esteemed I readers writes as follows;
As you print " Cunctator*s” pugnacious letter, with its elaborate quarreling on a point where no quarrel can possibly lie, 1 am made a little uncertain as to whether dr not you have noted that Mr. Kipling’s title is borrowed from Thomas Tusser. I do not know what 49 An Habitation Enforced ” may be, but venture the guess that it is the description of the farmhouse in " Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry."
No. Our correspondent may rest assured that we had not noted that the much-discussed title was borrowed, from Tusser. This failure is explained by the fact that, in common with most of our fellow-men in the present day, we have never read Tusser. Indeed, we have a vague feeling in regard to his works that. If they should ever come our way, we would be compelled to plead guilty, with the author of “ The ■ Etonians,” to an Inability to wade through Tusser." (Vide Allibone.) But Tusser to us has been a sealed book, though he has been likened to Virgil and Hesiod, is one of Fuller's Wor- : thies, and is mentioned agreeably by i Charles Knight in the biographical portion of his once widely popular edition ! of Shakespeare.
I Perhaps one ought to have got a tip
about Tusser from the fact that Mr.
Kipling uses as the motto of/his story
these lines attributed to the Eliza-
j bethan poet and proverb-maker:
! My fri-end, if cause doth wrest thee j Ere folly hath much oppressed thee,
Far from acquaintance kest thee,	|
Where country may digest thee, * * * Thank God that hath so blessed thee. And sit down, Robin, and rest thee*
i Thomas Tusser was born in Essex about 1515, and died In London, prob- i I ably in the ninth decade of the six- I ; teenth century. According to Fuller's I Worthies he was successively mu si- ,
' cian, schoolmaster, serving man, husbandman, grazier, post. He failed at farming, but “ laid down excellent rules In his ' Book of Husbandry and Housewifery,' (so that *he observer thereof must be rich,) in his own defense." His book is said Vo be pervaded by i “ morality, piety, and benevolent sfm-
\
ptictty." Of his poetry as poetry slight- | ing words have been written. But a modem critic has said of It that the scansion of his lines was remarkably correct according to the pronunciation . j of his day. Let us remember, also, of j Tusser that *ve owe to him many *' fa- | miliar quotations 1 besides “ an habi-I tation enforced (to be ** familiar '* from this time forward,) if, indeed, we owe that phrase to him, as our correspondent declares. He it was who wrote:
At Christmas play and make good cheer,
For Christmas comes but once a year.
