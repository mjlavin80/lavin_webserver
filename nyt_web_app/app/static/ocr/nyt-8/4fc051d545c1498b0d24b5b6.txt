I/THOUGH more than forty -years ■ have- now . passed since the war between the States came to an end, though times have changed and manners and the spir-? it ;both of the world and the Republic, ft:is still possible, here and there, to- come fn contact with the special note and tone of that society which flourished in the South before the war, j and which gives tlw history of those j days its peculiar aspect. Especially j are there certain cities in the South I . where one may by good fortune hear the discourse of grave and gracious old men who helped to bear Calhoun to his grave or joined in cavalry charges under Hampton, who prayed with Jackson and surrendered with Lee. And no one who has not heard such discourse, or read at least, with eymr^thy and understanding the more personal records of that time, (the liquid, elegiac prose, for instance, in which William Henry Trescott of South Carolina mourned over the lost cause,) will quite catch the special charm, the poignant aroma of the memoirs of Mrs. Louise Wigfall Wright.
It is a matter of course that Mrs. Wright is thoroughly “ unreconstructed.” The fortunate days of life ended at Appomattox; the negrro of to-day is a degenerate savage compared to his slave ancestor. Whoever is offended at these things will miss the charming human quality which makes ** A Southern Girl in ’61 " so excellent a piece of literature aside from its not inconsiderable historical value.
It is not easy to rate too highly the value as material for the future historian of such books as this of Mrs. Wright’s. Not, to be sure, to the barren chronicler of sieges, battles, measures, or Administrations, but to the historian of vital human things. The history of American civilization has n£>t yet been written; perhaps it is not yet time to write it. Meanwhile, however, the accumulation of such records as this will prepare the way. The uniqueness of the civilization of the old South, insisted upon so often, actually understood so rarely, will appear from a study of them.
It*is not the outward show and circumstance of that life as described by Mrs. Wright and her fellow-chroniclers that is unique and so significant. It is the spirit of the society of the old South which strikes the student with ever-increasing wonder the more intimately it is communicated to him. All preconceived notions of modernity, of normal progress, of the well-defined spirit of the nineteenth century, must be left behind here. For here was the staggering anomaly of a race of splendid, wrongheaded, chivalrous, altogether delightful and altogether absurd men, stranded, by some queer mood of fate, upon the barren	shore of an industrial	and
sordid but	clear and far-seeing	age.
i	They went	down in the conflict,	but
their memory is an exquisite and pa-possession.
Note the characteristics of the figures so clearly defined in Mrs. Wright’s pages: Davis and Benjamin, Jackson and Johnston and H»od, Longstreet, Hampton, Lee, and her own father. Senator Wigfall of Texas. What men these were! What generosity, courage, patriotism, endurance, what spirit and eloquence, what dignity under misfortune'. Yes, but, on the other hand, what complete Inability (upon this point all records and impressions are unanimous,) to reason, to think in terms of political or historical science; what fatal and incorrig-ibfe self-delusion! To this impression the new and interesting letters from Confederate leaders printed by Mrs. Wright contribute.
But Mrs. Wright’s book is even more valuable as a chronicle of society in the narrower sense of that term, and of the peculiar social conditions that obtained in the South during the war, especially toward the end of it. These men and women were not to be cast down. Upon the eve or at the end of disastrous battles, the tragedy of which they felt none the less keerly, they still found it possible to sustain, taking their tattered raiment and un-delectable supplies with fine ftood hu-
mor, something of their former howpi-. tality, of the ease and grace and lightness of their social life. And more than any 6ther group or class or generation of Americans they seem to have had what Matthew-Arnold was fond of calling the gift of social life and manners.
Of especial interest as epitomizing in many ways ali these characteristics and others, of the old South, are the letters which Halsey Wigfall, Mrs. | Wright’s brother, wrote from comp to j the various members of his family. He I w&s, like so many of the combatants ! on both sides, a mere lad, but very ma- , ture intellectually. The letters ui'erweH written, .humorous, with good literary reminiscences. The young man was evidently cultured and thoughtful and refined. But here, too, comes the note of fierce prejudice, of inability to think closely or see clearly. No dou'»t he grew~T5 be just such another fiery ci'd unreasoning gentleman as. his father, regretting, perhaps, that he couid iiot equal the latter’s record as a duelist. Admirable and	wrong-headed—with
these words one closes all such records and documents.
It is, however, its unusual literary quality that forms the most immediate appeal of “A Southern Girl in ’Hi.” Mrs. Wright has lightness and Met of literary manner, simplicity and freshness and ve**ve. Sometimes **ven more than this, as when, in a few words, rhe sums up the attitude of the South to Mr. Jefferson Davis. She says:	He
may have erred; but when the letters were placed upon him the Southern people forgot everything but that he was their first and only President." There is a fine use of restraint h«^r€— Mrs. Wright’s rarest quality, (even though it does not appear throughout her pages,) and one that is shown especially in her closing paragraph. She tells us how, when all hope was at an end, and'Appomattox no longer a rumor but a fact, she awaited her brother:
One evening, about dark, I was standing at the gate, watching dewn the road, with hardly a thought or hope of his appearing, when, far up the dusty highway, I saw him coming. He walked slowly, unlike the brisk step I knew of old; absolute dejection was in his mien, and he had no joyous greeting to give me. His uniform was worn and soiled, and he had taken from his collar the gold stars of his rank. Somehow I had no word to say. We stood and looked at each other. Finally we found speech, and to my query: '* What are you going to do? ” he answered, “I am on my way across the river to join Kirby Smith.” I laid my hand upon his shoulder, and paused a moment. “ Have you not heard," I said, " Kirby Smith has surrendered.**
To this picture and to these ■words nothing need be added. They are entirely beautiful and pathetic. It is a pity that Mrs. Wright has thought it necessary to spoil their impression by adding finally a number of very mediocre and rather strident stanzas on the Confederate Flag, stanzas that are poor as poetry and gratuitous as history.
But not even a tag of poor verse— and fewer things are more annoying than poor verse—can rob ** A Southern Girl in ’61 ” of its literary quality or historical value, its pathos, and Its fine humanity.	L.	L*.	^
