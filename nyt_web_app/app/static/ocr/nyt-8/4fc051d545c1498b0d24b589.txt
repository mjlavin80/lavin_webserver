, THE BUSHMAN.
|	=33=3
A Study of the Almost Extinct Pigmy Races of the D^ark Continent-*
H1LE a study of the Bushmen of South Africa may be of , little immediate utility, yet in time its value will undoubtedly be made manifest. In behalf of future students, there- j Tore, we thank the late Mr. Stow i and the still living- Mr. Theal for j their work on the Native Races of South Africa. Despite its broad title, the book is really, as we have suggested* a history i of the Bushmen, the now almost extinct i tribe of dwarfs that used to inhabit the southern end of Africa, the present Cape
Colony, and ihe recent Dutch republics, j It was prepared by Mr. Stow, who went to Africa in IS4J* in the seventies; his in-trociuction is dated 188U. He died at a j	date nut gn	eh in the	book. The accuracy
of his	work	in genera/ is vouched for by
M iss	Lucy	Lloyd,	described as " the
greatest living authority on the Bush-mm," and by Mr. Theal, the editor. What In* says of the Bushmen, then, can be accepted probably correct, and as forming a pr<ispt*c-ti\e]y valuable contribution
*	tn the ethnology of South Africa.
1 Mr.	Stow	believes	that the Bushmen
must have “ gradually worked themselves through a really unoccupied country, and that they were the primitive inhabitants of Southern Africa, and the forerunners 1	of every	other race, a	conclusion	which
I	is upheld by the most	ancient traditions
1	of every	intruding tribe	now found	in the
southern	portion of the	continent.’*	From
his study he decides that the Bushmen's language. artistic talents, and physical ehaiacU-risiics have closer affinities to Some of tne northern races than to those of the n^sTO type.” Mr. Stow further divides the Bushmen into two distinct sec- * tmns. painters and sculptors, which entered South Africa by two different lines, the sculptors moving through the centre of the continent, the painters along the west coast, and turning and moving northward until they occupied the whole of the ^nulhern end of the continent.
Itit11 comparatively recently, the Bushmen were considered a harmless set of bvings, who “ frequented the colony openly. bt-ffffcd :md stole, and were troublesome. just us the Kafirs were afterward.*’
A. an unnamed time, however, the invading races of Kafirs. Dutch, and English m-vd.-d th«.- territory they occupied, and "arove them back. Naturally, the Bushmen retaliated as they could, slaughtering; eatth'. killing Isolated settlery, making forays and destroying what they could n<H f'nrry away. The Dutch, and. seemingly, the Knglish, then adopted a policy of f*xt ^rmi nut ion, which hits almost ex-tinguish**d the interesting survivors of ll*Todutus's pigmies.
Nomadic as they were, and widely scatter^ by the whites and Kafirs, the Bush-m*-n, according to Mr Stow, had a form of go'crnment. Their race "was evidently at unr time divided into a number of large tribes* occupying tolerably well-defined tracts of country; these tribes were again dh ided, although they had but one chief, who was looked upon as paramount over the whole territory belonging to the trfbe. The subdivisions were under the guidance of lesser captains, who posses***^ almost uncontrolled authority over their respective kraals." They were extremely loyal to their chiefs, whole tribes frilling to a man rather than desert their leader in trouble.
Their domestic life was happy. Their family feeling was strong, a man had seldom more than two wives, and widows wf*re cared for, and received their share of food exactly as if their husbands had been living [t was noted that whereas j the dog^ and domestic anlinais of the Kafirs and other natives were always in poor condition, those of the Bushmen were fat and sleek- an interesting evidence of the kindliness of their masters.
Mr. Stow describes at length the habits of th* Bushmen, their weapons and Implements, their methods of hunting, their social customs, their amusements and games, their - musical instruments, and their burial customs. Marriage was a matter of affection with Them, not of barter or chase, though daring the wedding ceremony " the young man catches hold of his bride; her relations at once set on him with their * klbls/ or -digging stacks. ■ and the young fellow must hold his bride fast and receive all the hammering without letting his treasure escape "-evident- j ly a survival of the time when men stole their wives.
A favorite game among the toen was ^ to fight friendly duels with poisoned ar- : rows. *" Sometimes they sat upon the ' grottrfd opposite to each other, and then with the greatest coolness a simple tn- ; cli nation -of the head or a rapid twist of
