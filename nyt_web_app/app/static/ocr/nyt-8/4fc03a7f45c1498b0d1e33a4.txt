C. K. S. In The Spftere.
I suppose the literary event ot last week was the sale or Shakespeare Quartos at ; Sotheby's. This really arose from a Ipan ; exhibition of the Bucks Archaeological , Society, which took place at Aylesbury on ■ July 5, occasion on which a speech was > made by Lord Rosebery. The Bucks society sent around applications for loans in i all directions to make this exhibition of
■	interest, and one of the circulars sent j | to Mrs. Herbert of Havenfield Lodge, , I Great Mlsseii-ien, led to the turning out
3	of +hiq tragedy of ** King Richard IIL,"
I which was duly sent to the exhibition I and was marked " No. 74 " in the cata-I logTie, whereupon its rareness was demon-I strated to all men, and it was sold for I the sum of £1,750.
| Naturally other residents in Bucks be-I gan to look into their treasures, and a I Mr. George Carrington of Missenden Ab! bey remembered that he was the possess-I or of five quartos. In writing to The I Standard he says that these five were I always " treasured ” In his library, and I he claims that the sixth, this very copy | of " Richard III-/’ once belonged to his I family and *' disappeared from the library I while the house was let between 1B64-74."
1 It would be interesting to know what I tbe Herbert family, who have just re-I celved £1,750 for this copy of “Richard I III-.” have to say to Mr. Carrington’s j § statement. I presume they have some I record of having made the purchase.
I Meanwhile one cannot think very much 8 of Sir- Carrington's public spirit, if he I really knew that the five Shakespeare I quartos were in his library, In that he did 1 not lend them to the Bucks exhibition as I Mrs. Herbert did. The overwhelming I probability is that neither of the owners I of the Shakespeare Quartos had the I slightest	as	to	their	value, and
I had one of the entercrlslnc booksellers
I who do sucn things chosen* to advertise 5 in any Bucks newspaper he could prob-I ably have got the whole sir quartos for I about £50, or even less; whereas the five’
1 auartos owned by Mr. Carrington actual-8 lv fetched £2,850, and .the total sum paid I for the six quartos, not oaa of which IJ 5 believe had previously been or the slight- 3 i est' value la the eyes of its owner, was 5 1	£4,600.	*	*	•	•	-	'■' -	‘	‘	'
