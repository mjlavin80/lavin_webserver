The President Ucged to Lend His Aid to a Movement for the Reform of the Language.
Neio YorJ: Times Saturday Review of Boobs;
EBMINGLY Insignificant causes may sometimes stir' the mind to earnest thought, nay; even to the public expression of ideas which have for years been carefully under guard within the hidden recesses of our consciousness. The discussion in The New York Times Book Review of the last 'ew weeks of the ques-questlon whether the letter " h ” is a consonant or “ only ** an aspirate, or rather of the problem whether there is in reality any reliable authority to determine In what case it is the former and in which case the latter has stirred in me once more to its very depth the realization of the chaotic, I may almost say seml-bar-baric, condition, in which the English language continues Its lawless existence. Although as a naturalized citizen of an English-speaking country, I feel that a modest hesitancy ought to moderate the expression of my true opinion regarding the language of my adopted country, the keenness of my desire to see human Institutions improved to the standard of modem culture, and the sincere interest I
take in all those elements which contribute toward the progress of civilization in general, prompt me to overthrow that hesitancy which would perhaps be most becoming, and to state my views of the subject under discussion, openly, candidly, and without fear of criticism:
The spoken language of any nation is its language proper* When we exclude the ever-changing dialects of the careless and the ignorant and limit ourselves to the language of those people of higher culture whose capacity for linguistic discernment is most pronounced, we find in a nation's spoken language a permanent asset, here and there enriched by new words coined by poets and scientists, on the other hand subject to the elimination of other words which gradually become obsolete.
The written language of any nation is naught but a means of long-distance communication, in the same way as written music is simply the means of communicating certain notes, measures, and cadences.
Tiie perfect method of representing the soft strains of a charming melody on paper, as we know it to-day, cannot have been attained without serious difficulties. It necessarily took the efforts of successive generations to mold the first crude endeavors in this direction into a faultless system. If finally there had been no agreement upon certain strict and consistent rules for the conveyance of musical compositions, the communication of
a melody by meuns of pen or print would
have been well-nigh impossible, and would often have been likely to reduce the work of the most gifted composer to the eventually insipid interpretation of the first best manipulator of a musical instrument. In fact, one easily realizes that melodies might thus have become unrecognizable when compared with the original composition. The result would have been a musical anarchistic chaos.
Just as the song of tho nightingale fs the nightingale’s language, oven so is the language of man the song of man. There seems to be no reason why no serious effort should be made to introduce rules just as strict and consistent for the reproduction in writing of the human song called language as for those other songs which fall under tho heading of melodies. I realize, of course, that there is nothing new in this remark.
Foreign countries whose written language was at one time as devoid of consistency as is the English language to-day have long ago taken important steps toward this laudable gWal. Germany, Holland, France, Italy, Spain, have little by little improved their system of spelling by the periodic appointment* for this specific purpose, of literary committees under the auspices of the Government. These committees have ever seriously devoted themselves to the task set for them, with the result that the rules laid down have become nearer and nearer perfected, until, especially in Spain, there can nevermore be any doubt as to the-pronunciation of a written word, nor regarding the manner In which a given sound Is to be conveyed in writing. It is admitted that not all languages lend themselves as easily as others to this systematizing process.
It is possible that English, with Its great diversity of vowel sounds, presents more difficulties In this direction than any other civilized language. But. in the first place, this great diversity itselF may be largely due to local misinterpretations of Inaccurate methods of spelling, and, secondly, if the difficulties be indeed serious. there is all the more reason to place the task in the hands of a competent committee, whose decrees shall be law to ail the population. It Is true, efforts of the kind, have been made by private bodies who have since some time been introducing a few relatively unimportant changes, unfortunately not carried out to their full consistency. But as yet even these few changes were adopted almost exclusively by those who themselves made the effort to introduce them, while the population at large seems wholly indifferent, and sleepily continues the old-time lawlessness.
Grammar, and especially tho spelling of words, is one of the first branches to which the young scholar’s attention is directed. In France, Holland, Germany,
Italy, ' Spain ' there-. Is zaroused^ih. the -young, a$ Inseparably connected with .this first mental effort, the element ot consist- • ent discernment, of logical'reflection, the-very element that by all pedagogues^ Is deemed the most important toward devel-•oping the child Into a thinking being. On the other hand, ki the present.** state of written English, spelling Is a matter of memory purely and simply. In v/hicb/ hot only consistency is totally lacking, but in which even contradiction upon contradiction is forced upon the abused brain' j of the growing child. Although the practice of memory may be. ilroportant in, it- ( self, it can only be of truly educational importance, if consistent reasoning power be developed In harmony with. It, pr, to say the least, IE It be not catered to at the expense of logic. Though memory | may make us know and remember numerous loose facts, it is logic that must make us think.
The English, with their almost stubborn conservatism, and wfth their slowness to adopt the suggestions implied in the methods followed by foreign countries, have thus far neglected to give thl3 problem the attention which it a hundred | times over deserves. Let the English ad- i here to the ways ot the English. But I why should progressive America be just as conservative as the Britishers, at the expense of an educational element of un- j deniable value? Would it be unconstitu- I tional to appoint a Government committee for the improvement of our written language? Or would it really be impossible to get the politicians in Congress to occupy themselves with so ** advanced." a subject? Would, indeed, a law passed by Congress be at all necessary? It would seem, since we have at present in the Presidential chair a man not only of strong literary inclinations, but who at the same time possesses the backbone and make-up of the warrior in a good cause, that the moment is now especially favorable for an agitation, the management of which may safely be intrusted to our newspaper editors, who will undoubtedly find our literary men in general ready and willing to aid them.
My suggestion may be one oft repeated, but it seems at this moment especially opportune.
