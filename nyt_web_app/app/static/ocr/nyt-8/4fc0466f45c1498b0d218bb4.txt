O	man without understanding could ever have put into a book such admirable women and such a fine dog as those which live and breathe ; in the dream village of Little Ar-cady. Lovers of little children must take Mr. Harry Leon Wilson to their hearts after reading his new novel, and all who have learned the precious consolations of the game of solitaire; lovers, aa well, of the true romance whose garment’s hem even we machine-made moderns may sometimes touch; folks who like old manners, old furniture, old servants, and such as, being themselves prone to doubt, yet see the loveliness of faith—lovers, again, of charity and quaint jests, and of true things finely said.
That is a deal to grant to any writer of books, but Mr. Wilson deserves it. He has written good stories before; he has sHcwn before that he grasped certain vital things of American life, the workings of the crude social yeast in " The Spenders,*' the strugglings of the modern soul out of the hard shell of stiff old creeds in " The Seeker.' Now the keen observation of American social characteristics wh^ch marked " The Spenders " for a “ bost seller " and the insight into tho ment ill and spiritual processes attendant upon our National growing up, our passing from village provincialism to wider, if not better, views, which made “ The Seeker" too serious a book for most people—these two things are melted and fused by a kindly philosophy into a mellow and consistent romance. This romance loses none of its romantic quality for being modern, none of its modernness for being romance.
Mr. Wilson's story is not without its faults, of course. It will not please all the people throughout or some people even in spots. But it is p. fine thing of its kind, and will please many, the pleasing of whom is worth a man's time and trouble. For the novel’s plentiful sentiment is made wholesome by its intellectual sanity and its jeers are chastened with charity.
Mr. Wilson writes of an Illinois village just before and just after the Great War, of a shy boy who adored a schoolgirl with two yellow braids tied with scarlet ribbon, of another boy who was not shy, of a marriage and a going-away to the stricken field with a sad little miniature inside a blue coat. He writes of the return or £ol. J, Kodney Potts's heir of ** the Greek spirit," Rabelaisian Potts, who had his one glorious day of ambrosial drunkenness; of Solon Denny, who was the local editor and Boss of Little Arcady; of Westley Keyts, who was butcher there, and Eustace Eubanks, who sang blameless bass; of the sisters of Eustace, and of local tastes in furniture. He writes of Billy Durgin, bootblack and boy detective. He writes of black Clem*-' who came from Virginia, and was ** Miss Cah*line's pus’nal property,” in spite of the Emancipation Proclamation. He writes of “ Miss Caroline herself, who came from Virginia also, and about Miss Caroline’s daughter, Katharine Lansdaie. ! Finally, he writes about Jim, a setter j dog. unspoiled by training, a dog blessed with faith perfect and immortal.
Of the story we reveal no more. But that you may not have to take our word for it and know for yoarself how finely Mr. Wilson says some true things, this is the word of the schoolboy looking from afar off at the little girl with yellow braids, scarlet tipped, and the other boys i crowding about her:	j
It was then I perceived for the first time that the world was too densely populated,
I saw how much better it would be If every one but she and I were dead.
And when the ripened hero stands In the presence of Miss Caroline—whose fifty years and all her griefs leave her still . eternally young:
Mere kneeling at her feet savored too nearly oT arrogance. I relt the need to be a spread rug in her absence.
Tbe hero, you see, Is a “ man' whose gift for self-fooling promised ably to survive his hair.’*

mother, she was of a marked slenderness: a completed slenderness, I might say—a. slenderness so palpably finished as to details that I can only describe it as felicitous in the extreme.
Finally this of a woman who for ten years had unjustly doubted and now learned the truth:
m
One who could doubt the tenth year as poignantly as she had doubted the first—would she not in bitterness regret her doubt ten other years, and sweetly mourn her lost love still another ten?
