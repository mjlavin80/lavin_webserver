May Sinclair, Author of “ The Divine Fire,” and Her Literary Relationship to Geprge Eliot- *
Kcic York Times Saturday Review of Hook#:
HE fact that thr-'o are other countries besides one's own somewhat mitigates the asperity of the Scriptural adage concerning prophets. For what does it really matter whether a prophet gets his appreciation five miles east or twenty-five hundred miles west of his native heath?
The genera! balance of appreciation and justice, moreover, is Cairly maintained if two countries will persist in honoring each other's dishonored prophets. And if by some happy loading of the celestial dice a prophet wins immediate honor both at home and abroad, the balance is again kept from being lopsided by another prophet who manages to achieve oblivion in his own and in foreign lands as welL Examples of the latter kind are too numerous to bear cataloguing; but of the former only a few instances may be given, and among them is the recent case of "The Divine Fire," which has evoked must enthusiastic approval on both sides of ihe Atlantic, though only half of the good things which might be said of the book have been said. For it is doubtful whether there has been anything finer than “ The Divine Fire " in English fiction since Geoige Eliot ceased to write unless we consider " Lady Rose s Daughter ” or ** The Marriage of William Ashe," ** The Mantle of Elijah " and ‘‘ \Juisant6 ” as rivals for that distinction.
Studicd alongside of any of George Eliot’s novels. one discovers a very strong resemblance between the psychological treatment of the characters of " The Di- j vine Fire " and the method used by the j former author. In other words. Miss Sin- j clair’s mind ^eems more psychologically akin to George Eliot’s than any other j Englishwoman who has followed her in the fit Id of romance. In her conscientious fidelity to tacts—however painful—in her sympathetic de\elopment of widely di! verse characters, in her ke^n sense of humor, and in her no Was keen powers of observation Mi.*s Sinclair proclaims herself a literary as well as a moral niece (if not a sister) of George Eliot.
If Miss Sinclair's book contained only two of her characters, Horace Jewdwioe and the Beaver, the author would have deserved well of h<-r country for the rare ' accuracy with which she has caught the
pusillanimity of the oneand the complacent emptiness of the other. For every nation his its Jcwdwines and Beavers, and merely as a text-book for Jewdwiue reviewers ** The Divine Fire ** establishes its raison d'etre. But when one considers what inspired illumination this book sheds upon the X-Y-Z-like nature of poeis and their loves and the A-B-C like nature of Beavers, one heartily admits that this is a case where the author not only deserves well of her country, but of any and all other countries that are fortunate enough to obtain her work.
