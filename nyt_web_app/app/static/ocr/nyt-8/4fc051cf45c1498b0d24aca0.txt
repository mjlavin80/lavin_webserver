| 7v’cjr Torfc Tii/ws Saturday Review of Jiookft: An American friend who is summering 1 in England lias sent me an excellent photograph of tho very beautiful bronze ! statue of Tennyson by George Frederic Watts, recently erected in the cathedral close at Ijincoln and unveiled on July 15. The poet stands as if pausing in his ramble with his favorite dog close beside him,
looking up into____his master's face with
earnest eyes. The familiar capecoat hangs in graceful folds almost to his feet, and in his right hand his soft hat is lightly held. The noble head, with its perfect profile, is bent and bared as before the mystery of the Infinite, while his gaze is fixed with rapt intentness upon a little flower lying upon his open palm, and the inscription Is this:
Flower in the crannied wall,
I pluck you out of the crannies;
I hold you here, root and all, in my hand, LUtle flower—but if I could understand What you are, root and all, and all in all, I should know what God and man is. Hudson, N. Y., Aug. 35, 1905. A. R. B.
