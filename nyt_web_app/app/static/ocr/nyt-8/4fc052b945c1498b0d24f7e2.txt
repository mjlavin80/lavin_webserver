Lacking though it is in the* gift
of words and the sustained power of- plot which sometimes transform a series of pen pictures of :life into life itself* this book of Mr. Jer-vey*s is astonishingly and microscopically true in its substance. No man who knows Southern life as It has been since the great war—Southern type£ manners, ways of speech and of thought—can fail to recognize here pretty much all that be has himself seen and lived. Certainly he must find In Mr. Jervey’s* pages men and women, white and black, whose faces, the very tones of whose voices, are perfectly familiar to him.
Somehow tbe crudeness of the author's method adds to the impression of faithfulness. You can see at once that you are dealing here not with a literary artist, but with a photographer of facts. . The author, having seen people as they were in the topsy-turvy period after the war, seta them down in' his book much as he saw them. He sees with their eyes, quotes their BpeecRgsp'describes their elections, race riots, court proceedings, ward meetings, social gatherings, and lovemakings; dwells upon their problems social and political, and through it all is exceedingly temperate and non-partisan. The chief trouble is that he has made his story too long for anybody but one already an interested student of Southern life to care to read it through. But he declares of his work that *‘ It is an attempt to show a condition—nothing more,” that it does not aim at dramatic or romantic effect.
To descend to particulars for a moment, The Elder Brother ” tells (quite without recrimination as to the Federal policy) the story, political, social, and economic, of a Southern city during the period of Reconstruction. The anonymous State in which the imaginary city lies seems (from the particular negro dialect used) to be South Carolina. But (apart from the dialect) the picture would be almost equally true, say, of a Virginia	town. The
stage fairly teems with	personages,
j There are first two brothers, of contrasted character and disposition—with contrasted careers also. There is the > carpetbagger	in all his	forms—the
worst of him (which was unspeakable) and the best of him, (which was almost admirable.) There is the rascally and disreputable Southern renegade, and man of his own hands—a freebooter pure and simple—there is the man of traditions who is making the best-of it, and the self-made man and Ihe unprejudiced	Dutchman	assisting.
There is also the inevitable Micawber-like ne’er do well—him you will find bearing a good old name and allowing a large family of children to grow up in neglect in every Southern town and county. There is that other aristocratic product, the good fellow who is never serious and is quite indispensable in local society; there are several kinds of sturdy men who have made themselves, and pretty nearly all the types of the j negro—from Washington, the gentle- ! man’s servant, and Holbrook, a faithful and intelligent mulatto, dressed in po- | lice authority and doing his uniform credit, to the ignorant carpenter turned 1 buffoon lawyer and the pompous and i greedy black '* buck," who bullies and does jackal’s work for party managera
The women likewise. There's an old maid of ante-bellum training—one such at least every Southern man over thirty will remember in his own family. There’s the town belle, who is hearty. and wholesome and honest as can be, and not an *' aristocrat.” There’s the local lady of all the airs and lassitudes, and there is the preternaturally serious young woman who misses so much by being always perfectly cool and reasonable. $he ajso js a product (at second hand) of ante-bellum conditions—more exactly of the change in them.
In short, the book, if it is not a novel to carry the reader along—it is not that —is an exceedingly valuable, truthful, and interesting study. There is certainly no other picture of the period which approaches it in these vital points.
