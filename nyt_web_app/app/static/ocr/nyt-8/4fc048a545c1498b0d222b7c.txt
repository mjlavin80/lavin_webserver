Unwisdom of Hasty Charges of Plagiarism—Authorized Biographies of Two Cardinals.
OME time ago The Critic of this city published an article suggesting that Mrs.
' Katharine C. Thurston may have derived the idea of her extremely popular novel, “ The Masquerader." (called in | England 'John Chilcote, M. P..") from a story entitled “ The Premier and the Painter," , written seventeen years ago t)y Mr. Israel Zangwill. To that article the editor of The Critic prefixed a note expressing the editor’s belief that Mrs. Thurs- | ton was entirely guiltless of the sin of plagiarism- I The outcome justifies this opinion. This month The i Critic prints an answering letter from Mrs. Thurston which, as the editor says, dispels all doubts of the " originality of Mrs, Thurston’s plot and its working out," ** Originality ” is a large word, to be sure. As a matter of fact there is nothing particularly original in “ The Masquerader.” Its plot and its very situations have long been parts of the stock in trade of the romance makers* It is the author’s gift of story telling that makes the old materials serviceable. Of course, the idea that the author of a novel so well received els " The Circle " was would deliberately filch the plot, environment, and characters of a story by so prominent a writer as Zangwill is preposterous. Plagiarists do not work that way. Everybody who knows much of the writer’s craft will believe Mrs. Thurston when she declares that she never saw a copy of Mr. Zangwill's “The Premier and the Painter M and that the story was never mentioned in her hearing until The Critic's article was published. Charges of plagiarism are easy to make. Every newspaper receives many communications embodying such charges from irate, well-meaning persons who cannot be made to understand why the Editor does not immediately lend all his resources to their cause,
? Frequently men and women of the highest literary
I	standing are thus ruthlessly assailed.
