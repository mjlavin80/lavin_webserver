A. Language Re for m
Neio Forft Time* Saturday Review of Bootes:
Without doubt the suggested difference between the spoken and the visible word made by Mr. Calisch (Aug. 19, Page 540.) deserves immediate attention. But the psychological moment for so much more is so evident at Portsmouth, N. H., as well as Oyster Bay, that It is to be hoped it will not be allowed to pass without receiving its full meed.
It was a favorite remark of my privat-docent at Berlin that, language being divine, philology was next to theology. This is absurd. There is not a shadow of doubt in my mind that the ** tri-literal verb '* of the Semitic language is as human as the Morse code. I coined “ ocu-lage" to distinguish the appeal to the eye from that to the ear; which even then should be aurage, not language. The lingual part is not even the most important in many forms of utterance.
■	When a nation bursts its provincial Lbonds and its officials have been born out of hearing of the mother tongue of the political metropolis, it must adopt an ** oculage." It was done on the Euphrates and the Nile. There Is more than one “ ballon d’essai ” launched by me to ascertain whether the currents of air were favorable. So far as I am aware they lead an ephemeral existence. But if President Roosevelt, recognizing that he is the Chief Executive of a nation which contains, or at any time may contain, representatives of any speech under the sun, should take, as a popular basi3, the international code of signals and give it an imperial stamp there is no doubt of success. In a fugitive piece I described a sermon preached in Tien-Tsin from the masthead of the flagship of the American Admiral, and translated into a score of languages on the decks of the allied ships.
Tn its more concrete form It was a proposal for an International Congress of Orientalists, who would draw up, In Washington, on a scientific plan, such rules for the combination of certain signs as would put the East and West in communication, without disturbing the limited relations ot speech. If such an international code were known as the Code Roosevelt it would be a far more enduring .monument than that code of laws which suggests the title.
