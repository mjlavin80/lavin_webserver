.Yctr York limes Saturday Review of Books:
To those of your correspondents who have been disturbed by Kipling’s use of "an” in the titlf*. "An Habitation EnI forced,” let me suggest a corresponding usage in the Bible, j	In JCph. ii.,	they	will	find the ex-
pression, “ An habitation of God,” Also,
I for examples of “ an ” before other ** h '*
I sounds, let them compare. Second Chron. vi.. J, “an house of habitation"; Second Cor., v.,	1,	V an house not made with
hands”; First Sam., xvi.. 1G. "cunning played on an harp*'; Job vii., 1, "like the days of an hireling"; Luke i., 69. “ raised up an horn of salvation."
