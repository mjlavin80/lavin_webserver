The special Summer Number of The International Studio is being hurried through the press by the John Lane Company. It will be a thick quarto volume entitled " Art in Photography,” and will contain a large number of selected examples of European and American work in photography. An introduction has been written for it by Clive Holland. He describes the work of the better known pic-torialists in Great Britain such as A. Horsley Hinton. Charles Job, George Davison, Alexander Keighley, Charles Moss, Dan Dunlop, Mr*>. Dumas, and many others, and French and Belgian “ schools." He also speaks of the “ art ” generally, touching on the tone values. Mr. Holland wries:
*	• • Many of the most prominent and successful workers In Great Britain have recognized that at the outset the extreme plctorialists, who were many of them willing to sacrifice everything to effect and for the attainment of a resemblance to painting, were, in fact, checking the truest and sanest development of their art. That, indeed, greater success and greater honor would be achteved by a less close following of the art of painting as practiced at the present time. • * * As in a monochrome drawing tone values and a good range of them constitute with -symmetrica] form the chief charm and elements of success, so in a photograph for it to be well and suitably printed and the original negative perfectly exposed with a long range of tones will prove the best factors' in obtaining success. • • • The limitations of photography as regards 'the rendering of color, and the fact that the elimination of the superfluous Is not easy of accomplishment, prevent it, at ail events at. present, being considered on the same plane as painting, or gaining its chief successes in ‘ a similar way or by identical methods.
Other essays will be on America, by, Charles H. Caff in; Germany .and Austria-, Hungaryr. by A. Horsley Hinton, and Italy, by^ Dr. Enrico - Thovez. A variety of processes have been employed in the reproduction of the photographs:;’ Examples are given, also, of some .color photographs taken direct from Nature. Each picture has been mounted, and placed on a page by itself. There are landscapes, marine studies, portrait studies, Interiors, &c.	.	...
