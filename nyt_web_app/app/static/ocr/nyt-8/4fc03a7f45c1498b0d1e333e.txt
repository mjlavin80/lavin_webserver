In this book Carveth Read, M. 'A.. Fro-' fessor of Philosophy of Mind and Logic' in University College, London*.* has attempted to discriminate the characters of-truth and error; to collect and exam In? the grounds upon which philosophers have endeavored to justify their convictions or their scruples; and to inquire whether, or how far, belief Is, or may become, co-extenslve with reason. Ir^-hls Introductory chapters he considers belief and "knowledge and reality and truth. Then follow chapters on skepticism, the relativity of knowledge, ontology of the i ,world, universal forms of phenomena, and , psychology. He says in his opening para-I graph concerning the scope of philosophy:
I Some regard It as no more than the or' ganizatlon of the sciences; that further 1 content is unattainable has been shown, they say, by experience of repeated failure and by reflection upon the nature of the case. According to others there are prescientific beliefs that still have a necessary place In human life; and, even If no definite predications can be made outside the circle of the sciences, still the grounds of the sciences themselves must be examined. and their claims to be a comprehensive and sufficient explanation of the course of the world and ot human experience must be vindicated. Tnese opposing doctrines may conveniently be called the positive and the critical. To me It seems that, when reasonably stated, they are not opposed, but that both are necessary and complementary one to another.
The book will be published by the Macmillan Company In a week or two.
