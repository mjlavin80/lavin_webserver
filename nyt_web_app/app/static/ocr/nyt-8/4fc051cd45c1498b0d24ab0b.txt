}iew York Times Saturday Revietc of Books: One of your correspondents in criticising a recent poem by Edwin Ma.rkh.ain Bays, in reference to the praise of It by another person:	"He	[the writer! compares this
I?oem entitled ‘ Virgilia ' with Tennyson’s ' Maud.' * • * In my opinion the poem ts so full of faults and crudities that to compare it with Tennyson’s ‘ Maud ’ is nothing less than a capital offense.” Evidently this writer has a great admiration for Tennyson's Maud,” a poem which seems to me as near trash as any, thing of which its author, the great Poet Laureate, was capable. Thus I quote with gusto the following refrain, as expressing my own feelings;
\ ” Dismally dull, and dolefully dawdling.
Tennyson’s ‘ Maud ’ should be ‘ Tenny-- son’s Maudlin.* "	_
One	hear Edward FitzGerald be-
, moaning the fact that his friend Alfred would write such poor stuff, when he had the power to do things so grand.
I X fancy that I am not alone in the opinion that to compare any poem with the absurd sentimentality of Tennyson s •“	" is to praise it not at all.
