CHIEFLY TIGERS.
Capt. Glasfurd's Collection of Facti* and Fancies About Indian Wild Beasts.*
APT. GLASFURD is in some | sort the Thompson-Seton of the Indian jungles. That is, he is apt to lay aside the role of hunter, and, assuming the point of view and character of the hunted, to speak for his wild beasts autobiographically. AJso he makes his own pictures, and by his own confession mingles truth and fancy in his tales.
He has the grace to apologize in the beginning for writing another book about hunting In India—but he pleads In extenuation that his is not a record of great slaughter or an epic of personal exploits—that he has kept his own adventures in the background and dwelt rather upon the wonders of jungle scenery, the strange effects of midnight noises and silences upon the hunter up his tree or lying in his camp, the habits of Indian game, and some of the superstitions of the East which must more or less affect all who live in that land of ancient mystery. In other words, the author seeks to give a picture of India as it seems to the hunter with feeling and imagination—not as It may appear to tho man whose sole interest is in his bag.
The application of Thompson-Seton methods to the Indian fauna certainly produces in this seasoned sportsman’s hands a great deal of interesting material about the beasts he has shot at by night and day—bears, panthers, sam-bars, and, above all, tigers. There’s a j " Biography of a Tiger," which seems to combine truth and dramatic effect wonderfully well, and there are many stories of tiger shooting not better (or worse) than other stories of the same kind. Then Capt. Glasfurd tells about ** ghooming ” for bears. ’* Ghooming ’* (expressive word!) is, it appears, wandering around alone In the dark, and must be a queerish sport. However, after a night spent in this fashion, (and a bear slain.) you read how the Captain trailed back to his camp and fell asleep:
Perhaps I had slept half an hour when there was a quick thudding of naked heels on the hard ground, a , clinking of Jingling metal, and a grace- !

•RIFLE AND ROMANCE IN THE INDIA IV JUNGLE. A Record of Thirteen Years. By Capl. A. I. R. Glasfurd of the Indian Army. With numerous illustrations by the author and from photographs. 8vo. Pp. 404. New York: John Lane.
ful. upright figure swept by with long, jquick strides. An upward-curving brown arm, the dark silhouette of a big brass water pot poised aloft against the luminous eastern sky, where twinkled the morning star, and the figure was gone with Its retreating " clank-clank ” of barbaric anklets. Then more hurrying feet and clashing ornaments, as bevy on bevy of dusky Rebeccas went swiftly and silently down the path to the well. Scanty the water supply therein at this season, it was only the early birds among the village damsels who obtained their utensils full; therefore their hurry.
Clearly this hunter is no mere butcher of beasts! In another place, where he is writing of pig-sticking, he pauses to make a poem upon that ancient and honorable sport and quotes Dan Chaucer also in honor of the '* boare.*’
Among those stories whfcc£* are *' purely fanciful,” may bo Included, perhaps, two which concern rtie shooting of tigers. In one the quarry was an old man-eater, and as hunter sat in his tree and waited fear the murderous beast to come to the bait below he fell asleep. He waked with a touch
upon his shoulder, smelled a carrion stench, and saw a bandaged arm pointing. He shot the tiger and turned to find at his side—nothing!
The natives hinted at the ghostly presence of a sahib whom thp tiger had wounded and who had thereafter died of blood poison. In the other story an old sportsman takes about with him a box containing the stuffed skin of a Ghond—once his head beater—that box is a spell which attracts the striped cats. In this story also is mention of an old native woman—daughter or wife of the Ghond aforesaid. She came and crouched at the sahib’s feet. The sahib bade his servant give her a couple of annas and send her away. And the servant made answer:
She does not bog. hazur, but has ! been sitting there these two hours. She harkens not to any order. Dinner for the presence is laid at some distance—
I and also the easy chair. With aged I persons how shall argument be made? j If the presence himself would be pleased to give an order, the ancient will doubtless obey.
One of the stories relates a very wonderful adventure with a big sloth bear. (Melursus ursinus.) an animal held by some people, it seems, in very undeserved contempt. This bear attacked the author as he was passing along a narrow ledge above a precipice, and man and beast rolled over the side in close embrace. The man caught on a solitary bush that clung In a crevice of the rocks—rifle and bear rolled to the bottom.
Capt. Glasfurd declares that there is still big game in India, even for the sportsman of moderate means, and congratulates himself that the Indian Government is *' at last about to institute a game law to check the wanton destruction that has been going on for so many years.” Some of the stories he prints here wero published in India in a smaller volume a year ago.
