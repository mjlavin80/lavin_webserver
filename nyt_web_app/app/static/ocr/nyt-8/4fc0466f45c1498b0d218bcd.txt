HOUSE OF SAVOY.
Attempt to Make That Family’s Success Due to a Marriage of One of Its Members with a Granddaughter of Charles 1. of England.*
:E Marchesa Vitelleschi has produced an interesting work on an interesting period of European history. The House of Savoy was for centuries much like the Danish royal house of the present; It provided consorts for many of the Kings of Europe, Eleanor, wife of Henry III. of England, was of the Savoy family. Richard of Cornwall, titular King of Rome and Emperor, married a Savoy Princess, and its Princes married, In their turn, into the chief reigning houses. Finally— so far as this book is concerned—Victor
Amadeus II. married Anna Maria of Orleans, granddaughter of Charles I. of England. It is with this marriage, according to Mme. Vitelleschi, that the romance of the House of Savoy begins.
This French-English Princess was a possible heiress of the English crown after Queen Anne and the ** Old Pretender,” though her claim to the crown had no chance of being accepted by the English. But the connection possibly in later years brought about the British support of the throne of Anna of Orleans's great -grandson. The romance of the House of Savoy, however, has less to do with its Stuart connection than with the success of Victor Amadeus II. in raising his duchy of Savoy from a subservient position under the insolent protection of the King of France to an independent State worthy of the respect of the rest of Europe. Far more than this—he introduced cloth making and silk manufacture Into Piedmont, gave up two of his country seats that tobacco growing might be attempted on them—the experiment was successful; rebuilt the University of Turin and reformed its management, and increased the revenues ot the State very largely. He likewise won personal repute as a military commander.
The end of tbis successful King's life was not equal to Its earlier years. In 1728 his English-French wife died, and soon afterward he married a former mistress. Shortly after this second marriage he abdicated, and his son, Charles Emmanuel, became Duke of Savoy and King of Sardinia. The ex-King’s wife, however, was discontented, and in 1730 prevailed on her husband to try to regain his crown. The new King checkmated his father, however, took him prisoner, and kept him prisoner until his death, in 1732. The widow was sent to a convent, where she died thirty-seven years later, at the age of ninety.
STl'ART BLOOD IN SAVOY.
WHAT infinitesimal drop of Stuart blood remained in the veins of the |	rulers	of Savoy and Sardinia dis-
S appeared finally in 1831, when Charles Felix, tbe last male descendant of Anna Maria, died. The crown went to Charles Albert of Savoy-Carignano, descended from a collateral branch which had separated from the main stem two generations before Anna Maria of Orleans . brought her less than one-quarter part of the English blood royal to Piedmont, and from this King descends the present line of Dukes of Savoy, who became also Kings of Italy. There was a daughter of Anna Maria's great-grandson, however, who married and had children, and the descendants of one of these, Maria Theresa, Princess Louise of Bavaria, is the lineal representative of the house of Stuart. Some enthusiasts call her Queen Mary III. of England.
The Marchesa Vitelleschi. however, seems to think the connection between the British and Savoyard Courts quite close.
■	’* The connection between the Courts of Great Britain and Savoy and the mutual interests binding the royal houses of- those . * countries’* is the way she begins her preface, and she continues, in her first chapter: “ To no country" more than to England must the reminiscences of the princes of Savoy naturally appeal.” It is true that Charles H. evinced some avuncular interest in his niece, Anna Maria, ' but as the present house of Italy has ab-t sblufely none of the much-thinned Stuart blood in its veins, we. think that ^Mme. Vitelleschi’s wish is the father of her thought rattier than any .basis of fact Her wish, however, is merely another expression of the widely" spread'-idea that 4the British royal house is* English. It is ' true that the present Iting aSd his mother ^and his great-grandfather wVre born, on ' English soil,' but it is . also V iact Jthat it ^ is-about three centuries .since - one of the -ancestral Kings of^the-line married a wo-vman-jpne of whose	was ^English,
*	andivfurther/ that there~is rijbre French
royal blood In the veins of King Edward VII. than there Is English. He and his family are almost pure Germans and are English really only ex officio.
MME. VITELLESCHrS PURPOSE.
THIS of course is a digression, but it explains to some extent the reason for Mme. Vitelleschi’s attempt to magnify the importance to both English and Italians of her heroine, Anna Maria of Orleans. The rise of the House of Savoy is indeed romantic, but it is connected by the very thinnest line with even the long expelled House of Stuart.
Mme. Vitelleschi presents her case interestingly, however, even if not con-cluslvely, and with more reticence than \ most of those who write of Charles I. of j England as a martyr. “ The final coup by which all sentiments of humanity were violated took place on the 30th of January, 1649. The tragedy that made the Queen a widow and the children fatherless was the consummation of all the previous iniquitous actions of the regicides; ” so she writes in her first chapter; but she does not continue in the same strain. If she had not attempted to prove too mnch, to dwell too strongly on the importance to Savoy of its connection with the Stuarts, her book would have been more convincing. It evidences, however, much study on her part—she has had access to unusual sources of history; and it is noteworthy for the large numbers of portraits of the people mentioned by her. Of them it may be said in passing that one does not wonder that royalty was often so faithless. The only goodlooking person In the book is the mistress of Victor Amadeus II., the Con-tessa di Verrua.
