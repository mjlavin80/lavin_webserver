Tennyson's critics exclaimed, " Who ever heard of the night being divided by a shriek?” when they read that line in Maud:
The shrill-edged shriek of a mother divides ihe shuddering night.”
Even the flawless *' Garden Song.” from which be quotes in *’ Maud,” did not escape them.
The theme ot “ Virgilia ” is the same as that of the earlier ” Locksley Hall,” but the treatment is tender, mellow in comparison with the other, which tears its passion to tatters in language with full as much force as elegance. Our long idolatry of ’* I^oeksley Hall ” has warped ! our judgment of it.
Shall we not hear fr6m some of those t readers who have thrilled under the touch of " Virgilia ” and entered too deeply Into its spirit to endure its cold-blooded dissection without a pang?
Let those who mourn the decadence of poetry in these days sit in reverent silence before " The Haunted Temple.”
