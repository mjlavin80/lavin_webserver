LangxiQ^e and Poetry-
New Fork Times Saturday Rcvieic of Books:
It seems to roe that a man In order to be able to appreciate fully the value of the language of his own country must first of all truly love that country; for It Is such a love alone can give his soul the j power of feeling Its true sentiment- It appears impossible to me for an English- ; man, for Instance, to appreciate as he ought "Paradise Lost/' or " Childe Har- i old.” who has so little true feeling for his own country as to permit himself to go to a foreign one and fall so desperately in love with its language as to be able to see nothing but what is bad in his own. 1 ! I must modify the word ** love '* in this
I	latter case; infatuation In its worst sense Is nearer the meaning I wished to express.
| Again it seems to me that it is only real love of country that can bring forth poets and admirers of them, and that the first cannot succeed without the second Another thing; I am of the opinion that while rational invention and sense are requisite for the success of a poem, sound is of no small importance to the same end. Now, such being my opinion. I cannot come to any other conclusion than that a man who sees nothing good only in the German language, let us say, and who, it is to be taken for granted, has devoted himself to training his ear and tongue to it, can have no just appreciation for sound In any other one. Such a man is to me certainly not the one capable of deciding the question at hand for others.
I	have not the honor of having been bom a German, a Frenchman, or an Englishman. 1 would rather, though, have been born In the United States than in any other country save my own.
I	came from a land to which has been given by nature the gift of a sweet language, very well adapted for poetry, and
I	do not think I presume too much when
1	say I possess the qualification of distinguishing the difference between what is guttural and what is not so in other tongues. Now to me the endings of German words are not near as Soft and pleasing as are the endings of English words, whether in poetry or in music. In fact, such a comparison is all in favor of the English tongue. To my way of thinking, those hungry writers—hungry for want of subjects—who sixain their brains in giving creation to such stuff as “counting house language fit for Drill Sergeant's command words,” &c., and those other hungrier ones who quote them to express what their own brains cannot supply are to be put in the same class with those others who hold or affect to hold the same opinion in regard to American art.
