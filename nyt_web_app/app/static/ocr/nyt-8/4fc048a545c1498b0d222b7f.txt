Died August 24, 1770.
^/"HAT news In London? Why, the papers tell.
No matter great to-day of good or ill,
Save that the mail was robbed at Highgate Hill By a tall man who sat a black horse welL
O	City, robbed, unknowing what befell,
A youth has yielded up too light a breath To one who rides on the black horse of Death,
And thou art robbed of more than thou can'st tell!
Thy streets are robbed of a reproachful face,
A dormered room of dreams and visions wild.
Thy doors of hands that knocked at them in vain, Off ring thee what had brought you fame and gain— Even the untruthful fancies of a child.
Of which our after-years have seen the grace.
