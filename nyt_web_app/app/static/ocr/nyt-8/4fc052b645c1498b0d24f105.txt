Only an outline of the various styles of architecture and a brief discussion or their development are given in tho “Descriptive Handbook of Architecture,” by Martin A* Buckmaster, ARC.A., which
E.	P. Dutton & Co. will publish in this country. By *' architecture.” the author explains, .he means not a plain brick or stone wall, *• but a city wall with arch construction, ramparts, parape's, nnri gateways," for architecture is “ budding with design, purpose, and fitness. ‘ Nor does he consider such buildings as bridges, viaducts, &c., because usefulness alone is here considered, and they are reaJly works of engineering skill. Mr. Buckmaster writes:
Building is a natural development of man's mind from the earliest t*r,lc; evolved from a few simple e.enti*mary ideas, and arising directly out of sor:;n needs. It can only re«iKonabl ■ be called architecture when great ideas are .scientifically and artistically combined and carried out In due proportion. On the Art side the design and embell.sament, with ;tll the beauty and poetry tnat arose from tho embodiment of man s neens and thoughts, both social ani religious; and on the Science side the construction and setting out of the various parts or ms buildings accurately calculated fur their respective positions.
In his preface the author makes a plea for the study of historical architecture in the elementary schools, so that, from boyhood on, the young man who later turns to architecture as his vocation, may be acquainted with the methods of the ancient and mediaeval workers. He has chapters on ancient, classic, gothic, and renaissance architecture. A table has been inserted giving a synopsis of all the historical periods from ancient times to the present, in which the Influences of the various styles upon one another may be traced. There is also a glossary in which are small drawings of some of the objects defined, Besides these, there are sfxty-nlne illustrations in the text and seventeen plates, Including photographic reproductions of buildings, plans, drawings of different parts, &c.
