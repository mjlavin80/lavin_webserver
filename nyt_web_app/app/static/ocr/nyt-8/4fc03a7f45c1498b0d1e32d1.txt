j Mac York Times Saturday Review of Books:
■	In a recent issue of your book Review I it is stated by one of your readers that I the author of ** Moby Dick ” has been but now " discovered." Probably the writer was not aware (or maybe it was before his timo) that Herman Melville's " Sea Tales ” were written and popularized both in this country, and abroad, half a century ago, and have never been out of print. Four of them, including Moby Dick, are in the hands of a Boston firm, (Dana Estes & Co.) So appreciative a commentator, it is believed, will be glad to be reminded of the facts.

£Of course, this letter was written, as our readers will see, under a misapprehension. That one of our correspondents who “ discovered ’* Herman Mel- i ville through the aid of laudatory paragraphs in The New York Times Book Review used the word in a merely jocular sense. Wliat he meant was that he had begun to read Melville and liked him. DoubtTfess Melville’s books get many new readers every year, and he retains his old readers, for his books are worth re-read-ing.—Editor.]
