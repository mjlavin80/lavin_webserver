JTetr York Times Saturday Review of Bonks;
I noted in The Hew York Times Saturday REVIEW OF BOOKS of AUg\ 19 a brief comment on a " History of Hadley." Your review says that " Whalley died about 1074 and is supposed to have been buried in Mr. Russell’s cellar."
This supposition is far from correct so far as the place -of burial is concerned. Whalley’s grave, with that of another of the regicidcs—John Dixwell—is in the centre of “ the Green " in NewHaven, Conn., close to the jear wall of the Congregational Church on the “ Green,” or park. Rudely cut headstones of brown stone were placed to mark the graves, and still remain, though nearly sunk in the soilless than a foot above ground.
The only inscription visible is E. W. on one and J. D. on the other in large let-_ters, indicating that Edward Whalley and John Dixwell were burled there.
The descendants of John Dixwell have erected an appropriate monument and placed a fence around the little burial plot. The people of New Haven or of Connecticut should see that a suitable monument Is erected over Whalley’s grave. There was 'irnich Indignation among the people of New Haven when the British soldiery In possession of the town during the War for Independence desecrated the graves of these two regicides.
It would be worth while for strangers visiting New Haven to go across tho
Green " to view the hallowed spot.
