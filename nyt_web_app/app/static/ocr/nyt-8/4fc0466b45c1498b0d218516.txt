WE brin.gr to a close this week the prolonged discussion of the merits and defects of contemporary American poetry, in which a large number of our readers have participated, and which ! has developed, before the finish, into a controversy j about the verse of Edwin Markham. A continuance of the dispute would not help to a settlement of the question, and the arguments have become a trifle too personal. These hot weather controversies should always be impersonal. If a y^oet is to be discussed, he should be a dead poet. Mr. Markham is very mu:h a Jive. A contributor to The I^ondon Saturday Review has just Eugjrested an admirable subject for hot weather controversy, as an offset to the religious disputes readers of English newspapers are apt to indulge in. His Question is, “ Was ShaJcespearc a bad sleeper V ” He declares that the well-known lines in * Henry IV.* suggest the passionate longing for sleep which only those who have experienced the long-drawn misery of a ' white ni?ht * can feel.*' He finds “ the true wail of the insomnolent M in these lines from Sonnet XXVII.:
Weary with toil I haste me to my bed.
The dear renose for limbs with travel tired,
Gut then begins a journey in my head To work my mind when body's work’s expired.
