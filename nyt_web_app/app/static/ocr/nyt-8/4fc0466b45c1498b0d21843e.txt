Mr. Scarritt's chapter on automobile legislation is probably more valuable per se than anything that Mr. Sloss con-1 tributes; but if one cannot get Young s I book, he will find the present volume not j wholly without value, i _____________________________________

TO the person who does not own an automobile, the most interesting
part of this book will be Mr. Dave Hennen Morris’s introduction. ** Man wants physical individual transportation, says Mr. Morris; “ the steamboat and the railroad [train] have partially accomplished this; they carry their hundreds of thousands of passengers daily. But while man may go in them to the ends of the world, he must go with others, as one of a thousand, as one of a herd- The more one thinks of these conditions the more one is forced to the humiliating realiza- * tion that in the method and control of individual transportation there has been practically little advance since the days of the Greek runner or the Roman chariot. We still plod on at the same old rate o£ eight miles an hour, a speed equaled from the beginning of history by runners, , horses dromedaries, and elephants. At ) last the automobile has been invented, j Let us hope that It will emancipate us from the fetters that have bound us these , thousands of years, and will soon carry us over the entire face of the earth, an- I nihilating space and time at our wilL”
•	Mr. Morris describes the efforts made to regulate- the new monster **; how in ^ty it was required that a man with a red flag should precede a steam ma- . chine; then that only a licensed engineer should handle one; then that no automobile should enter a park. " It did not dawn in the minds of any one not an an-tomobilist that the automobile had legal rights, was entitled to consideration* or destined to become an Important part of street traffic."
All automobHlsts are not what they should be, Mr. Morris admits, hut the yellow Journals are largely responsible for the “ vicious desire ” to exterminate automobile users! “When once both sides admit that prohibition is Impossible, unreasonable, and uncommercial, and that Cair regulation Is possible, profitable, and necessary, the automobile problem will no longer exist.'*
