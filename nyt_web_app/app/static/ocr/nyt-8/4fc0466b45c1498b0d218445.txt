Weto York Times Saturday Review of Books:
“ Is it a waste of time to re-read a favorite book? M. asks ** A. M. F." of Brooklyn. This seems to me a question that-each,-Individual can best answer for himself. No- two people can ever read a book from exactly the same point of view. Eacli reader automatically weaves between thj; lines thoughts of the past or dreams oc the future which have been awakened by the sympathetic chords which the author has struck within him; and it largely depends on the number of chorda struck, how much we enjoy and profit by the book. Looking at the matter from a perfectly natural standpoint—that of evolutionary growth—even as we are ever enlarging our ideas, and adding to our store of memories, so we can never re-read a book with exactly the same emotions as before. Many heartstrings erstwhile silent will vibrate in sympathetic harmony with divers chords which the author has struck, and In so doing call forth an attendant train of thought. It is not the quantity of matter we read, but that which we assimilate, which does us the most good.
Some of the greatest writers that the world has eVer known—Shn.kespea.re. to wit—did not consider it a waste of time to re-read their favorites. Granted, owing to the paucity of books, it was sometimes a case of Hobson’s choice " with them, yet judging them by their fruits we certainly cannot feel that their time was misspent in re-reading their favorite books.
