WILD BIRDS
Mrs. Wright’s Opinion of Herrick’s Book About Their “ Home ^	Life ” Opposed.
Netc York Times Saturday Hec-ictv of Boot.?.*
FTER reading with much pleasure and profit the revised edition of Herrick’s ** The Home Life of Wild Birds ” and after being in* spaed again, as by the first edition of this unique work, I have just read the review of ibe book by Mrs. Mabel Osgood Wright in The New York Times book Review of June 17. and 1 beg leave to comment on the criticisms she advances.
Writers of popular books on animals, untrained in the modern biological labora* tory. may not understand the admirable technic of which Herrick's papers on the morphology of crustaceiuis show him to be a master, and so may fail to comprehend the biological significance of Herrick's work on birds, and be " very dubious as to whether many of the observations made are of any value save the gratifying of curiosity, which does not count/’
From Mrs. Wright s review we may infer:
U) That the book contains nothing original and very little of value.
01). That the conditions of observation are artificial and therefore the conclusions Illogical.
(3)	That the method is destructive.
(4)	That the portable tent has been used by others,
(0)	That very few of the illustrations rise above the level of mediocrity.
(1)	As t<3 originality; The whole method Ls so remarkably original that after Herrick's book appeared more than one ornithologist in effect said; “So easy! why didn’t I think of it before! " and immediately adopted the method.
As to results:	For the first time the
nest life of birds representing many species or families of the shy inland forms have been studied systematically hour by hour and day by day, with complete verbal and photographic records of every act performed, and also for the first time an exact analysis in the terms of instinct and habit or animal behavior was made of life at the nest. (Se* bottom of Pate 20. on Pages lf*0, 2W. &c.i
The several acts in terms of this behavior Herrick shows to be a.s follows:
(a) The search -*fter prey ,-oid jts capt-
■	ure;
fb) Its prepnration (often elaborate, as in the flicker and the sull, and consists to bruising, tearing off appendages, &C.J \ and transportation to the nest,
1 tc) Offering the food to the young and watching for the swallowing reaction,
,	(d) Inspection of the nest, very con-
stant in all Passeres, and many other orders;
!	(e)	Cleaning, with	incidental	use of the
1 excreta as food;
!	if)	Brooding;
(g) Shielding the young usually Id standing posture with wings and tail spread, and sometimes “bristling."
This serial behavior is repeated with
slight variations hundreds of times at
every nest Of doubtless thousands of spc-
cies of birds the world over No noticc
whatever in ornithological literature hr<.d
ever appeared of (d'i and (gl and but little ]
of (e>, but since the publication of Herrick’s book these things have become current and we hear much about " parental instinct ” in birds.
For	the first time,	also,	the	attitude of
Inspection, cleaning,	and	shielding were i
photographed. (See Pigs. 15. 47. 74, 23, 4U>, I rwi 1<>. JOS, &c,;) also of bristling, (see Figs. 3-1, 1<KU Herrick first brings out | the true significance of the so-called dis- ; tribution of food to the young, (see Pages 92. 182, &c.,) as wholly a question of the reaction of the gullet of the young. This depends upon whether the gullet is full or I not When full the gullet is inhibited and the young can take no more. The parent watches for the reaction—watch*1* the food in the gullet of thb young bird—(see Fig. 118.) a thing which had never been described or explained before. If the guJ-i let does not respond promptly the food is I given to another bird and passed around until a responsive throat is found.
The food is not simply delivered into the mouth, but pressed down Into the throat, where the afferent nerves end and ! the swallowing reflex can be started.
Consequently the condition of the young, i not the brain of the adult, determines the amount of food a nestling gets,
[ Herrick Is the first author to give an analysis of the-parental instincts in wild birds as applied to their whole life, and especially of fear. He gives many new details concerning the food and other | habits of indivtdua) birds and many photographs in which acts are shown- for : the first time—vl».f birds bruising insects, j (Figs. 3tf, 114,) birds inspecting* bristling,
| and shielding as already mentioned; adult I virco asleep on nest; 1 gntl turning eggs with blit; gull yawning, birds watching the food In throat, hawk spreading over prey, (Fig. 123;) cowbird fed by nurse, (Fig. 135;) flicker regurgitating food and j feeding young, (Figs. 137, 1S8L) l (2) As to conditions of observation" bo ing artificial, Herrick shows that after ; fear1 has been dispftlled there Is no dls- r turbing; factor^ ^*&therit bo.inspired by a earner^, a pexsop* .?<jr a,	or	r«ny*

been tabulated, and as for logical conclusions the facts speak for themselves.
(.*1) As to the destruction of young birds, the -mthor (Page 28) answers the objection?; thoroughly. When he works a whole season without the loss of a nest it would bo better to direct a crusade against rvu. 11 y destructive agents like hunUrs, egg collectors, and catsl
(4)	If the portable tent was used before the first edition of Herrick’s book the bright student of birds bid his light . under a bushel! Cumbersome and uncomfortable blinds, designed in one case ‘ to represent the trunk of a tree, h^d been in limited use, and it was thought necessary to decorate them with leaves and moss, but on** prominent ornJtlw>logist had declared that he preferred to dispense with blinds of every kind. The future of the portable tent as an obser\ at*>ry for the photographer and student of birds, especially in thetr nesting season, is assured, and no field outfit is now complete without if
<i> The Illustrations far from being mediocre are wonderful, and have been so pronounced by experts In animal photography It is the result, and not the particular make of camera, or lens, used that counts. The author wits one of the first to use the gra-flex f re flex) ea-niera, but this is of Tittle use in th< portrayal of ismall birds, and especially of all which nest in trees or much abov the ground— the case with the many shyer inland forms, to which his studies have been mainly directed. Indeed, in Herrick’s method, the moving of the tu-st. though often of great importance, is really lnci-dental to the chief thing attained the study at the closest range of the whole life on the nest, together with a com-pjete series of phntographs.
The movable tent is a most important element, and m*y be used in many cases without tonehmg the nest, as on .i high ; platform, (see Fig. 42.)
! Jn conclusion t wish to say that slighting criticisms fann«>t injure tie work of > a natumJist who, like Ur. Herrick, has shown orfginaiity, enduring patience, scl-; entific accuracy, and trained Judgment !	CHARLES	EDU'ARUS.
