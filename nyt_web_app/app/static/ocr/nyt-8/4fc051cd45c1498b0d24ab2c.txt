Mrs. Annie Bes&nt and C*. W. Leadb^at-er, the two well-known English theoso-phists. have collaborated in a volume describing " Thought Forms '—the shapes" our thoughts take. The " forms,/ or I ratlier the thoughts, are painted and drawn in colors, making in an fifty-eight j illustrations. The forms, It is said, are drawn from life. The volume h;i.x been written to put before students, in simple languag-f*. the results at which l>r Hum-| dux of Paris has been arriving. Hp has \ made experiments in photographing invisible objects, of which the sitter at the I moment Is thinking. It ts probable that th^ scientist has obtained In his series of pictures not so much the ariLMl thought Images as the effect caused In etheric matter by their vibrations. The boofc will bear the imprint of the John I^n*1 Company.
