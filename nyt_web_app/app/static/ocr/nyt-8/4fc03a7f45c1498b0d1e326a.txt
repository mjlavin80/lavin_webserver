IT seems that Mr. Andrew Lang does not accept the theory of Mr. Cummins Walters as to the solution of the mystery in Charles Dickens’s unfinished novel, Mr. Walters's book, to which we recently referred, “ Clues to * The Mystery of Edwin Drood * ** has not yet been published here and we are as yet all in the da.rk as to his theory. The English reviewers, in praising1 his book, have been courteously reticent. Mr. Lang seems to contend (he is really uot much interested in the matter) that Datch-ery is either Drood, restored to life, or Bazzard. Mr. Walters is sure that Datohery is neither of these. Mr. Lang goes so far as to admit that Mr. Walters s solution of the mystery is “ decidedly Dickensian ’ and “ very like Dickens when busy-with a game that : 1 was realiy unworthy of him." Mr. Lang judges by 1 the fragment of “The Mystery of Edwin Drood’* j that he would not have liked that story if Dickens I had lived to complete it.
