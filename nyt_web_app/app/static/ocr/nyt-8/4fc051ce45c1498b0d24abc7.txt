Nothing Doing.**
Sew York Times Saturday Review of Rookm:
Is not *4 nothing doing ’* a good English idtom? Many grammarians have found fault with “ is being *'	** done," or
” made," or " built,” &c.. and have urged the use of ' making,’* &c. If wo say “ The ship is building." meaning that a ship is being built; or Preparations are making,” meaning that preparations are being made, why not “ Nothing is doing.** meaning that nothing is being done. To me “ nothing doing ” looks an abbreviation for “There is nothing doing"; and this, I am sure, ta neither rare nor incorrect.	I4.	J.	B.	j
