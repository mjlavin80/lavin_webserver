“ The Hocfcesterlan ” In The Rochester Press.
In Thb Saturday Review of books of Thb "New York Times there is an article on a volume of Swinburne's poems, selected by William Morton Payne, and it is a piece of criticism altogether refreshing—interesting in itself, showing Intimate knowledge of the special theme, and wide literary scholarship, which gives perspective to the writer’s intellectual view. It attracts pecause it differs so widely from much of the criticism of the day. which Is given over to trivialities and eccentricities of style and to the consideration of tendencies and theories. The essayist, Montgomery Schuyler, was in his youth when Swinburne published the volume of poems which won fame, and he became an admirer of the new poet. He has kept much of his admiration, and he writes of Swinburne with enthusiasm, but as a critic he recognizes the fact that tUe poet has given way more
I and more to the delects ui nis qualities,
! and, as it were, weakened his genius in literary and imaginative excesses. Mr. Schuyler, moreover, is old-fashioned enough to consider Swinburne responsible as a man and an artist, and to deal I with his poetry for what It is, liking Its \ beauties, recognizing its faults, and testIng it all by an unperverted taste and 1 sound standards, judging freely, broadlv,
. and wisely.	*
