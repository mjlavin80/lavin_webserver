pw.rwalHE publication by the Dante Society of Cambridge, Mass.. of a concordance to Dante s minor Italian works,	to be
followed shortly by a similar volume dealing with his Latin writing's, marks an epoch in the annals of the Sorietv and of American Dante study which is worthy of more than perfunctory* passing notice.
It is only by a long period of use that the hoped-for qualities in a successful concordance can be verified; a casual ex ami nation, while revealing the amount o labor and patience consumed, can hardly throw' into noticeable relief the scholar ship and fine judgment which are the ■ basis	and	inspiration of such an	under
taking.	The volume before me	is fit-
tingly dedicated, as a tribute to America s most distinguished Danteist, to the Presi dent of the Society, Charles Eliot Norton without whose scholastic and materia aid and encouragement the work could hardly have been brought to the present
successful issue.
It is recorded in the by-laws of the Dante Society that "its object shall be . the encouragement of the study of the life and works of Dante.” In pursuance of this object, it was early determined to make available to Danteists the hitherto unpublished Latin text of the “ Comentura super Dantis Aldigherij Comoediam ” of Benvenuto Rambaldi (da Imola.) which, after the Boccaccio commentary in Italian, is second in point of chronology, j Rambaldi having performed the same service for Dante at Bologna in 13.4-80 that Boccaccio had a few years earlier in Florence. The first publication of Rambaldi’s commentary had been planned by Lord Vernon, to whose munificence Danteists already owed a splendid reprint of the first four editions of the ** Commodia ” when death inter\ encd-The project was then taken up by Lord Vernon's eldest son; but he, too, died before it could be carried out. ' The slovenly Italian translation of Rambaldi s Latin by Tamburini in the middle of the last century had made it more than ever necessary that the original should be placed accessible to students; and its pub- , iication would have been a splendid j achievement for the Dante Society.

AN early obstacle, however, presented I itself. It was learned that the second son of the late Lord Vernon, the Hon. William Warren Vernon, was not only eager but even then preparing to emulate his father's patronage, and had designated Sir James Lacaita as a fitting editor for the Rambaldi text. Thus the scheme was abandoned by the society. In 188T Lacaita’s excellent edition was published in Florence, in five volumes.
In the following year the Dante Society published Frof. E. A- Fay's concordance to the " Commedta; ” it then planned a concordance to Dante’s other writings, the first part of which Has now come
from the press.
In the Spring of 1902 the work on the concordance, which had been assigned to various members of the so- j ciety, was completed. It consisted of 44,- I 495 cards, each of which bore a word fol- , lowed by the context in which the word . appeared. The editing of these cards then became necessary, and that task was undertaken by A. S. Sheldon, Professor of Romance Philology at Harvard, and author of many monographs on philological subjects, assisted by Alain C. White, author of an important work on Dante's “ Quaestio de Aqua et Terra." On the advice of Prof. Norton it was decided to separate the verse from the prose parts of the concordance, the former to occupy the upper part and the latter the lower part of each page. Moreover, the test was to be brought into conformity with tho third edition of Dr. Edward Moore’s “ Tutte 1' opere di Dante,” ('* The Oxford Dante,”) then passing through the press, which, by taking Into account what had been achieved in Danto scholarship since the second edition (1897) and by incorporating the doubtful sonnets, made it necessary to increase the number of cards by 163. The various features of the work as it is now placed in published form, before the public are briefly yet comprehensively set forth by Prof. Sheldon in a ■* Prefazione ” written la elegant Italian—in appropriate linguistic conformity with the object of tho work.
The arrangement is simple and effective. In the verso portion, the ” cancon! ** of the ** Vita Nuova ** and of the *‘ Convi-vlo ’* precede the independent " cansoni then come the “ sestlne,” followed by the “ fcallate *- and the ** sonetti,” these verses of the " Vita Nuova ” preceding all others; and finally come the words of the “ Sette Salmi Penitenzlali ” and the “Profession e di Fede." In the prose the words

NOW, what words has it been found permissible, necessary, and reasonable To omit? Naturally, th ■ verbal forms of “ averp ” and "essere” head this list. Then come “ci.” "che," "ch&.” "chi,”
“ cui." “ c*,” ** ma." ” nc,” " nfr," "non,”
“ o " used ns a conjunction. “ questo,”
” quello,” " se " as a conjunction, " s£,”
“ si," and “ vi,” together with all regular forms of personal pronouns and possessive adjectives, although, naturally^ certain relative and *all demonstrative pronouns have been retained. There have also been retained the few curious Greek, Latin, and Provencal words to be found in Dante’s " Tuscan.” although quotations from these languages, when obvious, are omitted, as are the Provencal words in the xxi. Citnzone. This poem being written in Provencal, Latin, and Italian, the absence of the Troubadour vernacular from the concordance need bother no one.
Cross references have been introduced to a considerable extent. It has been found necessary to enter separately the various forms of “ cuore,” " virtu,” and *' frode,” and where these forms seem significant cross references have been made, particularly where the authenticity of the text is disputed. It will be seen that nice judgment must have been exercised in thedisnrimination of these things, but I think that no one who is familiar with Dante’s Tuscan will cavil long over seeming inconsistencies.
The entries for prose number almost three times as many as those for verse, but the same words in each have been, as far as the scheme of pagination allowed, kept on the same page. The work of editing, diligently pursued with the idea of eliminating all non-essentials— made possible through cross reference, mere location of unimportant and the discarding of insignificant words, which the card writers thought necessary to record—has reduced the number of words and word forms entered in verse to less ■than 2,500 and in prose to somewhat under 4,000. Some interesting figures are thus obtainable. “Cosa" is found to have been used 402 times by Dante in his Italian prose; “parte,” 358 times; "amore,” 185; "cuore,” and all its simpler forms, 46; in verse these words occur respectively 44, 28, 375, and 130 times. The disproportion of the number of times In which “parte” and "cuore” occur, and the almost equality of "amore" may incidentally be noted. “Cominciare” has in prose 13G, in verse 8; "ragione** has In prose 212, in verse 17. Of course the frequency or the infrequency of proper nouns signifies little; but it may prqve of interest to know what words other than proper nouns Dante made solitary use of in the texts covered by the concordance. In prose there are between 1,100 and 1,200 which occur only oncc, and about 200 less in verse. This is curious, when we recall the exigency and elasticity of a poet's vocabulary, it the same time, it may be noted that there are about 500 of these words appearing in the verse which do not occur in the prose.

I T is probable that the student of Dante in acquiring the concordance wi’ll postpone 'in examination of the acheme and directions, notwithstanding their inviting simplicity, and turn at once to questions of text which have long been the heated dispute of scholars. Prominent among them is that line in Sonetto XXXIL in the Canzoniere which formerly read: “ E monna Vanna e monna Bice poi "—an error which was famously perpetuated by Dante Gabriel Rossetti in his poetical translation; and many Danteists who have,not had access to original manuscripts have repeated it in attempting to prove that, had Beatrice been a solemn allegoric name, Dante would never have employed the tender abbreviation of Bice, and thus spoken of her in the same breath with Vanna. Guido Cavalcanti’s love. But Prof. Barbl has proved that Dante did not write Bice, but Lagia, and that the initial error was due to a scribe who sought to make tho line correspond with that in Sonetto'XIV. of the "Vita Nuova '*: “ lo vidi monna Vanna e monna Bice.” Tho concordance, while according the error, emphasizes the Baxbl reading, and thus Monna Lagia, the beloved of Lapo Ginni, usurps Beatrice’s place, and, with Monna Vanna and the unnamed thirtieth girl in Dante’s poetical list of the sixty most beautiful women of Florence, pursues her voyage Jn the “ Boat of Love,” leaving the Bice of the " Vita Nuova" more mystical and symbolic than ever. There are other cases of disputed readings which the editors have equally well settled in the light cast by that scholarship which Is the newest and has sometimes been found to be the best.
In closing his preface* Prof. Sheldon presents grateful thanks to the President of the society, to his colleague, Charles Hall Grandgent; to H. B. Nash, a well-known student of the Italian language, and to his collaborator, Mtv. White; He asserts that their diligent and accurate * co-operatibn haa greatly ' lightened his labor, while he tlimself frankly assumes the responsibility for any' errors that nia?
