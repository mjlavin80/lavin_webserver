As announced last week, a volume of *' Addresses to Cardinal Newman, with His Replies. 1879-81,*’ has been compiled for Longmans, Green & Co., who will issue it uniform with Newman's *' Meditations and Devotions." The addresses are those presented to Cardinal Newman at the time of his acceptance of the red hat from Pope Leo XIII. in 1878. They are preceded and followed by an account written by the late Rev. w. p. Neville of some of the incidents attending the offer of the Cardinalate and of Dr. Newman's subsequent journey and projected second trip to Rome, at which time he was over seventy-eight years old. Besides these addresses, the volume will contain portions of the official correspondence with reference to this offer and Dr. Newman’s acceptance of it.
