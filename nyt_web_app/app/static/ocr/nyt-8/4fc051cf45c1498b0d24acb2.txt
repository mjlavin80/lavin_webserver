BALLADE OF “ HOW TO w BOOKS,
THAT time when Learnings path was steep,
And rocks and fissures marred the way.
The few who dared were forced to creep, Their souls oft quaking" with dismay;
The goal achieved, their hairs were gray, Their bodies bent like shepherds’ crooks; How blest are we who run to-day The easy road of " How To ” books!
The presses groan, and volumes heap,
Our dullness we no more betray;
To know the stars, or shear a sheep— To live on air, or polo play;
The trick is ours, or we may stray Beneath the seas, with science cooks, And sprint by some reflected ray	'
The easy road of " How To ” books! !
Who craves the boon of dreamless sleep? j Who bricks would make, sans straw or clay?
" Call spirits from the vasty deep,"
Or weave a lofty, living lay?
Let him be heartened, jocund, gay,
Nor hopeless writhe on tenter-hooks— They meet no barriers who essay The easy road of *4 How To ’* books!
ENVOY,
The crltj<£s still will slash and slay Poor hapless scribes, in sanctum nooks; Lo! here’s a refuge for their prey—
The easy road of *' How To ” books!

repeatedly ts of more value to the reader than the devotion of the same energy /to different subjects and different writers. Memorizing from the King James version of the Bible lines of tlie choicest English ever penned, from Shakespeare and the poets, whose works outlive the ages, has always been of rare usefulness in the education of the young or old. Berkshire County ha-s
given to Massachusetts many of her ablest lawyers. Some In the past had easy access only to small libraries. But they knew their favorite books from cover to cover. Their information was within their fingers’ reach as they expounded the law to the court or argued the facts to the jury. Their ready knowledge was a bow of strength and its arrows were terrible in the day of battle. A most important result of education is the realization of the significance and precious value of time. In its practical bearing it trains us to devote a large part of the minutes allotted to pleasure to the enriching and expanding of the mind. The process of self-development becomes itself a pleasure, and in principle our toil is like the art of Michael Angelo:
Who works and j)rays For work is prayer, and consecrates his life
To the sublime ideal of his art,
Till art and life are one.
—From an address by Charles W. Bos-worth at the dedication of the Tyringham (Mass.) Library, Aug. 8.
Is there such a thing Coollnrc as cooling literature? Literature We think there is, only It can be more properly called the literature of coolness. Horace, with his Ban-dusian fountain, has some claim to be the father of It, though in the description of cool water Spenser has probably excelled every other poet. Goethe, who used to
bathe in the Tim by moonlight, told Eck-ermann that in his ballad of " The Fisherman ” he had employed the mermaid myth with no other aim than to express the charm of water in Summer. The fisherman sat fishing, and lo, a dripping mermaid fair sprang from the troubled main.*' The mermaid protested against the cruelty of angling. If, she said, he only knew " how gladly dart the fish across the sea! ** She then invited him to dart across the sea on his own account, and he consented to the watery bliss. One of the coolest stanzas in the language is Matthew Arnold's:
The silent courts, where night and day Into their stone-carved basins cold.
The splashing icy fountains play—
The humid corridors behold!
But to know how the literary mind can evoke ideas of coolness when the literary body craves for it one need only recall Flaubert's persecution of poor Maxtrae Du camp in the Desert of Kosselr. near the Red Sea. The camels carrying their whole supply of water had fallen and burst all the skins. What happened is told by Ducamp. We quote Mr. Tarver's translation:
'* After suffering thirst for thirty-six hours. While we were passing through a defile, a furnace formed of granite rocks, of a rose color, covered with inscriptions, Flaubert said to roe: ‘ Do, you remember the lemon ices that one eats at Tortoni's?’
for
Hot Weather.
I made a sign in the affirmative. He resumed: ' Lemon ice is a superior article; admit that you would not be annoyed at having swallowed a' lemon ice/ Curtly enough I replied, * Yes.’ After an interval of five minutes, * Ah! the lemon ices! All around the glass there is a cloud, which is like a white jelly.’ I said, ‘ Suppose we change the conversation?’ He replied,
*	That would be better, but lemon ice Is worthy of being celebrated; one fills the spoon, it makes a little mound, one softly squeezes it between the tongue and the palate; it melts slowly, coolly, deliciously; it bathes the uvula, glides over the tonsils, descends into the gullet, which is only too happy, and it falls into the stomach, which burste with laughing, so delighted is It. Between you and me, there is a scarcity of lemon ices in the desert of Kosselr.”
The maddened r>ucamp would not speak again for hours. When at last they drank, Flaubert took him in his arms and said: ** I thank you for not having blown out my brains with your gun; in your place I should not have resisted.”—London Globe.

the Autumn, Is not to
be confused with Lady [Mary Wortley] Montagu, the ** Queen of the Blue Stockings.” The two ladies had" qualities in
common and others which were not. Mrs. Montagu’s house in Portman Square was a tjreat centre of “ light and leading" when	George	II.	and George III. were
Kings. To it were attracted celebrities, English and foreign, and it is a mistake to suppose	that	Europe did not come to
London even then. Mrs. Montagu was the Madame Dn Deffaud of London society, as indeed somebody called her. Several volumes of her letters appeared after her death, but much correspondence was left for the benefit of posterity—in this ease ourselves.—The Book Monthly, London.
The honor has been claimed for the book trade that Sir Henry Irving was associated, with it in his youth by being employed in the well-known London and Indian house of Thacker. It seemed well that so interesting a thing should be
put to Sir Henry himself, and we have ventured to do so. With his usual fine courtesy he sends us a letter which is a footnote to literary history*
“ Touching your inquiry about my sojourn in the office of Messrs. Thacker, when 1 was a clerk in the city,” writes Sir Henry, “ I cannot recall any special handling of books. The firm exported ail kinds of wares, and I sat on a stool and wrote invoices. It would be pleasant t*nd romantic to say that, in this occupation,
1 caught a spark from Shakespeare. But stern veracity bids me forbear! ”—James Milne in The Book ^Monthly, London.

Walters’s Theory of “ The Mystery of fihoved into a heap
Mr. Walters concludes that Edwin was killed, and
Edwin Drood.*1 of quicklime, anfi-
that the prowling Datchery was Helena Landless, sister of Neville Landless, on whom Jasper attempts to throw the burden of the crime. Helena, we know, had often run away from her cruel stepfather in the disguise
of a boy. She was very resolute; she had to^clear her brother's character. She h^d black eyebrows, like Datchery, and wore, as Datchery, a white wig over her own head of hair; hence her habit of not wearing her tall hat, which was uncomfort* ably warm. She could run up to town, dress in the costume of her sex, and meet Rosa Bud; and run down again to Clofs-terham and spy,-., disguised as Datchery.

lines, lest her female hand should betray her. But she would not keep a secret i diary in chalk on the back of a door, in writing; nor is there any reason why sho kept a diary at all, whether in Ogam or in any other linear script; or why, if a 1 diary she needed, she did not write it in Tamil (she hailed from Ceylon) and lock it up in her dispatch box. Granting that a very young girl could disguise herself, her voice, her hands, her feet, in the semblance and costume of a middle-aged "buffer, living idly on his means," then i Helena may be Datchery. But suppose she is, the idea of Dickens is improbable 1 with the worst sort of Improbability, is terribly far fetched, and fails to interest. It is the idea of a bad sixpenny novel. We are asked to credit Dickens with " the highest scientific skill,” and this egregious invention is the result of his science! The idea would have been rejected by Mr, Guy Boothby, but it does not follow that Mr. Walters has not hit on Dickens's Idea. If he has, " Edwin Drood ” is far below " Count Robert of Paris ” In Its first uncorrected state, as the public will never know Jt.—Andrew Lang in The London Academy,

The “ Revolutionary Epick ” itself is a bewildering jumble of Shelley, Keats, and Milton. Amid extremely Shelleyan scenery of light and cloud, cataract and rainbow, sits the awful Demogorgon, encircled by a vast array of roseate spirits. To him there enter two other spirits, Magros, the embodiment of feudalism, and Lyridon, the embodiment of federalism, who contend in the Miltonic tongue for supreme sway over mankind. Each holds forth throughout a whole book, and in the end the Demogorgon gives sentence to the effect that " in man alone the fate of man is placed," and that, therefore, the spirits should hasten to discover him who is no King, but greater than all Kings, who walks unknown upon the earth that shortly will tremble at his tread. Thus Jarkly Is Napoleon indicated. *' * * The “ Eplck" was never finished. Three books onrfy were written, and that, apparently, satisfied the author. Not even Disraeli could sustain the poetic pose for longer. He wrote, as once he rode an Arabian mare almost to death, merely as a feat—because the true dandy must not only be picturesque, but capable as well of superhuman exertion. His courage must be as unquestionable as his coat; and hence our would-be poet enters the lists against such giants as Virgil, Dante, and Milton-, carries himself audaciously In the contest, and retires gallantly, before anything befalls that might bring him to harm or ridicule. The public, too, were apparently satisfied with three books: for, in spite of the author’s readiness to produce more, the encouragement of readers was not forthcoming,—London Times.

Whibley, In Blackwood, Some acutely touches off two Australian centenaries, those o f
FancfeiT Geor^e Sand and Nathan-
*	iel Hawthorne, both born
in 1S04. He thinks Hawthorne has the more vitality, because his essential motto was Montaigne’s, " This is a book of good faith, reader." On the other hand, Sand Is not marked with good faith until pretty late. It Is said of Keats that although the genius stares out of every
page in " Endyrolon," yet there is also a palpable substitution, now and again, of rhyme for thought. There is a good deal in George Sand of taking the easiest course, and twisting facts into accord with her genius of expression, but cannot this be even said of Carlyle—and of Dante?
.leorge Sand makes one think of the French Revolution, the noblest event in history, and yet stained with excesses. She is the most remarkable woman of her era, and the greatest female writer of all time hitherto. We borrow that from the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and indorse It. Women i^ish in droves after Bernhardt, Melba, arid Ada Crossley, from a conviction that “ Here are examples to show us one way out! "	’
Most though not all of the greatest writers are rapid. Flaubert seems as if he cannot sufficiently admire the fluency of Sand, and yet there is a little sub-acid In his way of talking. We relish the Shakespeares, Hugos, Dickenses, Du-mases, Balzacs, and Sands, who pour out irrepressibly. Even the Lope de Vegas are acceptable, and even the Guy Booth byS experience a huge and fierce delight!
In a democratic community, like this of Australia, we consider every movement in-ielatlon to the whole mass of the population, whereas In England you will find that the Cultivated Cenacle only regards itself, and leaves the masses outside, as brute beasts. Now that the working woman has*a vote, she will be apt to fall in with George Sand, and ask' why she herself is a slave and a cow, living In a miserable rabbit hutch, and chiefly addicted to the breeding of paupers.—1The -Imperial Review, Melbourne.

his study of the Napoleonic " Last Phase,” and some charming Asays and addresses, has established his claim to a high place in the literary hierarchy. So, of course, has Mr. Birrell, who may possibly have a~ minor post in the administration; ai:d Mr. Winston Churchill, in the intervals of war, statesmanship, travel, and polo, has found time to write. But, at a dinner of a literary club not long ago Mr. Churchill disclaimed the dignity of authorship on the ground of insufficient production He had only, he said, written five books—the same number as Moses,
An English Cabinet in the present century has seldom been without its literary element. It is enough to mention the names of Canning, Brougham, Macaulay, Derby. Bulwer Lytton, Disraeli, Cornewall Lewis, Derby, and Gladstone. Two, at least, In the above list—Macaulay and Lytton—were among the most popular writers of their time. A third, Disraeli, was a man of genius, whose novels, as mav'y people are beginning to think, may sui \ Ive as long as hh* political fame, and longer than those of most of his contemporaries. As tor the meritorious works, on which Mr. Gladstone bestowed so much labor, they are already forgotten. If Mr. Gladstone occupies a place in our libraries It will be through Mr. Morley’s " Life " and his ** Gleanings,” which will always be useful to the student of our constitutional and political history.
The rising literary talent seems, for the moment, to be on t>e of the Radicals. A few years ago n was different. In the eighties and nineties the clever young men were inclined to Toryism or Unionism—as witness W. E. Henley and all his school, the late J. K. Stephen and George Steevens, to mention those only who have passed away. But just now there do not seem to be any young Conservative champions to set against Mr. Trevelyan, Mr. Masterman, Mr. Hilaire Belloc, Mr. Chesterton, and the rest of the band of young literary Liberals and Radicals—not to mention those subversive revolutionists like " G. B. S.*' and Mr. H. G, Wells, who belong to no party, but, at any rate, can scarcely be classed on the side of constitutionalism and established order.—London Standard.
Since the absurd report of Mr. Wilde being still alive appeared in the papers I have received 378 letters from different sources asking me if the report were true. Perhaps yQU will make known to those interested in the subject the following facts:
At the time of his death Mr. Wilde owed a considerable sum of money to Paris tradespeople, who, out of regard for a fallen and distinguished man, (contrary to all French instincts,) had given him
considerable credit. When nursing him during his last illness he asked me, as one of his most intimate friends, that in the event of his death I should endeavor to see that those who had been kind to him were paid. Instead of raising difficulties, as they might easily have done, the French creditors, directly he was dead, accepted without any demur my personal promise that they would be paid in course of time. For a foreigner to die in Paris -when he is registered at the hotel under an assumed name is one of the most expensive luxuries in the world, and Wilde’s body was very nearly taken to the Morgue. His illness had been a great expense to his friends, and there was really no money to buy a suitable plot of ground for his grave. It also occurred to me, and to the friend who was with him at the last, that it would be In bad taste to spend a large sum of money on his grave and funeral expenses until the French creditors who had shown more than human charity were fully compensated. I therefore hired a plot of ground at B.iyneux and placed a simple stone over the place, and I pay a rent to the French Government for the use of a “ conccssion tem-poraire.” It shocks a great many visitors to Bayneux to learn that the grave is only a temporary one. But two-tlilrds of the French creditors have been satisfied, and by next year Wilde’s last wishes will have been carried out. I shall then move the remains to a permanent resting place at P£re la Chaise and a suitable monument will be erected over them. I receive numerous letters expressing astonishment at the nature of the grave at Ba/neux and the fact that it Is only a temporary one, but I have given you the reason. I venture to think that no one who knows the circumstances will think that I should have followed any other course.—Robert Ross, Editor of " De Profundis,*' In The London Sphere.

English Opinion of
« A Publisher’s
Confessions.**
** Let those write

those who always
wrote now write
the more." This is the‘ obvious moral
which springs to the mind after reading
the little book which a publisher has been
good enough to put before us, and which
he has been cute enough to label his
" Confession.” Every member of the genus irrltabile will think that it is his particular publisher confessing to the crimes committed in connection with his particular work' but " Confession ” does not altogether describe it. It is rather a bit of special pleading, an attempt to show what a virtuous, philanthropic person every publisher wqrthy of the name really is; how he publishes poor stuff that pays— to the accompaniment of such streaming eyes as the walrus ha!d when, while eating the oysters, he “sorted out.those of the- largest size v—when he • would -much rather be,;publiaMng ..good, sotwd^tera?;
