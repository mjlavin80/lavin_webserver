'Sew York Times Saturday Jtevicw of Books:
I have just been reading The New York Times Saturday Review of June 17—a good deal belated In the malls—in which inter alia, I have found the letter of your Wheeling, West Va., correspondent. This letter seems to give me a lair occasion to say a few words which I have for long been more than willing to say. I trust that your headline is not so far peremptory as to restrain this correspondent -from taking up his pen again far enough to answer one or two queries which I intend here to put.
I am only concerned now with what your correspondent says of Henry James. My interest in Mr. James is not new or slight. I was his fellow-student at the Harvard Law School forty years ago, and I have read all he has written until somewhat recently. I stopped reading him for a double reason; first, because his style had become so tortuous and altogether offensive in a literary sense, and next, because bis thoughts, if I may so call what is wholly unintelligible, had become too rarefied or esoteric for compr£fiension, much more for enjoyment.
I have said that I had read him till lately. In point of fact, I drew the line at " The Sacred Fount." Patience had then done its perfect work; it could do no more. To quote a phrase from a familiar line of poetry, the volume “ dropped from my nerveless hand,” and " The Golden Bowl " and “ The Wings of a Dove *' are and will be sealed books to me unless by . possibility some great genius shall hereafter fathom and explain them, or some deep critic, like your West Virginia correspondent, shall translate them into English.
Your correspondent shies rocks at disparagers of James, telling us that they say he can ” be read backward and forward with equal results." So I think, adding only that however read, the results are nil, except a Juggle of words. He further accuses us of thinking or saying that James “ never cares whether a reader understands him or not.” A true bill again; for plainly. James could write sense and reason if he half tried. “ The Portrait of a l>ady " is a genuine classic, clear in 1 style, deft and charming as a story, or study, as the present cant word is. If, 1 then. James now writes jargon and nonsense, as he indubitably does. It must be either because he has no meaning, or seeks to veil it from his readers by a carefully woven drapery of verbiage.
Your correspondent prophesies, too; thereby indulging in what tleorge Eliot well called the most gratuitous form of j error." Making an elaborate comparison I between the disfavor which Whistler met and that which now meets James, he prediets with rare confidence that James's triumph will be as has been Whistler's, j Into this realm of the unknown, and at present unknowable, it is not worth our j whil*1 to enter. To utilize the epigram of the great Sam Patch—" Some things can be done as well as others "—it might be said, “ Some people can prophesy as well as others.”
The serious, all-sufficing, all-pervading j fiiult. or vice, of James's later work is its j astonishing, inexplicable lack of intelligibility to ordinary minds, for I aver my ; firm belief that no man. not even James himself, no. nor even your West Virginia critic, can state a meaning, give us a version of " The Sacred Fount "—I confine myself here to what I have read and reread—which shall make it less 'than a tissue of meaningless sentences and an affront to literature# I beg your correspondent to so far resume his pen as to attempt to controvert this last statement. Don’t prophesy, especially UC you cannot give dates or approximations to dates; confine yourself ito what now is, lest I should pass off the stage before the I prophecy can be put to test! It is not opinions or beliefs that I want, but proofs. Proofs will satisfy me. will convert me, for I confess not to be of the class, of minds of whom Herbert Spencer said. “ Proofs will not alt^r their beliefs,"
Emerson's third of his well-known rules : for reading was. ” Never read any books but what you like." Much more would he have said “ Never rend any books but what you understand.” I am ready to re- i sume reading James whenever I am made acquainted with* the meaning of "The | Sacred Fount.”	I
What well-read reader, reading James’s j 14 The Sacred Fount ’’ — and I conclude the same must be said of " The Golden Fowl " and ” Tho Wings of a Dove can help being vividly reminded of John Lyly’s “Euphues." which has stood /or | three centuries and a quarter as the type an^irmp of vicious style and empty | thought, read only as a historical exam-pie and warning of literary degeneracy ! even in “ great Rliza's days,” Lyly has, however, one advantage over James; ■ whil^ his style is of the worst, his meaning. such as it is, is measurably clear.
Ry all means, let your correspondent, i or any other admirer or defender of these biter works of James, tell us plainly the grounds of iheir gay and confident pre- j diction that his critics and detractors will, sooner or later, be brought to grief.	:
(Joldwin Smith fins lately said of Browning, ” His poetry is philosophy done ; in verse with Browning societies to inter- j pret it.” I might say of James. His writ- ' ing of late is Intellectual flatulency done | in novels which there is no one to inter- I pret.	I>. H. CHAMBERLAIN.
