Kctc lorfc Times Satvraap Recictc of Boote :
W ithout having at all followed the present discussion in these columns concerning poetry, I am induced by matters dehors to add a word. It seems to me almost too obvious for utterance that the English language was never made for and never meant for poetry—that “ counting-house language, language fit for Drill Sergeant’s command words.” Byron at his best was never more than a rhyme-smith. For the same reason it seems to me that no one Is qualified to discuss
poetry who has not lived in that of Goethe and Schiller and Heine; or, except, best qualification of all, those who have been under the spell of Alfred de Musset. Whether the qualification is worth while is another question, which I decline to discuss, being inclined to the opinion that the counting-house language will do very well without the poetry.
Herman Melville was the poet who suggested these reflections. He seems to have appreciated (or anticipated?) Carlyle’s idea; for he had the poet’s thoughts, I but expressed them in vigorous prose. There are passages in his books so striking as to make one sit up breathless. And i who demands accuracy in an epic?	J
Speaking of accuracy, apology is indeed due for " stringing in German words " when quotations appear so faulty and free as to be almost slang.
