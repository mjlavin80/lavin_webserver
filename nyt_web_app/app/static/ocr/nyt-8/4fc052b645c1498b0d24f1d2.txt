IT was not long ago that Mr. Gouver-nour Morris wrote a striking little story in which the primordial human beast figured in all his hairy ugliness and rude mental simplicity. In this bool^ which was first published in 1837, you have a rather cTever imaginary picture of the life of the cave man In the rough £tone Age, with the rudeness of the -creature somewhat softened and idealized.
The hero Ab appears as infant cradled in ai nest of dry brown leaves, and in the very first chapter his mother must rescue him from a giant hyena by’ climbing with him into the tree‘tops in a manner decidedly reminiscent' of the " ato-vistic bounder."
■	As Ab grows up he becomes, of course, a , mighty hunter, and you may read how he i went out with his fellows to meet the ! mammoth, how the sea serpent came I ashore and carried terror through the dry j land, how the young cave man attempted ;
to pursue a girl of the Shell People (whb .
I dwelt by the river side) in the water, and ! how as they swam the girl outdid him' and laughed mockingly over her bronzed . shoulder. You may read, too, of huge I communal feastlngs upon the body of a slain mammoth, and of how Ab upon that rather gluttonous occasion looked upon the lovely Lightfoot—a maiden far les3 hairy than most of the ladies, her con-temporaries—threw her a choice morsel i of meat, and desired her for his own; then how for her sake he fought with his friend and comrade Oak, and cleft that sturdy savage’s thick skull with his stone axe, buried him, and ran away a haunted thing. Finally, how he returned and took Lightfoot, not at all against her will, to j dwell with him in his own new cave, and of honeymoon adventures with two huge i bears who “ treed " the pair and were starving them to death.
There is also the old fellow with bad legs who was spearmaker, and an authentic relation of how with a hint from a toy Idly ^
I	made by a little brother Ab invented the | first bow and tried the effect of arrows
on it. -	-
1	The manner of telling the story is rather ; pleasing and the care exercised In the . selection of those primitive traits which shall be mentioned makes the book quite ■ proper reading for young people. These may learn from it (perhaps) something of what life used to be before some modern improvements in manners and ways of ' living were invented.	'
