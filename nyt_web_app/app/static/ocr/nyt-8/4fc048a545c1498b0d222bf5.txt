MFL A. C. BENSON Ls disposed to lean backward in bis deaire - to avoid the attitude of hero worship that so many biographers are apt to assume. Hia posture in his excellent biographies ot Tennyson and Rossetti, In the English Men of-Letters Series, was certainly nothing less than bolt upright. In his latest contribution to that series his life of Edward FitzGerald, (New York, 1905:	The Macmillan Company,) he
will seem to some of the admirers of '* old Fitz ” to go still further In his objectiveness of view and his Impartiality of treatment- Not that he has not felt the charm of FitzGerald's curious and in many ways lovable character, or has not written with full sympathy and gentleness of his many foibles and weaknesses. Still less has he failed to appreciate, as the most devoted Omari te would have him, the beauty and the perfection of the versions of the Rubaiyat, or the charm of the letters.
But his treatment, on the whole, scarcely touches us with quite that personal and affectionate feeling for FitzGerald that doubtless most of us have involuntarily formed from reading what he has written and what others have written to him and about him. Perhaps Mr. Benson’s FitzGerald is the right one. Yet, for all the logical con-sis ten ey of the portrait, we are loath to yield to Mr. Senson’p art.	‘
There is very little ** story ’* to tell of FitzGerald’s life. Pew men have lived a more leisurely, uncontrasted existence, in which mournful inactivity seemed to follow from sheer irresolution and temperamental lack of energy. A man of great intellectual power, much nobleness and tenderness of character, he was not, as Mr. Benson puts It, cast quite enough in the ordinary mold for his own convenience. Trig uncertainty, his fitfulness, his helplessness, were a sign of weakness. They kept him *' shivering on the brink, half hoping that something miglit determine a step which he himself had not the courage spontaneously to take.” And as his biographer is compelled to point out, this languid lingering upon the skirts of life Is not a beautiful nor j an admirable thing.
No doubt this tendency accounts for FitzGerald’s strangely assorted friendships. He felt the need of more decisive natures to complement his own—of the imperious Tennyson and the rude Carlyle; and likewise of that preposterous M PoBh,” the ignorant sailor whose splendor he never tired of celebrating by word and deed. For his own part, his love and loyalty* his quiet generosity, his virginal pure-mindedness, the fineness and sensitive appreciation that glow through his letters, account sufficiently for the return in kind that was given for his friendship. And'this return came from some of the best minds of the century. We cannot accuse Mr. Benson of being less than just toward each of thfese sides of FitzGerald’s character. But he is .never indulgent. To the FitzGerald of the letters he iB most so—to that strange, remote, tender, wistful personality *’ which they reveal, and, revealing it so perfectly, fulfill the one condition that make letters memorable.	,
Of course FitzGerald’s biographer appreciates the Rubaiyat translations at their full worth; although he is not for that kind of " poking and pushing

The work Is Indeed ihV product of circumstances that seem, 'almost fortuitous—tho -discoVCfy . by FitzGerald of an ancient poet whoBe sentiment and love of beauty matched 'his own, and were coupled with the plangent philosophy that was his- He J was a practiced craftsman without a subject; and for once a man of high literary taste found a subject precisely adapted to his best faculty, strong where he was strong, and limited as he himself was limited.
Since the same conjunction was pres* ent In much less measure in the Spanish and Greek translations, these fell far short of the Omar, in Mr. Benson’s estimation. That estimation will doubtless not be accepted by the devoted followers of FitzGerald, and It does indeed seem as if Mr. Benson’s scruples had let defects blind him to many very remarkable beauties in those works. Of ** Euphranor ,f he has still lesfe good to say, and justly. The fact that only in -translations could FitzGerald achieve the heights of mastery Is the almost necessary outcome of that irresolution that so influenced his whole life. He was a dependent. Mr. Benson has clearly shown this interrelation and it must be accepted as the real key to FitzGerald’s character, as well as of his work.
