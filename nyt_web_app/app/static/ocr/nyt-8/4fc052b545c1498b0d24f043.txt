VOLS- XVI. and XVII. of Early Western Travels, edited by Mr. Reuben Gold Thwaites, are the third and fourth volumes of the account of Major Long's expedition from Pittsburg to the Rocky Mountains, made by order of the Secretary of War, during the years 181*.>-IS20. Mr. Thwaites's notes are full a'hd illustrative, but do not thrust themselves upon the reader at the expense of the author. This cannot be said of all editors. For example, Bishop Hurd’s notes to Addison are most offensive, for the editor does not confine himself to explaining what needs explanation, but interjects corrections—*' This would have been better thus: ”	** Mr. Addison should have
written so,*' and so on ad nauseam. Hurd is not alone. The average edit-cr seems to consider himself equipped for his work when he despises his subject thoroughly. No such fault can be laid at Mr. Thwaites’s door.	‘
He is guilty, however, in another way: He leaves out dates. It is no excuse to say that dates are omitted from the original; Mr. Thwaites puts in the page numbers of the original edition, and changes the chapter numbers about to suit his plan of editing. Why then can he not put in the year and Tnonth dates? The third volume of Long’s account, under Mr. Thwaites's editing, begins thus;
** £212] Chapter I. IVIIL] Excursion to the summit of the Peak—Mineral Springs —Coquimbo Owl—Encampment on the Arkansa. At an early hour on tire morning of the 13th/' &c. What year; what month? The running headline reads 4* Vol. XVI., 1810-1820 but that Is not definite. Not until the_ beginning of Chapter III. [X.J do we learn that the month was July; but the year might be 1819 or 1820. We do not find a single year date con-' nectcd with Major Long’s narrative, as Mr«* Thwaites edits it. The part of the trip. described must have been made ’ in 1S20, however, for the fourth volume brings the party home, and Contains a special report by Major Long .dated In January*, 1821. But there is nothing:-in tho third volume to serve as a guide post for the. year of the -journey. Mr.^Thwaites evidently conslders-lt easy £o refer to the first volume, which» of course, is always at the reader's, elbow. = ^ ■ • ' -1 : ■ " • It is not enough that Mr. -3Chwait.es can explain doubtful places, add information on minute points; his work as an editor should be directed not to show his own knowledge,^ but to plac6 the matter.of.the' book he edits, so-that the reader may it at the least expenditure *>f labor; An editor is. ^iflply .and, solely a piece' of labpr-savlng machinery. By^ as\Tmich as he fails to" reduce to a mlnimum the friction caused by.getting at theJnformation he has- edited,- by so much he' fads to-edit' properlyr Mr; Thwaites has added his
stories' of knowledge to' Major "ijong's; ’.but he has notrminlmlaed-the friction caused" In extracting it.*/’ * •	.	\	’
