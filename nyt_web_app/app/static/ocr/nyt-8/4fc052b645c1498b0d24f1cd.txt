INDIANA POETS.
Is equally incredible and indubitable that a newspaper of Indiana, The Indianapolis News, no less, has published a chart set-
-	ting	forth the poetical out-
*
put of that Commonwealth by counties, in the manner with which the census has familiarized us with reference to cereals and hog products. The map of Indiana, with the county lines shown, and the number of resident poets stamped within them, Is one of the most remarkable illustrations of the graphical method applied to statistics which we have ever encountered. Strange and large lacunae appear.
|	There are arid stretches of poetless
;	counties, seven of them together in one
place and eleven in another, as unfruit-(	ful of this particular crop as Emerson’s
^	jFYance, “ where poet ne’er was born.”
The inhabitants of this Great Poetical Desert should bethink themselves and import the seed or the spawn or the i	sire, or whatever it is that the skillful
poeUculturist does to secure a harvest of poems. But, on the other hand, there are counties in which poets pul-|	lulate and ■ bourgeon. Vayne County
i	has fourteen and Marion County has
,	thirty-seven. As Dr. Johnson said of
his college, they are " nests of singing birds."	,
Naturally, the taker of the poetical census has let nobody escape who ever j published anywhere a copy of verses on ■ any subject with his name to the same. The consequence is that the outlander is made to feel that he doesn’t know what Is doing in poetry. Three or four names in' the list a reader who Is not an Indianian may possibly recognize. But for the rest, they are in the position of the legendary citizen,
Whose fame beyond his own abode Extends for miles along the Harlem road.
How cold the foreigner to Indiana is left upon being apprised that several Indiana poets M have achieved a worldwide fame by a single poem, as did Sarah T* Bolton, John Finlay, and Will H, Thompson," the last named of whom he may indeed and pleasantly recall in connection with ** High Tide at Gettysburg." But what can the extra-Indianian do with '■ Julia L. Dumont, mother of the late Gen. Ebenezer Dumont,” who, it appears, was " the first Indiana writer whose work, both poetry and prose, whs readily accepted by Eastern publishers ”? What can he do with " Mary Louise Chitwood, who, .next to Sarah T. Bolton, was the most widely known of the Indiana poets of hgr time "?
^he compiler of the list is of a philosophical turn of mind, and raises the question we have suggested as to the poetical barrenness of parts of Indiana otherwise favored by nature.
"Why Is it there have been so few singers in northern counties of Indiana, while Eastern Indiana ana the counties along the Ohfo have always had their poets '* Why is it that Marion County has had thirty-seven recognized poets, while no note rises from the beautiful farming lands that He immediately to the west and to the north of her? These are all questions well worth considferation.
These inquiries and speculations may strike the experienced and extra-Indi-anian reader as the very acme of Little Pedlingtonianism. But, brethren, these things are an allegory. It is really no more ridiculous to undertake to settle
