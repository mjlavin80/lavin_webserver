Jfpto York Tinas Saturday Review of Books:
Referring to Mr. F. E. Rogers’s recent communication, would say that even ' though It would be Impossible to compile a collection of masterpieces of humor to rival ‘''Pickwick Papers,” et al., yet for me, at least. It would be of great Interest and value to have a symposium on humorous works, similar to the one you conducted-'some months ago on ghost stories.
To contribute a mite to such a symposium, X might say that among modern writers I have particularly enjoyed for their humor, ** The Madigans," ** Little Citizens," and both those controverted books, “ Elizabeth and Her German Garden ” and “ Memories of a. Baby."
By the way, how any one with any baby experiences can. compare that wooden doll, Skeezucks, with the lifelike, even though superlative, Binks, is a mystery to me.	HENRY	E.	SILKBR.
