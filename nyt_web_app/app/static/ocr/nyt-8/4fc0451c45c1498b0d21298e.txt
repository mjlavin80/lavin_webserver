EN strive	to print their names indelibly
upon the	face of time, for the desire ts
common to Jive on earth forever In the spirit if not in the flesh. It Is a constant struggle against individual obliteration. Fate, however, often decrees that those who make the proudest effort to achieve eternal survival shall	fail,	while, with	that strange perversity which
is one	of	her striking	characteristics, she Immortal-
izes some who had never a dream of perpetual glory, and she does this through what, at the moment, appears to mundane gaze nothing but cruel misfortune.
Thus the name of Alvar Nunez Cabeaa de Vaca, a Spaniard of the sixteenth century, shines in history and will retain its lustre so long as books are read.
In Joed, the lapse of almost four centuries since the 5 relation of his terrible experiences seems merely to have enhanced his Importance. With no intention of his own. with no intention of anybody, he enrolled his name in the list of great explorers. Yet he was no warrior seeking fame, but only one of a number of unfortunates striving to extricate themselves from a precarious situation caused by the miserable incompetence of a leader. In the annals of American history he stands as the first European to cross the southwestern part of what is now tbe United States.
His tale of disaster and painful wandering from tribe to tribe in tbe effort to escape, forms one of the most extraordinary episodes In the discovery and exploration of this continent, and again we have to thank Mr. Ripley Hitchcock for his judicious selections In extending the Trail makers’ Series. In this, the thirteenth volume, he has brought within common reach one of the rare documents of eariy Spanish travel, a narrative hitherto qiiitc inaccessible to the general public, yet one of first importance to all who would attain a clear understanding of the early history of our Southwest- In addition, the work is edited by no less an authority than Ad. F. Bandeller, the foremost in this line, and the translation is by his wife, whose quick intelligence and absolute familiarity with the Spanish language has enabled her to fathom many intricacies of the vague and confused record. The story was first published at Zamora in 154U, and it is that edition which Mrs. Bandeller has translated. The book was republished at Valladolid in 1555. Of the Zamora edition (which for a long time was unknown) only two copies have been traced. One in perfect condition Is in the Lenox Library, New York, anl the other, somewhat damaged, is in the British Museum. The I^cnox has the 1555 edition also, as well as much other material relating to this subject.
The first English translation was in Volume IV. of “ Pure has His Pi 1 grimes,” published In the seventeenth century, and In 1S5I Buckingham Smith translated the original and published privately 100 copies, followed in 1S71 by 110 copies of a second edition. In 3So7 it was translated by Temaox-Com-pans into French, and a paraphrase In 18G9 appeared in Talks of Old Travels," by H. rUngsley, London.
A reccnt translation Into English has been made by Charles n. McGuffey. but it has not yet been printed. Owing to the many difficulties, several translations are an advantage. The map which accompanies this volume is the same as the one adopted by Mr. Bandeller In describing Cabeza de Vaca's route In •• Contributions to the History of the Southwestern Portion of the United States," published by the Archaeological Institute of America in 1890. This tracing leads from about Galveston, where the survivors were assumed to he wrecked, across Texas to its centre: thenoe to the Rio Grande at the mouth of the Pecos; and thence west across the Sierra Madre to Sonora. Compare with this the" discussion of route by Brownie Ponton and Bates H. MacFarland In the Quarterly of the Texas Historical Society, January, 1S98.	,

The hero of this great adventure Iff v'usually known as Alvar Nuftez Cabeza de Vaca, but Cabeza de Vaca was his
*	mother’s name, which, as i* still customary in Spain for the eldest stfft, he had “taken in honor of his mother, so that tht name apparently should be written Alvar ‘Nunez de Vera y Cabeza de Vaca, his father having been Francisco de Vera, son of the conqueror of tk*. Canary Islands, The maternal name was derived from the action of one of the ancestors, a shepherd. Martin Alhaja, wbo indicated by means of a cow skull the entrance to a mountain defile by which the Moors ^ were defeated. The useful shepherd was ennobled, and took hla title from the circumstance.
THE NARVAEZ EXPEDITION-
IN 1527, when Panfilo de Narvaez organized his expedition to Florida, Cabeza de Vaca became treasurer. In April, 1528. a landing- was made on tbe west coast of the Florida Peninsula and on May 1 Narvaez, the same who had made a fiasco of the expedition against Cortes, decided against tbe protest of de Vaca to leave the ships and strike inland, inadequately prepared though he was. Tbe vessels were to follow along tbe coast and find a harbor for rendezvous. Because of tile protest Narvaez endeavored to induce de Vaca to remain with the ships and direct them, but the latter, considering this an imputation of cowardice, refused, declaring he would rather suffer with the land party. And so he did; and singularly was the very one to lead the three other survivors successfully out of the wilderness. Three hundred persons started with high hopes, each man having but two pounds of ship biscuit and half a pound of bacon. It was a piece of folly often repeated in the centuries of exploration to follow, and even to this day not as rar-i as It ought to be.
The ships cruised along the coast for about a year and then abandoned the quest, while disaster on disaster fell on the ill-managed party struggling over the land at no great distance from the Gulf, till by the end of July death threatened the whole company and they endeavored to thwart the sinister hand. Success was but temporary. The sea offered the only feasible route for escape, and, though no one knew how, it was decided to build several boats. One man contrived to make a forge and bellows, and by its help spurs, crossbows, &c-, were turned into tools and nails. A near-by native village was raided for corn, and every third day one of the weary horses was killed for m-at. The boats, begun Aug. 4. were completed Sept. 20. There were five, each of twenty " elbow lengths. ' Ropes were made of horse tails and palmetto: shirts pave sails, and the 22d of September saw the boats launched, loaded to the water's edge, and coasting toward Panuco and toward their impending fate. Food was scarce. The water bottles, fashioned out of the skins of horses’ legs, were soon rotten, necessitating frequent landings in search of fresh water. Men fell stick; starvation and privation were mastering them. Human endurance has its limit.
About a month after the launching— that is. about six months after the first , landing in Florida—they came to the I mouth of a river so large that its powerful current enabled them lo dip fresh water out of the sea. It is believed that j this river was the Mississippi. Here the fjve boats became separated. That of ! Narvaez and one other succeeded in land-j ing. while three drifted away. The com-I mander. always a bungler, slept aboard , his boat, which, inadequately secured, j drifted before a norther, and. with her unfortunate freight, vanished forever. No lt'Ss unfortunate, however, were those who remained on the land, for they were com*
, polled to march along the shore with groat difficulty. They perished miserably. often eating each other,
j	DE	VACA	WRECKED.
THE three boats at sea steered westward; that of I>orantes alone; Peiialosa and de Vaca in company. In four days Penalosa disappeared in a qorm, and de Vaca went on, to be cast, Sov. d. 1528, on the beach of a long, low inland, identified by Bandelier. as the Isl-mid of Galveston. The boat of Dorantes, it happened, was also cast on this same island Seven months had now passed since the parting from the ships, and the survivors were barely more than one* quartrr of the original number. The de Vaca party tried to launch their boat again, and to do it removed all their clothing. The craft was capsized in the surf, drifted away, and the;- were left to begin life anew in this far, wild land, with not even a shirt to their backs. So did ill-luck follow them daily, and visit thf'm with fresh disasters The Dorantes party now discovered them, ;ind combined tht y counted eighty survi\or? in all.
Fou" w**re then sent to i<>ok for Panuco. and that was the end of them. Very soon only fifteen besides Cabeza de Vara w**r*- left alive, and he was tak< n sick and could not .accompany the thirteen j who started to seek ciHvizat .i	His	j
doom seemed to be closed, but F.n^ d*--li^htr* in surprises. He recovered, and ^ ■with one Alaniz and Lope de O\i«-do a^ain f t<*ok up the struggle for subsistence, i Alaniz soon died. Oviedo remained with the first Amerinds they had fallen among,

but de Vaca turned himself’into a trader, j and for severe! seasons exchanged - the | products of the sea for buffalcvrobes, &c., with tribes of tbe. interior, some of them fifty leagued away. It was then that,

He says he spent nearly six yearp with the na-| tives, alone and naked. ** as they alt were j themselves," "Unfortunately be does not describe the events of these years; “ as it would take tco long to tell.*’ He remained so long with tbe hope of rescuing Oviedo, but that individual, after making tbe attempt to leave, weakened and returned to the island natives.
Cabeza de Vaca then went on without him, and presently fell In with three survivors of the thirteen Who had started for civilization so many years before when de Vaca was sick. These were Castillo, (Maldonado, bis mother name.) Dorantes. and the latter’s negro, Kstevanico. For 1 ten months these four traveled westward,
I from tribe to tribe, becoming “ medicine men,” and, their fame growing, they at [ leng-th held great power. Estevanlco, as i the others were too much occupied with the medicine business, was the one who talked with the natives the most, and in-j formed himself of the country, and this knowledge came into play later when he I became guide for Friar Marcos de Nizza, who was sent (1539) from Mexico northward on a tour of exploration. Tbe narrative of Marcos is appended to this work; Out of his journey grew the famous Coronado expedition. Coronado in 1541 met with a native who had seen the de Vaca party- (See Page ^52, Journey of Coronado, this series.}
QIARREL WITH AIXARAZ.
IN April, i-Vifi. Cabeza ae Vaca and his three companions reached the waters of a river in Sonora, which he called Petlatlan. and there met Capt. Alcaraz, who was slave hunting and who had already captured many men and “all the women and children ’* of one locality. He tried to use de Vaca in his scheme, and this led to a bitter quarrel. The result was the wanderers were badly treated, but at length they reached the frontier settlement of San Miguel de Cultacan, where Melchior Diaz, honorable i lid brave, was in command. Thereafter they had no trouble Cabeza de Vaca returned to Spain the following y^ar, 1537, made a report to the Emperor and asked for a grant to conquer Florida. This having already been given to De Soto, (See Page 5.
** Narrative of De Soto,” this series,) and not being able to agree on terms lor a combination, de Vaca accepted the place of Governor of the La Plata country, whither he went in 1541, to meet with opposition and m;ik^ a fallare. Like other distinguished explorers of that period, he was finally sent a prisoner to Spain, where he remained in confinement for eight years. His treatment was not severe. and after liberation he lived comfortably and occupied an honorable position. No work of fiction could paint a more rem irk.iblp career, and the world must ever r'‘g;r! his omission of the de-pcription of his six years' experience as a trader among those Southern tribes. No-wIipmj can there be found a better illustration of ;he extent of human endurance.
