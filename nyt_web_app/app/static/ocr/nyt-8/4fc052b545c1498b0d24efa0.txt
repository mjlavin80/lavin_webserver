Edward Moran's thirteen historical marine paintings representing " Thirteen Chapters of American History " have been described and gathered together In one octavo volume, bound in pale gray boards with brick red linen back (New York: the Baker & Taylor Co. $l.r>0 net.) The book was compiled by Theodore Sutro, the well-known New York lawyer, who was Mrs. Moran's counsel throughout the litigation proceedings when Mrs. Moran brought suit against her husband's executor for the possession of these‘paintings, which the artist had given her upon their completion. Another point of interest in connection with the pictures is the fact that they have been for some time at the Metropolitan-Museum of Art.
