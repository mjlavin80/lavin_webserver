MISS BROWNE has done a remarkably good piece of work in her bibliography of Hawthorne. It Is curious that with aU the interest in the novelist, this is the first list of his writings and of the writings about him, ever prepared; but it comes at an appropriate time, almost coincident with the Hawthorne centenary, and must receive a warm welcome from all admirers of the
great writer.
The bibliography represents work extending over sixteen years; it was begun as far back as 1S88.	" No work of this
kind can be final," says <the compiler; but everything that came to her knowledge has been noted, and the book is quite up to date, with references to aU the articles called forth last year by the Hawthorne centenary. How thorough it is may be gathered from separate entries: for example, Mr. Joline's “ Meditations of An Autograph Collector ” Is noted as containing two letters from Hawthorne; The AmericanTVIonthly Magazine of October, 1830, is listed because in it was Park Benjamin's review of the Token for that year, .wherein were " 8 lines laudatory of Hawthorne's tales in that volume."
Hawthorne has not been translated very much, l*Yance and Germany alone having his works, in whole or in part, rendered into their vernaculars. NV>r have his stories been drasgdLtized1, with the exception, of “ Th<? Scarlfet^tter.” That has served fb* Tthe Jlbr^a/pf on© opera, by 'W&tter Dqincosch arid peorge Parsons Lathrop, and ^5 the basis of three plays* .only two -of which. have been published. In view of the use by drama- *. tists of sd* many xindramatiCi Stories, it is rather tsuridtt? that'"Hawthorne 'has not been used is material for sta£<^ purpose#.
An interesting ’feature of the volume Is the correction of various ndcriptlbns of . authorship to Hawthorne'. '*	Bald	;
