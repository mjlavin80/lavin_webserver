THE "PERFECT GENT.”
How to Be One Explained at Length by an Expert.
T must be hard to find yourself called to be a social mentor—for no one will heed your teachings, or behold them with anything: but amusement- But that fact probably does not worry such a
teacher; the same spirit that moves' him to take up the task has mercifully deprived him of any sense of humor. (Not always. We knew a man who compiled a book on etiquette as a joke; it was the reviewers who took it seriously.)
The latest person who feels called to tell us how to behave is Mr. Charles Harcourt. He signs his preface " C.
H., (F. L.*\)—a mysterious signature. Mr. Harcourt has not always been destitute of a sense of humor, for he has read Kipling- and quotes Punch—and we are not among those who consider the reading of Punch incompatible with a sense of humor. But Mr. Harcourt now is without a drop of that allaying Tiber; “ buttons " are the top mark for his soul now. “ 4 Good Form 1 is not written for mere votaries of fashioh," he says. ** Its purpose is to help the man, be he a member of a rural community or of the club circles of a city, who desires to regulate his life after the manner of gentlemen.” That wonderful thing, the Typical Club Man, possesses his mind, just as it does’that of the nursemaid.
Mr. Harcourt covers the ground of good form rvo -carefully as the unknown author t-f “ The Complete Letter Writer ” covered his subject. He begins with ** Dress and the Toilet,’* and ends with Smoking.” He certainly tells many things. For example, in the first-named chapter he tells you how to bow j when wearing a soft hat: M The action , is most gracefully accomplished by seizing the crown of the hat and lifting it from the head." The crown or the j hat? And suppose it’s a new hat, and | doesn’t come apart easily? How about ^ the little finger in this case and in drinking tea? Should it be separated I froWi the other fingers? In this chap- j ter Mr. Harcourt further assures us i that his ideal man uses dumbbells and ; Indian clubs after his morning tub, I and doesn't shave. Of course, he may have a beard, but if he has none, when does he shave?
The chapter called " In Public " is a fund of Harcourt-Courtleyian information. We quote an eloquent lesson on driving: ‘4 In entering a carriage, if you are to occupy the seat on your left hand, put your left foot on the step, your right just inside the vehicle; then bring the left forward and beyond the other foot, and with a half turn sink into your seat. The other seat will be gained by reversing the process."
In hia chapter on “Dinners, Lunch-■ eons. Suppers," Mr. Harcourt is distinctly happy. “ Unfold your napkin and place it across your knees. That is the only place for it when not in use”; In other words, don't use It as a bib or apron, and don’t hang it on the j shoulder of ** the lady who you take I In." " The game is reinforced by Burgundy " is a lovable phrase. As soon as you are served, commence to eat in a leisurely manner,** says Mr. Harcourt. Here we dissent; if you begin to "eat at once, eat fast—then you get a chance for a “ second portion/' for the waiter may think he has overlooked you. At a luncheon “ leave your hat, stick, &c. In the hali, and greet your hostess in the drawing room," " &c/’ does not include your keys and loose change, but refers possibly to your “ gums ” or overshoes, and the parcel you are carrying with you.
The author explains the difference between a dance and a balL In his chapter on " Correspondence ” he says we ought to say “ L. D. Sampson, Esq., M* IX,” and in that on “ Smoking ” he tells us we ought to pay from $2 to $5 for a brier pipe. He“ advises us. further how to care for our pipe after we get It —information th^t hardly seems to us to come under his definition of good form—44 the manifestation 61 good breeding."
But why jeer at Mr. Harcourt and his book? It is written in good faith, if not In good form, and contains hints that should be helpful. Raise your hat to the hearse In a funeral procession;:
lemove your hat and rise to your feet when the national anthem is played at any public entertainment; good advice this, that we Americans sadly need.
*	There is an unfortunate tendency to laxity of conversation in the absence of the other sex Mr. Harcourt might add, “ and in the presence of the other sex " never mention a woman’s name unless to pay her a compliment ”—an extreme rule, but based on sound principles. One of his own rules Mr. Harcourt breaks constantly: “ To use a foreign word or phrase when an English one would equally well express your meaning is affectation." He writes, be on the qui vive,” mauvaise honte, savoir faire, sur le pied de la plus grande famillarite, and as his printer has no accents to his type, the affectation which he cultivates is glar-^ ingly apparent. It is comically so 'in his advice to young men to pay their M party calls"; if they don’t, they “ must not be surprised if a woman so neglected should biffe their names from her list." But consistency is the vice of a weak mind, and n6 one could imagine that a person so intensely serious as Mr. Harcourt had anything but a mind of the solidest construction.
