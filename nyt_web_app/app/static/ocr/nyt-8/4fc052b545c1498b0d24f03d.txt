mean? Are we to.believo that this house, once the habitation of an author ot national—yes, of International—imputation has been allowed to pass Into private hands? Has not public interest been stirred up sufficiently to keep this place free from restraint and opened to a respecting' public?
Directly opposite the cottage is a city park named after the poet. Its acreage Is two and it is laid out tastefully. Suppose the city should get possession of this house, why could it not be moved from its present location and placed in the centre of this preserve. Here it would be safe | from the encroachment of time; here fire would be less likely to burn it down, and here could be a Poe museum where mementos of all sorts could be gathered under the very roof where Edgar Allan Poe himself passed se.veral years. That genius of his may not transcend to the aspirant, but such a place would be filled with inspiration.

But when people come from the Battery or from Brooklyn, Queens, or Richmond, to the Bronx intent on *' visiting ” this Poe cottage they are sadly disappointed.
I The public at large is not counted on, for when the pilgrim arrives is she or he not j confronted with a placard hung out conspicuously bearing the following words: i ’’Private Property—No Trespassing*” Now the good friends who have come so far to ■' visit ” are held back by this terrible warning. Of course they may view the house and observe the leg-end on it telling of Poe having his residence here during is44-0. and above it they may see the picture of a raven, but nothing more. You may ask why, but only the verses can answer.
