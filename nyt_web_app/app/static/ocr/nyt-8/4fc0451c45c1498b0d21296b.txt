Tlie Collected Letters of the Famous Historian and Cbarcbtuan.*
LtTHOUGH Bishop Stubbs was
-	an ardent churchman In his acceptance-of dogma and In his ideal of priestly duty* It is unquestionably aa a historian that he will be remembered and most be reckoned ■with by students of English history. To the volume of his letters just published is prefixed an Introductory chapter on the events and incidents of his youth. Beyond that there Is little more j than such comment as Is necessary to explain the letters which deal almost entirely with public affairs and the historical and religious questions in which his Interest centred to the exclusion of nearly everything else. The only family letter
printed is one to his aunt, written when he was sixteen y fears old, and his references to the members of his family are of the scantiest.
The Bishop came of yeoman ancestry, and could trace his line back to the middle of the fourteenth century. He felt that as a future historian he was fortu-nateHTn the place and circumstances of his birth. His ancestors were devoted to Church and State, all of them apparently having been (phurch Wardens. His grandfather was out in the Gordon riots, and a more remote forefather had a gift of land from John of Gaunt. His earliest recollection was of the burning of York Minster, his first drive was across Mar-ston Moor, and his grandfather’s house stood on the site of the battle of Bor-oughbridge. It was on these and similar pegs of family history that he began to hang the historical studies that were at once the labor and the pastime of his arduous life. His appeal was eloquent that the storehouse of Jiistory.which England is should be thoroughly explored, with every parish as a starting point
William Stubbs was bom In 1825. His father was a solicitor of Knaresborough, and died when William, the eldest child, was sixteen, leaving his wife to face the problem of supporting and educating six children on extremely narrow means. Soon after his father's death WUliam obtained through Bishop Long ley the appointment of servitor at Christ Church, Oxford. He at once took hts place among the serious scholars of his college, and readily made friends, despite u native reserve and the social disadvantages accompanying the position of servitor. In his day these disadvantages were Tar from trivial. but whatever annoyance they may have caused him did not obliterate his strong sense of Indebtedness to Christ Church, for which. throughout his life he cherished an ardent sentiment.
When he was elected Fellow of Trinity he threw himself zealously into the study of church history. The only indication he ever gave of disagreeing with the doctrines or practice of the institution he reverenced was at tbe early age of six. when he announced to his grandmother his dislike of the Prayer Book, *' because it says a man may not marry his grandmother. and I mean to marry you.** After that single revolt all was conformity. Aa a FeUow he emphatically was counted among the High Churchmen and the adherents of Dr. Pusey, although he was of those to whom the elaborate ritual was an unimportant detail and regarded as often a hindrance.
In 1850, when he was twenty-five, he accepted the college living at Navestock, and there for eighteen years he labored as a devoted parish priest, sharing in the life of hfs people and indefatigable In visiting them, multiplying the number of church services previously held, and preaching more than the usual quota of sermons.
His first published work. " Reglstrura Sacrum Angllcannm,’* described as ” an attempt to exhibit ihe course of Episcopal Succession In England.” wa^ printed In 1858, ten years after it was begun. The task had been enormous, but was a magnificent preparation for the path of mediaeval history which for so many years he was to tread, giving him an enviable equipment In paleography as well as in history. It served also as an introduction to the long-continued and familiar correspondence with Freeman. Although the letters that passed between the two are little more than intimate comments and discussions of abstruse points in history and archaeology, the friendly spirit of their intercourse Is constantly manifest. The acquaintance with the historian Green began in	and.	of	its initial incident
Bishop Stubbs gives the following animated description In his farewell lecture at Oxford:
We were invited to Wells, to a meeting of the Somerset Archaeological Society, to stay with a common friend whom you will have no difficulty In identifying. T was told, “ If you leave the station at 2

I dare say that I aired my erudition so far as to tell him that t was going to the archaeological meeting and to stay at Somerleaxe. •* Oh* then." he said, “you must be either Stubbs or Dimock." I replied I am not Dimock.rr He. came' to me at Navestock afterward and that volume of Renan found its way uncut Into my waste paper basket.
In the life of Green the incident is given In substantially the same way, with the added tonch of Green's amusement that he should be saved from the ungodly Renan by so transparent a device. The friendship thus begun lasted during Green's life. He and Freeman, with Stubbs, made an engaging trio, dl-verse enough In methog, but having In common the great object of interpreting England to herself and pursuing their I way without a trace of petty jealousy or self-seeking.
When, In 1866, Stubbs was appointed to the Regius Professorship of Modern History, os the successor of Goldwln Smith, Green thus wrote of him:
No two men could at first sight seem more unlike than the brilliant, epigrammatic politician and the profound, but i comparatively obscure, historian who fol- 1 lows him, but beneath this outer dissfml- j larlty lie. In fact, strong points of resemblance, both in temper of mind and In the mode in which either would view the subject he proposed to teach. Both are essentially Idealists; both are men of deep and earnest convictions, both are of a temper—which ardent partisans as they are—raises them high above what passes i for-party feeling; both have distinct cooral theories, and both are bold and frank enough to state their moral theory as the ground of their historic teaching. Above all. both are larger than the mere chair which they fill. Each is In different ways admirably fitted to combat and counteract that narrowness of view which Is* the especial bane of university life—whether like the one, by linking Its studies with the thoughts and hopes and strut^l^s nf the world without it or, like the other, by grasping tn Its whole extent the study which he himself Is pursuing, and by revealing to Oxford the position which she actually occupies In the general area as It were, of intellectual Inquiry.	’
Nothing1 could better define the peculiar merits of the historian whose ambition It was to found a school of history which should buiftl not upon Hallam and Pal-grave and Kemble and Froude and Mac-Rulav. but on ** the abundant, collected, and arranged materials on which these writers tried to build when they were scantv and scattered and In disorder." His method was that of the scientific worker, and his view was broad, yet In certain ways he was sufficiently limited, and even sought limitation. It may well be doubted If one active tn many fields of thought could have kept himself from nnv allusion to work foreign to his own In a day when Carlyle, Darwin. Hurley. Soencer, Tyndall, Browning, and George Eliot were writing, and It Is highly characteristic of Bishop Stubbs that none of these names appear In his correspondence. He also kept quite free from the acknowledgment of any change of belief among the clergy and laity. The schools of thought represented by Bishop Co-lenso and “ Essays and Reviews,’* on the one hand, and Canon Gore and “ Lux Mundi." on the other, were to him as though they did not exist. Much against his will, he was drawn officially Into the famous trial of the Bishop of Lincoln, and In his mention of It Is always the note of distress. He could say with a Iar^e proportion of sincerity tn making the acknowledgment that he did not believe a Dissenter could write a history of England. And he could refuse to break bread with a Unitarian minister.
