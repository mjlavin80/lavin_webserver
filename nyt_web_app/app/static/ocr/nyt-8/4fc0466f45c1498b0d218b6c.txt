|N no previous period in history has interest In colonization been at once so widespread and so acute. It is true that at certain times, due to the pressure of population or to the competition of commercial or military rivals, Greece and Home sent out colonies with eager and often reckless haste* and most of the countries of modern Europe have had an era in which the policy of so-called “ colonial expansion*’ became a senseless mania; but never before were so many civilized powers engaged, or so zealously engaged, in exploiting remote regions of the world. The vastness of tbe field of colonial activity, comprising nearly the whole of Asia, all of Africa, Oceania, and Australasia, and much of the territory of South, Central, and North America, reveals tbe wide range and the enthusiasm of the modern spirit of colonization.
Before one can attain to a just appreciation of the colonial policy of Europe the United. States one point must be clear, and that Is that the so-called •' colonies " are generally not colonies at all. They are " dependences,’* lands conquered and annexed for various purposes -as sources of food supply, or as possible markets for home products, or tho territory is coveted by a rival power, or It is fancied as a military or naval base, or held for the mere glory of conquest. Only Russia, in Siberia ana in Central Asia, and Japan in Formosa, have planted true colonies. And Japan alone of the great powers is making a serious attempt to establish 3 true colony in tropical lands. Europe and the United States are not settling or colonizing, in the tropical regions; they are merely governing certain dependencies there.
This point is brought out by Mr. Ireland, but not with sufficient clearness until the " Conclusion " of this admirable, satisfactory, and unlimltedly suggestive book. It should have been made at the be ginning, as the distinction between a colonv and a dependency, and the true classification of all tropical possessions as • depend«vu ies," are necessary to a clear understanding of the conditions and problems.

THE author limits hi? investigation to the Far Eastern tropical dependencies of four Western powers—
(; rea t Britain. the United States. Holland, and France. To the British dependencies are devoted about one-half the volume, and includes studies of Hongkong, North Borneo. Sarawak. Burma the Federated Malay Stairs, and the Straits Settlements; France is represented by lndo-Ohina,
ire;(ted rather inadequately hut instructively, in fourteen pages, and Holland by Java, to which is given twenty-six pages, not full pnnjch to satisfy, and to the American dependency of the Philippines ijj devoted the remainder of tht* book, except the “ Conclusion." or about one-fourth of the whole. The Philippines are indeed treated more fully and more satisfactorily than any other dependency
Air Ireland's preparation for writing sin h a book was unquesionaMy thorough He had already spent ye:irs in studying the dependencies of European nations In t h° tropics when, in 19ol, lie was appointed Colonial Commissioner of the Univer-s:t> of Chicago for the purpose of making a report on colonial administration in Southeastern Asia, The " report ” will comprise ten or twelve volumes, arid this single volume is the essence and sum of the whole. The map of Southeastern Asia which accompanies the book and whh h is probably the best available map of that part of thp world, was prepared by the author. Thi*-- and the bibliography and the statistical appendix give untiMial value to the book.

To American readers the work Is peculiarly attractive and stimulating. Perhaps It win appeal to us more than to the people of any of the other holders of dependencies In the tropics, as It not only Institutes a thorough comparison of our colonial administration with that of our rivals, but it is a sharp, often a mordant, criticism of our conduct and of our general policy and ideals. The spirit of the writer, when be deals with the course this country has followed ip the Philippines, is even a little censorious. He seems to reveal some prejudice and feeling against us, and his criticism of American ideals as applied to Che islands is positively corrosive. If our Ideals are wrong we must be very far afield. We could only blunder into success, and Mr. Ireland thinks we are blundering deeper into wrong and approaching nearer and nearer to disaster.
THE failure the author finds in the American policy he ascribes to our ignorance of the nature and the history of tropical lands. We are stupidly and futilely trying to establish a colony In a region where only a dependency is possible, to transplant democratic ideals where only autocratic ideals are conceivable. The tropics, he contends, haye “ added nothing to human advancement " for five hundred years, and that *' a Western Government can be maintained in
tropical countries only as long as white men are on tbe spot to keep things in line/* This notion Is not new, nor is it entirely sound, as great civilizations have arisen within the so-called " heat belt,” whether we define it by the isotherms of 68 degrees Fahrenheit, or by the thirtieth degree north and south parallels of latitude. But it is so nearly true that it will serve as a dependable working hypothesis. Granted that it is not possible to establish tn the tropics a permanent Western government to be administered by natives, and that it is also not possible to endow a tropical people with Western civilization and ideals, and the failure of American aims in the Philippines is written on the wall, for they are exactly the things we are trying to do.
American readers will find Mr. Ireland’s treatment of Hongkong and Sarawak, the ideal British dependencies, especially interesting, as the former may teach us much in rt-spect to the management of Manila, and the latter holds many good lessons that could be applied to the gen- j eral administration of the Philippines, | A wise policy has in sixty years made Hongkong the greatest seaport -of the world Sarawak was the demesne of the famous Rajah Brooke, and now of his familx. Its history reads like a-romance-the most marvelous political romance in modern times.
is as far removed from the story of tho .floody conquest, “ pacification," and government of the Philippines as could be placed in the limits of one world. There has been jx-ace where the sword and torch ravaged ia our Islands, and there have jeen prosperity, progress, and happiness ■vhere have failed to create the fouh-jation of either. And these happy results ^ere, according to Mr. Ireland and histo-lans. due to the establishment of a strong centralized Government. He quotes 1 froude:
” Find a Raja Brooke [of Sarawak] if ou can *	*	*	fend him out with nc
jiore instructions than the Knight of I>a Mancha gave Sancho to tear God and do nis duty *	*	* The leading of the wise

French Indo-(’hina and Java have nat! urally n« t so much to teach us as have | the British dependencies, although Mr. Ireland draws a luminous and suggestive purallel Im rn the French colonial pokey and our own, England and Hoi--land, he points out. sought colonies in the tropics because ** the progress of dis-

Of the Dutch in Java we should like to have more than tho author gives u». This is, In fact, the least satisfactory portion of the book. “ One of tho most striking characteristics of Dutch colonial enterprise is the entire absence, throughout almost the wliole range of Dutch colonial history, of any spirit of imperialism or of any desire for territorial aggrandizement." In view of the fact that Holland permitted for years the systematic and wholesale plundering of the Javanese by the Dutch Blast Indies Company, a company that in the words of the Dutch publicist, De Souter, had only ** profits as its lodestar and greed as its compass,” and of the outrageous war o£ a hundred years that the Netherlands have waged against the Achinese In Sumatra, this high tribute seems a trifle overwrought. But that the Dutch have achieved a great success in their dependency of Java, and are now generally entitled to the praise of having no ** imperialistic ” sentiments, is manifestly true. Their methods, at least many of them, seem to us a compromise with vice and evil for the sake of political exigency, and would not be tolerated by public opinion in the United States.

MOST American readers will doubtless turn at	once to what Mr.	Ireland
has	to say	of the Philippines and
of	our first	experiment with	a de-
pendency in the Far Eastern tropics. And they will find there much that will	inevitably interest them,	much
that will challenge ‘their attention because the observation has been from the viewpoint of an Englishman, much that will help to sweep away certain illusions that many of them have cherished, and much that will irritate because of the frank hostility to American ideals j and methods. But no one can read this Illuminating criticism of our aamtnlstra-tlon of the Philippines without obtaining a clearer knowledge cf a most difficult situation and a better appreciation of the intricate and perplexing problems that confront us.
Mr. Ireland is inconsistent, however, in his view of the purposes or motives that led us into the Far Eastern tropics. On page 1H6 he says:	"It is a matter of
plain fact that in the whole of recorded history there cannot be found a single Instance of a nation which, having reached a certain stage of economic develop* ment. has not embarked upon enterprises of territorial expansion, that this phenomenon in the growth of nations has persisted in all climates and under every form of government ” It is more natural, he thinks, to attribute " the over-sea expansion of the United States " to the ** continuous chain of human evolution " than to regard it as abnormal. But on page U64 he discards the theory of " economic development ” and ” continuous chain of human evolution 1 for the theory of utter abnormality. He says:	“	The
case of the Pnited State? is simple in the extreme; it may be summed up in the phrase ' expansion by accident.’ ” According to the author, the entire fourse of the United States with respect to the Philippines has been marked hy indecision, incompetence, a blind ignorance, or a stultified indifference to the experience of other nations engaged in the same kind of work, and. gravest of all errors, false and impracticable ideals We coquetted with Apuinaldo and his revolution. recognizing him as an ally until we had used him and his army to accomplish our purpose tlon fm^ature and only vagut !y guessed at l>y ourselves—and finally repudiating him and waging a bloody war of coiwpn st and extermination against the Filipinos The summing up of the evidence against us in this particular is sweeping and leaves us In a deplorable situation: but the IslandH are ours, and how are we justifying our conquest and government of them? Not at all, says Mi Ireland. The verdict of history will be against us. as the verdict or universal experience already against us But we have, he says on Page 1K0. a “contempt for universal experience." We have undertaken to solve a world problem long ago solved brilliantly by Greece end Rome and Tyre, and recently England and France and Holland, but we are going to solve it in our American way. or not at all.
THE “pernicious influence of American home politics on Philippine legislation 11 atid "the narrow vision of local officials ” receive due comment* and, of course, due castigation. Mr. Ire-
; land's point of view and his despair of our accomplishing any goOd in the Islands are clearly and forcibly presented In tbe fol-
E
; lowing:
** r was shown in the Philippines some of i the most wretched roads I have seen tn e fifteen years -ot colonial travel, and was asked with pride whether England had ever done anything tike that for the bene> fit of her colonial subjects; and when 1 . replied that you could travel a thousand miles in an automobile Ln the Fed* era ted Malay States on roads a* good as the Massachusetts Btat« roads, my statement was met, it not with absolute incredulity, at least with, the last degree of surprise. It was rhe same thing- in a hundred matters. Had any nation except the United States ever given the natives of a colony any voice in their own government, or given titem an honest judiciary, or a good water supply, or an efficient police force* or ever governed a colony with any -other object than deriving revenue from it? And »o on through the whole range of colonial administration! It fs obvious that if a body of men. from lack of comparative ^knowledge, honestly believe that the work they are doing is better than that of ail others in tho same field, the prospect of Jinprovement originating within the administrative hierarchy Is reduced to a minimum.”
And so. after the clearest, sanest, best -reasoned, and frankest investigation that has yet been made of American rule in the Philippines, Mr. Ireland pronounces It, to the present moment, a failure. It Is a searching and stimulating criticism, that wfll do good perhaps in exact proportion to its irritation of our National pride.	STANHOPE	SAMS.
