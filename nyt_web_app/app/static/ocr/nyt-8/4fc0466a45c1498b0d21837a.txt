.Verc York Times Saturday Rcvitic of fitx>ks:
In your Issue of last Saturday, und«*r " Topics of the Wefk," you ask:	” If you
were to be in the wilderness a whol*1 month with only one boob, what book would you choose? ’*
I think this question likely to arouse a widespread interest and I anticipate that you will be inundated with answers. For my part, the one book would be “ Thf Autocrat of the Breakfast Table.” by Oliver Wendell Holmes. I first read this about twenty years a&o, and then and there formed a friendship with the genial, lovable autocrat, which, has Increased as the years have rolled on, and if instead of a month being the time limit. It was for the rest of my life—even if that was lengthened unto threescore years and ten —of all the books I have ever read, I should unhesitatingly say, " Give me my well-beloved and well-marked Autocrat.*' H.
