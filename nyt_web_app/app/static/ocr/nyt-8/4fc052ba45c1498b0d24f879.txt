RS. GOODWIN’S new novel 13 characterized by a plot of striking:	originality.
r While camping in the Rocky Mountains one man saves the life of another at the risk of bis own. Naturally, the man rescued feels imposed upon him a lifelong burden of gratitude and obligation. but he is made miserable by an invincible dislike of the man to whom he owes his life. The situation grows complicated when both love the same girl, when the man so leeply in* debted to his rival becomes aware of his ingrained dishonor, and when the father of the girl appeals to the sorely harassed debtor to know whether his preserver Is ** a trustworthy man,” one who will make ** a safe husband.” How to adjust the claim of the heroic savior of one’s life with the counter-claim of truth and of loyalty to a woman beloved is the problem Mrs. Goodwin’s hero has to solve. She manages the | situation with great adroitness, and has j woven from it a story of intense interest, one that will be breathlessly followed from the first page to the last.
Quite apart from the ingenious plot, the novel is full of both power and charm. The author’s characters are vital, her touch is brilliant, her pages I coruscate with flashing, succinct say- | ings. One is startled to see her definl- 1 tion of epigram as " another name for, the clever statement of an untruth," for she is nothing if not epigrammatic, j Indeed, her style, admirable as it is, is not wholly free from the vice of overcleverness. We are moved to protest, too, against sundry weighty little reflections occasionally dragged in* and | reminding one of George Bliot at her worst. Nor do we like in the glancing I touch and go of conversation, ex-cathe- i dra utterances upon large subjects, re- j marks dropped into the stream, and I neither explained nor followed to any ^ logical conclusion, as, for example:
The liquor business is as good as any .other if it is honestly conducted. -
If immortality were an established fact I should regard it as the jrowntng Injustice of life.
Both these opinions, by the bye, are those of Dr. Dilke, Mrs. Goodwin’s leading character, to whom we are inclined to refuse the allegiance an author is wont to claim for her hero. He is a strong and a very human young man, but somewhat bumptious and conceited withal, with something a little repellant in his attitude toward the man who had imperiled his life to save him: while as a son one cannot but recalled that saddest word of disillusioned maternity, " Who would be a mother if she could know how slight a thing she would be to her son when she is old ? "
It is rather unfair, however, to count 1 it against a writer that she does not give us a faultless hero; but when he slips away from his creator, as we think Dr. Dilke has done, and insists Upon making a worse appearance than she intended, criticism is perhaps in order* The heroine is a charming girl, though one sympathizes with the choleric papa over the bad housekeeping which eliminates such'essentials as ink and pens; and one finds her less interesting than the very reprehensible cousin with the immortal Becky’s eyes and hair, and something of her temperament. The irascible father la capital, and there are few better drawn figures in modern fiction than Uiat of Jacob Secor, who buys honor, a Sena-torship, a fascinating wife with his worse than tainted millions, and even achieves a -sort of personal respectability by reason of the sense of obligation to his purchased position.
The chapter describing his Initial effort to woo consideration by means of philanthropy is a fine bit of Incisive Barcasm softened by humor. The struggle of the Pieria Public Library Committee against the acceptance of rioney gained by unblushing fraud, the way in which it enmeshes itself in sophistries, the fearful extent to which the sudden appearance of the benefactor embarrasses the dedication of the new

Mrs. Goodwin has Scored a triumph in the difficult character of Brandyce, ff man void of honor, yetforcing unwilling admiration for his fine qualities." The art of fiction has become top subtle to paint a rascal all blade, and this one is so well managed that " the pity of It ” is the dominant impression. The final revelation of hiB baseness seems rather clumsily brought about, but to bring it about at just the right moment necessitated a little creaking of machinery. Mra Fenwick is one of those delightful old ladies one loves to meet. Her letter to her niece is as racy as possible. Uitlike her irreverent nephew, who declared " one week in her courtsM to be *' better than a thousand—much better," we wish we had more of her—much more.
Although the story is almost overweighted with its detachable brilliants, it is the rare case of 41 embarrassment of riches "—the great majority thereof being gems, not paste. Mrs. Goodwin’s " wit and wisdom,” or, more accurately, her witty wisdom, would make a notable collection from which voice and pen would be tempted largely to filch. We have never been inclined to quarrel with those books the fingers of one hand abundantly suffice to count which give us conversation more scintillating than the intercourse of real life dan summon on the instant. It is good to have the ineffectual “ staircase wit M of actuality brought back into the drawing room of imagination.
“ Claims and Counterclaims ** is to be hailed as combining the many fine qualities that go to make a novel of high merit. Its unique plot, its lifelike characters, its brilliant execution in both dialogue and movement, are all crowned by a novel's raison d’etre—its absorbing Interest.
