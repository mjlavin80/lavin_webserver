Netc York 7'itnes Saturday Review of Book*:
Edwin Markham's ■' Virgilia," in the
August Cosmopolitan, was declared in
this correspondence to be “ the noblest
love poem of any length yet produced in
America-" In making this statement I
was speaking not only for myself, but
also for a gentleman of fine feeling, a
student familiar with all that is best in
the poetry of both England and America.
“ Virgilia " gives us beautiful tropes and
far-reaching ideas, and carries at the
same time a fine atmosphere of wildness,
most appropriate to the mood and motive
of the poem. The climax is woven out of
tbe noblest emotion of man.
But in The New York Times Book
Review of last Saturday appeared two
adverse criticisms of the poem, and I am
forced to say that they are the poorest
efforts at criticism that ever came under
my eye. Our poetry is indeed in a bad
way if it has to suffer this sort of mis-
understandiiig. These two critics of the
poem—Mr. George W. Taylor and Mr.
Stephen A. Clow—seem to know how to
write with clearness and brevity, but
they are as blind as bats on the poetry
side of the brain. They cannot tell a flower of poesy from a weed of prose.
Let me refer to their remarks on Mr. Markham’s poem, especially to their remarks on the following stanzas already quoted:	■
Do you mind that hour in the soft sweet morning.
When I held you fast in divine alarms— When my soul stood up like a god adorning	‘
His body with bright arms?
Forget it not till the crowns are crumbled And the swords of the Kings are rent with rust;
Forget it not till the hills lie humbled And the springs of tht* seas run dust.
Now, the host of your readers will feel the fine poetry of these lines; they will be moved by the beautiful simplicity and majesty of *the utterance. N(St so with Mr. Taylor. He says:	:
** Do you mind that hour is too commonplace." I say that it is <a strong phrase and perfectly In tone with - the | poem. Rossetti uses the word ** mind *’ in a similar sense.	I
2.	" Divine cannot be made to qualify
1 alarms.* ” Certainly Mr. Taylor knows , little about love, if he does not know that a noble love lifts one into the region of the spiritual—that the alarms or emotions of a great love are divine.
3.	“ T*he measure of the fourth line Is j awkward.** What sort of an ear has Mr. j
| Taylor? Or does he test a line of verse by counting the syllables! That fourth t i line swings pe'rfectly with the fourth line of the _second -stanza quoted. Efech has !
! four accents, although they do not have i the same number of syllables.	1
4.	*■ Difficult to catch the sense of j I these stanzas." Well, this Is too much! 1
If Mr. Taylor ean*t " catch the sense ” of , I these perfectly plain verses, then the books of poesy will be as stoutly sealed j to his mind as the secrets of lost Lamuria. In this ■unguarded remark Mr. Taylor re- i veals one Of the great reasons why our poetry is Baid to be in a decline. His only i hope is to turn for his poetry to the clarified verses of “ tbe Sweet Singer of j Michigan! ” The charge of obscurity cannot be leveled against the work of our. poets, least of all against the poems of Edwin Markham.
Now for Mr. Clow’s, strictures on Mr, Markham's* •* Virgilia/’ He says one good thing—“'Alliteration ..should be the gargoyle, not the column.” This. Is. wqII thought ‘and well said. And doubtless there wEtTbe .readers who will Ihink -that Mr.. Storkhaha sometimes presses^ftjs. .al-UterO.Use. bei\uty< toa far. But7 Mr. Clow

In all of lila <?£heV strlcturep is ^y^n rnor^.. reckless, than tSlr. Taylor* L^t us >eoosi(fer 7 a tew: ' .„y-\	■	-	<■

others? A lyric is any snnglike expression of strong emotion.
li. “ Barrenness ” is Mr. now’s next objection to “ Virgilia." Kach reader will decide this point for himself. To me the poem seems «rowded with idea?, all caught in the web of noble emotion.
3.	" In thLs poem I can find hardly one Image, one metaphor, that is not strained, trivial, or false.” Against this wild statement let me quote a few If the images: " The world’s fang,” ” the pain that the first gods kneaded Into all joy.” ” a sea" child nursed by the surge and thunder,” ** marked for the lyric grief,” " the high gray cliff in the pool hangs double.” •* there on the cliff Is the seabird s tavern.” These are enough to show Mr. Markham’s fresh, vigorous imagery.
4.	** Take the two lines from the second stanza quoted:
That lone last peak of my soul had spoken,
That last peak lost in light.
Who ever heard of a peak speaking? "
I cries Mr. Clow. ” And supposing a peak could speak, imagine honeyed love-accents from its craggy lips! ” Come, come, Mr. Clow, you must find out what poetry really is. Get you to your Bible and your Byron! Does not Isaiah tell how " the mountains and hills shall j break forth into singing ” ? And does | not Byron tell how * Jura answers from ' her misty shroud? ’*	*	•	* O Isaiah,
! who ever heard of a mountain slng-ing? ” It Is pitiful that you did not j have a modern Clow to revise your j prophesies:	•	•	* Alas\ Mr. Clow
| fails us at every point. He tninks that the peak in the Markham poem is expected to utter " honeyed love-aceents," when of course its ” craggy lips ” are expected to utter the deeper nature of the forlorn lover. Is it necessary to explain to Mr. Clow that the passage refers to the well-known Idea that it takes a sweetheart to bring out the best that Is
in a man?
But life is not long enough to follow this “ critic ** into all the caves and morasses of his criticism. I will give only one more sample of his floundering. He objects to the line,
The wild white foam of a river crumbles.
Picture foam crumbling,** exclaims our critic. Very well. I picture It. Who, in the name of the nine Muses, hasn’t seen foam crumble? And this, forsooth, is criticism! We can all see now what is the matter with the modern Muse or Poesy:	she is forced to struggle for-
ward, her feet wearied and her bright robes torn by the weight of Innumerable
Clows and Taylors.
