'* One of the most important, and to Prof. Flinders Petrie most perplexing,
‘ finds ’ is the newly discovered Inscription on the Stele of Merenptah," because " there is nothing in the inscription to corroborate the story'told in the Penta^ teuch.” (Page 520, Aug. 5.) Further on this most important and perplexing find is thus explained:	" The deliverance of
the Israelites from Egypt is turned into the deliverance of Egypt itself from the Lybian confederacy of raiding barbarians, among the hordes of which the Israelites were a scarcely distinguished unit.”
But Josephus Js surely a writer, with ' whose works every student is expected to be familiar. Eighteen centuries ago Aplon denied that the racial ancestors of the Homan Jews had ever been in Egyptl It was much as if a dispute bad arisen over the Norman ancestry of an English gypsy. Thereupon Josephus proceeded, to cite from Chaeremon, Lysimachus, Manetho, and other historians a series of stories about a certain foreign race which had invaded Egypt. Centuries later, from 80,000 to 250,000, Infected with leprosy and other diseases, were confined at Turr.i, opposite Old Cairo. They were afterward allowed to occupy Auaris, which had been abandoned by the Hyksos. Here they were joined by a force sufficient to command the neck of the delta and the trade routes between Memphis and Suez,, as well as Thebes and Kosselr. They were besieged by an allied force coming down the Nile, and, having been unable to keep control of the water supply, were forced to surrender. As they could not take “ their cattle and their little ones." more than a three days' journey through the desert, they could not retreat westward. Tho " mixed multitude '* made its way to Suez; and a Greek tradition says that Miriam, sister of Moses and Aaron, bathed in the well in the Wadi Arabah. Whether this account be true or only the Egyptian side of the story, there is nothing novel, surprising, or important in Its corroboration of the Stele.
In the first century of the Christian era. there were innumerable scholars reading demotic and hieroglyphic. Forty centuries do not impair the legibility of a papjrrus; and the events described were only about fourteen centuries old. The trouble is largely due to that " Pithom ’* stone, with its inscription " Ab Ero In Clusma, vilir M," thus fixing its date in A. D. 1SS2, or, say, between M. Naville's departure- from Tel el Maskuta on Saturday morning and his return on Monday. As Mommsen said, and Cesare da Caro (OH Hyksos) conceded, this precious document could only be i interpreted as showing that for the trav- ] eler (eunti) going toward Clysma (Suez) Ero, with its “ bricks ” and storehouses was nine miles behind him!	i
When a Hermes is unearthed it speaks for itself, but an inscription, especially if, as in the case of the " Pithom ”(?) stone, a few scratches done with the point of a knife or chisel on a flooring block of limestone, has no such value as the Anto-nine itinerary, Plutarch, or the astronomical positions of Claudius Ptolemy.
Cultivated Egypt is usually compared with Belgium- How could G00,000 fighting men be interned; and oppressed in. Belgium or Maryland? It is equally absurd to contemplate a force ot Lybians camping,, in the desert, to- the west -of the Nile water. But if the-Tumilat-Goshen be rejected and. Avarls is identified with the-Fayoum, every detaLL is found to be exact, from Merenptah and Aahmes to Moses and the anti-Semites quoted by Josephus.
