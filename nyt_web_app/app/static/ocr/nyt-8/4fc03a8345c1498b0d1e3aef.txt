SCHOONfcT AKER'S drama of early Christianity te in the linte of saga dramas,. Biblical dramas, prehistoric dramas, &c., that have marked a certain reaction against modernity in literature, without proving their point, however, or satisfying the historic sense to any great degree. " The Saxons " has the advantage of an unhackneyed theme—the attempt (and failure) to introduce Christianity into the heathen North—but the story is not very clearly told. There are forty persons of the drama, besides fairies, gnomes, a dwarf, and a witch, classified 'as the " Saxon Unit," the ** Homan Unit/* the “ Greek Unit,” and the ” Su-•pernatural.” The distinctions between the’classes are not sharply made, and unless the reader is thoroughly informed or highly alert his mind will become more or less befogged in following the flight of the Saxons away from the Christians and the complicated relations among Oswald, Father Benedict, Sigurd, Selena. and-^Canzler. Nevertheless tho spirited movement of the dialogue testifies to a definite idea in the author’s mind, and many of the passages show a mental and moral energy rare enough in modem verse to be conspicuous. Such fragments as these have suggestion of Browningese about them, but their philosophy at least is sound and sufficiently stimulating;
The greatest man in this great world Is he who sees ail" things are going right
Yet fights as though all things were going wrong.
Nothing so rankles in the heart of God As to sw lirs fresh come from prayer for grace	*	.
Refusing justice.
To what man has a right.
He has a right because he is a man.
And not because he is a kind of man.
The diction is picturesquely irregular, and such expressions as " plopped ’* and " drixzling dag " may be taken as unpoetic license, not incompatible with charming lines and snatches of song quite filled with the lyrical spirit.
“ Sel£n£,” by Am£Ue Rives, is a more poetic if not a more dramatic production. The recital of the awak* ening of love in Sel£n£’s maidenly heart by the wiles of the “ little great god Love ’’ is frankly human. There Is no demand upon Intense sympathies, the story is well and swiftly told, and the poetry fulfills at least two-thirds of Milton’s requirement. It is both " simple " and “ sensuous,” and contains many passages of sustained beauty and poetic feeling, with such lapses, however, as the use of skyey,” *' beamy," “sheeny,” "splashy.” ” t wi-natured.” and other words that certainly are not to he conceived a^ having ” rushed like a thought to meet the poet's wish.”
The transference of sot iai conventions to the	courts ot Jupiter is £1-
way's soYnewhat amusing, and &el£n£s rebuke to the God of Love for not having appeared, a( i ordinj-c to her summons, ■’ in full panoply " ha.s a rinp of sophi.-stt'-ation. PeU'n-'s own adornment could easily he translated Into terms of the millinery of the present hour, but her charming figure stands quite firmly a.ml vividly erect, a thoroughly realized conception of girlish grace. She is given the **ull benefit of her various names, which suggest the array of titles of a modern German Princess—Rel£n£. Dian, Phoebe, Cynthia, Artemis, and—with an effect of excessive plain-speaking — the Moon. The book ends with a little rush of lyric verse which has the true singing quality:
SELENE.
Tfiou Jyri(ul water.
More sweetly thou stealest Althrough the dim covert Than into a day-dream The song of a throstle!
What name dost thou murmur? What message enchanting?
"Oh, hasten, beloved!”
Thou seemest to whisper;
** I weary of dreaming
And fain would behold thee! "
Oh, Hermes, thou tleet one.
My bow for thy sandals'
CHOR-VR.
O	ecstasy tender!
O	passionate yearning!

"The Lily.and the Prince of Spray,” a “ Drama of the Sea in Five Cantos,’* as its sub-title describes it, is more pretentious in characterization than in substance. The changes of its irregular meter are whimsical and fairly successful, and the thing attempted Is accomplished with apparent ease on the part of the writer. The result Is sufficiently amusing in a mild way; but Mr. Heywood's ability to do work more truly worth his and our while Is better estimated by the few examples of more serious verse grouped in the same volume with the drama. Slight as these are, they are well enough executed to convey the writer’s emotion. The following little poem called “ Beyond the Shore ” touches simply a universal mood:
Am I content? Ah, no! The stream of life
Has broadened out. The mists befog the shore.
My barque more frail, the waves upheaving toss And press It sore.
And when the tfde flows sullenly and deep,
I drift along—instead of working; wait
The unhidden ebb, and then despairing cry
Too late! Too late’
I know the shore is there. Long years ago
It was so close that I could almost touch
The blossoms on Us banka. I want them now
O	God! how much!
