N: 1707 Bonaparte had culled ~his harvest of laurels In Northern Italy ana Styrla,
, and the strong military trend thus given to Jacobin politics .	.	was perpetuated by the coup
d’etat carried out so drastically by Au-
geteau, the lieutenant of the young chief.

'Thereafter the Jacobins lorded it every1* where—at Paris and In the diplomatic arena. The Royalist and constitutional reaction in the interior of France was decisively crushed, and the Jacobin i swashbucklers who were raised to power condoned the egotistical doings of the young General who had really, though not ostensibly, assured their triumph. ! Thus, side by side with the exile or petty persecutions going on in Prance, we may observe the breakdown of the efforts = for peace put forth by Pitt and Malmesbury—efforts which we now know to have been sincere—the triumph of Bonaparte in'his diplomatic campaign with Austria, and the consequent treaty, that of Campo Formlo, (October, 1797,) which reduced Austria to an almost secondary place and Great Britain to isolation.
The Royalists of Prance felt the full force of these untoward influences. Wh'le those who remained in Prance were persecuted, the Emigres across the borders were everywhere neglected, or even openly flouted. The Prince of Cond£ was fain to take hfs discouraged little " army ” with him from Biiden to Volhynia, where he came under the balancing policy of Russia In place of the weak vacillat'ons of Francis of Austria and his henchmen in Swabia. The great Tsarilstf, Catherine II„ had died at the close of 1798, and the cause of monarchy found no able and determined champion on the Continent. Louis XVIII., from his retreat at Blank* enburg, in the Duchy of Brunswick, vainly sought to bring Prussia and Spain into the field and to Inspire courage into Austrin; but his efforts and those of hfs *’ Ministers," de Blacas and -others, only served to Illustrate the fatuity of the Royalist counsels.
As for the Comte d’Artois, residing at Holyrood, he exhibited all the petulance of youth and the unteachableness of old age. M- Daudet states that the British Government subjected him to some measure of surveillance, but it seems to have been very slight. The peevishness and the overweening pretensions of the femlgrGs led them to see slights and control, or even persecution, where none were intended, M. Daudet in his work on Piche-gru has already introduced students to the strange circles in which that Genera!, as well as Fauehe-Borel and other Royalist agents, moved, and he here enters into a description of their wider aims.
It must be confessed that the details of these Intrigues—e. g., of those which led up to the " catastrophe ” of Jan, 31, 17JJ7 —are of slight interest, and we think that here as elsewhere the author might with advantage have cut down his narrative.
In these obscure labyrinths the reader is apt to lose his way as well as his interest, because theii connection with the main course of events is not sufficiently emphasized.
The author would perhaps have been well advised had he concentrated more attention orf the great events, such as Fruetidor, As It Is, his narrative is occasionally open to the charge of a want of proportion. Fruetidor he dismisses in a
few pages. He, however, rightly points \

out that the fate of tho Royalist and constitutional parties at that crisis was due almost solely to th«ir want of a capable leader. Under able guidance they might readily have crushed the Jacobin minority—it was undoubtedly a minority—and thereby have altered the history of the
world. For in that case it is probable

that the ancient dynasty would soon have ! been recalled, and that Bonaparte might I have decided to act with the majority and

M. 'Daudet rightly credits Louis XVIII- j with one great quality, that of .opposing I to .his -misfortunes an Invincible tenacity | of purpose. Witness his remark In a letter to the PrinCe of Cond£ after the coup*d’4tat of Fruetidor:—“I am more afflicted than surprised at the events in Paris, We have always seen the rogues very wide awake and the good people off their guard." Even so, he hopes soon to . bring Condi's army from Poland nearer to the Rhine In order to profit by the revulsion of feeling tiat would follow on the adoption of terrorist methods by the Jacobites. There is something kingly In this constancy—a quality which never died out even In the darker days that were to come.
Into the later portions of the narrative, dealing with the. betrothal of Mme. Royale (daughter of Louis XVI.) with the Due d'Angoul£me. the forced departure of
-	Louis XVIII. from Blankenburg, his sojourn at Mittau, the renewed intrigues,
(In which Dumouriez and Wickham bore a part,) It is impossible to enter. M. Daudet everywhere commands the confidence of his readers by the thoroughness of his research and the sobriety of his judgment. With a self-restraint which by no means obscures the pathos of the genera! situation, he follows the fortunes of : “ the King *’ as they once more rise in 1 the year 1799, only to be dashed by the stroke of Brumaire. In January, 1801,
, Louis XVIII. received the order of thft Czar to leave his dominions. It is at that point, when the Royalist cause seemed at its last gasp, that M. Daudet closes his narrative in this volume.
