New York Times Saturday Review of Books:
■	I read with much interest in your issue of Aug. 12 Montgomery Schuyler's article on Dr. Payne’s anthology of the poems of Swinburne. But will you pardon me when I say that that same article contains about as many execrable words and sentences as any article of the like, com- | pass I have seen in a long time ? I should not be so churlish as to say this IE I were not of the opinion that the case illustrates to a nicety a widespread literary fault. Literary criticism, pur et simple—
I mean, literary criticism that is not at once chastened and made substantial by contact with life and affairs—Ift aspiring to be belletristic in flavor becomes emasculate and trifling. There -is too wide a divorce between literary appreciation and good, sound common sense. Too often the whole business suggests overreflnement. The literary man—enamored of mere style, casting envious glances at the urbane top-loftiness of Matthew Arnold or the ultra-delicacy of some one like Walter Pater—loses all sense of proportion, labors his phrases unduly, and in the long run j goes to incredible lengths in the way of : dilettante and inane expression. I know I nothing about Montgomery Schuyler. You ! may know that his general work does not at all lie open to my strictures. But, at : any rate, the article in question seems to me to point my moral exactly; and what ' I would lash is not this article hut 1ho , fault it exemplifies,	■	.
Let me transcribe some of the sentences, bracketing therewith a few stabs of comment:
(1) M For It is what that same Pal-grave, with that sureness of critical appreciation which showed Itself' not so much in what he said about hia poets as in the selections he so unfailingly made from them of their best, described as ‘ the brilliant lyrical gift ’ of Mr. Swln- j burne that alone needed or deserved the honors of an anthology in order to give in j manageable compass the measure of his poetical claims." [The sense of proportion restored even for an instant would con- | demn this.]	j
f2) "It is probably within bounds to i say that there is not one of Swinburne’s lyrics that would not gain by compression, and not only by such concision in the j planning as the poet alone could apply, but by sheer truncation of the finished product." (Sheer truncation of the fin- 4 ished product ” is the sort of thing one Indulges in when one forgets everything but mere language or manner.]	;
f3>	*' And so, ' the conception of self-
nothingness ’ being, according to one philosopher, * the grandest we can have,’ and being that which renders most men voiceless and a favored few voiceful, in the presence of the ocean or the stars, the poet who has it is a poet in virtue of having it." [Verbal trifling run riot.]
(4)	“ The ‘ format' of ‘ The Golden
Treasury ' is an admirable example, containing, one supposes, much more matter in fifty pages fewer and in a more convenient shape." [See reference above to ‘toploftiness.’)
(T») " That does not exactly strike us as a, good reason for including in the anthology the sonnets he wrote about those poets, so obliviscible, excepting by himself.” [" Obliviscible " is a vile word.]
To ctjnclude. let me say that the only criticism that is worth its salt is the criticism that is whole, sane, substantial, informing. I may be blinded by national basis, but I do think that British critics like, say, Goldwin Smith, Prof. Do'ffden, John Morley, are rarely guilty of this attenuation of manner.
