Melvina Drew is a. pen name. Under it Xjucie Rolande wrote an article about the folly of women of fashion in wasting i upon dogs what human being's were starving for, and especially the little children of the poor. The article was printed in
" her county paper ” somewhere in Kentucky and was copied and copied till It
reached tho ears of New York and made a groat stir. Lucie herself came to the whirlpool to speak to the fashionable. However, before all that happens, you have re.ii.l how Lucie was taken from her country home to the city on the Hudson, and how a great physician operated on hrr eves and cured her of an impending blindness. Also you have read „ of Miss Virginia Dell, who was rich and loved this great physician and had paid $10,000 for two degs. You hive even encountered a certain Lord Alexander, (a British peer at least.) who used to take Lucie driving, during her convalescence, behind a wonderful pair of thoroughbreds. Of course, in the end Lucie, with her enthusiasm for social service, marries the great physician, not Miss Dell, who spent $10,000 on two dogs, but, in the meantime, there are pages and pages of talk and i many characters are introduced, fashionable and unfashionable. Sometimes the I scene is New York, though to be sure you wouldn’t know it was New York. There I is a lack of definition and local color which argues in the author a rather | vague knowledge of what she names the metropolis.
