N&o York Times Saturday Review of Books:
Commenting on A- M. P.’s request for opinions regarding- the rereading- of fa-yorlte books, I would say that, wearied with current literature, the cambric-tea and swashbuckle romances of the hour, I return with pleasure to old-time favorites—Hawthorne's “ Scarlet Letter,” Hugo's " Toilers of the Sea,” Auerbach's *' On the Heights," Brontg’s " Jane Eyre/' ZangwIIl’s " The Master,” Stevenson's ever-gruesome.- ** Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and .Mr. Hyde/’ and many more books in which -flesh-and-blood men and women. strugrg-Ie- with the- real problems of existence, or vivid imagination weaves of brilliant threads, a magic carpet on which one can journey to the kingdom outside the wall of the commonplace.
T wonder if others have experienced this. The current novel may seem brilliant during perusal, the new scientific
■	work, written down to the average reader's supposed dull capacity, may contain much, information, but neither of these impresses m3 so strongly, nor remains so tenaciously ir^. the memory as the work of authors now relegated by the up-to-date young man and woman to the rank3 of the. “back numbers."
Regarding poetry, this may have weakened, because old-time herofo themes have been worn threadbare, and present-day happenings in tvhich heroism predomi-1 nates arc too clofee to our vision to make the pasteboard crown resemble the laurel wreath. Modem invention has so simplified and cushioned the struggle for existence that tbe thrill of* Inspiration does not
bound in red blood through the veins and tingle- In the finger tips, but courses tamely under the guidance of a chaperone in well-regulated streams that never overflow circumscribed banks.
Present-day magazine humor is vapid, or flippant. Real wit often emanates from the brain of the ’ newspaper hack, who,
' driven at topmost speed in the demand for “ copy," photographs by flash-i light a true- likeness of the latest sensa-;■ tion, or momentous-question of the pass-I ing- hour. For a companion in the wilderness, I would choose Shakespeare. He would cater to every mental need.
