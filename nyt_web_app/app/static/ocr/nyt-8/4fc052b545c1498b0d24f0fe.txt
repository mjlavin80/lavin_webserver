F the making of books on Michel de Montaigne there wilt probably be no end within anytime it is worth, while to consider in the art of literary prediction. Ths process has gone on with varying en2rgy for more than three t on Luries. There is a library about him in French possibly as numcr' ous—co r tain I y not so interesting1—as the one in hin belo\ ed tower. There is a considerable output from German sourccs, and o? late the English-speaking wojrld has welcomed the beginning of what promises to be a continuous currcnt of tr.in.slatJon, biography, comment, and commentary. The man was so various tn hi1; interests, which, nevertheless, v.vre those the humblest of his fellows could understand and in gre.it part share* he brought his shrewd observation to bear so penetratingly on matter* common to mankind; his audacious judgment dealt so intimately with the conditions of daily life; and especially l.e had so r ire a gift of persuasive, convincing candor—tbe air of talking "in confidence, almost in secret, with each of his readers—that he has won, and must win, a certain nu:nber of eager confidants, In each succeeding generation, who seek his company with a sort of passionate curiosity which he constantly rewards and stimulates and rarely wearies. It Is no wonder that his words find renewed appreciation, as time passes, in other lands than his own,, in later times immensely changed from his own, an^i a^e rendered lovingly into languages so different from that he employed, fashioned. and enriched.
The latent tribute of admiration for Montaigne reaches us from London, and is th^ work of a lnlv, Constance Countess de la Warr. It is entitled, simply enough, “ Thoughts from Montaigne,” and is published by ISveieigh Nash. The title is slightly misleading, as nearly half of the iittle volume is given to a biographical study and “reflections,” and only tho remainder to the extracts selected and translated by the Countess. Her chief purpose seems to have been to dissipate the alarm of possible readers of Montaigne inspired by ** the mistaken idea that his teachings are of an atheistical character,” tmd to spread the influence ** for good ” of ** his pure and noble teaching, and hu elevated views on all that concerns the guidance of life.” Mr. Eger-tou Castle, who writes a rather mincing « foreword ”(to the work, intimates that the hope cf the Countess is to bring this “ classic ” " within reach even of sister-students as yet too young to reach the shelf where stands in many volumes the entire wisdom of Montaigne.” So wr.at wc pretty frankly have is the story of the great Frenchman’s life, some comment on his writings, and cullings therefrom suited to the use of a young ladies’ boarding school conducted by pious and prudent managers. To this aim we think the book is not ill adapted. " 'he conception its readers are likely to receive of Montaigne, of Lis view (or manifold views) of life, of his theism, is such as the patrons of such a school could not Justly criticise. And the conception is right enough so far as it goes. As concerns Montaigne’s atheism, it seems late to

authorities of theChurchin Rome itself found nothing suspect Jn his .wjlttngs*. and one m:nrt be very fearsome indeed, it this dayr to .give serious attention to the charge, But we fear that "sister-students within -whose reach Montaigne is thus brought,	they
are tali enough to take down the “ many volumes,” the ** entire wisdom ’* of Montaigne, tempted thereto tW3 Innocent and well-meant, essay,., will find much therein not dreamed of in the philosophy of the Countess de la Warr, much with which their boarding-school training will hardly fit them to deaL For the simple fact is- that as to a very Important part of that which ” concerns the guidance of life,” namely, the relation of the sexes, Men-taigne’s views were not " elevated ” and his teachings can hardly, by any stretch of admiring imagination, be called " pure and noble.” Of his personal relations with .women much is known highly creditable to him. He won the affection of his wife and daughter ^>nd the devotion of Mile, de G^umay, his fiile d’alliance, to whom hirf"tribute of admiration and respect is singularly eloquent, tender, and grave. But in many passages of his essays his discourse of women is coarse, contemptuous, revolting. He was a very great thinker. Without the touch of splendid imagination that makes Rabelais (alone of Frenchmen, one Is tempted to say,) comparable to Shakespeare, his penetration, his Intellectual daring, his wonderful gift of candor, make him the most winning, the most rewarding of French philosophers. In a very stem, as, also* in a very charming, way he was a great moralist. But, making all allowance for the manner of his time, his view of women was far too often base. Whether it is wise, or worth while, to ignore, or conceal,, that fact in Introducing him to the society of general readers, including, rather selecting, young women readers, is a question we. fortunately, are not called on to decide.
