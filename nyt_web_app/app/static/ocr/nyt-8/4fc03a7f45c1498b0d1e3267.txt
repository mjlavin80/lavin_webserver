Then the author has presented the widow with a sweet middle-aged romance in which two men a«L involved— men of types much affected by women novelists—one strong, serene, patient, understanding, the other a man with a passion so lofty as to sacrifice itself upon its own altar. The widow is excellent, the gir> is human and entertaining, the two gross and selfish males are drawn pretty well to the life, and there .ire two old ladies-ancestral furniture, as It *\ere— who are perfectly conceived in the sour spiirit of uncharity and sodden Hritish convention. As for the men who are not gross and selfish —doubt less they are wt^ll enough in thefr way.
The book will furnish good reading for those who sympathize with middle age and lovely (if fadedt woman import] upon, and shows wonderfully well the real nature of the eternal tragedy of motherhood. Further the ^tory has qualities which will please the sardonic also.
