It is a quick change from Jerusalem in the time of Christ to the Waldorf-As-torla Hotel in New York City. But Mr. Opie Read, who only the other day had a story about the centurion who commanded the Roman soldiers at the Crucifixion, now gives us a novel about a Western millionaire the chief scenes of which are laid in the hotel just mentioned. Mr. Read is much more at home in New York than he is in the first century of the Christian era, and, really, the present volume furnishes some very good reading. The millionaire is a Kentuckian by birth and very gallant; there is a very lovely widow who talks to him in the tea room, and to whom he tells quaint tales of the West; there Is a young man, the millionaire’s adopted son, and a young woman, the widow’s niece. Then the millionaire writes a blood and thunder play and produces it regardless of expense or popular approval. To add to the zest of it, too, the Colonel—so the 1 millionaire is called—is in disguise—that is, he wears an alias—and he is very fond of playing Haroun A1 Rashid- He has his own way of tipping waiters and views on a large number of subjects. There is a villain also, and a scene (laid at New Haven, Conn., in the very shadow of Yale College) in which the Colonel and the villain throw dice to decide which shall die by his own hand.
