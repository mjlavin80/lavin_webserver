FROM READERS
New York Times Saturday Review of Books:
Quite recently I chanced to see the reply of Mr. Hamilton W. Mabie to an inquirer who asked him how to study Browning—what commentaries to get, &c. Mr. Mabio said: “Get no commentaries; get a good edition of Browning. Do not approach him as a philosopher, scientist, or a problem; approach him as a human poet of the nineteenth century. It has been Browning's unfortunate fate to be enveloped in fogs of discussion, *	*	•
to bo overloaded with notes, illustrations, and explanations of every sort and kind. The result has been that many people who would have found Browning of inestimable value in their mental and spiritual life have been repelled from him.
After having been thus repelled for many years I took up the study of Browning last Winter, determined to judge for myselT, and I found him a most fascinating and delightful human poet- My only regret is that I so long defrauded myself of the pleasure of knowing him.
