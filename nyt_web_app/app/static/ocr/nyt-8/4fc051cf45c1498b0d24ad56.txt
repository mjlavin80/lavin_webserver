While Congress sat in this city the Society Library, dating from 3704, was at its service; in Philadelphia, the Library Company offered the use of its books.
•In 17S9 Elbridge Gerry proposed that books be bought for the use of Congress, but little was done until a permanent seat of government had been selected. I In 1SGH, however, shortly after Congress I
had moved to Washington, it had a 11- I brarv of 243 volumes. Later appropria- | tions were made to buy more books, until in 1814, when the British destroyed the CapitoJ, there were some 3,000 volumes on the shelves in the largest Senate committee room. After the burning of the Capitol, Congress bought Jefferson’s library, G,4S7 volumes In all, paying $23,- . 650; and this was the nucleus of the present collection, which In 1864, when the first volume of the history ends, amount- , ed to 82,000 volumes, and now contains considerably more than 1,000,000,
Since 184C a copy of every copyrighted book must be deposited in the Library of Congress; but even this requirement did not until after the war Increase the sise of the collection largely. In 1847 there were 42,000 books on its shelves, 45,000 in 1849, 55,000 in 1651, In the last year occurred a fire which destroyed 35,000 volumes, so that in 1852 ther© were but
20,000	left Thereafter the growth by years was: 1853, to 35,000; 1854, to 40,000; 180Q to GJ.000; 1884, to 82,000. A large proportion of the books were purchased or given, the copyright books were comparatively few.
THE Library of Congress has ltaa its troubles. The average Committee on Library of the average House of Congress is not selected for the bibliographical knowledge of its members; even when it happens to be composed largely of
•	men interested in books, it does not follow that Congress will attend to their recommendations. ’ Years ago fine collections of books—the Buturlin and the Duraazo Libraries—might have been bought cheaply; but Congress ** in its wisdom ” refused to buy, and the books were eagerly snapped	j
up by wiser people. "Washington’s library	1
was refused by Congress, and saved from being bought by foreigners only by its purchase for the Boston Athenaeum. In January, 1850, the manuscript of Washington’s " Farewell Address" was advertised to be sold at auction In Philadelphia on Feb. 12. Clay introduced a resolution for its purchase, which was debated at length, and finally adopted—but not until the Ms. had been bought by James. Lenox of this city. A cheap means of getting books was proposed by Alexandre Vattemare in the forties; he suggested an exchange of duplicates among the libraries of the United States and between them and foreign libraries. Congress grudgingly accepted the suggestion, but provided no money for the necessary expenses of such an exchange. The librarians worked the system to some extent, however, and Mr. Johnston notes that " in 1850 a member of Congress had better opportunities for information regarding France than he had for almost any State in the Union.” Twice, too, the Library has been " in politics " actually; but only one of those periods falls within the limits covered by the present volume; the removal of George Watter-ston, the Librarian, by President Jackson. The wonder really is, however, that the Library has pulled through and gained its present position.
In the thirties the Library of Congress was largely a place of resort. Only a few persons were permitted to use the books, which were still intended solely for Congress, outsiders made use of the room as a lounging place, and carried the custom to such an extent that stories are quoted by Mr. Johnston of visitors disgusted at seeing a single old man monopolizing chairs and taole with books ^hile women were standing around looking for seats.

ONE result of the short-sightedness of Congress in managing the Library is that there is no complete set in this country of Congressional or Governmental publications. The Canadian archives have a complete set of those publications* and
