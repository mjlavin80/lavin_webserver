We shall find no better definition of poetry's essential qualities than Milton's " simple, sensuous, and impassioned.*'
The first is the quality of clearness, which means that the thought must be readily understood. Tennyson and Kipling are road with delight by all classes, cultured and unschookd.
By “ sensuous " Milton meant the imaginative quality—the picturing faculty of the brain—in its broadest sense, including not only the sense of sight, but hearing, smell, and taste as well, though less often.
