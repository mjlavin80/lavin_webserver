ttOF. DUNCAN'S book is the first of a series to be known as the New Science Series, which he fa to edit, intended to give a broad view of the new work along scientific lines, the results of which have so astounded th§ world in recent years. Prof. Cooke of Harvard' College thirty years ago prepared a volume on the New Chemistry; Prof. Duncan’s might be called the Newer Chemistry were It not that it refers to physics as well as chemistry. The name chosen is therefore in the nature of a compromise, and applies well to the volume.
Prof. Duncan undertakes, as he says, to tell rather what has been done than who has done it- *' Nevertheless, these men represent the very filite of the army of science. It is doubtful whether In any other field of human effort there are to be found so many men of transcendent genius, magnificent training, and splendid balance of judgment as are to be found In the science of radio-activity.’' Perhaps it is not for a layman to Question this statement; one may be permitted to remark on its youthful enthusiasm, however.
The work of the leaders in the New Knowledge ** consists of facts experimentally obtained and theories based upon these facts. These theories cannot be said to rest upon any definite consensus of scientific opinion. The science Is too new. Each theory is, rather, the work of some one man who Js entitled to speak as the authority paramount on that particular subject.”
| The science Is too new ? It would seem, then, that the volume put out by Prof. Duncan was an attempt to get to be the first in the field—somewhat as our amateur Generals of the Spanish war hurried home to turn out copy for the magazines. The Japanese, by their control Of the correspondents In the East, have thus far hindered the publication of “ histories ” of their war with Russia, but they do not control the scientific world so completely as they do military matters in Manchuria. Granting, then, that It is pushed through the press to be first in the field, it does not follow that Prof. Duncan’s book will be as valueless as roost of the copy turned off by the heroes of the Spanish war, or forgotten as quickly. Prof. Duncan has a training in his work which the Generals. Colonels, and privates lacked, and he writes with the great advantage over them of knowing what had been done in his vocation, which they did not have in their avocation—of knowing, that is, what had been done in chemistry and physics before the astonishing discoveries .of the last few years had been made. He is not likely, therefore, to magnify a skir-rmish into one of the world’s great battles. He may be compared to a military observer who sends each day to his superior officer accounts of operations as they occur, without waiting until they are completed. The reports are of interest to those who read them understanding^, and in default of a final report on the whole campaign • may be invaluable.
NO final report on the New Knowledge can be expected In our time, the , trained observer’s preliminary reports must suffice for us. Prof. Duncan's book, then, is such a report: an attempt to tell what the new discoveries in physics and chemistry are and what they seem to point to, so far as conservative men see
at present.
The author writes well and accurately, occasionally with a Southern expression that is novel in a technical book. His descriptions and explanations are clear even to tfie layman, who has forgotten all about, algebra and geometry except that they have to do with blackboards and letters, and everything about chemistry except that H20 is water, and is not •quite certain even of that. He uses technical phrases only when necessary. He brings out the romance of the New Knowledge; how, just as Leverrier decided that there must be an unknown planet in our solar system and found it where his calculations had shown it must be, Mendel6ef, in making his table of the elements left places for three, whose properties he described, though he had never seen them; and how, years later, these elements were discovered, one coming from Scandinavia, another from the Pyrenees, the third from German mines! The romances of Anthony Hope and Conan Doyle may be more exciting to the average reader, but they are not so true as the romance of the New Science.
*.*
THE book describes the processes by which Mendeieef’s unknown elements were discovered, how ions were found and studied, the discovery of the divisibility of _ atoms—the discovery
of the divisibility of the smallest conceivable particle, a sufficient paradox, surely; the discovery of radio-activity, of radium, the birth of five new elements, and tells to what all these novelties seem to point—to almost alchemical achievements. The New Knowledge Is astounding, because It is so jgnuch greater than that we had had before. It makes the dreams of-the alchemists almost real; It seems almost as if it might end tn the discovery of their philosopher's stone and elixir of life. It ha£ caused scientists to reconstruct their conception of the universe, to redefine their definitions. Where it will lead us we do not know; ** the science is too new." Where it seems likely to lead, in the opinion of the discoverers, this book tells.
A very great comfort to the laymen in reading Prof. Duncan's book Is the shortness of his chapters. It is unusual, too, to find quotations from the poets in a book largely technical, or slang and colloquial expressions there. But the author quotes from Ben Jonson’s '* Alchemist " at one time, and remarks at another that " the doctrine of the conservation of energy is receiving some pretty hard knocks nowadays, and whether or not it is weakening will be for -the future to determine." We admit we like this, though we do not suggest that technical books, even of the New Science, should be written regularly by a student of George Ade or even of Ben Jonson.
