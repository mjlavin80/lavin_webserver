A^TT recent' estimates of the writings of the lamented Secretary of State are wanting in a fair and broadly considerate view of wJiat he actually produced. Some concede the fresh human interest of the '* Pike County Ballads," while denying high poetic merit to his other poems* His verse is praised at the expense of his prose, whereas the latter evinces a mastery of pure English speech that should rank him among our distinctly accomplished writers.
I Much of the inadequate criticism may be traced to the fact that no collection of John Hay’s writings has ever appeared. Some of the best of them are scattered in privately printed pamphlets, or in the columns of periodicals. He should not te judged alone by the small prose work,
*‘ Castilian Days,” nor by the sti!l smaller volume of poems, nor by the Nicolay and Hay “ Abraham Lincoln," which was the joint work of two writers. We should, in fairness, take into view the much wider field covered by his literary and memorial
I	addresses, his Tribune editorials dpring many years, and his able and high-minded diplomatic papers. As the only American Secretary of State except John Quincy Adams who might properly be styled a man of letters, (since Webster, Everett, and Evarts left little but speeches behind them.) there should be published a com. plete memorial edition of hi3 writings, accompanied by an adequate biography. The record of such a life, such an extensive literary production, and such a tactful and able series of state papers, which have
*	exerted so beneficent and widespread an influence upon public opinion, should not be confincd to the expressions, however-1. appreciative, of the ephemeral press.
Some critics of his verse have characterized “ The Stirrup Cup ” as '* his one , poem of the first order,” Is it not surprising that they should have overlooked
1“ A Woman's Love "—a poem perfect in rhythmic. construction, and conveying a lesson of passionate constancy and expiatory woe—a poem worthy of Omar Khayyam himself?
And many have chosen to give the hymn which he wrote late in life as a fair example of his powers, whereas it is inferior in poetic merit to most which he chose to include in his volume of poems.
In his widely dispersed prose writings are found many warm and generous appreciations of great writers and famous artists who have enriched the world with the fruits of their genius. Of Walter Scott he wrote: “ The author of ' Waverley,’ amidst all vicissitudes of changing modes, has kept his pre-eminence in two hemispheres as the master of imaginative narrative* His magic still has power to charm all wholesome and candid souls."
In his description of Murillo’s transcendent art he breaks into unwonted enthusiasm:
The Virgin floats upborne by rosy clouds; flocks of pink cherubs flutter at her feet, waving palm-branches. The golden air is thick with suggestions of dim celestial faces, but nothing mars the imposing solitude of the Queen of Heaven, shrined »lone, throned in the luminous azure. The face is the purest expression of loveliness possible to art. No man ever understood or interpreted like this grand Andalusian the power that the worship of woman exerts on the religions of the world.
And of Raphael he says: “ After centu- 1 ries of discussion, the critics are dumb. All men have learned the habit of Albani, who always uncovered vJiis head at the name of Raphael Sanzio.”
When he came to characterize Cervantes he says that " he accomplished a work which folds in with Spanish fame the orb of the world.” His eloquent description of the overpowering eloquence of Caste-lar is too long to quote. And how nobly he summed up the proud and happy outcome of our ci\ il war, ending in the firm reunion of the States, in these felicitous words:
When the army of the Union saw it \. =is no longer needed, without a murmur or question, making no terms, asking 110 1 e-turn, in the flush of victory and full ness of might, it laid down its arms and melted back into the mass of peaceful citizens. There is no event, since the Nation was born, which has so proved its solid capic-ity for ^elf-government. Iioth sections share equally in that crown of glory. They had held a debate of incomparable importance. and had fought it out with equal energy. A conclusion had been reached, and it is to the everlasting honor of both sides that they each knew when the war was over, and the hour of a lasting peace had struck.
Mr. Hay's literary style steadily improved with the years. It became the fit organ of the man—measured, yet sympathetic. self-contained, but instinct with life and sentiment, ^ and free from what Tennyson styled *' the falsehood of extremes.” This man shone alike ;is journalist, poet, diplomat, statesman, and Prime Minister of the Republic, to which he gave the best years of a devoted life. To young writers of to-day who may be in danger of emulating such models as
