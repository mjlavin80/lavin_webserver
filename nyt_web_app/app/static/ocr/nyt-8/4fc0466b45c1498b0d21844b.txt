HAT question upon which every
American who can think has no
doubt spent some serious consideration—the question of where the American family is tending—is treated by the present author in a manner which, if not convincing, is suggestive.
Mr. Hagar sets out from remote biological beginning’s in order to exhibit as many as possible of the elements involved in the case. By this method he establishes, to his own satisfaction at least, that equality between the sexes does r.ot exist, and that the modern idea of decreasing the unlikenesses and increasing the resemblances between men and women is a very mistaken one. The higher the animal, he says, the more nature tends to ^differentiate the sexes. Therefore the present effort in the contrary direction is against nature.
Frcm this fallacy of likeness springs the other fallacy of economic equality; and it is this last fallacy, in Mr. Ha-jar’s opinion, which has such a bold upon American life and has done so ■nuch toward destroying the American ramily. For he thinks the family in 5rder to be an economic unit (which it must be to survive) must have an economic head with responsibilities and compensating powers. His notion is that women under modern modifications of older systems have assumed men's economic rights and failed to assume their economic responsibilities. If they (the women) do assume these latter, the result could only be the reversal of the old economic relations of the sexes, leaving the woman as the responsible breadwinner, and man either a mere fighting animal or a drone. Mr. Hagar does not express an opinion as to whether woman could carry the doutjje burden thus assumed. As things stand, however, he is clear that conditions are fatal to the family, and he has no remedy to suggest but that which will come of the realization of the fallacy and a " return (as the patent food people with such unconscious humor put it) to nature.”
However, there is no doubt that he makes a good point when, he says that the influx of a foreign population with a lower standard tends-to the discouragement of marriage among the people already on the ground. He shows how the character of the population of New England has in this way been utterly “changed in a hundred years. He compares with New Kngland the South, where there has been no foreign Influx and the children of the original settlers still increase and multiply. The presence of a supposititiously inferior race there, owing to the color line and the circumstance that the whites and blacks have never been “ competingM in the economic sense, has not affected the marriage and birth rate of -the whites, as. by a false analogy, some might expect.
The book contains a number of tables and is fearfully and wonderfully-arranged under discouraging “ topical heads ”—obscured also T^ith would-be scientific terms of sentimental connotation and assoclation-rbut it is a decidedly interesting -and by no means
