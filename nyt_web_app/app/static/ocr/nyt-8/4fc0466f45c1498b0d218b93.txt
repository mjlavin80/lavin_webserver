Memoirs of the Poet’s Widow— Chronicle of a Rich, Varied, and Active Life.*
A.RGE as may seem the mass of* biographical matter concerning Bayard Taylor already before the 'world, one feels with each fresh addition that it is good to come again into contact with a spirit so blithe and brave, so finely attuned to the romance of life, so continually lifted by vital aspiration above all meaner ends. That Taylor did not reach the height of his ambition matters little from the point of view of his biography. For, after all, to have wandered over all dreamed -of lands and seas in the days of adventurous youth, to have served one’s country well in great affairs, to have achieved tbe final translation of a supreme masterpiece, and left at least one lyric of authentic inspiration —ttiia is to have lived a life singularly fair and fortunate and pleasant to contemplate. Add to this commerce with friends in many lands, a harmonious home, a healthy human Interest in primitive and strengthening things—the land and its fruits—and one is hardly inclined to pity Taylor even for the comparative failure of his poetic ambitions and his early death. All these aspects of his life are presented with a fine, because unconscious simplicity by Mrs, Taylor in her volume of memoirs.
That volume, however, deals up to a certain point with her life alone—the life of her girlhood passed in the ducal capital of Gotha. This little German town, as portrayed by Mrs. Taylor, is charmingly typical of a phase of existence hardly to be found now. The extremely few material needs were easily provided for, and life was spent in very genuine if not very broad Intellectual activity, suffused with kindly loyalties and observances. There Mrs. Taylor was born, and passed her early years as the daughter of the astronomer Hansen, whose character, as described by her, bears not a little resemj>lance to that of the old Geheimrat Goethe. And thither, drawn by a friend made upon his far travels, came Taylor, straight from the Orient, full of dreams and schemes, and already, it appears, speaking German with marvelous facility. His first stay was brief, but ~his return soon, and he started out to Greece with Friiuleln Hansen as his wife.. Thence the Taylors went to America, first to his ancestral Quaker home in the Pennsylvania woods, and then to New York.
TAYLOR'S EARLY FRIENDS.
THEY were received with open arms by the group of literary men and women who were then striving, with perhaps too much self-consciousness but with earnest idealism, to create literature. And nothing could be more interesting to the student of America's literary history than the temper and attitude of this New York group which Mrs. Taylor describes. The names are well known. There was Boker of “ Francesca da Rimini ” fame, Willis, Charles Godfrey Le-land. the translator of Heine; those gentle ladies the Cary and Warner sisters, abo\o all, there were the Stoddards, Mr. Suzman. Mr. T. B. Aldrich, and at times might be seen the Homeric head of Bryant. Literature was to them the breath of life; literary interests were supreme to nearly all. If they produced no great literature, they lived in adoration of it, in aspiration, in single-minded hope and work And from this intense coinmunit> of spirit that rH^m^l at the Stoddards’ gatherings there seem to have sprung veritable. " noctes cotnaoque deurrt..' One wonders whether to-day jxx America there could be found a group of men so vitally interested, not in fiction od science, but in what is, after all, the supreme thing—poetry. It is true that they had, in a measure at lea-st, the support of the public. Crude as that public was in many ways, it ’seems yetT from Mrs. Taylor's account, of the saJe of her husband's volumes, to have been interested in pure literature. Where is that interest to-^ay?
Of similar significance in regard to certain changes that seem to have taken place in our National life are Mrs. Taylor’s accounts of her husband's lectures and his own delightful letters from his various tours. The public of no country seems ever to have felt so keen a hunger for the goods of the spirit as the American public of those years. To villages in the then almost primeval West, over prairies and through forests, was Taylor called to speak of poetry and romance and the wonders of ancient lands. Again and again was he called upon, even to the wearing out of his own strength, and the influence that he thus exerted, somewhat imperfect in Quality as it was, may

be set down as- not the least of, his -achievements. But "all this that formed-: part of the life of the older Republic was passing. Before the Taylors realized it, the war was upon ihem, and even Cedarcroft, their beloved home, seemed for a time in danger. The victory of the North assured, they turned their faces once more to Europe,
Nothing adds more to the interest of Mrs. Taylor’s volume than these complete changes of scene and atmosphere. From the turbulent, anxious America of those days they went to Gotha, They were guests of the puke and Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, and watched with their hosts the yellow moon over old gardens filled with fragrance and exquisite peace. A few months after, and they went to St. 'Petersburg, where Taylor had been appointed Chargfi d'Affaires, and lived for some months in- the formal and gorgeous society of the Russian capital.
FfUL FORTY YEARS.
THEN came peace at home, and Taylor again took up his old life of lecturing and of feverish poetic activity. ■ He celebrated at this time his fortieth birthday, and recited upon that occasion some charming verses, hitherto unpublished;
And friends beloved, whom here I see Still lend their fresher youth to me—
Still make me feel, while Time departs, The grace that dwells in equal hearts.
Be to me ever as to-night And I shall know no setting light Of love, and joy in all things fain And light as thirty, forty wear.
Yea, though as bald my head should grow As Lorry Graham’s, or white as snow, Like Stoddard’s pow, or tho’ my face Stedman’s imposing mien should grace,
Or Mac Entee's, severe and grand.
Or Barry of the outstretched hand.
Or though I speak with Delphic breath Like the august Elizabeth,
Or stateliness with grace combine Like Gertrude. Music’s nymph divine,
Or look on life with eyes serene Like thee, true-hearted Josephine—
Still shall I keep my youth intact.
In feeling, thought, and speech ana act, And fast though still the years intrude, IUL meet thenj, now with Fortytude.
STUDYING GOETHE.
THE remaining years of Taylor's life were spent in extraordinarily full and rich activity. Side by side with creative work of lesser value progressed the translation of “ Faust," a work that would have been surpassed In value and interest only by the long planned combined biography of Goethe and Schiller, which it "was not given him to write. To prepare for it he wandered slowly through Goethes country, and on these pious joumeyings met many famous men. He dwelt with Gustav Frey tag, visited old Rueckert still dreading of the Orient in his German garden, and heard Auerbach imitate the master"s reading of his own ,great verse. And as the years went on Taylor was more and more honored in Germany as one who had carried German Gulture and German poetry Into the lands of tbe “ unheard-of West.” so that his appointment to the Ambassadorship was received with enthusiasm.
But one should not forget Mrs. Taylor’s altogether charming memories of the Brownings, of Thackeray, of Barry Cornwall, above all, of' that illustrious poet of whose personality so little that is actual and definite is known.*- She writes:
At the end of the week I had the great pleasure of meeting the j then youngest celebrity of the English Parnassus—the poet Algernon Charles Swfnbume. I wtfs struck by his - appearance the moment he entered, our room; bis slender form, the reddish hair that curled thtckly over his head, his fine and mobile features, high forehead, bright brown eyes, and a thin moustache above the sensitive mouth —all these combined to give him the air of an unusual personality. He was very excitable, impulsive in speech and gesture. He teased our. little daughter, romped with her and hid under the long folds of the tablecloth. He seemed to b#* pleased that we admired his “ Ata-lanta in Oalydon " and his latest drama ■■ Chastelard," and offered to read us the French chansons occurring in the latter. He asked for a lighted candle, althpugh it was bright daylight; then he held the book in one hand close to tho taper, and read. With the index finger of the other hand closing the left eye. This picture was so striking that it impressed itself indelibly on my memory.
It wiTl be seen that ** On Two Continents " presents little that is new, little that we did not know before. One may say, however, with little hesitation that in this book and in no other is to be found the most attractive and sympathetic record of one of the most interesting of all Americans. And Taylor is so interesting because he continually stimulates us bv fhe stibtle'' problem Why he was not a better poet? - He had imagination. experience, a generous gift, of speech. Poetry was the beginning of life to him and its end. Yet his poetry has | no true carrying power. It seems, then,
1 to use a figure as old as literature, that j he wooed the Muse with too insistent a passion, caught with too conscious an 1 ardor after her gleaming tresses, which still escaped his hands. He did not yield , himself to that " wise passiveness ” ! which Wordsworth praises, but feverish-I ly pursued imagined shapes. Had he been 1 able to dwell for periods with rich and fruitful idleness, with calm and meditation. he might have Written mor« memorably As it is the records of his life will remain, next to the translation of i " Faust,” his best and completest monument.
