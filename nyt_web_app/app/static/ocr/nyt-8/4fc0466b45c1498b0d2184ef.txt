An Executive Burlesque.
LETTERS OF A. SELF-MADE PRESIDENT. By James - J. Neville. 12mo. New York: J. S. Ogllvie F’Titolishlnsr Company. Jl.
Quite obviously, the author intends in these letter*? of his self-made President to burlesque the career and public utterances. of Theodore Roosevelt. It is equally obvious that his attitude toward Mr. Roosevelt Is not one' of entire approval of the President's ways and policies. But tha author's attitude ktoward tho President *s of no importance whatever. The self-mad® executive in the book writes, amonfr others, to a man of color whom he has entertained recently at luncheon, to a pugilist In whose manly art he takes a manly interest, to the Secretary of the Navy, commanding th^ navy to assemble for a review at “Clam Bay"; to the Kaiser regarding a statue, to an army friend to M assure him that he need not have any misgivings about his confirmation by the Senate," to his friend " Jake *' regarding a book *« Jake ” is going to write about tha President, &c. Now and then the malice has a spice of wit, but generally speaking the letters of a selfmade President are rather heavy. There Is no attempt whatever (as the subjects of letters already cited show) to conceal, or even to make dim, the identities of tne real persons involved in the burlesque. Usually the names even are modified only so far as to make a part serve for the whole.
