THERE Is something significant in a literary way about the new revision of the Methodist Hymnal. It is the revision made since 1878, and is the only one on which the Methodism of this country.both . North and South, has been united since 1848. These are two facts that may well be borne in mind in considering the new Hymnal and its literary characteristics as compared with previous collections. We are struck by the distinguished list of poets whose works go to make up the volume. Many of the 1 greatest English writers have furnished important ! contributions to devotional verse, that have become beloved of the Church, and these have been more liberally appropriated in the new_ Hymnal than ever before by one of the most numerous and essentially popular denominations. Literary excellence is doubtless not the first quality that is or should be sought hi hymns; but we do not suppose that anybody today would seriously maintain that the impressiveness and helpfulness and the religious value of a I hymnal are- any the less, but rather the greater, be- j cause of high literary quality. For this quality, if it j means anything of value at all. includes dignity and eiev;uion of idea invested in language of beauty and power. It is a fact to be reckoned with that the poetry of such men Is to b&_ diffused through the 1 country in vast editions, and ifl to be scrutinized and cherished and remembered as not much poetry is nowadays.	.
