I _ Mrs. Mary Mapes Dodge had a spe-
I clal privilege, during her long literary career, In the circle of her readers. Her Influence upon American children was a gracious as well as a potent one.
! She wrote some charming .children’s verse, she delighted two generations with the adventures of Hans Brinker, and for more than thirty years she had had the making of one of the best of juvenile magazines. St. Nicholas, under her sympathetic guidance, has kept the interest of successive phalanxes of boys and girls, because It has been projected from the point of view of real flesh-and-blood boys and girls. There was something of the fine fibre of the literary artist fn her work as writer and editor. Many who have, in one sense, outgrown her productions, will recall them now with a sense of affection and . gratitude.
