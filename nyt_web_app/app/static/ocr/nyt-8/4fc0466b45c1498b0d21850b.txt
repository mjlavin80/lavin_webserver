A. Fresh Batch of Letters From His Sevc; e Critics and FTis Enthusiastic Admirers.
ITH this generous selection of letters from an enormous number lately received touching on the Dtfetry of Mr. Edwin Markham, this extraordinarily p r o 1 onged controversy must be closed.
I.
licw York Times Saturday Review of Books:
T HAVE BEEN greatly Interested by the X letters in your last issue, called fofth by my criticism of Mt. Markham's ** Virgilia.” They are Instructive In more ways than one. Foolish had I been to think that my criticisms would meet with approval; Instead of that, natural vials of fine wrath—yes, and vials of highly exquisite facetlae—are poured uaon my unprotected head, and it is hard to keep
from a vague feeling that some fearful I&se majesty has been committed. I hope I can take care of myself. In any case I congratulate Mr. Markham upon his devoted, though myopic, coterie—they will help him a little now. but let me warn him that they will be Impotent to save him from the inexorable Nemesis of the years unless he shall yet be able to write something which will give the world true delight and joy.
What a commentary this particular discussion is on the present state of literary criticism! As things stand now, the proportion of blame to praise is about one thousand to one of the former; you might think we were living In an age of continuous masterpieces. Let a single voice be raised inharmonious with this chorus of fulsome puffery, single appeal for the true, the really genuine—for the best; let an equal word of denunciation of the maudlin flood of potboiling poetry and fiction that is shrieked at us from a thousand printing presses be uttered, and lo, tht utterer is derided! A beautiful state of affairs! No one seems to have independence, courage, the love of the best, to-pillory the counterfeits, and so they flourish and cover the earth. What a pitiful plight for literature to be in! Little wonder that every scribbling goose is a swan, every jingling poetaster hailed as a heavenly genius, and every novel, “ written in three months," denominated “ as good as Thackeray at his best." Of course we are solaced by the thought that the pastry cooks will presently find these immortal novels convenient for tying up tarts and pies, and that the truckmen will cam many an honest dollar in carting poet<cal masterpieces to the pulp mills. But what of the ceaseless and irreparable damage and disgrace to literature in the meantime, degradation of the standards of ihe best, slighting of the truly worthy writers whom we have, while the counterfeiters are indeed literally arrayed in " fine linen " and fare sumptuously every day*
This is my simple plea for that I have said and for the brief and wholly unpretentious criticism which 1 have ventured to make on Mr. Markham’s “ Virgilia." I think it well, by the way, to s’ngle out Mr. Markham, feeling that he is a sort of Robert Montgomery of American literature. and that it is time something besides nnuffiitirg panegyrics were* written about his productions.
My criticisms, needless to say, are accompanied by the kindliest personal feelings toward the venerable poet, who I believe, who I am sure, has tried to do his best with the abilities at his command, and within the fatal limitations of having been bom several centuries too late.
Not a single one of my criticisms of “ Virgilia " has been successfully controverted. Perhaps I should have amplified ,	my reference to the metaphor " that lune
t	last peak of my soul had spoken,” so as
to explain that my real .objection was to !	its ridiculous inappositeness. My lacon-
i	ism, however, w^as useful In putting one
of our critics on record as to his concep-;	tion of metaphors. He protests: “ Does
not Isaiah speak of the mountains ‘ break-I	ing forth	into singing’?" Verily,	Isaiah
does, but	does this critic imagine	that a
I	metaphor is faultless per se; that one
metaphor is necessarily as allowable as j	another?	If so, then I shall write	a poem
|	on urban	transportation in which	I shall
speak of a trolley car “ bursting into |	song.** Cannot any child perceive that a
1	metaphor is great or trivial in the degree
that it is congruous or incongruous?
Now, in the first place, how preposterous to speak of the soul—that indefinable,
;	intangible thing—as having a "peak."
j	pur eyes and ears are at once outraged.
!	Then add to this the distressing abnormal-
j	Uy and inanity of this “ peak ’* speaking
!	—saying I care not what—and you have
|	Mr. Markham's hapless metaphor!
I have already made some furious strictures on “Virgilia"; allow me to make a few more, I would like to point out the incredible process of the " world's ,	fang" being metamorphosed into a
" foam-soft feather," in the first verse; the inexpressible banality of "a precious pain in my pulsing side," in Verse the vapidity and awkwardness of Line 1, Verse 4; the ridiculous culinary fig’nrii of the gods " kneading " pain into joy—ve gods! and ** tears " falling into a " heap " unheeded, in the fifth verse; the perfectly ludicrous bathos of Verse the equally amusing incongruity of " laughing with the lightning "—think of it!-in Verse H>; the exquisite (?) imagery of the “ rocks" and " iron winds" which "clang" in Verse 17; the absurd futility in Verso 11) of his 14 singing " to the surge in the midst of howling winds and in-thtmdering tides; the paradox of " tides ” going "over" him in Verse 18, or the clumsy tautology in any case; and w'hen
' were ever swallows' or seabirds' nests
■	** hanging " from anywhere?
And I wonder what unfriendly genius prompted Mr. Markham to rescue Part III. from its home in the waste basket!— ! ah, there, too, was the place, let. me mur! mur it softly, yet sincerely, for far more than Part III. of the poem!	'
j But why continue. Only let me add the astounding information that in,, this poem
1	of lines I have counted 60 alliterations, or. if enumerated by single words, about IliU!
No, this poem will not do. Neither will anything else do, in my opinion, that Mr. Markham has written. He Is, to put It in a nutshell, simply a very remarkable artist in what I would call the " mechanics," that is, the purely verbal part, of verse, somewhat in the sense that Mr. James may be called a fine prose writer. Mr. Markham’s verse is full of many happy and graceful conceits, erudite knowledge, classical allusions, glittering hyperbole. It has all these. But we instinctively feel that there Is something vital lacking, that the magic spirit of poesy, the rare word, ever eludes the grasp of the artificer. Of coufse. there are always many honest, simple souls whose undlscerning eye labels everything poetry that has a capital letter at the beginning of each line and a lot of high-sounding words; it is most natural that these honest, simple souls should be easily pleased and deceived; nor can they cancelvc how the devoted lover of poetry may also be the dissecting surgeon with his scalpel; and these are the persons who would naturally be delighted by the particular kind of verse which Mr. Markham writes.
Let us consider for a moment what we mean by poetry. It Is a most fascinating subject. AJJow me to give, with all modesty, a definition of my own—presented to the world absolutely uncopyrighted—and call poetry that which awakens in our minds an endless train of haunting and beauteous images and associations. All true poetry does much more than this;* it at least must do this. Allow me to quote a sample of the very greatest poetry:
Now came still evening Qtt, and twilight gray
Had In her sober livery all things clad; Silence accompanied: for beast and bird. They to their grassy couch, these to their nests.
Were slunk. AU but the wakeful nightingale;
She all night long her amorous descant sung.
Silence was pleased; now' glowed the firmament
With living sapphires; Hesperus, that led The starry host, rode brightest, till the moon.
Rising in clouded majesty, at length Apparent] queen, unveiled her peerless light.
And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw.
Take just three words from these marvelous lines:	“	Silence was pleased."
Would not these three words alone illustrate all the wonderful power of real poetry? Here is the great poet, working his mystery and charm, we scarce know how. We only feel that this is the very highest effect which can be wrought by word?, an example of what a real poet can do. All the requirements of true poetry which Matthew Arnold mentions are fulfilled, viz.: perfect truth and seriousness of substance, perfect truth and beauty of movement and diction. If we koep this standard ever in our minds how can sham poetry deceive us?
Lot me sa^, in closing, a word for my old-time friend, Macaulay. One of your correspondents alludes to his " chop-stick " poetry. What are we to think of the subtle critical calibre which would class " Horatius at the Bridge " as " chop-stick ” poetry—a poem which stands alone in its noble originality by the consensus of the best critics in English literature. Can wc not safely picture the schoolboys of il005 reading that blood-stirring, lyrical trumpet call with the same fond delight with which we read it again and again in our own school days— now far too long ago, alas! and if this fair planet shall still be circling through space in the year o00T>, when a million schoolboys will be proudly memorizing, just as we did, " Horatius at the Bridge," whore do you think the Markhams and the " blind poets of Harlem " will be then?
