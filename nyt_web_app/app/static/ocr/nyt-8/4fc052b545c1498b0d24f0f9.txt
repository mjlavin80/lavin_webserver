Originally this series of nature books for little people—"All the Year Round consisted of three parts, " Autumn,"
" Winter," and " Spring-,” but their popularity has justified the authors, M, A. L • I>ane and Margaret Lane, in adding a fourth volume to the series. ('* Summer." 12mo. pp. 90. Illustrated. Boston: Ginn & Co., 35 cents.) The books are designed for school use as well as independent reading. In this fourth volume the beauties of nature in town and country are set forth in prose and verse, and the authors have gone to such fountain heads of literature as Shakespeare, Stevenson, Tennyson, and others of the poets as well as the best prose 'writers for their text. In their preface they state that the object of their efforts is to cultivate in the child a real taste for literature as well as to •'stimulate thought, enlarge the vocabulary, and open the eyes of children to the -wonderful world-around^^them."
