Mrs. Isobel Strong1 writes from California, where she Is staying1 In a Santa Clara cabin with Mrs. Frank Norris, not far from Mrs. Stevenson's ranch, to a friend in this city, and tells how she 3pends her days and describes the room in which she writes:
I am sitting by a table made of a slab of polished redwood on sawed logs for legs. The cabin is made of redwood logs with the ‘ velvet ' on. * * * We go down every afternoon to my mother's ranch, a mile below us, and play tennis madly. Then we get our milk and provisions, pile them into a little wagon and trudge up here for supper. A man called on us yesterday, and, after that walk which we take every day. he had to lie down and gasp—and we play tennis besides. In the evenings we have chess till half past nine, and then sleep till six the next day. . . . And oh. the air and fragrance of redwood and manzinta and modrona and the fresh spring water!
