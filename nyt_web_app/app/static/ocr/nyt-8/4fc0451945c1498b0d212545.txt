New York Times Saturday Review of Boo*j:
The question of E. D. W., Point Pleasant, N. J., renews my Interest in an error to the correction of which my private efforts have from time to time been turned since 1870, when the “ Diamond “ .edition of Mrs. Browning came into my hands.	•
i Verse XIV. of Mrs. Browning’s " Mother and Poet *’ is thus printed:
O	Christ of the seven wounds, who look’dst thro’ the dark
To the face of Thy mother! Consider, I pray,	■
How we common mothers stand desolate, mark *
Whose sons, not being Christs, die with eyes turned away.
And no last word to say!
As The Sattjrdat Review says, the Macmillan authorized edition and the Cambridge edition substitute *' five wounds” for "seven wounds," that is to-say, they make two blunders where there was but one.	.
Mrs. Browning seems to, me to present the “Mother and Poet '* a w6tt-known writer, it is said, as drawing*si parallel between Our Lady's case and "her own;
, between Our Lord’s loving speeches from 1 the cross, and the silence of her own two sons, and	she	makes	her cry	to the
“Christ of the seven words.”	’	'
The " seven words " and the " no last words," the " look through the dark,” and " the	eyes	turned	away,”	balance
perfectly to my apprehension.
Further,	the	phrase	“ Christ	of the
seven words " is as clear as “ Christ of the five wounds " would be. Our Lord spoke seven times on the cross, saying:
*' Father, forgive them, for they know : not what they do. * * * This day shalt thou be with Me in Paradise. Woman, behold thy con. * * * Behold thy mother.
•	* • I thirst. * • * My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken Me! ” and either “ It is finished *’ or “ Father, into Thy I hands I commend my spirit.” No evangelist gives the seven, but it is no great task to put them together, and it is customary to recall them in the service appointed for Good Friday evening, part of ' which is seven sermons from the “ Seven | Words.”
It has seemed strange to me that Cath-j olics have not made some endeavor to have this error corrected, but it is possible that my own experience of the difficulty of convincing Protestants that " Christ of the seven words ” is an intelligible phrase may be typical.
As for the retention of “ seven wounds " in editions revised either by Mr. Browning or by Mrs, Browning, it might be explained by heterophemy or by pure carelessness; neither is incredible.
May a word be permitted on the question of *' county ” or “country " in "Enoch Arden”? "Country," meaning " England,” would not harmonize with the contcxt; " county ** might possibly harmonize, and might explain the Ignorance of the questioned persons, but would Tennyson, an Englishman, think it possible that a simple sailor would be much better known in his county than he would bo known in England? Did he not use " country," as Mr. Kipling. Sir Conan Doyle, and Anthony Hope use it, and a3 American writers of hunting stories use it. as meaning " region.” Thus did Washington use it, in his Cambridge order to put only “ the men of this country ” on guard, when he found that the sentries from more distant regions were subject to fits of homesickness and consequent desertion to regions less accessible than tho immediate ** country." Thus is it used in Ireland—Roche’s country, McArtan's country, MacSweeney's country—being simply the regions once owned, by certain families. And is not the Blue Grass country a fairly well known American phrase?
On this point, however, there is room for balancing of probabilities. In the case of " Mother and Poet " is there much room for doubt? If there be, the doubters are sure to be represented among the readers of The Review, and they will gently correct.	S.	B.
