A GOOD INDEX
HISTORIC HIGHWAYS OF* AMERICA.
Volume XVI. Index by Archer Butler Hul bert. One volume. Pp. 188. 8vo. Cleveland, Ohio:	Tlie	Arthur H. Clark Company
Mr. Hulbert brings to an end his series " Historic Highways of America. ” with a sixteenth volume devoted wholly to the index to the volumes of text. Only those who know how many books are thrown on the world without any index, aftd how many are turned out with indexes which are almost worse than none, fv'in appreciate this sixteenth volume of Mr. Hulbert's work* It Is a key, useless as it stands, but opening a vast amount of historical treasure to the person who holds it—and the storehouse whose lock it fits.	*
We have always considered the Index to Messrs. Nlcolay and Hay's history of Abraham Lincoln a monument of ill-1 directed energy. It absolutely needs an index. Mr. Hulbert's, at the other end of the line, is an admirably made and en-: tlrely workable index—a model of what an index should be.
