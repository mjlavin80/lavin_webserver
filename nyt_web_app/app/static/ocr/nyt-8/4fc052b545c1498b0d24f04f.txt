Hugh Miller found It a “ supremely
melancholy place’*; Dean Stanley said it was " a place to vis^t once, but never again George Gilflllan gave it the nickname, ** Castle Folly”; to Robert Chambers It was “ a sad piece of patchwork and we all know the contempt that Carlyle felt for this expression of Sir Walter's taste.
On the whole we should be inclined to consider that those who have found so much fault were perfectly right- Scott's ambition seems to be a rather poor thing to this generation. At any rate, tbe literary man of to-day deems it a higher achievement to produoe good work, whether it be in prose or verse, than to build an imitation of a mediaeval castle, and to fill It with armor and curiosities belonging to no ^ relatives of his, and therefore carrying no personal association.—London Academy.

Miss Tarbell’s study
An Oricrlnal of Rockefeller is the
and Unannal	_	.
_ , .	„	study	of	a monster.
Opinion of
Miss Tarbell.	curiously	enough,
the monster turns out to be Miss Tarbell herself. She occupies the centre of the stage. She calls herself an historian, but has not added anything to her laurels by this work. Aside from
the dollars which she receives for her study, her motive for maliciousness seems inexplicable.
Miss Tarbell has essayed the familiar task of discovering the real Mr. Rockefeller: and again we repeat, although professing to be an historian, with Parisian training, she quite readily adopts the f;ic-tics of the sensational journalist, fixing on Mr. Rockefeller all sorts of vilest motives.
At no place In Miss Tarbell’s study does it appear that she has ever gone to Mr. Rockefeller personally for information, even on the gravest charges which she levels against him; that she ever thought to ask him what are the motives of his life’s work in whose general results she finds nothing to praise, everything to decry. That Miss Tarbell has the hardihood to write of a man whom she does not quote in his own defense, is. in itself, a refutation of her honesty of purpose, a condemnation of her weight as an his- . torian.—John F. Hogan in The Gateway, ! Detroit. Mich.	,

Good Poetry.
Stringer on the adversity that appears to have overtaken poets in the twentieth century, Elisa Barker paradoxically declares in The New yoRK Times book Review that the reason why so little poetry is produced is the ready market found for good verse in popular periodicals. On the face of it this appears self-contradictory to absurdity.

"	“	Is it not a
The “ Best sellins ” mistake,” asks
a contempt rary weekly Journal, “ for literary papers to give lists of -the best selling books * week by week, or month by month? It is unfairly handl capping the books which are best for worthier reasons/’ If the principle implied in this remark were fully carried out it would obviously be the duty of literary papers to devote most of their space to learned and recondite works. If a new popular novel and a large work on palaeontology were allotted columns according to their respective merits, the popular novel might suffer. On the other hand, more readers are interested in popular novels than in palaeontology; and even literary papers ha ve to consider their readers.
On the other hand there is a real force in the objection to advertising regularly ** the best selling books.” To do so is to give news: but it may also mean the suppression of news—for instance, as to the books of real merit which have not sold, or the trivial accidents which are often responsible for the success of a book. Nor is it asking too much of a professedly literary paper to expect that it should aim at furthering the success of good books and that it should wish bad books to fail. We are not anxious to see a literary paper with a purpose ”; but we do expect it to put the art of criticism before the art of book selling.—London Daily News.

He fulled to obtain a chair either at Oxford or at Cambridge, though he had proved his worth at botli universities; he was twice disappointed of
a Fellowship, and it was reserved for a metropolitan educational body to recognize the profundity of his acquirements. Strong was appointed Professor of Arabic at University College in 18Tv>. and in the same year was made librarian at Chats-worth. The Duke of Devonshire's action was imitated by the Duke of Portland at Wei beck in 1896, and in 1897 Strong became Librarian to the House of Lords. He held the post at St. Stephen s up to the date of his death, a period of nearly seven years; and while he filled it added immensely to his personal if not to his public reputation. Not only the scholars of the House were attracted to the grave, asceict-looking student who presided over its literary treasures.

His abnormal quickness of eye cawed him to discover many a hidden artistic masterpiece and to detect the forgotten or usurped authorship of many another.— London Globe.
Unfavorable Opinions of P. D. Mnarlc**.
Aubrey de Vere used to say that listening to Maurice was like eating pea soup with a fork. Prof. Jowett, In describing to Sir M E. Grant Duff a sermon preached by Maurice before the University of Oxford, said: “ All that I could make out was that to-day was yesterday, and this world the same as the next.” In one of her lively letters Mrs. Carlyle writes: ” Mr. Maurice we rarely see, nor do I greatly regret his absence; for, to tell you the truth, I am never in his company without being attacked with a sort of paroxysm of mental cramp! He keeps one always, with his wire drawings and paradoxes, as If one were dancing on the points of one’s toes, (spiritually speaking.) And then he will help with the kettle, and never fails to pour it all over the milk pot and sugar basin*" A letter from Carlyle himself to his mother characterizes poor Maurice in much the same manner, but more emphatically—'4 one of the most entirely uninteresting men of genius that I can meet”; and “all twisted, screwed, wiredrawn. with such restless sensitiveness, tho utmost inability to let nature have fair play with-him”: and again, “I do

Bicknell in The Dial, Chicago.
TJie Influence In Literature of the “Gesta. Romanorum.**
It was the Oriental mind that brought forth tho fable, and in all probability invented allegory. The West borrowed the form, and contrived to turn to account in similar fashion its own stores of legend. No tale was so stubborn or so intrinsically immoral that the expert casuist could not deduce therefrom some edifying lesson in conduct or doctrine. History, that most refractory material of all, afforded him the choicest themes for moral discourse, for he lived in a blissful age of Ignorance when, if he spoke of Domitian
as a mild and enlightened Christian ruler (see *’ Gesta Romanorum ”) or of the An-tonines as brutal tyrants, no one among his hearers was likely to correct him. Fact and fiction were not yet clearly differentiated; both were inextricably commingled In the popular mind as legend, offering the most plastic of materials for the purposes of the divine. In its palmy days the " Gesta Romanorum " was, presented and received as authentic history, although it contains sqme of the most startling deviations from fact and sheet caricatures of probability on record. This book was as widely read as ever were the Arabian Nights " and the " Morte Dar-thur." Before the invention of printing it was copied so often and, such is the weakness of the scribe, so many divergences were Introduced, that few among the surviving manuscripts have more tha;i a family likeness to each other, and some arc so unlike that learned editors have taken them for quite different works, complied in imitation of the “ Gesta." The number of the manuscripts illustrates the enormous popularity of this treasury of entertainment and moral edification, from the end of the thirteenth century to the Tudor period; the printed editions show that it was still read up to the eighteenth century. Boccaccio and Chaucer quarried in it for material; that Shakespeare followed their example is known to every i one; perhaps not so mnny are aware that I Schiller and Dante Gabriel Rossetti extracted ore from the same rich mine.— London Academy.

with keen enjoyment; ” Northanger
Abbey ’* i9 in part an avowed burlesque of Mrs. Radcliffe. and we can discover, in the language of Shakespearean commentary, the ” originals " for several of her plots and persons in the works of Fanny Burney.
Such an investigation, indeed, seems to | have been almost courted by the author herself when she borrowed a title from a chance phrase of her sister novelist’s for t a story with a somewhat sfmllar plot, developed, among other coincidences, tn two closely parallel scenes. When at length, after a series of cruel misfortunes, the hero and heroine of “ Cecilia ” were permitted to console each other, an onlooker thus pointed the moral of their experience:	“The	whole of this unfortunate
business has been the result of pride and prejudice.”
There .must have been a day, about twenty years after they were written, when these words assumed, in Jane Austen's eyes, a sudden significance. She had read them before, probably many times, but on this occasion they proved no less than an inspiration. Within her desk, on which perhaps the favorite volume was then lying, lay the neatly written manuscript of a tale constructed, in some measure, on the lines of this very ” Cecilia.” She had called it *' First Impressions. ’ Would not ** Pride and Prejudice ” be a better name? It was certainly a happy thought. * • * Many a reader, doubtless, has. with Elizabeth Bennett. " lifted up his eyes in amazement " at the platitudes of Mary on the occasion of Lydia's elopement, without suspecting that offensive young moralist of having culled her phrases from one of Miss Burney’s romances. ** Remember, my dear Evelina. ' writes Mr. Villars. ” nothing is so delicate as the reputation of a woman; It is at once the most beautiful and most brittle of all human things.” Now Mary was “ a great reader and made extracts.'* Sh« evidently studied the art of judicious quotation—" Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia,” says this astounding sister ** we may draw from it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is Irretrievable—that one false step Involves her in endless ruin—that her reputation Is no less brittle than it is beautiful, and that she cannot bo too guarded in her be^

seo the skeletons of the men who did It swinging In chains. The Duke of Wellington and Lord Albemarle burnt Mrs. Fitsherbert's documents, all but live; and the Job took so long that the Duke was afraid ot setting fire to “ the old woman’s chimney/*
, Had she been a mercenary woman, says Mr. Fyvie, she might have obtained a large sum of money for these documents and the mass of correspondence Which It was In her power to lay before the public. She used to say that she could have given the best public and private history of all the transactions of the country from the close of the American war down to the death of the Duke of York.
Such were the papers which the Duke of Wellington, with a light heart, sent up “the old woman's chimney"! This callousness, and the thought of what Tje have lost by it, might Justify a proposal to pull down the statue of Achilles in Hyde Park, set up tn the Duke's honor by the ** Ladies of England." Achilles might reduce hearths and homes to ashes with all the pomp and circumstance of glorious war, and we should not mind at all. But the dispersion of Mrs. Fttzher-bert*s documents up the chimney was an act of barbarism we cannot forgive. The five that were spared are still In Coutt’s Bank, and public opinion ought to have them out. But It is more important to -pass a law making it a penal offense to commit the papers of disinterested ladies and others, when there is reason to believe that they would make the most piquant reading, to the mercy of chimneys. Chimney sweepers may come to dust; but let us have no more valuable documents turned to scot!
The conduct of the Duke in this affair Is all the more strange if you consider how he sacrificed himself on the altar of curiosity when he was alone with tho dead body of George IV. He saw a piece Of dirty ribbpn round that monarch’s neck, drew it out, and discovered a miniature of Mrs. Fltzherbert- When he narrated tbe story afterward he blushed, as If he thought he had yielded to an Impulse of a prying housemaid. But for that impulse wo should never have known that “ Prinny " was faithful to his Maria, whom he had wedded in his youth, regardless of the statute which threatened him with exclusion from the throne for mirriage with a Papist.—I ^ondon Chronicle.

since Mr. Octavius
Morgan published In 185:1 tables of the date letters used by the Goldsmiths' Company of London. These were not, however, facsimiles, and no mention was made of the provincial assay offices. Ten years later Chaffers, having had access to the treasures of South Kensington, carried the subject a little further, and his handbook still circulates in an enlarged form. Interest in this fascinating study was
stimulated by an article in The Quarterly Review for April, 187G, by Sir George , Dasent, but so little was the subject generally understood prior to this date that at the dispersal of the Strawberry Hill and Stowe collections quantities of the finest Old English silver were sold at melting price, the purchasers (except where confronted with an engraved date of presentation) not knowing whether what they bought was mediaeval. Carolean. or Georgian. At Strawberry Hill the great Sir Robert Walpole’s three-pronged forks sold for less than the cost of new ones. The publication in 1878 of Mr. Cripps's book marked a great advance in the treatment of the subject. It doubtless gave birth to the era of high and ever-increasing prices, and It has remained, notwithstanding many imperfections, the best work of reference- for the collector until now. Mr. Jackson's monumental volume of nearly 700 folio pages, " English Goldsmiths and Their Marks." which lies before us, leaves nothing to conjecture, and it must surely remain the standard authority for the next generation.—London Daily Telegraph.
“ The Tyrol •* and “ The Svrtss Language.**
I see that a Mr. W. Q. McCracken has published through the Duckworths a new book of travel entitled ” The Tyrol." What should we think of a German or a Frenchman who wrote a book on England which he called ” The England **? Yet the phrase "The Tyrol " is Just as absurd as " The England." The
mistake is common enough. Seated next to the British Consul at a dinner in Innsbruck last year 1 asked him something about “ Tyrol." He positively beamed upon me. ” You are the first Englishman," he said, " who has not exasperated me since I have teen here by talldng about ' The ’ Tyrol."
In reference to English mistakes of this kind Mr. W. L. Alden calls my attention to the fact that Dickens once referred to ** the Swiss language." The reference Is In “ Martin Chuzxlewit." Just after Martin arrives In New York he calls on the Misses Norris. ” They sang in all the languages except their own—German, French, Italian. Spanish Portuguese. Swiss—but nothing native.**—Clement Shorter In The London Sphere.
