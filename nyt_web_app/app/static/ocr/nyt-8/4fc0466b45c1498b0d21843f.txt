TOPICS OF THE WZEEIC- |
UR portrait of Edith Wharton, whose serial novel in Scribner's, " The House of Mirth,** is so eagerly discussed this Summer, is from her latest photograph, unpublished, and is reproduced with her approval, This is the first portrait printed in The New York Times Book Review in eight years or more, and the departure from custom is surely justified by the widespread interest in the subject. Likenesses of Mrs, Wharton are rare. Her literary career began in 1899 with the publication of “ The Greater Inclination,’* *‘ The VaJley of Decision,’’ which had a great vogue in 1902, had been preceded by “ The Touchstone *’ and “ Crucial Instances.” Later books have been “ The Descent of Man,” a collection of short stories equal to the best in our recent literature; “ Sanctuary,” and *• Italian Backgrounds.” The recently printed assertion that “ The House of Mirth,’’ like most ” society ” novels, promised to reach no logical or dramatic conclusion, and was likely to end, as it were, “in the air ” with a question mark, seems to be sufficiently disproved in the latest installment, in which the drawing together of the meshes of the plot is readily observed. Indeed, this novel has a well-wrought plot which cannot fail to develop a striking denouement.
MRS. HUMPHRY WARD will be a welcome visitor in the United States, where all her books since ** Robert Elsmer^ *’ h£.ve had a host of readers and one must receive with a certain measure of respect the broad hint of her publishers (Messrs. Harper
&	Brothers) that she intends to write a novel with American background, atmosphere, and characters. Mrs. Ward’s advent may be expected in December. 1 Somehow, we fancy that American j readers of ” Marcella,” " Sir George i Tressady,” Lady Rose's Daughter,’’ and '* The Marriage of William Ashe *’ would scarcely regard without misgivings an attempt of this favorite author to depict the brisk, varied life and the unformed society of their own country. But Mrs, Ward has often proved sufficiently that she is too sound and able an artist to attempt what t;he cannot accomplish. Certainly there is no novelist whose vision might not be beneficially broadened, and we may be sure that Mrs. Ward will never go to work w*ith a medium that she cannot skillfully handle. A touch or two of American life (studied at first hand) in one of her admirable pictures of Ola World society would be very effective. We understand that a new novel by Mrs. Ward has been contracted for by the Harpers, but that no date hus been set for its publication.
SIR GILBERT PARKER has net been putting forth new boc'-cs lately, probably because the re- j cently strenuous affairs of state in Great Britain have exacted a great | deal of the time and thought of a Gov- ’ eminent memtcr of Parliament. Sir Gilbert's latest book, *‘ A Ladder of Swords.” which was very successful, by i the way. was merely one of his old, longish short stories expanded, touched up here and there, and renamed. ** The
Right of Way/* published five years ago, was the last book of his accounted by publishers and booksellers' a ** literary sensation/* The Harpers, however, expect to publish a new novel by him within a few months. Sir Gilbert Is now In Canada, the land of his birth, though he is claimed by other lands, j Australians remember his literary activity during his long residence in the antipodes and account him one of themselves. In England he is a Londoner of the Londoners, with a seat in Parliament (he represents the Gravesend district) and a residence *.n Carlton House Terrace* In New York he is a familiar figure, having a wide circle of act quaintances here. Sir Gilbert will visit this city before his return to England in September.
TALKING about literary activity in Australia, we are always glad to receive a copy of The Imperial Review of Melbourne. Printed on eighty pages or so of ordinary octavo Fize, and bound in plain blue paper covers, with an imperial crown, which seems to set defiance to its editor’s views, as the only ornament, it carries no advertisements and contains no signed articles. Its editor ca’ls himself ” Demos,” and alike in all the contents of his magazine and the terse, curt quality of his literary style, justifies his pseudonym. He is a settled and invincible democrat in art and letters, as well as in his political views. The articles, which are invariably short and pointed, all have his manner; that is to say, they all seem to be the product of one pen. There are no fewer than sixty-four of these articles In the number just at hand, including decidedly unconventional reviews of recent books, comments on theatrical, economical, historical, social, and sporting topics, biographical sketches, and notes of travel. The writer or writers know London and New York as well as they know Melbourne, Sydney and Ballarat. They may despise traditions, but they are decidedly entertaining fellows. Here is a specimen of their quality as literary reviewers, the subject being fir Francis C. Burnand’s published reminiscences:
Burnand’s Autobiography is impudent and amusing. He was born to edit Punch and write 150 plays. His aristocratic family endeavored to twist him properly at Eton and Cambridge, but the Drama had got hold of him, like the Phylloxera. To be sure his production is only whipt syllabub, but in one of his miserable attempts as a barrister in the London Criminal Court his lady client took off her shoe and flung it at him, in the spirit with which stage aspirants are treated to Vegetables.
OSE of the women writers whose name is frequently signed to books and magazine articles is G. E. Mitton. Nine reviewers out of ten speak of this author as ** Mr.*’ Mitten. Why not? Presumably that is her desire. Only‘one Mitton is named in Who's Who ” for 1905— the Rev. Henry* Arthur, Master of Sherburn House. Once in a while an English reviewer who knows speaks of *' Miss ” Mitton. Most librarians have a vague idea that the writer is a woman, but her latest book, ** The Scenery of London,” has been generally ascribed to a man. It is difficult to understand why a woman who writes wishes to conceal her sex, or if she does not, why she does not take pains to make it known. Neither reviewers nor librarians can be expected to remombpr everything1.
THE plans for the writing and publication of the projected Catholic Encyclopedia (to be published in this c ity by the Robert Appleton Company) are well under way. The associate editor, the Rev. Dr. Edward A. Pace of the Department of Philosophy in the Catholic University at Washington, sailed from Montreal last week, and will be absent until October, visiting the prominent Catholic writers of England, Ireland, and Scotland, all of whom have promised to contribute to the work. Dr. Pace, it ^ts likely, will
-	read a paper, setting forth the* plans of the cyclopedia, before the conference of the Catholic Truth Society, at Stonyhurst, late In September.
IN view of the convocation of Russian and Japanese envoys at Portsmouth, N. H-, the Buffalo Public Library has compiled a timely list of books relating to the peaceful settlement of international difficulties. These Include Lyman Abbott’s " Christ’s Law for the Settlement of Controversies,” Charles Francis Adams's " Before and After the Treaty of Washington,” Amos Sheldon's ** Political and Legal Remedies for War,” K. P. Amoldson’s “Pax Mundi,” Caleb Cushing’s M The Treaty of Washington," J. W. Foster's “ Arbitration and The Hague Court,”
F.	W. Holls’s M The Peace Conference at The Hague and Its Bearings on International Law and Policy,” G. Moy-nler and L. Appia’s The Geneva Conference,” Carl Schurz’s ** Arbitration in International Disputes," Charles Sumner's “ Addresses on War,” and B. F. Trueblood’s ** The Federation of the World.” To expect an ordinary hardworking American citizen to settle down to tho reading of these or any large proportion of them these hot months is out of the question. The fact that the subject already has so large a “ literature" of recent date, however, is interesting. Students of history will be glad to possess the leaflet issued by the Buffalo Library, which contains more titles than we have quoted, and which can be obtained by addressing the librarian.
MENTION has already been made In these notes of the effort on foot In England to secure a fund for the support of Ethel, the daughter of the late Bret Harte. It is well known ! that her father’s affairs were not prosperous in his later years. Miss Harte
I	was left quite unprovided for. She has been a singer and an actress, but her health is poor, and a committee of English friends of Bret Harte and admirers of his books has undertaken to obtain subscriptions in her behalf. The committee includes Mr. George Meredith, Sir Francis Burnand, Sir Gilbert Parker, M, P.: Sir A. Conan Doyle, Mr. Clement Shorter, Mr. Beerbohm Tree, and Mr. Anthony Hope Hawkins. Contributions will be received by the Honorary Secretary to the fund. Dr. L. C. Alexander, at Holly Lodge, Upper Parkftelds, Putney, London, S. W., or at the Putney branch of the London and County Bank.
BY an interesting coincidence we publish this week both the announcement of a forthcoming book by W. H. Wilkins on Mrs. Fitz-herbert and George IV. and (in the department of Current Comment) a suggestive passage from The London Chronicle’s review of John Fyvie’s Some Famous Women of Wit and Beauty,” severely condemning the ruthless destruction of Mrs. Fitzherbert*s papers. Mr. Wilkins’s publishers intimate that he has had access to those documents of Mrs. Fitzherbert which were not destroyed under the eyes of the Duke of Wellington and Lord Albemarle. These are five in number and were left in l&ti at Coutts’s Bank, where they have since remained, carefully sealed. It is not thought that they can throw much new light on the history of that era or on the relations of Mrs. Fitzherbert and the plump Prince of WTales. The fact of the positive legality of their marriage is not seriously disputed nowadays The packet of papers in Coutts*s Bank is known to contain: (1) A mortgage on the Pavilion at Brighton; (2) the certificate of the private marriage, (in a mutilated condition;) t.'i) a letter from George IV. relating to the marriage; (4) a will written by George IV., and (5) a memorandum written by Mrs. Fitzherbert, and attached to a letter written by the clergyman who performed the ceremony.
