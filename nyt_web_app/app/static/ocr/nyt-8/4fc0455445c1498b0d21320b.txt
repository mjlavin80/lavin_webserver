The Decadents and Their Defenders — Shakespeare Again — A New Hymnal.
HEFtE seem to bo some differences among: the supporters of what is called ** the decadent " in literature as to how they shall	support it.	Some are for
brazening	the matter	out, admitting
everything that is charged or insinuated against it, and declaring that of such is the reality of art. Others take a more prudent stand and put a bfetter and more plausible face upon it, protesting that a bogey	has	been made	of decadence,	that it is not
what	people think or	say it is. A	writer in The
(Boston Herald is ot these latter, and-is grieved at the unfavorable implications that are thrown around the term. He instructs us as to the need of revising the generally accepted connotation of " decadent.” This, we learn, is not in the least connected with morality, either of the thoughts expressed or of the character of the author. It indicates merely a “ revolt" against the conventional and approved literary expression, The decadent chooses to “ shape and color phrases in an unusual way." Because some decadents have been given over to riotous living we are told their art has been unjustly reproached; that the true decadents “ have as a rule written in a vein of
exquisite purity/’	'
