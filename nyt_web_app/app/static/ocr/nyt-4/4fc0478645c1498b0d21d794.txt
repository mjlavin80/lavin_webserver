A’rix* VorA- Times Book Review;
The point of view of tho book reviewer
is. sometimes difficult for the lay reader to grasp. It is well for the critic to find faults, perhaps, even-when they aro invisible to the general public, but the public likes (o see a genuinely good thing appreciated with some warmth. Does It not seem a work of supererogation to say, '-for instance, of "The Marriage of William Ashe/'^that Mrs. Ward is lacking in humor? We might also say of ** The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn^" that they are not morally Instructive. Is it not a little beside the mark to say of Mrs. Ward's books in general that none but personages are encountered In them? Considering the life that Mrs. Ward writes about, what kind of people does one expect to meet in her books? Certainly not Eben Holdens and David Harums. It would do jiist as wellT to say that there are no personages In '* The Rise of Silas Lap-ham." A book on a serious theme is complete in itself without the addition of humor, and the author should not be reproved for anything that is beyond the scope of his book. Let us have more appreciation and less fault-finding. M. L».
