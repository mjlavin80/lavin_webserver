Cpncemtng this reading by fads Gilbert K. Chesterton makes an Interesting point when he says It Is not so much a question of good or bad literature as It is of a certain kind of literature, asserting that hd can stand any sort of detective stories. I can bear witness that when my fad happens to be war I road with equal zest the journalistic slop of Carl Bleibtreu in German—the easy writing which makes such ^hard reading;. Zola’s horrors in French, vand von Moltke's and von Sybel’s dry high lights. And when my fad happens to bo the sea, I go from Conrad’s subtleties to W. Clark Kussell’s simplicity, and rroxn him to Jacobs’s humor, enjoying each as though the others did not exist.	j
However,^ that is not going all the way with Mr. Chesterton, for he claims that ! when he cannot get the good of a certain j kind ho takes the bad, as he prefers bad coffee to any kind of tea. I confess I would rather be without books than read the really poor ones. 1 claim, of course, that the three authors last mentioned are equally good in their different ways, and 110 one' would call even Carl Bleibtreu* s books " bad." I admit only that an advantage of reading by fads may be that one thereby gets away from the slavery to style which is apt to hamper the young, and blind them to the realities of books. And the badness that the great public will stand Is of a deeper and worse nature than faults of style or taste or construction, &c.

Reading- by Proxy.
yoo York Times Iiaelc Rcricio:
A correspondent in the Book Review Of April 15 suggests that President Roosevelt should do his reading by proxy, as it were. Though I did not note the list ot his reading referred to it is easy to guess that a mar. like President Roosevelt reads by fans. And wlio can indulge fads by proxy! It follows that he reads for recreation, so he would be sure to find much more laVorious the conversations out of which Mr. K. AV. suijt;ests he should gather the information the rending of winch is supposed to hi; so wearing.
Are there, then, so few people who read by fads and for recreation? The writer finds more rest in books than in complete idleness; no rest is more easily found, more ready to sink into; history, biography, and fiction for more brain-wearied moments: science and difficult languages for more leisurely times. .
If one’s duties involve the seeing and talking to people for upward of eight hours per day, surely books are better for the spare hours than more people and more talk, especially when the solitude of books is varied, as by President Roosevelt; with the solitude of the open in riding and. hunting:	*
It is quite different with those engaged in literary labors, entirely or to a great extent, like Bancroft and Gladstone; for such labor secretaries and readers maybe indispensable. But Gladstone* certainly
