Walter Savage Land or’s villa, on the road from Florence to Fiesole, is for sale. Landor dwelt there when the Florentine mood possessed him, for thirty years, and the house still bears his name. Here the famous men of letters of the middle years of the last century visited him. Here he reveled amid .memories Of Boccaccio and wrote the Fentameron. Here he bore the burden- of' domestic infelicity until It grew unbearable. There, is. talk, of buying the place and
coitsecr&ting: It;to his memory. r	-V - -
