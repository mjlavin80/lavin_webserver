No on^ is more closely associated with American botany than is Thomas Nut tall, who \7as bora In Settle, West Riding, Yorkshire, In 17S6. Not much Is Known ‘ concerning bis family. His parents, it is -■ believed, were in humble circumstances. He was apprenticed to a printer, and must h ve .been proficient, for he tells that some of his -own publications were set-up with his own hands. It Is also told that his condition was so near to destitution that to better himself he emigrated to the United States, at the age of twenty-two. After having Uvei in the United States for some twenty years, and having acquired fame and position as a man of science, he left the country for' England because of the bequest ,of an uncle, by which “ he received an estate at Nut-grove, near Liverpool, with; the condition that during the remainder of his life ’’ lie should reside in England for at least nine months of each year. He, however, revisited America several times, remaining in the United States some three months at a time. Still devoted to botany, when In England he spent his time in the cultivation of rare plants. The story Is told that he met in Philadelphia Dr. Benjamin Smith Barton, a man remarkable for his scientific knowledge, and that Dr. Burton stimulated Nuttall to prosecute his studies. Then the young Englishman' made long excursions, going south as far as North Carolina. In 1810 he accompanied John Bradbury to the Missouri. Returning to Philadelphia in 1811* he once more set on his travels, exploring the area west of tlie Mississippi. Next he turned to the Southwest, and to the Arkansas, and started on this trip in 1S18.
The title of the volume, edited by Reuben Gold Thwaites, is " Journal of Travels into the Arkansas Territory, during the Year IS 10. With Occasional Observations on the Manners of the Aborigines.'* The work was published in Philadelphia in	During-<thfs extended journey
Nuttall seems to have been indifferent to all dangers and privations. Often without, necessary food or clothing he braved all the perils. He was on the banks of the Red River, and the Indians were by no means friendly. He had just worked his way over a mountain pass, when he wrote; "In the rivulets and ravines I was gratified by the discovery of a new shrubby plant allied to the genus Phyllanthus." On another occasion he'and his companion, a hunter, had been risking their lives in a small canoe, on a dangerous river. An attack from the Osage Indians was threatening. The river was so alkaline that they could not drink its water. Although parthed with thirst-he riever gave up his hunt for new plants or trees* He writes, with apparent glee, of how he found “ a very curious Gaura, an undescribed species of Donia, of Erigonum, of Achyranthes. Arundo, and Gentian." Descending the Mississippi, he described Natchez as “ well known and oppulent.” He passed Baton Rouge. " where a garrison had been established ever since its cession," Early river scenes are com* mented on, the great stream, “ crowded With the boats of French and Spanish peddlers, not much larger than perogues, * but fitted up with a cabin, covered deck, and sails.” New Orleans Sj* dwelt on, with its 40.000 inhabitants. Nuttall tells how dreadful had been that sctturge, yellow fever, and ** how it probably carried off
5,000	or 6,000 individuals." At tho conclusion of the volume there is an account of the ancient aboriginal population of the banks of the Mississippi. Elias Durand, who was a Philadelphia con temporal of Nuttall. wrote of him: “ No other explorer of the botany of North America has personally made more discoveries; no writer on American plants, except perhaps Prof. Asa Gray, has described more new genera and species. His name will live as long as our flora remains an object of study.*'
