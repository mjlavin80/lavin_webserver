ASHE

' Poor Mrs. Humphry Ward! She used to be blamed for moralizing too much In her novela, now she Is blamed for not . moralizing enough In ** William. Ashe." I take Issue witH the latter-"view; She does moralize.in ‘VWilliam Ashe/’ but In a iaore artistic manner than. was her Wont In the past; Who can read . that 'wonderful story and fail to draw a moral from the career of. the bewitching but ■‘hapless heroine?' Who can tall to despise Cliffe, love the. Dean,. cherish anil' j>lty Kitty and - Ashe, reverence Lady Tron-,more,( or be contemptuous of Lady Parr
•	ham and Mary'Lyster.? Here, then, Is the .moral fibre of the work, as it shouia be, wovenInto the living characters themselves, so that we unconsciously desire to avoid Kitty’s example or Cllffe'a, and follow those of the Dean or‘Lady Tranmore. The characters In a-novel should have as much moral or* unmoral effect as the living people with whom wo associate, and no'more. As for Mrs. "WartJ, it would he impossible for her to write a book that did not contain a subtle moral uplift—that Is to say, she could not write an immoral, book, though she can and does present questionable situations... So does-the Bible, if I may be.permitted, to say so in all reverence. It all depends upon how the facts are presented.
