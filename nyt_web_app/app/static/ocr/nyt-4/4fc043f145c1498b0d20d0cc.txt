HE author of "The Reign of Law" and | " The Chotr Invisible " might have been | expectcd to lavor the long novel, with j its “old classic proportions and nobll-'< ity,** rather than “the lighter, shorter book which is the popular American type to-day." Mr. Allen notes in the new book he has taken as a sort of text for his illuminative essay on American fiction signs of a conflict of the tendencies toward each form. No doubt the omnivorous general reader of this hour prefers the short novel as assuredly as the publisher and the reviewer do. Still Dot all the popular novels of io-day, not all even of the *' best sellers,’* are short and light. Probably the ordinary person of moderate literary culture will say that if a novel is to be as long as " Vanity Fair " or David Copperfield M it must be as good as those books, and that a very little of the contemporary novel of commerce goes a great way. Of ' course this argument is not In opposition to any advanced by Mr. Allen, who places the novelist's art on the highest plane. His expression of his firm belief in the vitality of that form of literary art is the most significant note in his article. His analysis of a master novelist’s requirements and the intellectual and artistic processes employed in the making. of a master-work of fiction Is. luctd and convincing. Mr. Allen’s essay is not likely to encourage any light-hearted, shallow, ill-equipped youth to take to novel writing,, but It is full of encouragement for the few serious and: genuinely gifted men and* women who are now devoting their Uvea to that kind of work.
