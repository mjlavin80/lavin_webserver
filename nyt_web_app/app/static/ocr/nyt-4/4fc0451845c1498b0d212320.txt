" Oh, 'frad some power the glftie gle us>** &c., sang the bard of the plowshare, and In her little boolc Kate Gertrude Prin-"dlvllle has come as near thegiftie ’* as Is possible for human eyes.Two of the Guests’* deals with all of the guests, and shows what they think of one another.
-	The fact that most people have always wished to know what the guests think of one another under the veneer of Irreproachable etiquette cannot fail to make the little volume Interesting;.
A house party'assembles at Ryemouth. .The moment they, are Introduced every erie of the guests mails a letter to a relative or an! Intimate frlend( telling just what he or she thinks of everybody else. The different opinions, particularly those of the women who are Influenced by matters of beauty, dress, and popularity with, the opposite sex, are amusing, especially where there is a little pique or jealousy.
The principals of the scries of letters
are Arnold Gresham and Margaret Exeter,
who are two of the guests. All of the
women are In love with *' Sir Galahad,”
as Gresham Is called, and all the men are
m love with Margaret, who Is variously
described as "an angel among’women,’*
** a bold creature who is simply throwing
herself at Arnold Gresham/' (this from a
woman, of course.) an " auburn goddess/’
and (this from a young man who ‘likes them brunette himself,) '* a carrot-haired goddess.”
By some oversight Gresham and Margaret are not introduced, and in the crowd the mistake is not rectified untit Arnold Introduces himself. The letters .ghow that long before this event they were much in love with one another. The progress of Cupid is rapid after that, and ends satisfactorily. The letters of a Miss Hereford, who thought she had Gresham all to herself, are a remarkable series of feminine documents. The letters are cleverly written. Those from the fair sex are delightfully womanly, while the masculine letters are mysteriously characteristic to have come from £he pen of woman author.
