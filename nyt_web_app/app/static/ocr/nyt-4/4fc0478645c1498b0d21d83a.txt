Although what I propose saying is neither in the nature of a query nor a literary-explanation, yet It seems to ine to be. Just of a nature that will greatly interest your readers and to which they will gladly respond at once. I have just received the fallowing letter:
Shizuoka, Japan, Feb. 26, 1903.
Dear Sir—Some days ago we received the- four English -newspapers sent by you to us officers Imprisoned at Shizuoka. We . cannot express our feelings and tnoat ; profound thanks for the Christian benevolence and kindness which you hare i shown toward us in our tmhappy condition. We have here only a tew Russian hooks, read and reread for a long time. Imagine then our lively joy when we received your newspapers, which, besides the pleasure of reading-, have -given us material for work, as many among us prisoners are studying the English language. What you sent us, and the . Bible above all, has been welcomed with the most .sincere gratitude. Accept, dear Sir, our most distinguished regards, for and in the name of my comrades.
