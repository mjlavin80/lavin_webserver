" South Africa: A Glance at Current Conditions and Politics," by J. H. Balfour Browne, K. C.r contains descriptions of a voyagv from I^ngJand to Cape Town and from Cape Town to Johannesburg and Pretoria. The writer also deals with i some of tbe social and political questions i which arc just now of interest, and in a [ guarded way refers to some aspects of [ Johannesburg society. He writes:
; - Johannesburg as a town surprises and j disappoints. It has been put up in a. i hurry. antl .mostly built of corrugated -iron. There are finished buildings, most! ly of . stucco, and innumerable shiuities. i There are wide streets, but they aro all j dusty. Commissioner Street is the main artery for business. It is there that, in I imitation • of ‘America, skyscrapers have I been built, which domineer over the town i more than the .old fort does. * * *
1 Sunday in Johannesburg is honored • in , the breach and not ih the observance. ■ i * • * Johannesburg is a young thing j yet, not out of Its teens, but H apes the manners ot centuries. Many of their ; essays at politics have a you as look, and '
! remind one of children playing at a game . ! or of the hurly-burly of a comic opera, i * • * The people here regard themselves as “ grown up," but they drive about in buggies and are children.
