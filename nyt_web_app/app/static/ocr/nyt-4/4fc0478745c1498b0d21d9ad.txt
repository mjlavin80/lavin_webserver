Andy Adams lias given us in “ The Outlet ” a genuine American story. The word story, in this case, must not bo confounded with its frequent use as a work of fiction. There is no fiction Jn '* The Outlet,” but a true, well-defined, and entertainingly written narrative of one of the great cattle drives from Texas across the Kansas, Nebraska, and Wyo-. ming plains to the great Northwest territory toward which the population from the East with its railroads and other commercial facilities was rapidly pushing.
This development of the great Northwest opened the long: looked for outlet for the disposal of Texas cattle that the ranch owners had been anxiously awaiting. The year 1S84 saw 800,000 cattle cross the Red River, the northern boundary of Texas, for this new market. To drive this mighty herd about 4,000 men and 30,000 horses were needed, while the value ot the beeves ran high up into the millions. The Government was the purchaser of great quantities of beef for its army and Indian wards, and many of the big deliveries were made at Fort Buford, in the northwestern part of North Dakota, near the Montana boundary line.
It was to this point that Andy Adams In his enrly cowboy days drove several thousand steers. It was h:s first experience as foreman of a large herd, and the recital of his adventures breathes the buoyant enthusiasm that he- felt in the delights of being the boss of a big cattle outfit.
Those were the palmy days of tho cowboy. He had a definite occupation, and 1 stood for something more than a picturesque rough rider of the plains. New ' conditions have since arisen in marketIng Western beef, and this is the reason why The Outlet ” possesses a double interest to the student of the development of our National life. Not only do we see how the horses^men, and provisions were gathered for the long drive across the plains, but we arc placed on a friendly footing with the cattlemen in their nightly encampments, listen with delight to their somewhat crude stories, but full of human Interest, and follow them into the pioneer towns along the old trails, where gambling, drinking, and dance hall shows consumed the attention and the money of the cowboys who congregated there for brief periods of recreation from the monotonous life in the saddle. There is also
another side to the story which reveals something of the questionable methods employed by sharp and not overhonest speculators - tn obtaining and subletting Government contracts for army beef. A Congressman, a special Commissioner, and Other Officials arp involved in these practices. Their influence is sufficient to procure an order from the War Department suspending temporarily the Post Commander and Quartermaster of Port Buford who had refused to accept the cattle presented by this clique of sharpers on account. 6t inferiority. The men with the *■ pull *’ prevail, and Andy Adams’s sleek herd Is turned back, to winter in Montana, but fortunately to be sold at a great financial gain the following season.
