j New York Times Bobft Review:
My attention has "been called to a '.lengthy and decidedly pessimistic article j which appeared lately in. a daily news' paper on “The Passing1 of*a New York j Book Shop." After studying the article ' In question I am left with an Impression ; very similar to,one I had some time ago on learning that‘s certain weekly newspaper employed a maiden lady of the
■	tender age of fifty to. write the articles I which appeared in its “Mother’s Col- ; j umn.” We will take It for granted, how- j 1 ever, that the article was' written by a ! book merchant with a practical experl-ence; let us see if we can find some falia-; ctj?s herein.	-	—-«=•
I'll wager that inside of two years : there will not be a book shop left in New York, and I wager further that there Is not a man in New York to-day who^ Is making a # living selling books alone.”
I am unable to dispute the first claim/ not being an expert in prophecy* but I certainly challenge the latter, and-1 am in ; a position to positively prove. the asser- 1 tlou erroneous. Let us suppose, however, | for the sake of argument, that the ma-Jorlty of the contingencies claimed have J arisen. Why this “ dry rot Being In business means to the average bookseller, 1 opening his place in the morning, counting, whatever cash may have, been taken in-during the day,.and dosing:. Nothing new attempted to increase the business, the same old rut; and there's but precious i
•	little difference between the rut and' the grave, except for its length and breadth. ! Constant travel on one road without making any repairs is sure *to wear the ! rut as deep as the grave. Let us make some repairs and get rig-ht methods; they 1 can never be other than those that handicap competitors. There was a time in New York when men of means willingly1 paid fabulous prices, for supposedly rare tomes, under the assurance that what they purchased, was the only one In. existence and very rare," only to be rudely awakened on their first visit to X»ondon to the fact that tt could have been purchased for a shilling. “A burnt child j dreads the fire." That time has passed, and no longer does he allow, his credulity , to influence him in making book purchases. '	.	.
“The only-money there is in books is in rare editions, or editions de luxe, and tho trade in these is handled by two or three established dealers.”
There is a very potent sermon in the latter portion of that paragraph. I am constrained to believe that such fs the fact, for the reason they have never put an inflated value' on their wares irrespective of merit, merely because the prospective customer was able to pay the price; and the average “ book shop ” man has been too pachymenic to discover it in ; time. Yes, the day of the *' book shop M is passing; for the simple reason- that a long deluded public are rapidly discerning that the word "shop "as applied to the sale of books is, as a rule, with but few exceptions synonymous with false values.
I believe that the book store will always be sought by the buyer whose capital is limited, and who gauges the value of literature by Its calibre and not by its rarity. It is the man who believes that "the writings of the wise is tho only legacy our posterity cannot squander ” to whom we look for support, and I do not believe that the shoddy bait,, of a few cents reduction in price will Induce him to turn aside to those marts which for^ the most part cater to frivolous and fashionable femininity.
