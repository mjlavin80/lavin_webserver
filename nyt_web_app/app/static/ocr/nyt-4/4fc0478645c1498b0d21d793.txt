This volume contains a collection of miscellaneous writings from the pen o£ the Iato Armine Thomas Kent, of whom the contributor of the introductory biographical sketch admits the cufious, bustling world did not know him.” Kent, who was an Englishman of good family, born in lSSti and educated at Harrow* and Baliot, died in ltXXi. in London. His literary work consisted largely of reviews, which are reprinted in this volume from The Fortnightly Review. The Saturday Review, The National Review, World, (Engl^th.) Cornhill Magazine, and St. James's Gazette. Among these reviews are several very interesting and very well worth reading—even preserving. Without underrating a number of others, the
critical consideration of Leigh Hunt as a poet is certainly not the least valuable thing to be found in the book. Suggestive titles which stand sentinel over articles more or less good are " The Crime of Alexander Pope "—a matter of meters, of course; “Wordsworth the Unequal." " Bilrns the Bilingual,*’ and '* A Lost Fo'tet." .The lost poet, by the way, Is W.
H.- Mullock of "New Republic" fame— _arid .other fames sinre,- not poetical. There is also an excellent review of H. W. P.aul’s " Arnold " in The English Men of Letters series.
The poems which are distributed among the critical matter are sometimes grave, sometimes sentimentaJ, sometimes satiric, as in the case of the " Ballade of the Ballade," which pokes fun at Mr. Andrew Lang and his fantastic French meters. There are Latin poems, too, and a somewhat longer " Europa ” after Moschus.
