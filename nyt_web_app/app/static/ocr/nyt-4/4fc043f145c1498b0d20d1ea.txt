Mrs. Stuart has long headed the r&ldi of dcplcters of the negro character. She knows well how to best bring to the surface the exquisite humor ^and pathos of plantation life. Most of the stories contained in this collection deal with the negro before the days of freedom robbed him of the glamour of romance. “ The Second "Wooing of Satina Sue *' Is the grotesquely pathetic story of poor little Steve's fail and restoration to grace. It all came about through the exhortations of Saul Sanders, the new minister. Saul favored marriage by the church. He even threatened with eternal damnation those erring1 couples who declined the siniplG offices of the clergy, while to those who had already erred In scorning the regularly ordained blessings he offered restitution at $2 per couple. Among the latter were Steve and Salina Sue. as a mere matter cf form Steve readily acceded to the preacher’s arguments, but not so Salina. When it came to a question of a * church wedding with all the proper and becoming accoutrements of wreath and veil, Salina hesitated. Steve was not a fine figure of a roan. If wedding there must be, she preferred some one of more outward grace* Poor little Steve I His was a hard road to travel during tho months of bis second wooing of the obstreperous SaJina Sue* Uut titeve and patience together with the broken collarbone of tittle Minervy, " who mightily favored her pa," triumphed in the end, and Steve’s smile again shone as refulgent as ever.
Here also Is the story of Uncle Lum, whose wife Minervy quit him for ** a tall, stately, light-complected yalier man wid looks and behavior— follered him down de river and set up housekeeping wtd 'im on a raft/' Uncle Lum later married Nance Ann and remained true to her to the letter, although In spirit he wandered back to Minervy with her coquettish, birdlike ways. He sent a valentine surreptitiously to his first love, although under no circumstances could he have been Induccd to desert the second object of his affections.
The story of Egypt, her dogged sense of honor, her love for old, stiitticss Ajax, her pathetic struggle for liberty, not tor herself but for Ajax, Is stUi another, while the incorrigible goings-on of Tobe Taylor, who was born on April Fool’s Day, relieve such shadows as creep Into the recital of Egypt's struggles. Tobe’s exuberance of spirits, one April day, led him to collect all the babies in the neighborhood, change their clothes, lay them In a row, and hide In a corner to watch the maternal scrambles. Besides these there Is ihe story of 511-lady, to whom the airs and graces of fine ladylsm were as breath to her nostrils.
She was scarce six months old before sht exhibited a marked distaste for dirt, she loved the feeling of shoes on her feet, and before she was seven showed a decided predilection for fans and para* soIp. to say nothing of ruffled... dresses; and lastly comes the recital of the interesting romance of Chinkapin Castle, in which " Gran' Joke Alexius " plays the leading role ot Orlando,	I
