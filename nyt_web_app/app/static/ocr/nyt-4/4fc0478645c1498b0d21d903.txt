THE ITALO-AMERICAN.
A Protest Against a Prevailing Preju- i dice from Several Statisticians.^ i
HE pretty evident 'purpose of this volume, is to reverse the prevailing American prejudice against the Italian as an immigrant and material Tor United States citizenship. Mr. Broughton Brandenburg in his 41 Imported Americans" has already written a considerable book with the same purpose. His conclusions were based on close personal association with the Southern Italian and the Sicilian immigrant in the steerage and elsewhere, and he found them worthy.
The present work uses not the argument of personal experience, but that of statistics, and its authors came to the same conclusion. They attempt to s'how first of'' all that the Italian settler is economically a good thing for the country, and In a frankly modern spirit dwell longest upon the monetary consideration. Secondly they .produce evidence that in the particulars of disease and crime he does not supply more than his quota—falls, in fact, far short of the Irish—and, thirdly, they argue from data, ‘which they present that he is not at all oil to our water, but adapts himself very completely (in a generation or so) to American ways of doing and thinking. It must be confessed that it is not always possible for.the reader to draw such full inferences from the authors* statistics as the authors themselves feel themselves justified in drawing from this material. Moreover, it will strike many perhaps that Messrs. I^ord, Trenor, and Barrows have omitted some essential facts, but both the facts presented and the inferences drawn are interesting in substance—even when the manner of presentation is dry.
It appears that Italians were a long time getting into the way of coming to the United States. As late as 1890 the official figures showed less than 200,000 in the entire country; by 1900 this number had increased, according to the official count, to something like 500,000/ Taking in (as is customary) the first American-born generation. Mr. Eliot Lord estimates the present Italian population of the United Suites at about 800,000, or, say, 1 per cent, of the-total. Of these he says hard upon 500,000 are living in the State of New York. The Bulletin of the Italian Chamber of Commerce (March. 1904) places the number of Italians in the greater city at nearly 400,000. Roughly, then, half of the present Italian population of the country, is centred in New York City, while ol the other half, the greater part are massed in the other large cities or in the New Jersey towns which are for all' essential purposes suburbs of New York. Philadelphia bad 18.000 in 1IXJ0, Chicago 1G,000. Boston nearly 14,000, Newark nearly 0,000, New Orleans, Pittsburg, Buffalo, Providence, and New Haven all over 5,000. By States Pennsylvania (00,000) came at that date next after New York,, then New Jersey, (42,000.) then Massachusetts, (20,0>0.) then Illinois, (23,000,) then California, OSi.fKKM then Louisiana, (17,000,) then Colorado, (7,000.)
At first, of course, the great majority of immigrants were men, and a great part of these were apt to return to Italy sfter a few years, but the present tendency to permanency is indicated* by a steady decline of the overproportion of males.
At the Port of New York:
Examination showed that from July l, 1893. to the end of December, 1803, more than one-third of the immigrants came to join members of their immediate families.	.
A state of things which aiso would indicate permanency of settlement.
Mr. -Lord surveys at length the conditions surrounding emigration from Italy and the regulations of the Italian Government In the matter—of which, also, Mr. Brandenburg, in his book had much to say. Luigi Villari is quoted to the effect that up to a few years ago Italian writers *' have likened emigration to suicid;, and every Italian who left his country was regarded as little better than a traitor/' That condition has passed; now the claim is made that it is the best class of able-bodied, wage-earning peasants who come—the ambitious, ‘not the u submerged,” as common belief has it. *• It is not hard, conditions,** says Signor Rossi, 41 or starvation that now sends Italians to America; they come because they are eager for more money/* The present authors do not mention the circumstance, that much of this mone3'‘ is
sent back to Italy, and that'whole Italian , village? live on remittances from working members of their families established in America.	.
It is admitted, of course, that most of ^the Italians are unskilled laborers, or if they are nol actually unskilled; that their ignorance, of the language and their-poverty force them to.begin with, the lowest

and cheapest grade of manual labor, but it is asserted that the second generation goes * to school and quickly rises above this low-water mark. ' Interesting statistics, further, are furnished of Italian holdings of real estate in the tenement districts of New York. A list compiled by an Italian I operator shows more than 800 land own* ers of Italian descent in the city, the ng-gregatc holdings valued at $15,000^000 to [ $20,000,000. They have $15,000,000 In savings banks and own approximately 10,--
000	stores/' In other cities the showing j is proportionately better, and In Utica ^ they actually have a theatre of their own.
The authors deplore the concentration of Italians in cities, and especially in New York, and explain it by the necessity for the average Immigrant to get work im-I mediately upon landing; then they go on to show how rural colonies have prospered in Jersey, California, Texas, Tennessee, and Louisiana.
In the South proper (east ot the Mis-* sisslppi) there are very few Italians as ■yet. To show the extent of the prejudice there, South Carolina is quoted as having a law restricting immigration " to white citizens of the United States, citizens of Ireland, Scotland, Switzerland, France, and other foreigners of Saxon origin/' and if such enactments are. not usual, it is ;tt least certain that there has been little local disposition to tempt the Italian to that part of the country. Yet Mr. Lord thinks these patient and industrious people have a great opening in the cotton, rice, and sugar regions/ and Instances particularly the Italian settlement near Greenville. Miss., where the* colonists have succeeded wonderfully and are locally esteemed much superior to the negro in what has been, counted the negro’s own province. The'* author calls employers of these Italians in evidence, to the effect that while they make more cot- 1 ton than the negro for the land owners, they earn in the process five times as much money for themselves as the negro would earn in Tike case.
In California it was said (in 1S97) that near 50,000 Italians in that State were almost all of them employed in agriculture, owning farms to the number of 2,700 and capital amounting to $1S,000,000. Mr. Lord points to truck farming near cities as another field, and cites Instances in this case, too.	.
There is a vast deal of other matter which cannot be touched upon here, and taken all together the cumulative cvi-
