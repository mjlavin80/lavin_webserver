Two new books on the contemporary drama, Mr. James Huneker’s “ Iconoclasts/' which Is wonderfully good reading from beginning to end, and Mr. Edward Everett Hale, Jr/s, •' Dramatists of To-Day/* emphasize the painful fact when Americans want to write serious books about dramatic art they must still go to Europe for their subjects. We have the beginnings of a drama here now, maybe, but there is as yet nothing to write books about. We have some good acting, too, but that is another matter. Mr. Huneker and Mr. Hale write about nearly the same set of dramatists. One gathers that Mr. Hale takes himself rather more seriously than Mr. Huneker takes himself, but when Huneker is at his intellectual and emotional best, when he is not indulging: his bent for mere literary virtuosity, he seems to us the most informing of all the expositors of the contemporary playmakers of the European continent, from Ibsen to Strindberg and Paul Hervieu, Mr. Hale writes very well, too, with abundant knowledge of his subJect derived from study at first hand. He has much more'to say than Mr. Huneker of the technical details of the theatre, and many of his ideas seem
practical, V which is most rare.” Mr. Hale has a
useful appendix, and we confess to a weakness for anything useful.in a book, even a book of theatrical criticism. This appendix contains dates and facts touching the performance and publication of the plays of the authors considered In the book.
