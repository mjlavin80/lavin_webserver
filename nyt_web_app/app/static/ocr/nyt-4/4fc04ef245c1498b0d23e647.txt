Kew York Times Rook Review:
I have just finished reading “ The Marriage of William Ashe," Mrs. Humphry Ward's latest novel, and I wonder if the other readers of your paper are as much enraged with William Ashe as I am. Why,’ after he had spoiled Lady Kitty for years, al! that he possibly could, did he suddenly refuse to forgive her at .fust the moment when she most needed it? Why did he not let himself be guided by the little Dean, when Lady Kitty, broken and repentant, wished to come back to him? Ashe’s refusal was the one last thing that made poor Kitty's tragic little life unlivable. The stern decree of a righteous judgment may seem to demand
I that he who falls must work* out his own salvation through suffering* but It does seem as if there were a higher law, and that frequently,“perhaps generally, most good could be done by forgiving the unforgivable.
I think Ashe’s refusal to forgive Kitty is perfectly consistent with his character as drawn by Mrs. Ward, for I think she intended to make him a bit of a prig, and it was inevitable that he should fail Kitty just when she most needed him. But I have noticed in several reviews of t this novel that Ashe is “ the most perfect type of an English gentleman." I would like to know what your readers think. What was Mrs. Ward’s conception of William Ashe? Because on this depends the whole ethical question.
