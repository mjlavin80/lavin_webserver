VICAR HAWKER.
’ " ■ t.
A New, Authoritative Biography of
the Eccentric Clergyman of
Morwenstow.1?
HOSE who have read Barlng-Gould’s life of Robert .Stephen Hawker will be glad of the new biography of the Vicar of Morwenstow; and those who	know	little or
nothing about him will be glad to make his acquaintance in a memoir by Mr. C. IS.	lJyles.	Baring-
Gould published his life of Hawker some seven months after the latter's death. He ' was barely acquainted with the- man whose biography he claimed to write; therefore he was ignorant of many incidents in Hawker'.s career; of many others	he	was can-less	in tho	handling:,
and as	to	still others, lie was	mistaken
if not untruthful. Mr. Byles is not only Hawker’s son-in-law, he is ah.u the editor of the latest and probably the definitive editions of Hawker's writings; his book therefore, demands acceptance as the real biography of tho Vicar of Morwenstow.
So narrow-minded that he believed that all Dis.senters would be damned, and told Dissenters so to their face; so broadminded that during twenty years one of his church wardens waa a Wesleyan preacher; so high-church that he was about the first Anglican clergyman since the Reformation to wear vestments: so Jow-church that he altered the service as lie chose; such a combination of contradictions was Robert Stephen Hawker, for forty years Vicar of Morwenstow, in Cornwall. He was almost wholly a local celebrity—up to his sixtieth year he had barely boon out of Cornwall, and had ridden not half a dozen times In trains—vet ho has been recognized as the real poet of Cornwall; and on three points at least has gained a fanio extending far beyond the boundaries of the ancients Duchy. He wrote the famous poem " The Song of the Western Men," otherwise known as ‘And Shall Trelawny Die?" He helped Tennyson in the letter’s epic of King Arthur, and himself wrote a poem on the "Hots'Grail which ranks with
the Laureate's; and tho circUlllStllTlCCS Of his death have given »sc to a discussion not yet ended.
Hawker was born in Plymouth, in December,	the son and grandson of
Anglican clergymen. In 15*23 he entered Pembroke College, Oxford, and six months later, when not yet twenty, he married Miss Charlotte I'Ans, twenty-one years Ills senior. Haring-Gould says ^he was his godmother, and had taught hirn bis letters; as a fact, she was not and she had not. The marriage was absolutely happy. Mrs. Hawker helped her husband financially, and crrtainly did not injure him mentally. She wrote religious books, and he had a high opinion of her literary abilities. Married students not being allowed jn an Oxford " college,” Hawker had to leave Pembroke, but he entered Magdalen ! Hall, whence he was graduated in 1828, having won the Newdigato prize in 1827 with a poem on Pompeii. He bccame deacon in	and priest in Ifvll; and
after serving as curate at North Tamer-ton, early in lS'i'i was made V:car of Mor-wenstow, an office whicli he held until his death, in l?ST."i, Into his work as vicar he plunged heartily. He rebuilt the vicarage and spent his own and his wife’s money on the parish. One instance of his methods may be noted:	Hi:	was allowed some
10s. for burying shipwrecked men; ho spent three or four times as much upon them; in fact, all his expenditures were on the same scale—nothing .was too good for the service of the Church. His parish was a wild place, his people " a mixed multitude of smugglers, wreckers, and dissenters of various hue. •	*	* The
bulk of the nt-ople had become the followers of the great preacher [John Wesley] who came down into Cornwall and persuaded the people to alter their sins/* In passing, it may be noted that Efford, not far from Morwenstow, where Mrs. Hawker lived before her imtrriagc, was t lie original of Amyas Leigh's home, Chapel, in Kingsley's " Westward Ho! " Hawker absolutely refused to adopt the usual clerical garb. In his earlier years he wore a brown cassock—” a blushing brown, tlie hue of Our Lady's hair, as typified in the stem of the maiden-hair fern*’; later he* wore a long coat of purple; instead of a waistcoat a blue fisherman's jersey, to show that he was a fisher of men. Oil one side of the jersey w^s woven a red cross, to mark the entrance of the centurion's spear; from a button hole dangled a carpenter's pencil, (chosen with reference to the Carpenter of Nazareth;) lie wore fisherman's boots,
a wide-awake beaver, and for a cane carried a cross-handled walking stick. At one time he was fond of the headgear of a Russian priest. He was superstitious, believing In the evil cye( in ghosts, demons, demoniac possession, intensely fond of local legends, which he believed

devoutly. - For -many years 1 he was nti opium eater, and though he gave up Opium after his second marriage* he again became a slave to It. HI? services in church were conducted with a curious mixture of-pomp and carelessness.
Parents were pot. allowed In church' when1*their children were christened. Ke~ ceiving the child from the god-mother, he poured the baptismal water three times on the child, and then, with the chfld fn hts arms, walked up nearly to the first chancel stops, and then held it high in his arms as he said:	“	We	receive this child
into the congregation of Christ’s tlock, and do sign him with the sign of the cross,”	.	-
On the other hand,, he would wander v.p. and down the chancel, book in 'hantl “ and reading now in English, now in Latin. At certain points in the service he would prostrate himself on the ground before the altar, with-outstretched 'irms, in the form of a cross.” Yet he would shout to the sexton to stop ringing the bell: " Now, Tom, three for the Trinity, and one for- the Blessed Virgin," and would give to tlie churchwarden’s niece who brought hfin the list of hymns each Sunday a piece of barley sugar, a supply of which he kept on hand. He accepted the Catholic dogma of the immaculate Conception, and had a medal made in honor of the papal bull defining That doctrine, which he wore for many years.
Hawker’s Trekwnay Ballad ” both Scott and Macaulay accepted as really old; the latter corrected himself in the second edition' ot his history, leaving out his earlier reference to the ballad “ whose refrain is still remembered/' The poetry was original with Hawker , except the refrains. ^ In 1S48 Hawker made the acquaintance of Tennyson, then preparing to write his Arthurian epic.
In his journal, under date of June 2,
1848, Tennyson	wrote:	j
Took a gig	to Rev.	S.	Hawker	at	'
Morwenstow, passing Comb Valley, fine view over sea, coldest manner of Vicar -until I told my name, then all heartiness, • Walk on cliff with him, told of ship* wreck.
In 18G3, after nearly forty years of mar* ried life. Hawker became a widower. Under the inspiration	of	. sorrow	he
achieved his masterpiece, “ The Quest of the Sangrraal,” of which he had had-the Idea, in his mind lor nearly forty
years. The poem was published In Tennyson’s poem, "The Holy Grail,” appearing five years later. Mr. Byles's comparison of	the two	Doems may	be.
quoted:
For the incidents of the tale Tennyson follows-Malnry, w:i!le Hawker gives' rein to his own imagination. Tennyson makes Arthur .disapprove the Quest; Hawker makes him the moving
Spirit. The quality of Tennyson’s poem is ethereal beauty; that of Hawker's
hissed st^er.gthr # TenrVys6n’s .language 1st pictorial, Hawlcer's rhetoWcah 4 m' * While the -Laureate's Idyl surpasses the Cornish vicar-s fragment as a"-work ■'Of-art, the. latter poem has in if:2nore'of the breath of Ufe.
. On JDec,	2J,	’Hawker	married
Pauline Kuozynski, a; girl of>, twenty, of -Polish birth but English training. She had been governess in a clergyman's family near bj^,. 13y her he had three daughters.	The last	years of	his life
were troubled by financial difficulties,,by his failure to add to ~ his income by waiting, and by his return to the use Of opium. On Aug.. irf/:d87D, he died* ‘having the previous day been received Jinto, the, Roman Catholic Church, “ an event which,” to quote- the present biographer,	"has	caused more	contro-
versy perhaps an any other episode in the life of a parish clergyman.'*
Mrs. Hawker, without her husband’s consent, but acting as she said' she believed he would have wished, sent for a Catholic	priest	and	had him	receive
the “vicar into the Catholic Church. She was not at the time a Catholic, though she later became one. The question of 1 course arose, Did Hawker really become I if Catholic?
■	Considering all the circumstances, Mr. j Byles thinks that Hawker was probably not conscious—" we must remember, too,
!; the influence of opium on a-'mind broken
by age, anxiety, and disease.” He quotes
' also from two Catholic friends of Hawker,
both of whom were surprised to; learn
of the vicar’s conversion. He considers
that Mrs. Hawker acted honestly, but
in fact committed~an error of judgment.
“ Prom a worldly point of view she had nothing to gain and everything to lose.
. * • * A worldly woman would have regarded the opinion of the world and the effect 011 her own social position. Mrs. ’’Hawker chose the difficult, unpopular course, which involved the ■ estrangement of friends; the attacks of enemies, and
the beginning of life anew with a prospect of poverty.’* “Most of all," he says j elsewhere. “ we must remember that it is not for us to sit in judgment, and that quesuons of this kind rest between a man’s conscience and bis Maker.1*
