yeto 1 ttrU J'ur.C'i /Joofc Review:
A landsman cf over sixty years’ standing always heard the “ Mariners* Sayings ” quoted by your correspondent given, thus:	..	'
Mackerel backs and mares* tails Make lofty ships, carry low sails.
And again:	'	,
If the rain's before the wind, Topsails reef and halyards mind;
. If the wind's before the rain,
H’ist your topsails up again.
This version adheres to the rhymes and metre. In the first couplet sometimes one heard “ mackerels’ backs."
E. B. COOK. Hoboken, N. J., March 27, 1005.
