jJjHE human kindness of Anarchists is ?n expression which 'will serve as the text Of this volume. Mr. Sanborn explains in a preface that he is not himself an Anarchist— quite tho reverse—but he Will nevertheless exhibit the "virtues of the men who are ready to turn the world upside down; he will explain that all such persons are not bomb throwers, and he will even urge some excuses—mitigating circumstanccs at least—for the bomb throwers themselves. Mr. Sanborn has Known Anarchists in Paris, and finds them lovable men, not without a philosophy of SWect reasonableness; he tol'.s of some of these, of the excellent mild thecrles they hold; of the work they dc, cf the papers they edit, of the erimcs they sometimes -commit, because he is not an Anarchist, but holds to the old order, " prefers infinitely things as they are," he does not venture himself to expound the Anarchist doctrine. He quotes instead Jean Grave, who, with Pierre Kropotkine and Elis£e ■Reclus, is of the leaders of the cult and . more French than either. According to Grave “ the politicians " who exploit the present order for their ox;Tn private profit;
* * • have not got beyond this form. ula:	" In the State a free community, in
the community a free individual’*—we know that these political forms are incompatible with liberty, since they tend always to submit a number of men to'the same rule; and we formulate our device, *4 in a free humanity, a fix;c individual."
• Grave declares that "the wealth of so. ciety is the appanage of a minority of loafers." The aim. of ail good Anarchists, therefore, is to destroy '* privileges,” to enable the defrauded raajority to “ reenter into the possession of that of which they have been despoiled.” To such end '* tbe bases of the economic order must be changed," the soil must be his who can till it, Government must go, organized religion, the otmriage tie that binds, and nil manner of rules, reflations, and impositions. Reasonable Anarchists admit difficulties in the way of these consummations—difficulties but not impossibilities,
Mr. Sanborn devotes certain chapters, nevertheless, to methods of Anarchist propaganda, which indicate that anarchic sweet reasonableness has Its limits. The methods are: I., oral propaganda;
II., written propaganda; propaganda by example; IV., propaganda by deed— the last including propaganda by bomb. The first, which works chiefly in that unstable compound, the Anarchist group, (Anarchists cannot consistently have a regular organization.) Includes also much spouting at small gatherings in cabarets, even larger meetings, generally meetings captured from some less radical purpose. For instance, there was advertised during tho days succeeding the Dreyfus affair a “ great national mass meeting " at Tivoli-Vauxhall, near the Place de la R€-publique. The Nationalists arranged to admit by ticket, but the Anarchists, through alt available revolutionary organs, invited " all republicans, all Socialists, and all llbertaires [libertaire is a euphonious name for Anarchist] to assist at this meeting."
To one familiar with Parisian ways these antithetic notices promised a beautiful scrimmage. There was a beautiful scrimmage.
At the appointed time, while the duly ticketed were straggling in, and just as the President, *' a phenomenally fat politician." rose to speak, a crowd of 2.000 Socialists and Anarchists swept away police lines and ticket takers and surged Into the hall.
"Vive la Soeiale! Vive l'Anarchic! A bas rArm^c.' ” bellowed the invaders.
"Vive ie drapenu! Vive I'Ai'mGe! ” screamed the invaded.
The fat President “ brandished his bell and pounded for order.” In vain. “ The antagonistic yells mounted, collided, cracked, and exploded in midair. Hurrah for the army! Death to Jews! Down with Zola! Three cheers for tne Flag! ’ At the back the crowd sang a song which might be rendered " Away to Bedlam,** fitting thereto the words “ Spit on Lou-bet" Then a shrill voice in a corner piped up “ Away with the hogshead man " a hundred, five hundred voices " joined in, then the whole two thousand bawled “ Away with the hogshead man.”
And bawling thus they seethed on to the platform like a wave, lifted the frantically gesticulating “ hogs=he*».d man *• and his two hundred of avoirdupois clean off his feet, and receding with multitudinous laughter, swept him down the aisle and out through the door as if he were a chip, and all his satellites and followers in the wake of him.
The Socialists and Anarchists were in possession and proceeded to elect officers. But presently these allies disagreed. From “ furious debate ” the meeting went to shouts and then to blows.
Fists, canes, umbrellas, chairs, and benches cleaved the air; shoes battered
-PARIS AXD THE SOCIAL REVOLUTION. A story of the revolutionary elements in the various classes or Parisian society. By AJvan Francis Sanborn. With Illustrative drawings by Vaughan Trowbridge. 8vo. Pp. 404. Boston: Small, Maynard & Co.
shins, and hcad3 . concaved stomachs; clothes were torn, hats crushed in and trampted under foot; furniture was tils- I membered, and mirrors, windows, and , gas globes shattered. The pushing, pulling, pounding, kicking, scratching, biting and butting, the oaths and calls for- help, the howls, growls, and yelps of baffled rage and pain, would need the pen of a French Fielding to describe and transcribe.
The Anarchists at last threw the Socialists out, but had hardly achieved this feat before the police came in force.
“ Gentlemen," said they, " the meeting is dissolved,” and turned out the gas. Ejected from the hall, the Anarchists were reunited in the street with the Socialists, and both joined again against the Nationalists, still howling outside. But Anarchists, Socialists, Nationalists—all made common cause against the police, and the Garde RepubUcainc had to be called in to disperse the rioters.
Such is practical anarchy, as exhibited in the propaganda by voice. Mr. Sanborn speaks also of Anarchist ballads sung vociferously in cabarets and elsewhere, and of these songs quotes some, as ** La Ravachole,’’ compounded as to tune cf the “ Carmagnole ” and the " Ca Ira," nnd very explosive as to words. Again the "Chanson du P^re la Purge "—apothecary to mankind—which has a rare swing and enumerates the following deadly medicines for a diseased society:	Daggers,
scythes, . pikes,- six-shooters, kerosene, firebrands, nitro-glycerlne, paving stones, dynamite, powder, and illuminating gas.
Turning to the written propaganda one reads much curious and enlivening matter about Anarchist newspapers, always without cash, always dodging an unsympathetic law. Of the number of them In Paris r.o figures can be given, since one may not usually know where they are published.
However, a list of titles of Anarchist papers which have lived (and died) is more Interesting—The Ca Ira, The Convict. The Defiance, The Famished, The Black Flag, The Anarchist Hydra, The Audacity, Beggary. AU these are now defunct. There are, moreover, multitudes of placards, on one of which one reads, " To the sewer with the Senate "—and uncounted other literature—floating everywhere in spite of law and police, from hidden or shifting places. Mr. Sanborn tells of an Anarchist cabby who " rode down pedestrians in pursuance of a vow he had made to exterminate the bourgeois," of another Anarchist of less precipitous and more profitable bent who had a fine way of getting a free meal. This fellow—in the days when men were panicky of Anarchists— dined abundantly in places of high price, then called the proprietor, and said with great calmness: “ Monsieur, I have dined well in your house. I thank you. I haven’t a sou. Arrest me If you like, but I warn you that I am an Anarchist and that you expose yourself to the vengeance of my associates.”
Again one hears the ethics of theft discussed from the point of view of the Anarchist morality. It appears that according to (he best " libertist ” opinion theft to be truly meritorious must he open. It is then a part Of the propaganda by example. By Anarchist theory what is commonly called theft is merely the recovery of stolen goods. One must, therefore, claim one's own boldly before the world. The ethics of murder is another delicate matter, and nice distinctions are made between assassinations of autocrats and politicians and massacres of flocks of the sidy bourgeois sheep. These distinctions, however, are made chiefly by ttie philosophers of the sect.
There are Anarchist balls, too, most hearty but respectable affairs—woefully lacking in Spice and color—which Mr. Sanborn compares with the high jinks at the Moulin Rouge, ’* maintained mainly for the prudent depravity of tourists." The centrast has been made more striking still by two of Mr. Trowbridge’s excellent pictures placed side by side. By the way, these pictures are not the least attractive and interesting feature of the book, which covers a vast deal upon which this notice does not touch even remotely.
