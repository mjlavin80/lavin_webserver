THE BALKANS
Miss Durham Finds It a Country of Strife and Bloodshed.1*1
HE Balkan country is the record of " confusion worse confounded." Here lives or fights the Balkan man, and it matters not whether he be Greek, or Serb, or Bulgar, or Albanian, Christian or Moslem. The element of discord always seems to be pronounced. Racial hatreds appear to be instinctive. There have been no end of books written of late on these Balkan States. The one under notice, the title of which is not flattering, since it reads *' The Burden of the Balkans," gives a positive picture of conditions there. The lady who signs herself M. Edith Durham possesses great pluck and power of description, and she enters intimately into the subject, for she has had advantages that few possess. She was sent to the Balkans in charge of provisions, clothing, and money destined by sympathetic English people for distribution in this Godforsaken land. To do this duty required strict attention, and, at the same time, sharpness. People desirous of partaking of charity are sometimes inclined to he rapacious, and the point of honor Is not always nicely kept. The track to steer in a land “ strewed with the wreckage of past ages " -was not easy. In a country of hatreds, to be always sweet and smiling would have resulted in being molested. There Is imbued a certain spirit of romance in the adventures of the author, and a " noli me tangere ** way about her which is admirable and without any masculinity. in her protracted journey she suffers from heat and cold, and often goes hungry, and naturally does not like it, and says so. But there is no whimpering. She has no prejudices, though she may not be overfond of Russia, for the empire of the Czar has been for centuries, on the lookout for her own particular interests in the Balkans, and has done her best to stir up hatred and racial antagonism.^"
To study the history of tho various races in the Balkan country, you might begin among the moderns, with Gibbon, and read an entire library, and then not grasp the subject. Perhaps it has been the most unfortunate of all lands, for as it has been overrun, the worst traits of the invaders have remained. It is a land behind the age, and, what is more unfortunate, puffed up with notions of the grandeur of the past,, a past which is out of joint with the present. The author writes:
Things look very different in the East and the West. You may travel among the Balkan people alone and drop iojr the time being every Western habit; you may eat with the natives, drink with them, ^leep with them, ride with them, live as they do, and watch them patiently for months; you may visit and revisit their lands and think that you- are beginning to ■ understand them, when something occurs that turns a sudden searchlight upon them and you perceive in a flash mat you were as far as ever from seeing things from their point of view. To do this you must leap back across the centuries, wipe the West and its ideas out from you, 'et loose all that there is in you of primitive man, and learn six languages, all quite useless in other parts of the world.
The start on the trip began at Vienna*, the objective point being Semlin. Then Resna was reachcd. Resna is described as “ a dirty little place of recent date." There are hatreds between the Greek and the Bulgarian churches. Attendance to the churches, the lady thinks, is merely a question of party politics. Ochrida, we are told, trails along a lake of surpassing beauty, but the town is mean and, squalid.' The Bulgars, so the author j seeing: to think, rejoice In badly smelling towns, be* cause such has been the custom from the oldest period when therfe was 9. Bulgarian Empire. The people are crazed with politics. “ You can scarcely look out of the window without being-suspected of doing It for political purposes.” It is a place full of prejudices, and the tattle is faces-cant. The unfortunate conditions of the surroundings of Ochrlda are dilated on.,
All the land around was a hell of misery! 1 We lived on a thin crust of quiet, beneath ! which surged a lava bed of raw primeval passion and red-hot race hatred Into which no power dared thrust It3 finders for fear or haying them burned oft It was a position of such absorbing interest that, with apologies to my friends, I must confess I never wanted either European comrades or books. The study of the forces that underlay the mass of surrounding suffering seemed to be the only ■thing worth living for, Its temporary re-* lief but court plaster on a cancer.

Among the author's numerous duties,
was that or visiting the hospitals, where the wants of the sick had her attention. She saw much misery, and the attention, given was but slight. It was not the ailing who were clamorous for assistance, but everybody wanted heft). “ Give, give, ‘ give! ” they cried from morning to night The women were never satisfied. The English lady was ^of ten requested to be. come a political, intermediary. Why should She not Jilde guns and ammunition so that the Turks might not capture them? Of course, the author was thrown in. with the doctor in charge of the hospital She was approached ‘with the idea that she* should commit murder for the benefit;of

Politics here cover a multitude of sins. One night a man turned up mysteriously. In his village there were three traitors. Before anything further could be done they must be destroyed. They could not be shot, for this would probably bring down the authorities, and it was impossible to buy poison, because the law on the sale of it was strictly enforced. (This Is Interesting, as it shows that it is possible to enforce a law in Turkey when expedient.) But " Madama *' (myself) was a friend of the doctor. No doubt if she .asked him he would write her something that could be put In coffee. Then the three gentlemen could be asked to supper and their political differences quietly arranged. Nor had he any doubt that I should fulfill this humble request. An episode such as this Is vividly Interesting. It is possible to ride hastily through the Balkan Peninsula and credit the people with western country feeling. A shorL residence among them reveals tbe Middle Ages, their, sentiment, morals, and point of view, all presented alive, by the overlying stratum of Oriental rule.
A Bulgarian Bishop the lady shows to be a villain hiding his 111-deeds under the cloak of religion. He was entirely disgusted with the Englishwoman because she would not uphold his plans for the shedding of Jtfood. The question he seemed to ask was what was she there for, if not to foster the plans of the Bulgarians. British relief funds might do more good if they were employed for purely political purposes, so he intimated. When in tho country of the Albanians the people wanted to know why it was the Bulgarian had all the help given him. Brigandage was an Albanian profession, the excuse being that they would rather be robbers than to he robbed themselves. Avlona is a small town, having-some 5,000 people, with the advantages of three foreign consulates,
" Austrian, Italian, and Greek, watching Albanian interests; the fourth, Russian, of coursc, is watching tlie other three." Here is one of those luminous touches which the author paints. As she is traveling she sees a party of women working In the fields, and entering a cottage she notices -a Martini rifle laid across a cradle. The men at the plow carried flintlocks, and the goatherd his rifle. Blood feuds were constant, and to go out
without a gun was considered as stupid as would be a Britisher without an umbrella in the rainy season. More than once the lady got Into trouble because she carried with her a few books, one of which was a Freneh dictionary, and she writes:
When It is remembored that no books con be imported into the Turkish Empire, cxcept by smuggling, without passing the Turkish censor, who suspects every-thing-he cannot understand; that no book can be sold that has not the stamp of the local Vail in it. and that before any book can be read these people have to learn a foreign language, the number of well-informed and educated persons Is very remarkable, Tho failure so far, even with Austrian aid, to obtain the firman for the coveted united church and school, Is ascribed to Russia, who Is said to terrorize the Sultan, and is hated with a hatred almost incredible in its virulence.
