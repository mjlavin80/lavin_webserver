The current number of The International Studio has an article by John Lane of the .Bodley Head on Sir Caspar Purdon Clarke, the new Director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in this city, to which the writer laments the departure of the well-known English archaeologist as a “ national loss.*' Mr. Lane,, who knows Sir Purdon, describes him as follows:
Sir Purdon Jigs the rare faculty of being an expert in antiquities, as-well as of knowing all that is best about the modem arts. Indeed, I can recall nothing more fascinating than to hear him describe the causes and effects of the various constituents employed in, say, producing a piece of pottery, enamel, or some Oriental fabric, be it ancient or modern.- The fact is, he seems to know how everything is maae. He appears to be chemist, scientist, artist, craftsman, antiquary, archaeologist, and alchemist, combined. He also has the instinct of at once’ recognizing tbe genuineness of an antiQue as well as Its ^beauty. These are too often diverse Qualities. It should be remembered that not all thrags which are old or even antique, are beautiful, or have any spe* cial educational or monetary value. It Is this rare combination which has equipped him as one of the greatest experts in Europe.
