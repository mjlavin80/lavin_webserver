Marriott Watson suggests Sk series of articles by eminent folks entitled “ Books That Have Made Me Cry." He quotes from one of the chapters in Andrew Lang's “ Adventures Among My Books," in which Mr. Lang confesses that he has wept over Eva’s death in 44 Uncle Tom’s Cabin/' Col. Newcome’s death, the death of Socrates, and a passage In Thucydides. How about the deaths of Little Nell, Paul Dombey, and Poor Jo? Dickens was a master-hand at the arrangement of words so as to compel the reader's tears
to flow. How about certain passages in ’’ Les Misera-
t
bles/' notably that in which Marius tells Jean Val Jean that he must not call on Cosette again? How about the death of Cordelia In " Lear " ? There are, to be sure, many passages in fiction which make us weep when we are young which we can read dryeyed when we reach mature years. But some of us can never elude the lachrymal spell of Dickens, however much our reason may rebel against our super -ficial emotions. Mr. Watson thinks heijiaa wept oft-| ener than Mr. Lang. He remembers particularly cer-1 tain tear-compelling chapters in Rhoda Broughton's novels. His suggestion is interesting. Others, besides eminent men and women, may have something interesting to say about books which have made them cry.
