CANADIAN TALES.
a'linjw^
A Baker’s Dozen of Collected Stories by Herman Whitaker.^'-
HERE seems to be. no particular reason why Mr. Herman Whitaker should have chosen “ Th& Probationer " ns tho title story for his thirteen tales about the wild regions of Northwestern Canada. It pive.^ not the least inkling either as to the si-irit or as to the contents of a. book which is unusually vigorous and su^rrrstive. Mr. Whitaker must liave been very lazy when ho contented himself with so poor a name for
su<‘h good work as is packed between the covers of “ The Probationer ’’—which covers, by the way, will still further mislead the casual eye with their innocent design of anemones or some such inappropriate symbol of the savage Northland described within.
Sex eral. not to say many, other stories, long and short, good and Indifferent, have b“en written about the great Northwest in the last decade, but it is only fair to the author of this latest contribution to say that that disadvantageous fact does not seem to interfere in the least with the keen interest with which one reads every one of these thirteen glimpses of life as It is lived in that land of mystery and danger and hardship, where good, manly courage and strength count high against elemental nature, and the rules and regulations of civilization undergo a striking change. Circumstances surely alter cases in the wastes that spread " between Winnipeg and Fort McCloud, from Pembina to the arctic," and for the most part even a denizen of the tame and effete East can see the logic of the rough laws of wood3 and prairies as exemplified in thctse
Stories.
“ Tin.' Probationer” will be the best sort of a companion for a hot Summer day. as the very breath of Kins' Bliczard, the terror of the Northwest, blows through ' it. Its men are always huddling about roaring stoves to escape tho icy blasts or unwinding scarfs coated inch-thick with ice before they can open their mouths to tell of the horrors they have escaped or that are impending, and the master element, the storm, never once ceases to be ma-stor—though now and then outwitted

for a time—through all these stories. One marvels how even such sturdy beings as the trappers of the Hudson Bay Company can learn to face such odds, and yet the story of their lives is so fascinating that one envies the fullness, the freedom, the satisfaction, of it, as alluringly set forth in Mr. Whitaker's litle sagas. The Probationer himself, as he looked down from the crest of the long divide on bis new pastorate after a long drive behind Jake Mattheson’s bronchos to the accompaniment of a twenty-mile wind and GO degrees of frost, thought It all hard, cruel, brutal in its utter savagery. He could not understand the smile that, at the familiar sight, was softening the lines of the grim visage beside him, and he wondered it he, too, would some day come to love something in that bleak prospect. Oiily time was needed, as the end of his story proves, to put him under the spell of tho prairie—its mystery, its fascination-just as Mr. Whitaker will put their spell ovpt all to whom wide life and the joy of existence appeal.
And not only the life appeals, but the'.
people ius well. One lilces Immensely the sturdy young trappers who made life miserable for the young Probationer, until he had proved to their complete satisfaction, and, still more important, to the completo satisfaction of the village beauty, Ruth Walton, that he was not of the pattern of the other incompetents who had been sent to look after their souls, but in everything except brawn was stronger than themselves, there was nothing half-hearted about their final championship of " the minister.** Rough, obstinate, fierce, fond of taking justice Into . their own hands, are most of these Canadian sons of Anak, as Mr. Whitaker draws them, but always there is the saving grace of a generous soul, hidden though ! it may be as long as possible from the public eye. Their hard life makes them shy of gentlenfess, but the gentleness Is i there under the crust, and of a very beau-
tfful quality when brought to the light
or day.
It would be hard to pick out any particular number of these stories and say that they are the best of the lot, because each one seems to have some special merit of its own. " An Iliad of the Snows ” is perhaps most satisfying from all points of view, though, as soon as that has been said. " Tho Devil's Muskeg ** presents rival claims, except in its less attractive title. Why not say with Kipling’s "Tramp Royal "—we "liked it all ’?
