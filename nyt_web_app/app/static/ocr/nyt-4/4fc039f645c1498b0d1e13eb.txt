I have been greatly interested in the widely divergent opinions expressed by some of your readers as to the character of Mrs. Ward's latest heroine, Lady Kitty Ashe, and the behavior of her'husband. Lady Kitty seems to have won many enthusiastic friends, a fact which surprises me, as I must confess myself quite unable to see her charm. She Is a woman who lacks every instinct of good breeding:. Intensely selfish, totally Inconsiderate of others, even of the man she professes to love. Her crippled child she neglects for days, and to satisfy her own -fooliSli resentment sho is quite willing to sacrifice her husband's career, Many excuses are made for- her—heredity, early training, or, rather, lack of training, and her husband’s silly overindulgence—but all these combined are hardily sufficient to account for the fact that she is without one redeeming trait, save beauty and the fragility which enables Mrs. Ward to dispose of her by means of the disease best beloved of novelists—consumption. Per; b'aps the remarkable elocutionary ability, the " temperament " we are told she possessed. was her great excuse, but it is a
■	difficult one to accept: the shallow wife’s dramatic gifts seeming as unreal as tho I prosy husband’s Parliamentary genius, j We are told that Lady Kitty Ashe Is an accurate, though slightly toned-down, i replica of Lady Caroline Lamb. But—f3 Mrs. Ward a historian or a-novelist? If she is a historian her portrait may be a good one; as a character created by a novelist Lady Kitty is unreal, absurd. William Ashe himself seems to have j been carved out of the same block c-f I wood that went to the making of Aldous ! Raeburn and Jacob Delafield—a dreary,
| priggish, woman’s hero, whose wonderful ; political ability we are obliged to take on trust. The single living, breathing person in the book Ls tho charming little Dean, and one can only regret that Mrs. Ward forced him to take a prominent part in the balcony episode. * Ho never would have done it of h!s own free will.
:	“ The Marriage of William Ashe" is
i exceedingly well written and very Interesting. but the interest felt Is that with ; which one follows the performance of a skillful juggler, not that which is excited bv the fate of veritable human beings.
