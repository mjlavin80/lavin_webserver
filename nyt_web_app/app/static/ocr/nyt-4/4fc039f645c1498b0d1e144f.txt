After reading. “ The Marriage of William Ashe," one is prepared to see.The Nhw Tork Times Book Review flooded. with letters ’from readers, Taut not ioiv ' such , expressions „ as. ** Poor > Kitty ! ”r. ’’** Dear, adorable child! ” “Tfounfi*, frail,’* *&c;, the frail referring to her physical condition.' It might bewell to say at the' outset that considering the m'Oods, .tempers,: and hysterical pleasures indulged in/. not to ,mention toying, with the * passions of/a man-like Cliffe, Iiady (?) Kitty’s strength and nerves 'supported, that which would haye floored her stout-' est -Blave^.V V ! .
~ Admittedly she was “badly bora," but not “ badly reared;* ’ as one correspondent claims. Convent-bred, every reasonable wish gratided, well received in society for her own (surface) charm, ail these things should have made for the building 'up of a fine woman. Besides this she .had. In extreme youth, a perfectly clear, conception of her mother's odious character, " which to a proper mind would have suggested the importance of circumspect behavior and a dignified bearing at ail times. But not to Kitty! Discretion could not have been 41 shaken into Tier ’ small shoulders.” The accident of en’vi-ronment (all needs supplied)' saved her . from at. once reaching her true level among the demi-monde. Given time, there is where heart and' inclination would have led her, but as yet life was too full of untried pleasures for her to hear the voice within. One begrudges so corrupt a nature the privilege of attaining position and respectability which she 'does not value. One reiads hotly of the kind but futile support and Indulgence of husband, mother-in-law, and society In general^ Kitty is given her chance, (let her admirers not forget this,) a chance that could not have come to a more unworthy girl.
Kitty loved to shock the decent *and self-respecting members of the high circle to which she was elevated, but any one of these who failed to smile at her follies was immediately marked for her vengeance, for the -ladorable child,*f it must be confessed, was maliciously vindictive.	.
To Mary Lyster she proved a veritable dog-ln-the-rmangcr* Haying married "the man destined for Mary, she later, with deliberate Intent, came between Mary and Cliffe a3 their romance was about to expand. One correspondent lays Kitty's folly to the loss of her child. His deformity was so repulsive to her that she cared nothing for him, alive or dead. The " mother " was not in her, and she could have eared for no child excepting occasional spasms of pride when its beauty reflected her own.
William Ashe is not a well-rounded character. A man of his mentality should have forestalled Kitty’s making a fool of him; but William had a ridiculously undisturbed confidence In her ex-erclslng good sense at the crucial mo-nient, for which belief she never gave him the slightest ground. For the criminal indulgence of cultivating the vanity and selfishness of his wife William Ashe paid dearly. But not too dearly. He deserved all that came to him and more also. Had Cliffe been Kitty's husband he would have made her behave or -given her an earlier excuse than Ashe did for taking openly to the downward road. She was destined from birth to reach that road, and at no time in her perfectly useless life was she worth the effort of saving, as the author proves after giving her ninety-nine chances—one correspondent declares that she should have been given the hundredth also! Mrs. Ward insults the intelligence of the reader by mendaciously pretending that Kitty is af-fccted (for a moment only, to be purej by the obvious decline of her child. One knows the self-conscious Kitty gave no second thought to the boy, using him once or twicfe as a foil as she used a chair or the bedside to frame a pathetic, pose which always brought down the gallery, occupied solely by the gullible William! There is no getting away from Kitty in or out of the ybook, she is “ rubbed in '* oaf \ the reader as she “ rubbed. herself hiV on all who came in contact with her. Like Henry James, though for different reasons, Mrs. Ward is no longer worth your time.
