In the short preface to Giovanni Rosadi’s volume, “The Trial of Jesus/* Dr. Emif Reich, author of “Success Among. Nations,” “Atlas of English History,” &c., speaks as follows of the author’s work:
Signor Rosadi has approached his prob-fem—apparently a purely legal one—with a, warmth of sympathy, with a breadth of philosophical view, 'with a purity of religious ;.sentiment that have rendered his book not only a noteworthy contribution to the history of Jesus, but a stimulating and (we say it unhesitatingly) an edifying, work in the best sense of the word. ..
.writes with warmth concerning the “ higher criticism ** and its harmful aims; however, he says: " Higher criticism has done harm • ? * not to the Bible, but to the critics themselves. Whatever scfoi-1 ists and. pedants may say In their numerous journals and periodicals,* it remains certain that higher critics have not con-trlbuted anything essential toward a true historical construction of the greatest figyre..of history.”	•
Whether applied to Greek and I>atin classics or to the Old and New Testament, Dr. Reich adds this higher criticism “ has proved an amazing-blunder.” Dodd, Mead & Co. have the book in active preparation
