2	HAVE to note this week, coincident with the little English revival of interest in Keats, due partly to the publication in London of the “ Hyperion ” fac simile, and a new edition of the poems of the author of 41 Lamia," a similar revival of interest in Bryant on both sides of the Atlantic. This latter is. indeed, a small revival, but Bryant la again a topic of literary, discussion, and the discussion cannot fail to be measurably profitable to the youngsters. Mr. William Aspenwall Bradley’s biography of William Cullen Bryant in the English Men of Letters Series is founded largely, so far as mere facts go, on the late Parke Godwin’s authorized biography of his wife's father. Mr* Bradley thinks that, in spite of the praise of the author of " Thanatopsis ”*by Poe, Stedman, and Prof. Woodberry, “ criticism, and especially American criticism, has done Bryant scant justice/* Churton Collins has a tribute to Bryant in his book on “ The Poetry and Poets of America/' and Mr. ".Bradley hopes^ that England may eventually “ discover Bryant." The tone of his own praise of Bryant, however, is-very moderate. His criticism is_ tinctured with sobriety, not to 3ay caution. “ Bryant may not be-a great poet/' are the Words that begin , hla very last paragraph. Elsewhere he says: M He Is no Wordsworth ** and “he Is not for an instant seriously to be compared with tliat great poet-philoso- -! pher whose impress is on all English poetry sjri£e his time/’ 3Vell? the burden of American criticism in the j past has not differed nrbckfrom this. -	^
