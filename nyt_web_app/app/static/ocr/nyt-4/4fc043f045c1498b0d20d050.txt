| A. FRENCH VIEW OF HAWTHORNE, j
' "We have received from the publishers, Hachette et Cie of Paris, a bulky volume, N. Hawthorne, sa vie et son oeuvre," by M. L. Dhaleine, Doctor, 6s lettres. It contains 500 large octavo pages of close print. Our French friends have a happy phrase for a work demanding patient industry and sustained energy, “de longue haleine." As one measures the contents of this "big, elaborate volume one wonders if the name of the author be not an anagram composed from that phrase, such evidence does the volume give of painstaking study, so thoroughly is its matter mastered and marshaled, so minutely and accurately is it annotated. Nor is the work by any means one solely of patience and industry. It is in its criticism as sympathetic as it is comprehensive and as discriminating as it is detailed. The writer not merely has searched well the- field—what Hawthorne wrote and what has been written about him—but he has searched intelligently the history and the literature of Hawthorne’s time, He has essayed to trace such influences as he can fairly be thought to have yielded to and has tried to determine his place In American letters. All this he has done in admirable spirit and with evident interest in and enjoyment of his task, which,-presumably, was not - an easy one.
We may be pardoned for thinking that Hawthorne's writings would not appeal very strongly to the mind of a Frenchman. His charm, for Englishspeaking readers, is sufficiently elusive. To many it seems to lie more in the manner than in the matter; the two. indeed, may well seem not entirely congruous, the latter is often so weird and mystical and suggestive of a rather vague symbolism, the former ! generally so lucid and simple, so grave and yet so supple, so enticing in its brightness, so almost baffling in its polish. It is not given to all EnglishSpeaking men and women to penetrate the attraction Hawthorne possesses for his faithful lovers, and—though lasting fame may await him—we think it is now true that the number whom he jdraws and satisfies is smaller than was the case a generation ago and^is probably, for the time, diminishing. And if this be true, it is also true that interest in and understanding of the environment in which his work was done is very much more rare than a generation ago. To many of us it seemed twoscore years since that when he died, like Lycidas, he left no peer, and one seeks in vain among the writers of the present day one who betrays either like inspiration or life in like conditions. How much more, then, may a French' man be expected to find the elucidation of Hawthorne difficult. The French mind is usually analytic, and Haw* ‘thorne eludes analysis. The French *
.^nind delights in precision and definiteness and excets in precise and definite treatment, and ~ Hawthorne was, in great part, a dreamer of dreams; his singular'power of observation was, in great part, directed to matters ■ essentially obscure. Mystery, as mystery, i delighted and excited him/ and ho | hunted it amid commonplace surround! ings persistently and—as it seems even
■	to his admirers—at times perversely.
But It is frankly to be said that M.
; Dhaleine has not been 'repelled, and certainly has not been defeated by the difficulties presented by Hawthorne. On^he contrary, he has faced them with courage and has overcome them with success that would be remarkable in the best-equipped countryman of the American romancer. And he succeeds most conspicuously on the side where he might easily have fallen short, -j A peculiarity of his work is that it seeks no aid from the comparative method, from which much aid might readily have been gbt. He confines himself to a portrayal of Hawthorne’s life and work as he sees them after close study. The result is a singularly clear and informing volume, of which It is not too much to say that it is a substantial contribution—in a sense an Indispensable contribution—to the literary history of our country in the middle third of the last century.
