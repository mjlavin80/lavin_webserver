To these add Uncle Ablme-lech, a man " loose-jointed In his mind a trifle," but his memory " striwgy and lone’'; -Stevey Todd, ship's cook, and Madse. who is just a slrl. F’iniilly Capt.
Tom himself. Says he, autobiograph-
1 cully:
I was so. when I was a lad of eighteen or nineteen. I was a wild one, though not large, but limber and clipper built and happy any side up, and my notion of human life was that It wis something like a cakewalk and something like a Bartlett pear, as being juicy anywhere you bit in.
