Tfcic York Times Hook Rcvlcic; P^W£wjj]HERE swrna to be a tendency among the average readers jrW*	of novels, as indicated in
jg3|. jfinSl their letters to 'fas Book iM §£ea Review, .to insist that a nov-e]ist shall also be a preacher, and write books with the express intention of pointing a moral. A most ..amusing illustration of this tendency was shpwn in thf* controversy concerning " Elizabeth and Her German Garden, to ‘which you opened your hospitable columns some* little time ago—the contributors to one side of the controversy being determined to read into that airy masterpiece a fell desire on the part of its author to mal:e light of some sacred things. And now the letter writers are after Mrs. Humphry Ward. They want To know why she did not cause William Ashe, to do this or that, and demand If she considers him to be a gentleman and a modcl'husband; and If his treatment of the irritating Lady Kitty was what It ought to have been. &c. They even modestly suggest that if William had done otherwise, the resulting conduct of Lady Kit,ty would^h.ive been more satisfactory to readers of the booki all of this im ’plying that if Mrs. Ward lias not made William Ashe a perfect man of faultless behavior she is open to criticism. fa not this view a bit crude? The great writers ‘<if strong fiction, among whom Mrs. 'Ward ht>!ds high rank, are artists in the use of words, who depict0 life with the same earnest effort at truthful delineation that inspires the painter or sculptor. They do not lend their great gifts to the presentation of' pleasing possibilities, but rather to tho faithful portrayal of human life, character, and emotions, as they are. A novel which should be peopled by men and women free from error and above jiuman weakness would hardly be of interest to thoughtful readers.
Nowhero in her book does Mrs. Ward present William as a model, nor does she s-t forth his dealings with his wife as tt tluidc to Husbands. She has selected as the (.ventral figure in this story a fair type of hlgh-daiss	and	with
r;ire .skill and understanding has Shown What would be ih<* natural consequence of a marriage between such a man and a woman like Lady Kitty. He is a man with the qualities and delects of his class.
;i:iJ Jn- brhav -s toward his erring 'Rife as sik'Ii a man wmiild he most likely to do. It is of cours** possible that if a husband should forgive such a wife once more. (William had already forgiven much,) she might do better if given one more trial, hut he certainly had no reason to hope for a happy result from the experiment.
H<’ had loved her deeply and borne with ]iit patiently until her consuming cgo-Lism had worn away the glamour of his 1 lm>\ and he saw her as she was—vain, -elfish, and hopelessly self-centred in spite of her occasional flashes of better sentiment. On such a foundation, after failures to arouse her ' better nature. what could he hope to build? Coincident with this awakening comes the opening out < f his career ami the necessity for making a choice. His decision was perhaps not the one that would have be‘*n made by an ideal man and husband, hut at least it was a natural one under the circumstances. The book is a sad and impressive picture of the tragedy that ran come to mismated lives—to the union of a " spirituul arfslocrat ” <to use Mrs. Ward's own fine phrase) and a moral plebeian, for with all her dainty ways and outward refinement. Lady Kitty's emotions nirely rise above the dictates of vanity, personal spite, and self-indulgence carried lo the last degree. If this fine writer has drawn with fidelity the two characters around whom the interest of the story centres, and has caused them to act consistently, her task is well and truly done. The moral of the situation
must he drawn by each reader for himself, according to his light. And Mrs. Ward has done her work well. It seeins to me that only a woman could have conceived such a character as Lady Kitty, and I believe that only women will fully appreciate the lifelike quality of the picture. No writers have so well understood as Mrs. Ward and George Eliot the petty bareness that oan, without apparent disharmony, reside in a personality of outwardly exquisite femininity. Witness, Lady Kitty and Rosamund Yincy. Happily such women are rare.
Those readers who will not be satisfied with the book unless they can find some moralizing may turn to the interview in which the Doan pleads with William for the supposedly penitent Kitty. Certainly no finer anti-divorce sermon has been piven in these days. It was natural that the Dean should preach a little, so Mrs. Ward lets him preach; but William's province was not to preach, nor even to I	set an example. His creator has set him
|	before us, a man of a certain type, and
he acted as Huch a man would probably have acted iindCr the circumstances. The man and woman .are true to life, the circumstances are ^rell within the range of ■possibility, and thfe action is consistent thereto. Is not .this enougly to expect from our author*! _	^r-
