" For the existence of this thing which we call the thordughbred horse of America, we, in common with all countries of civilization ,■ must give' thanks to England. There is not.at this day galloping-r upon the turf of any land under the sun a single1 animal worthy* of• the name of . race horse. which does not go' back through generations to an- original English foundation.: The American turf- 1b only the English turf transplanted, with > wine alterations; v.to a new soil.

Almost with the ' genesis of the‘white man upon the American continent. theV use. of the horse as a ,means of - sport came into vogue; In
