t A very industrious man was Sam Del Purchas, - who, gathered In all possible Information of a geographical character about early travelers. Long-winded of course he was* but it was probably necessary in the time when Purchas Hved to omit nothing. Certainly his acquaintance with sacred and profane history was enormous. His method of interpretation may not accord wi.th our Ideas of to-day. lust as in 200 years our theories will be set aside. But Samuel Purchas's ** Hakluy-tus Posthumus " a mine well worth digging'into. His time was one of eager curiosity, for the world swarmed with adventurers, and there were hopes of untold wealth for fortune seekers. If King Solomon had found Ophir, why should not an EDgIJsh monarch have brought before £lm the gold and the *' diamants ” of the East?
Purchas was born at Thaxted, In Essex. aboQl 1577. He was educated at St. John’s College, Cambridge, and In 1G01 became the curate of Purleigh. in Essex. The lower clergy, did not hold In those days a high social position, so when he married he.and his bride are described as " household servants of the parson of Purleigh."
In the vicarage of Eastwood he remained 6p to 1614. Eastwood was not far from , Leigh, only two miies /rom tbe Thames, and Leigh was a seaport. Here tt was, probably, that Purchas's head got full of j stories of adventure, and he made a regular study of the records of the past. He j was no traveler, for he wrote. " Even I j which have written so much of travelles and travellers, never travelled 200 miles | from Thaxted in Essex where I was ! borne." Later on when he became rector of St. Martin’s, Ludgate, he had access to all the books he wanted. Several works were written by Purchas on travels, and the “ Hakluytus Posthumus " saw the light in	and was ** imprinted in Lon- j
don for Henry Featherton at ye slgne of the rose, in Pauls Churchward.’* The volumes under notice are facsimiles of the originals. Purchas in bis title shows the respect he had for tbe great English geographer, Thomas Hakluyt, and it seems highly probable that tbe two had worked together, Hakluyt died in IGlTt. and Purchas eleven years afterward.
The custom of the day required the most obsequious dedication, and Purchac writes such a one " To the Most High and Excellent Prince Charles." Just before the true business of the book begins Purchas writes *' A Note Touching the Dutch." It might have been that commercial rivalry somewhat prejudiced the author in regard to the Hollander. Rather ambiguously Purchas hints that there are many good and great men in the Low Country, and also many rascals, Pur-c has tells about the " Shelves and Rorkes from the e-arth, W hirlee-wlndes. Currents. Billowes and Bellowes of the Sea. Tempests. Hurricanes, Tufons, Waterspouts, am] dreadful Meteors from the Aire " which endanger sealaring men. In a chupter with lhe title "Of Ophir,' divers opinions aro weigh d and censured, also whether " the vVm passe was knowne to ilif Old World." He insists that the re mot*1 parts weiv lately uninhabited, ‘ the New World but ne\&:Iy, n nd a great part thereof not yet." All things in America., he says. " proclaim** it a New World." There are not in " all Virginia. New England, ami Newfoundland as many people as in the Citie with the Suburbs."
Jn the second volume the history of all the travels, beginning with the Portu guese, are jecountcd. then follows Columbus, and after him the English and Dutrh exploration**. One topi* of great interest is lh«* letters of William Adams, who tells of his stay In Japon— a forced stay, by the way—and ho*v he built
*	shippes " for the Emperor I >es< ribin.fi: lhe people. Adams wrote
The people of this Island or Japon are good of nature, courteous above measure and valiant in warre; thpir Justice is severely executed without any nartialite upon the transgressors of the Law *	*	*	1	think	no l^a.nd better gov-
erned in the world by Civil Police.
Adams sailed from the Tcxel in lIKXi. and his letters w^re written during the closing years of the fifteenth and the beginning of the sixteenth centuries.
Too much respect cannot be given to the work	o£ Samuel Purchas. With
Hakluyt, It	shows	the advances made by
civilization. Some centuries have passed Eince the book was issued, and of course I much has	been	learned since. Nevertheless,	is one	of tho foundations on
