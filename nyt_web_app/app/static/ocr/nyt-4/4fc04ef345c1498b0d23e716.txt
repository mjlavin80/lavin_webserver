•\I have been much interested in the different opinions-6f your correspondents In regard to 41 The Marriage of William' Ashe,” .and ain minded to add my mite to theplle. Truly the old adage, "Many men' of many minds," holds good. It seems odd that any one should be “enraged ” at poor, long-suffering William unless it was because he did not shake .that little depaon Kitty out of her boots the first time she began to cut up her capers. He “ spoiled ” her from a mistaken sense of honor. He had promised her freedom, and, like the gentleman he was, he kept that promise, not realizing that she would abuse his patience. She had compromised him publicly and privately, been rude to his friends, flouted his mother, carried on a desperate flirtation right under his nose, and made herself conspicuous and a drawback in every possible way, and then, when his book came out, she had simply gone to the end of her tether and laid .the "last straw on the camel’s back-’' She lied, of course, when she told him she didn’t think it would do him any harm, unless the fact that she never did think before doing anything could cover the statement. Darrell told her In* very plain language how detrimental it would be to William, and’if she had one-tenth of the acuteness and brains Mrs. Ward gives to her, she knew it without being told. To my mind Kitty is one of those characters about which It irritates one to read. To live with her would give the worst criminal immunity from Hades, If there Were such a place. Mrs. Ward’s especial bid for sympathy for,Kitty seems to be in her being small and frail and thin. The fact is always emphasized when she has been particularly outrageous. As far as I can see, the only things about her not small were her vanity, selfishness, egotism, and heartlessness. They were colossal. She didn't even love her child, because he was afflicted, and she thought of no one but herself where the gratification of her whims was concerned. Unstable as water and illogical as an animal, William's forgiveness would have availed little as a prevention of future escapades. Mary’s treachery and Cliff e’s appearance at Verone only hastened, not caused, the climax.
I wonder if it has ocourred to any reader that the most deserving of sympathy
is , Lady Tranmore. "William made his
OWtt bed, 5nd if he found it full of thorns he had to suffer. Lady Tranmore knew what Kitty’s antecedents and upbringing had been, but was powerless to prevent the marriage. Think what anguish she must have endured, what a blow to her i love, her ambition, and pride of race, and : how nobly she stood by Kitty for her idolized William’s sake. Mary was detestable from start to finish, and did not at all deserve to be called Polly. ’ KATHERINE BARSTOW.
