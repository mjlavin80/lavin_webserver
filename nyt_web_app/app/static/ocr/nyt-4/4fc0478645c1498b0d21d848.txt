The drama Is more a personal than a theoretical matter. Every one goes to see plays; every one is In some way or other affected by them. In most cases the effect will be no more than comes from a period of rest to a spirit wearied by the restless work or play or ennui of life from day to day. A relaxation, a recess, a recreation—such is the theatre to most. But even as such It must be something more. If this man always does one thing and that man does something else, they will certainly differ In time. If one man commonly goes for an evening’s amusement to so-called vaudeville, and another for an evening’s amusement commonly goes to see Shakespeare *	*	*	there will
surely be some difference finally, other things being equal, between the two. The theatre is too powerful a stimulant for any spirit at all sensitive to escape it wholly.
It is thus that Edward Everett Hale, Jr., speaks of the drama in his introduction on “Standards of Criticism” to his book, M Dramatists of the Day,’* which Henry Holt & Co. publish.
Dr. Hale describes the more important dramatic writings of Rostand, Suder-mann, Hauptmann, Maeterlinck, Shaw, Pinero, and Phillips, and touches also on the achievements of Ibsen and his place in the modern drama. Although the work of the dramatists Is considered mainly as literature, several of the stage performances are discussed; a number of the plays of Maeterlinck and Shaw that have not been performed in thi3 country have also been given a place in the book. “ Three or four passages ’* In the volume, as the author says in liis prefatory note, originally appeared in The Dial, which “ used to give him opportunities to write on these matters.”
