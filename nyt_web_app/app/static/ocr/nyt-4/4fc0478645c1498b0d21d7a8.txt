Tod, a waif from the moors, i.i emphatically u. self-made man: hr* goes down into the inevitable* tin mine as a. pit boy and emerges as the ohief engineer to find his father. Though of noble form. TorJ's face is as ugly as thr* desert, redeemed only by his e>es. Luke. by contrast, i.s of the | best family in the region, handsome as Ganymede, graceful as ii panther, and son of one of the chief owners of the-mine.
Luke's cousin Jessie falls in Jove with Tod at the mature age of six. when the ugliness of hi« face matters naught to her. Later the beauty of Luke draws her fancy so strongly that the tale just skirts
a tragedy. But tho o'-ean finds its way into tho children’s old playground, the Puffing Hole, and threatens the mine. As the two men battle side by side to stem the tide their old friendship rises again, from the waves, and reunited, they may appear in a sequel, it is hinted. In spite of tho inane title the book is well worth reading. The people are natural and consistent, the story is well- told and interesting, and if the seciuel should ever appear it should find an audience predisposed .in tts favor.
