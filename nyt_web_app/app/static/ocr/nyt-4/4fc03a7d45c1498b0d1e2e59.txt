In his paper in the May Century on the work of The Associated Press, in which he will tell of the removal of Russian censorship on foreign news, Melville E. Stone speaks in conclusion of the consequence of the arrangements made by the Czar and himself, brought about in a personal interview of the American, with the ** Little Father." Mr. Stone writes:
As a consequence of these arrangements The Associated Press has been able to usurp in a large measure the functions of the diplomat, and I think it makes for universal peace in a remarkable way. Instead of public Questions now passing1 through the long and tedious methods of diplomacy, as formerly, the story Is told with authority by The Associated JPress. The point of view of a- country''Ts presented no longer by diplomatic communication, but in the dispatches of The As* eociated Press.
