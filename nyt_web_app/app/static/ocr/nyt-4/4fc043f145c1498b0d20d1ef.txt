THE UUAKERESS. A Tale. Cy CTiarlea Heber Clark, (Max Adeler.) Illustru*-e<J. x_mo. r’hllatielphia; TTic John C. Wlnstmi Company.
In the IttUe village of Connock, In Pennsylvania, away from the din and bustle of larger cities, lived Abby Wooffcrd, a, Quakeress, young-, inexperienced, anJ pure of heart, whose Hfe had been shaken by ! no deep passions, but whose love for i George Fotherly had burned with a i steady, unflickering flame from earliest 1 childhood. George was a Quaker, too, manly, stalwart, good to look and to lean upon, and Abby and he might have ended ' their lives peacefully together without events enough to make one chapter. let alone a story covering 302 pages, but for [ the appearance on the scene of Dolly Harley and hor dashing brother, Clayton, who came from the South to visit their aunt.
1 Alra. Ponder, the wife of the pastor of one of the churches for the world’s people in Connock. There was that about Clayton which disturbed the peace of the Quaker maiden, which attracted her in spite of i herself, and which suddenly, against her will, flared into hot passion. And Clayton, on his side, wooed Abby with all the ardor of a warm Southern nature. Not until after he had won her did he eonft-sa to her that he already had a wife living in Mexico whom he married when he was young- and before ho knew his own mind. After that the struggle in Abby's breast begun—her Innate purity and goodness warrfngr with her fierce love for this man in spite of his weaknesses and folly.
George Fotherly, meanwhile, a noble picture of ideal manhood, stands firm as a rock in his devotion for Abby even In the face of Dolly’s evident charms. In spite of Mrs. Ponder’s talkative tongue, which delays the action somewhat, the story moves along at a fairly rapid pace. The worst grievance to be lodged against that amiable lady was her habit of addressing her rather weighty spouse by the
endearing title of M birdie.”
There are descriptions of the peaceful meetings of Quaker First Days, and counter scenes where Abby, listening to the voice of tho tempter, arrays herself In purple and fine linen and dances on the arm of Clayton; there is a duel tn the small hours of the morning, with Abby arriving just in time
to separate the antagonists; there is n note begging Abby to torget her honor and fly with the man she loves; a happy error which saves her from disgrace, and, lastly, the convenient battlefield with a merciful bullet which ends the conflict for Clayton and brings Abby, brokenhearted, to the arms of George, there to rest a while and die.
