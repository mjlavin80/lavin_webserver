N American professional man of distinction, ^who died not many years ago, was in the habit, when any 0110 had angered him, of locking Itfm-seU in hia private office and writing a Jong:	and abusive letter
the offending person, in which the gave his anger full play. A choice vocabulary of epithets and denunciatory adjectives was drawn upon freely for these letters^ The offensive creature was extravagantly berated In every line. When the letter was finished its writer felt greatly relieved. He read it over several times to enjoy its forcible expression of righteous indignation. Then he destroyed it, and, unlocking his office door, returned to the day’s routine with a, calm mind.
This method of relieving one's wrath might seem to some men of business too expensive for ordinary use; for time is money. But it has its advantages. No one can give way to anger without loss of dignity except in his own closet, with the key turned in the lock. A letter written for immediate destruction, and for the writer’s eye only, is surely the safest medium for the literary expression of wrath. To be sure, there is always the danger, remote, but real, that the writer might die suddenly before destroying the letter. It is better, indeed, never to give way to anger at all; but this way of the ingenious professional man seems to us by far the best way, if one cannot wholly control his passions.
If it be urged that there is a suspicion of obvious moralizing in the foregoing, the excuse must be that the inspiration for the remarks was found in the new book of Miss Marie Corelli, which is made up entirely of obvious moralizing and explosions of unreasoning wrath. After glancing through the book, which contains a collection of short but formidable essays, most of which had already appeared in periodicals, we are Impelled to commend the method of the professional person above mentioned to Miss Corelli's attention. That this well-meant advicc will ever reach her eye we are not encouraged to hope. It Is a well-known fact that Miss Corelli never reads newspapers, although "the sins of newspapers and tho Ignorance of journalists are among her favorite subjects.

Miss Corelli’s book is entitled " Free Opinions Freely Expressed on Certain Phases of Modern Social Life and Conduct,” and it is published by Dodd, Mead & Co. We should not, for our own part, call Miss Corelirs opinions " free." They are certainly not free from prejudice and ill-temper, not always, as it seems, from downright malice. They are rather
" cheap opinions opinions winch, cxcept when they are common and unimportant, are not often formed on reason and good Judgment. Miss Corelli hates not only
the newspapers, but the Americana, Mr. Carnegie, and a large part of the English clergy. Particularly, she hates persons who write and print unfavorable comments on her hooks.
There is no reason at all why Miss Corelli should be at pains to express her dislikes in print. She has plenty of other subjects to write about. In the field of fiction she hesitates at nothing. Everything in nature, everything beyond nature,
Is in her quarry. She tacklcs subjects that might chill the ardor of a Milton or a Goethe, and writes about them with precisely the same authority and large fund of information she reveals when writing about the foibles of modern English society.
She has certainly a good working equivalent for the poetic imagination, she is filled with a tempestuous sort of ardor which she calls religion, and she is hailed as one gifted with genius by countless thousands of her fellow-beings. There are, to be sure, many misguided folks who often mistake for genius a lack of the sense of shame; but we are far from assuming: that all the qualities in Miss CoreliS's innumerable works which have made her fame are ignoble. Violence, prejudice, a painfully narrow view of life, and a lack of proportion, however, shockingly mar her present book, and are more 1 or less noticeable blemishes in all her books.
