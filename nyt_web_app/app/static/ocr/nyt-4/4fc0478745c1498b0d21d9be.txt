In tho present day of minute specialization, works dealing with only one phase of a limited subject have a place Which 1 a century ago they could not have had.
I Among1 this class of highly specialized literature, the latest book of Mr. Thomas Gold Frost would be ranked. It is particularly a treatise describing and comparing the incorporation laws of the various States and Territories of the Union. 1 Every step in obtaining a charter, incor- | porating-, issuing stock, and going Into I bankruptcy is fully described for every i class of corporation and with reference , to the statutes of every Commonwealth. | The legislative, judicial, and executive powers of the various branches of the | Federal and State Governments over cor- j porations are given clearly anti succinctly, , and 185 pages are devoted to a synopsis- | digest of the incorporation acts 'of the several States and Territories. This digest I is remarkable for its careful condensation | of the very wordy acts into a form avail- | able for quick and reliable reference, j Nothing essential Is omitted, and nothing1 unnecessary is included. The citation of the statutes is interlarded with the records of cases showing their judicial interpretation and the contingencies relative to them which have arisen.
As a book for the reference of the lawyer and the Information of the prospective incorporator, we do not know of any work comparable to this. It is as profound as the occasion demands, and is abbreviated to meet the requirements of the busy man who wants predigested in^ formation, unincumbered with the husk3 and chaff of legal phraseology.
