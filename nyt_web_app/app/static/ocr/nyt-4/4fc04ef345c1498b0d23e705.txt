We should not rank Mr. Wells quite as higr^ Jules Verne as a romancer, but as a Yrumorist lie far surpasses Verne, who was hardly a humorist at all» hardly more so than, the author of '* Sindbad the Sailor,'*, who had at least a sense .of humor.
A comparison In The London Times of the work of Jules Verne, the French writer of modern tables, and H. O. Wells, who has Just published a new book of more or less amazing stories, seems to place Mr. Wells on a somewhat higher Intellectual plane than the recently deceased Frenchman. Vefne is admitted to be the better "raconteur0 of the two, but he wrote in fun, while Mr. Wells is in earnest. Now ’we have inferred, hitherto, that Mr. Wells sometimes Jests. The beginning of “ The Food of the Gods” is surely mere burlesque. Some of hia Stories like “ The Sleeper Awakened " and " The~ War of Worlds V are grotesque rather, than amusing, to be sure, but if'he is not one of the British humorists of the present hour, even ln his philosophi-,
. cal and 44 sociological - moods, what oii earth,ishe?
