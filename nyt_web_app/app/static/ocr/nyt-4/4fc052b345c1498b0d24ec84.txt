Tfew York Times Book Rtviac:
In reading “ The Marriage of William Ashe" multitudinous questions arise as crystallized sands of black, green, yellow, and red. They arrange themselves in Mrs. Ward's kaleidoscope as disease,
: heredity, pro-natal Influence, education, original sin. biology, and kindred sub: jects in the determination of cause and effect. As they consecutively arise one wonders whether a kaleidoscope suits its ! own humor about the patterns or answers to, another call. There is no way of find-lng out. All we can do la to keep on admiring or rejecting what Is projected through the eyepiece.
But science, like law, is tedious. We ; are respectable—at least we have it in our heads that we're so—and we want to know whether to associate with ICltty Ashe or not. Or whether, seeing what she did. we should still call her ** Lady."
: In~ the first place, Kitty possessed ** ferai-nlnity " in its concentrated form, and as nature has justified herself In making some hunchbacks the greatest musicians of all time, so aj^o has she shown that if wo do not understand the greatness of femininity as it appears now and then, in its intense forms, that Is our fault, not the embodiment of the form's. This alone justified Kitty, or Mrs. Ashe, or ! Lady Kitty. Secondly, she was invincibly and, irrevocably linked with art. Just as art justifies nudity or poetic license.
1 Kitty Ashe justifies her being. To the j mind that makes government and its | half-brother business to be the chief end of man Lady Ashe is a monstrosity. To ! ' any one who believes individuality and ! I its beautiful and artistic development the primary reason, and government and commercialism mere ends of society to make it possible, she was the exponent of that spirit that stands for woman's greater freedom to-day. William Ashe served a Government which has In its plodding way ever emerged into the light of day as a bottle of old wine comes from an old cellar to the table covered with cobwebs and dust. His love affair went through the same process. Lucky it was his wine was poured out amid the brilliancy e're the guest departed.
,As we look, back to the Colonial wars— the Boston Tea Party and like Incidents— we see William Ashe and his tardy love at a deathbed reflected in renewed prom-
■ , Isea to a moribund- Colonial scheme. Eng * ' land loved us when too late, and loves us now, in our celestial freedom, so to speak. From the absent railroad- man—:the best of husbands, ' no doubt—to the English Cabinet Minister is a wide stretch. They both, however, are to answer the same call of women in ■their solitude. "We can’t stand to be away from you so much," " Help us or we fail." Let us think over all the tragedies we’ve seen and ' react about, where women failed. Loneliness was the keynote—always. A '* chilling: want of sympathy." Loneli-’■noss starts the morphia fiend. Loneliness starts the neurasthenic woman. Loneliness started the trip of Lady Kitty with Geoffrey Cliffe, Fondness evinced in mere outward forms of endearment is not to the point. That does not suffice any more than a beautifully wrapped bonbon would satisfy the hunger of a boy out fishing tho whole morning. It is cympathy, real sympathy, that/s the thing. Not translated in the language 01' all men to all women, but made vigorously Individual, palpitatingly, personal. Did William Ashe' even single out Kitty to “tell her why she towered over all women in her sparkling passion? Maybe it happened, some one says, but wasn’t mentioned. Why leave It out and put the ordinary conversations with maids and the like so much in evidence? Tho truth Is, Kitty probably had to infer, the fcame as we did, and as Geoffrey Cliffe carried his poetic reasons with him, he became to be in her eyes what he did—which was a kind of language for her love for William. In “ Lady Rose's Daughter " I've always wondered if-Julie Ik Breton didn't kiss Jacob *' good-bye" and Imagine fo I herself It was Warkwortli, and In this i later story if Kitty didn't picture Will-1 iam as vigorously displaying his passion when she listened to Cliffe. •
Cliffe was one of the little souls sent by the gods to make fun of our society and its absurdities and Inconsistencies. She succeeded, and, what is more, satisfied the test of divinity ,at her death, since she triumphed over life and met the i darkness calmly and sweetly. As she died one could fancy they saw the mark : of the shear thrust In the side from -Polly and tho Imprint of the nails in her 1 limbw— the nails of established usage, j English custom, and social tradition. In one place only did slitt fall in her crucifixion—she might have said, " William,
' forgive Polly. She1 knew not what she did." But, being merely one of us, she didn't. .	.	H. M. HALL.
