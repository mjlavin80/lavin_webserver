New York Times Book Review:
In his rather lame reply to your editorial of March 11, the author of '* The ClansmanM asserts that^ during the eighteen months of preparation for writing that much-discussed novel more than
4,000	volumes of historical and controversial material passed through his hands, and that he bought nearly a thousand volumes outright, as he needed to make a clearer study of them than was possible in the great libraries. That was indeed an ouvrage de longue halelne. Four thousand books, big and little, good and bad, consulted in eighteen months, gives us an average of seven books dally for 547 consecutive days'. And yet the poet dared to write that “ Labor itself is but a sorrowful song.'*
Not content with thus perusing nothings, and perhaps to remind himself if not others, that the trade of literature is not always what it is cracked up to be, Mr. Dixon buys a thousand volumes for his library that he may look into them in his hours of ease and alternate labor, “seeking for a single blossom in theory desert M of a multitude of books. He is careful to tell us that he placed them in his library. To properly shelve 1,000 volumes calls for a space 18 feet long by 8 feet in height, and this means 144 square feet of room wall given over to works all bearing on. one subject! C'est €patant
By the way, I came only to-day on a paragraph in Volume II. of “ The United States: A History of Three Centuries'*— a remarkable work being published by the Putnams—which read as follows:	"As
an example of New England thrift, it is narrated of James Burnham of Norwich, Conn,, that beginning soon after the middle of the eighteenth century he personally took to the village market within twenty years 2,500 loads of wood, all but fifty loads from his own land and most of it cut by himself, and with not an accident of any kind, even to the bruising of a finger.” It may be permitted us to wonder If, like the honest woodchoppor of Norwich, the honest novelist, who used striking situations from other books, but knew no way by which he might give proper credit to their rightful owners, will be so pleasantly mentioned In history 150 years from now.
