Gullibility stretched to tho breaking point of elasticity is the predominating, if not the only, trait of this singular character known as Reuben Larkmead. Educated in a Western college and possessing: a fortune running into the millions, founded on beet sugar, the young man comes to New Tork:	His	wealth,
aided by friends whom the reader is led to imagine are within the Inner circle of the “ best society," supplies easy introductions into this exclusive set. He Is invited on a coaching party, and^the praise bestowed by his fair companions upon the clever handling of the reins causes him to feel that " to be a hero in that life one must be able to do something In the way of sports, like driving a coach or a golf ball/’
He accordingly buys a coach and four, only to discover the next morning that he has been miserably swindled. Next he essays to buy a yacht, but, although he sees the boat, It turns out to be a leaky fishing smack, which is at once beached, and his friends thank him for giving them a wreck for amusement. He tries politics, and after paying liberally for a club bearing his name, is almost hooted i from the room when he attempts his first serious speech, and a lively row ensues, in which he regains some of'his lost pres- j tige by thrashing the middleweight cham- I pJon of hJs district	~

Here 1 he mcetg scheming actresses, sharpers, gamblers, in short, that large army of grafters ever seeking to find somebody to pay their way through life. Among these easily made friends Reuben Larkmead is the popular fellow; he is treated with the greatest consideration, but he is surprised to discover that he always pays the bills. Of one of these-friends he says:
Neither could I forget that In speaking of me to liar mother she applied to me a term of endearment. She had frequently said to me that she dearly loved a lobster. and I overheard her say to her mother in speaking of me, " He’s such a lobster.”	'
Reuben's somewhat checkered career as the butt of ridicule among his high-society^ friends and the ".easy mark*' among those of a lower.status Is related in an'amuslng manner, but the supine Insipidity of the hero destroys whatever interest might have been aroused in him at the beginning of the book. A thin plot of sentimentality runs through this recital of Reuben’s adventures, -^which, close when the uncle, who suddenly turns out to be a welt-set-up young-fellow of thirty-nine years, marries the young lady to whom Reuben once pro^ posed. Reuben then doe3 the next best
thing and proposes to the mother, who for several years has been a dashing young widow. Needless to say, he is accepted, and In her he finds some one to care for his money, If not, to a great extent, for him,	..	.
