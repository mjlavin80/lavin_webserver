We are asked to regard as a serious piece of literature this dull^-gray little book- stamped in gold, which contains about 20,000 words written by the late Oscar Wilde during his detention in Reading Jail. Is it a masterpiece of literary expression containing the confession of a tortured .soul which frees itself from material things and with a kind of surprise, a kind of scorn rises abovfe humanity and deems itself superior to it? Or is it the work of a literary artisan, of a fabricator of phrases, who having run the whole gamut of human knowledge and human emotion sets down a sequence of' ideas clothed in a language which he knows with an unerring literary sense must be ! effective?	-	-	.	■	■
*	Is it possible to produce a perfecl“work 1 of art—literary or plastic—except the mind
which guides the pen or chisel or brush be sincere in what it conceives arid;in what it expresses? Had Oscar * Wilde* been a ’"Saul, a Socrates, or even a John Bunyan, there would be nothing paradoxical - in *• De Profundis,’' and the book would at once be* assured of a position Yery high indeed in the literature of human documents.
But Wilde was not a Saul or a Socrates or a Bunyan. ’ Leaving his social 'career -aside'; Ills methods of literary production were such as to denote- the literary'artisan rather than the literary artist. Only on the supposition that real .genius, with whom he had coquetted and whom he had imitated and counterfeited, -came to him — . ' • — - * - * ■ ’ ■ in his cell at Reading, can we.accept V* £>e ProfUndis” at-its face value; The other alternative is to regard it as the most remarkable spurious piece of'literature ever produced. Internal analysis as well'as. . a searching, examination into, the manner, of Wilde’s life in jail may in, time reveal the truth; At present, thev internal evi-1’ dence-of “ De Profundis reveals nothing that would ntft be compatible with sincere contemplation r finding expression; in a literary form of the highest artistic order.
Who wrote these lines and many others of equal strength and'beauty—the literary charlatan who was master of his tools or •the repentant sinner, who was incidentally a great literary artist—a hypocrite to the last stroke of the pen or a. chastened, regenerated mind, to- which a forgiving; beneficent genius gave a precious and absolutely undeserved gift?
I have got to make everything that has happened to me good for me.The plank bed, the loathsome food, .the hard ropes shredded into oakum till one s finger tips grow * dull with pain, the* menial offices . with-which each day .begins And.finishes
*	> *• each-and. all of these things I have
to transform into a spiritual experience. There'll not a-single degradation of* the body which I-must-npt try and make, into a spiritualizing of the soul. .	'
