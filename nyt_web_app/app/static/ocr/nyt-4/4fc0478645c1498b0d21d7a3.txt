In convenient form the Director of the Arnold Arboreum at Harvard presents a Volume in which may be found ail information concerning: trees in the United States. Tho ugh research es have been many, the author writes that suclT is the richness of our arborescent flora that a few of our trees to-day may have escaped the notice of botanists^ The "Manual of the Trees of North America *’ is so written that with the lefist amount of trouble you may find to what family or species any particular tree belongs. To aid such inquiries there aria many illustrations where the leaves/ flowers, or fruits ore accurately shown. Firstly, the^ Class Gymnospermae Is considered, to which the Coniferae belong. There are the pines, and of them thirty-one genera are scattered over the surface of the globe, the most abundant being in northern temperate regions. There are' thirteen in North America. The finest of these trees is the Pinus Strobus, which is occasionally found with a height of 250 feet. It , Is distributed all the way from New-| fottndland to Manitoba and eouth as far as Northern Georgia. This pine, Mr. Sar^ gent says\~V is manufactured into lumber, shingles, and laths, used In construction, for cabinet making, the interior finish of buildings, wooden ware, matches, and the masts of vessels.” Its rival is the Pinus Ponderosa, or the yellow pine. This tree will rise occasionally to the height of'230 feet The Pinus Caribaea is a most important tree. Naval stores are largely produced from this pine.
As belonging to the ConIferae there is that magnificent representative the Sequoia sempervlrens, or the redwood. This
giant is thus •described: " A tree, rrom 200 to-340 feet high, with a sllgtitly tapering and irregularly lobed trunk, usually free of branches for 75 or 100 feet.'* These branches are remarkably small in proportion to the trunk* The bark is over
| half a foot in thickness. The wood is not 1 strong- and is used for shingles, fence: posts, railway ties, wine butts, and general building purposes. The: Sequoia Welllngtonia, another arboreal giant, will occasionally rise to a height of-320 feet, and has a trunk some 35 feet in diameter. The wood of this Sequoia is not as good as that of the Sempervirens. To the family of the JugJandaceae the - hickory belongs. There are twelve species. :»nd eleven of them are found in the United States. The excellence of the wood of the hickory brought about our skill in the construction of light vehicles. The oak is mucE~ more widely distributed than is generally supposed. In North America Quercus lives in the southern hemisphere, and may be found in South-America as far as Colombia. There are in ail 275 species, and 52 exist in North America. Almost all of them are important lumber trees, and their bark, rich in tannin, is used foe the tanning of leather. The-Quercus Virginia, the Live Oak, is worthy of particular notice. Its distribution Is of the widest. It flourishes in Mobjack Bay, Virginia; all along the coast and islands of Florida, the shores *of the Gulf of Mexico, through Texas, and then crosses the continent and lives in L»ower California. The wood of this particular oak is heavy, hard, tough, close-grained, and is largely used in shipbuilding." The Yucca Is strictly an American tree. There are about thirty species^ Most of them are small, and only nine of them “ assume the habit and attain the size of small trees.’* Some of the Yucca are of great utility, the roots serve as a substitute for soap, and from their tough fibres and stalks, ropes, baskets, and mats are made. The Maple is widely distributed. It grows in Java. The classical name of the Maple tree is Acer. The limoid sweet sap of the American species furnishes the sugar, and the Macer Sac-charum yields the most. The wood of this particular maple has its* use, and when found with a curly grain is known as bird’s eye maple. Or the U30 trees described in the volume but a tithe can be presented. Tree culture will be better understood when this '* Manual ’* is read.
