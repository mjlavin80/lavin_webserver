There are many new words, phrases, and examples in the new edition ot Robert Nares’s *' Glossary of Words, Phrases, Names, and Allusions In the Works of English Authors, Particularly of Shakespeare and His Contemporaries," edited by J. O. Halllwell, F. R. S., and Thomas Wright, F. S. A. (Svof cloth, leather back. Pp. 0S2. New York: E. P. Dutton & Co. $3 net.) The work was originally published by Nares in 18l£i; and to It he owes chiefly his literary fame. It was the result of thirty-six vears of study and | experience, and is one of the most useful j works for explaining and illustrating the obsolete language and the customs and manners of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It is also of value to readers of the literature of the Elizabethan pe-rlod and to dramatic writers. The author fcas scattered throughout the book critl- i cisms on the difficulties of the text of Shakespeare, which show his knowledge of the literature or the day.
For the present edition very few changes have been made in Nares's text. The editors have added such phrases, words, and expressions that had not been noticed by the author and new and valuable ones that they have found since the publication of the first edition. According to them:
The principle followed in the selection oE these additions has been to give words and phrases from books popular at the time when they were published which have now become very rare tending, to clear up difficulties in writers of that age who are more generally, known or who ore better deserving of general attention. From these illustrations some words and phrases only partially understood before will now receive new light; while others are given because they are rare and curious and may explain difficult passages in authors of this period which have not yet been brought into discussion.
The editors tell us in their preface that Robert Nares, during his whole life, was an active man of letters. He was born at York in 1733, and was the son of tho ! musician anti composer, Dr. James Nares. Among his publications are “ Elements of Orthoepy," Volume III. of the “ Harleian Catalogue," numerous political and other , essays and pamphlets; and he started and conducted, until its forty-second volume,' The British Critic. He was “ the centre of a large circle of friends and acquaint* ahces, by whom he was respected not only as a gentleman and scholar, but as a sound divine and sincere Christian, and to whom he was endeared by many social qualities.*' He was' one ot the'founders'.
