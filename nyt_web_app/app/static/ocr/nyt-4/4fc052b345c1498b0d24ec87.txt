Religious enthusiasm, human affection, the pursuit of gain—these three motives account for the peopling of America by men of European stock and Christian faith. The heroism of white missionaries to the yellow races of Asia Is fresh in every one's recollection, but they axe only
the latest of a long line of magnanimous
men and women. In the nineteenth century David Livingstone and other English Protestants , sought the scorching plains of South Africa to convert to Christianity the black men of those arid regions; in the seventeenth century Isaac Jogues, Andrew White, and other Jesuit Fathers, both French and English, crossed the Atlantic to rescue the souls of North American red men—many of them met torture and death at the hands of those whom they came to save. In the last year of the tenth century L»eif Ericsson, the Northman, sailed trom Norway to Greenland t<T carry the blessings of Christianity to his father and his father's friends, and neighbors. Falling to the southward of Cape Farewell, he came to a strange land, which he named Viniand; he then turned the prow of his ship northward and gained Greenland in safety.

It s called “ The Planting of a Nation in the New 'World/’ and brings the account down to 16G0. At the end of each chapter have been placed for advanced students in history technical discussions and bibliographical matter. -
