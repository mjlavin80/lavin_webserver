'* The price of fish " is not so sounding: a phrase as ** the price of Admiralty,” but It is paid in precisely the same coin, the lives cf men and the tears of women. The heroism of fishers, fishing for their children's bread, is not less than the heroism of those adventurers who explored the New World and fought tb* Armada. Nor is their glory less^so Dr. Yriifred T. Grenfell will have it.
In this little volume the man whose work among ;he seafaring folk of Labrador has been so worthily celebrated by Norman Duncan, tells of t-he life of the fishers along the coast of that bleak, in-j hospitable country and in the North Sea : a® welL The doctor of tbe Mission i to Deep Sea Fishermen clothes his i facts in a thin guise of fioUon, to be I sure, but the facts are the important i thing. A North Sea fisherman and a Lab: rador man In turn tell each the story of | his life from boyhood, first in the old days when rank ungodliness prevailed in the fleets, rum flowed free, and t“here was never a doctor at hand; later as the first mission ships came and changcd things for the better, till now the price of fish,
in blood and suffering and degradation, at least, is much reduced. Dr. Grenfell's narrative of the North Sea fishers especially—considered quite without reference to its value as a record of evangelization— is stirring, full of the life and tragedy of the sea, eloquent of the rough humanity, the elemental strength, the vices as well as the virtues of the men who spend their lives fighting the winds and waves and taking lish out of the deep. The account of the Labrador men is briefer and less picturesque. Upon Dr. Grenfell's own part in the work the narrative touches only In j the most indirect manner. His name does not appear at all except as signed to the , preface.
