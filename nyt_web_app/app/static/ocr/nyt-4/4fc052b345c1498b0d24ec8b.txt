THE GERMAN PEOPLE.
Prof. Dodd Reviews the New Volume of Prof. Karl l_amprecht*s History, Treating of the Seventeenth Century-*
HIS volume Of Lamprecht's monumental history deata ■with the seventeenth century. Its aim and purpose Are to chow the changes in the intellectual, the political' and economic life of Germany which came as a result or tho Lutheran and Calvinistic revolts against the mediaeval. Church.
The author’s preparation for his task has been most thorough as his experience as a student of many departments o learning: has been most extensive. For more than twenty years now the	.
I^lpzle historian has Ueen devoting his magnificent powers to the creation of an account of the growth and evolution of his people which should deal at once with the varied forms and expressions of their historic life—their philosophy, religion, politics, as well as their art-productlons and economic conditions. Lamprecht has been called an economic historian, a slu-gent of sociology, a devotee of art and j philosophy—depending on the point of view of the critic in each instance. He Js none of these in the narrow sense, Bdt truly a sympathetic, thoughtful interpreter, and master of the varied culture of that wonderful people whore historio life began some centuries before the Christian era and has but recently reached Its political unity! The author has been attacked by a number of Important students and defended by men of equal ability; his work has meanwhile continued to make Its way into the homes and libraries of cultured people the world over, while the German Governments have recognized Its worth and conferred high honors upon the writer. The United States, too* has not failed to pay its tribute:	At	the recent

It is then with a notable production and <l really great mind that we have to do Jn this volume. The English Fortnightly Review says Lamprecht’s history is an experiment In his field as notable as was that of Thomas Carlyle. And whoever reads and appreciates the " Deutsche Ge-Echichte," or any considerable part of it, will readily concede to the autKor the very first rank among the students of history in Its broadest and noblest sense.
In describing the linal results of the Lutheran revolt on the religious life of Germany, Lamprecht says (Page 31) that the decidedly orthodox tendency of Luther, combined with the natural conservatism of Melanchthon, produced a sort of Lutheran scholasticism almost as barren and worthless as that of the later Middle Ages. In the same connection he stresses what i^urckhardt pointed out some twenty years ago—that Luther rescued the Papacy from the two great-mortal dangers Into which it was running in 1520—complete secularization from within and domination from without by the political powers. Before Luther’s death the Roman Church becomes a distinctly religious’ Institution and the Council of Trent made-her independent of the temporal authority. But both Lutheranism and the revived Catholicism fail to seize tha Idea which was to dominate the future—re-llglaus freedom. On the other hand the new Reformed Church and the ancient Roman curia join hands in a policy of most rigid Intolerance. Passive obedience was what both demanded from every one, and the pious Lutheran enjoyed a heresy trial as thoroughly as a Catholic loved an auto da fe. Both Churches were at one In their hatred ot Calvinism, which was reciprocated with Interest. So the kindly, liberal feeling of the great humanists, both orthodox and reformed, was lost to th-2 world. It became a mortal sin to think except in prescribed grooves.
Strange to say the Calvinists of Holland—the religious ancestors of our New England Puritans—opened their doors to persecuted thinkers, students and writers from all countries. Tolerance, if not freedom, was made the law of the land; yet even then Spinoza dared not speak his mind, and his famous “ Ethics ” was not published until after his death. Still, as is bo well shown in this work, the centre of learning shifts from South Germany and the Rhine to The Hague, Amsterdam, ajid Louvain. There Descartes spent the greater part of his active years, and John Locke later found there his much-needed ajsj'Iurn.
How weak, though, must this feeling have been when the House of Orange could play upon the passions of the people by charging the De Witts rvlth lack of religious conviction. Indeed, the passion for persecution on the part of the masses

that" one_of their 'representatives taught:
that the~Calvini3ts instead of worshipping God paid homage to the devil, arid Calvinists felt quite the same way. toward their rivals ‘ and competitors In religious matters. A chief weakness of their HighJMIghUnesses with the people was their failure to persecute, 1. e., their I guaranteeing of religious toleration—al-, most freedom to whoever asked it. ,	.
It ought to interest Kew Yorkers peeu-. llarly to read Lamprecht’s entertaining and yet thoroughly dignified description of the life of the MynJHeers of Holland as iti was lived in their closed-packed_ but wealthy towns and cities during the first half of the seventeenth centuryr Their art, philosophy, history, and science* are portrayed here by a master hand.
But the J5urden of tho volume Is to show how out of chaotic Germany of the first half of the seventeenth’ century grew tho despotisms of tho eighteenth; how Ihest) petit, spiteful, quarrelsome Princes and Knights given over to heresy-hunting or self-indulgence made strong tho foundations of the Kingdom of Prussia and finally of the Empire.
The Urs-t step was taken when Luther yielded the right of control over the Church to the local ruler. The next was taken by the local Prince when he agreed to guarantee peace and'-s’afety to the local Church, its clergy and members. When the Reformers gained the majority it was not a long way to complete ascendency with every man in the State a church member; and the Prince from this time forward faileiT to distinguish religious from Stite and dynqstlc interests. Thus the monarch is made twofold stronger by the Reformation; he Is‘both King and Pope, The Thirty Years’ War settled this principle in favor of the local' ruler, both the Catholics and Lutherans adopting the same policy.
The Calvinists viewed things in the same way; out the logical effect of their teaching was that each man might arrange his own spiritual affairs to suit himself, since the priest was not essential to salvation. In England and the Netherlands not a few accepted this Idea, becoming independents—opponents of the union of Church and State. These by combining with the natural opponents to the Stuart statecraft were able finally to overthrow the ** godlike ” Kingship, though they were not able to establish llberfy in its fullest sense. The Puritans —the allies of the independents—believed In the unity of Church and State a^d hence uniformity of the religious practice —the theory on which the New England theocracies were founded.
The unldn of the secular power and tho orthodox religious authority In Germany established in very fact the theory of the Divine Right for which the Stuart party shed so much blooti and made such enormous sacrifices. It was but an easy transition from a State like that of Hax-ony in 1C00 to Prussia under Frederick the Great, a century and a half later.
Parallel to the tracing of the course of despotism and skepticism as its companion. Lamprecht reviews the course of commerce, its rise in Germany after the fearful ravages of Wallenstein and Tilly, its slow growth and with it the adoption of the mercantilists’ scheme of foreign trade—high tariffs, bounties, and arbitrary monetary laws.	■
Another interesting topic treated la the growth of a cultured class of the popu* iatlon—readers of books and authors of polite and ceremonious letters—the patrons of the universities, and the basis of future learning of Germany. Book markets like Leipzig and news and trade centres like Frankfort come again into prominence. The large merchants of these towns sent out weekly price lists, to which notices of fmportant coming events would sometimes bo attached." Then going Ii step further the price list was surrounded by news notes. From this developed the weekly news sheet— the newspaper.
It will,be seen that it is an evolutionary process which Lamprecht Js tracing—the history of the people, their thoughts, their acts, and their aspirations, that he wculd give to us. And we cannot fail to learn from him a great deal about the people and civilization of Germany during the century of the Thirty Years* War. And to give the world an adequate picture of that country at that time is as Important an effort as it is welcome, for there is hardly another satisfactory book either In English or in German dealing with that perplexed and perplexing subject-
Lamprecht’s method is not that of the Ranke school of historians. He does not give us a reference for every statement made; his pages are not all foot notes, yet no one can fairly dispute the accuracy of his work. His aim is to use all that has been done by his predecessors to interpret their work and add the result-of his own varied study and investigation. We have in consequence an original, stimulating, democratic view of the complex life of the people—an account fuller and more accurate than Buckle’s similar work on England, and as interesting and entertaining as Macaulay’s famous history.
