This is a collection of .iilne short stories Irom the pen of an author whose work is too well known to require; recommendation. Some of the stories have already appeared, but the object of -the volume seems to be to bring together some little tales of plain things in life in which Mr. F. Hopkinson Smith discovers n groin of gold " at the bottom of every heart.-cruclble choked with cinders.”
Tho author has succeeded admirably in hls^ndmirable aim," Ho does not confine htp stories to any particular stage setting, hut wanders, as the digger should do, wherever the gold of life Is to be found. The story of " The Extra Blanket,” which deals with a typical drummer on the road, is a sketch ot ;t life with which every one in this country is familiar, and the humanity of the chorus-girls who give up “ the extra blanket ’* to the freezing consumptive and of the drummer who in turn gives his blanket to the girls is a beautiful piece of pathos. The stories deserve rending, ana the circulation of such a volume will not bring benefit to the author alone.
