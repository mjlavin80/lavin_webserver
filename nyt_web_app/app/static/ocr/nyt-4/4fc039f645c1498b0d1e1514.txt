I PICTURES OF THE EAST
Sir Frederick Treves’s Account of
What I1c Saw on tfie Oihcr Side Of the World-1*
"	R FREDERICK TREVES, tho
.King’s physician, vs not, perhaps, a iftofound man. but ho has at times a very pretty Icnaclc of description. A journey around the world, even in the beaten track, presents admirable opportunities for the us<5 of such a talent, and some of these opportunities have been duly improved in this volume. For tho rest, what Sir Frederick says is not impressive. His reflections upon peoples by the way, his comments upon otuics and customs more honored in lands to the east of Suez than in Piccadilly or Bloomsbury, his incursions into history, his thoughts and opinions in general, as distinguished from his mere observings of the surfaces of things, are apt to be fru'olous if they are not quite commonplace.
We will take our quotations, therefore,
^ from the descriptive passages and begin with tho following, relating to men and women just £ot aboard ship:
They scurry ever tho deck, up and down the staircases, and along the corridors like ants in a disturbed ant-honp—still dragging things. It would appear that there is scarcely a nTson who has not lost somethin?—a child or a bundle or the « site of a catin.
At Gibraltar Sir Frederick remarks i pnn many things, but especially the “ nurse-maidenly walks” visible in th^ t<wn below the famous Rock—that	■	’n^h
1“ cultivates and professes to ui>• nj commodity only-sudden death.” He passes Marseilles and Crete, and c^mes upon Port Said, whoro. by repute. " iniquity is the chief commodity.” a town teeming with " stage villains" and gambling hells and saloons which are “ a maelstrom for the virtuous antf a shooting galkr^ for the wicked." Sir Frederick will have it, however, that Port Said Is merely cheap and ugly and not wickeder than f	Levantine towns. Then he
tells i:v "rtv and noisy coaling is by night, a in* .v.v the Suez Canal appears when the xi. p‘s electric searchlight turns its glare nvn the darkness.
The w:il- r rf the canal became the deepest indi£ri>. .-Mir} its banks an intense white. Ti:e ship seemed to be afloat In arctic regions and be slowly creeping along a crack or open way between two ice floes.
In the Red Sea his talk is of heat cud barren coasts and pyjamas for all men. In the Indian Ocean he speaks of games on deck and lovers lingering by the rail in the dusk, and so comes smoothly to Bombay—“ no mean city,” and nobly cele-' brated by Mr. Kipling- as his birthplace. Bombay is the western gate of India., and of India Sir Frederick has much to say— of Agra and its fort and palaces and mausoleum, and the Emperors who build-ed them; of Delhi, its mosques, its Ridge, its gates; of Jeypore, a city of emptiness; of Benares and its sacred stairs leading down into the holy, sewer-fed Ganges; of Cawnpore and Lucknow, and the Mutiny; of Calcutta and its smell, infamous among all the smells of the earth; of the English “ cantonement ” near each town, where the exiles and masters of the country dwell to themselves.
It consists of a series of roads which are wide ard straight, with trees on either side of them, and beyond the trees white walls. One of these roads is always named “ The Mall," in virtue of som<3 undying memory that hangs about the precincts of Charing Cross. Beyond the roads are stiff rows of barracks as simple in design as the wooden blocks of buildings from a child's toy box. They are dotted about in just such a way as a boy would place them on a table when playing at town building. Near about tne barracks are hospitals, store?, a racket court, “ horse lines,” a dairy, a bank, a Post Office, and a church. The church professes a style of architecture which may be called amateur Gothic, but ft is brave with whitewash and green paint.
Then of Simla, sitting " like Humpty Dumpty of the nursery ryhme on the top of a wall. The wall is narrow, and Its sides are steep.*’ Sir Frederick continues:
This Humpty Durrtpty town is a JraHday place, a city of forgetfulness. •	*	*
There are no straight, formal roads to recall the routine ridden cantonement. There is no Mall. Tumbling down the hillside like a rubbish heap, and fairly well hidden from sight, is the native ta-zaar. There Is no need to go there, nor any occasion to be reminded of India pnd Its reeking citie3. Those who comc have come to forget. Simla—the make-believe— would have Itself to be a little piece of the islands of Britain hidden away among foreign hills.
The King's physician writes of close herding, brown men and women, bullocks, donkeys, camels, streaming In gay garments out of city gates over the hot plain* or jostling each other in narrow streets and noisy bazaars, and of how these bazaars appear by day and night, he writes of Burmah and the women there— women who know nothing of changing "nshidns or arrangements for torturing the uair in pompadour effects, who wear for sole raiment a jacket of white linen

and a scant fkirt of gay-colored silk, and arc* pleasant to look upon and excellent at driving a bargain; he , writes of Cingalese ladies, whose white I linen jacket is shorter—who bare the brown waist as their Western sis-1 ters in gala dress their white shoulders; of Singapore, of Hongkong, and the Chinese cuddies upon the golf links there.
Sir 1'rederick docs not like the new in Japan. He dwells rather upun still unspoiled Kyoto, the ancient capital, and the old things that survive, and touches vury little upon the war with Itus.na, which had just tegun when he was in the land of the Cherry Blossom—for so he prefers to think of it.
The author has something (but not very much) to say about Japanese hospit i!s, and speaks of interviews with the I^nincr-or and with President Roosevelt—for he returned home by way of America. Cf this country, however, he says little, that little of Fosemitc and the Grand Canon cf Colorado. We arc not properly ** on the other side of the lantern ”—which is the round world, with its East and its West.
