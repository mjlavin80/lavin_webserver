LAMB’S LETTERS^;
The Collection, with Mary Lamb's Letters and Many New of Charles, Edited by E. V. Lucas.
HAT the best-intended arrangements of men are certain at times (especially If they have been duly enacted into law) To produce unexpected and awkward complications is a principle which has nowhere a more eloquent testimony than Is furnished by the state of Charles Lamb’s published letters. As Mr. Lucas remarks in hia preface to the two volumes before us, “Owing' to the curious operations of -the law of copyright it will not /or at least forty-two years be possible for any one edition of Lamb’s correspondence to contain all the letters.” And he adds:
' To-day, in order to possess a complete set down to the present time we mrust purchase at least nine, and possibly more, works amounting- to many volumes— among them " Charles Lamb and the Lloyds," of whicli I was the editor, but which I am debarred from using. It is In order to some extent to meet the difficulty thus set up, and cover the whole ground of the correspondetoo, that I have in the notes drawn attention to every important letter distributed over these many other volumes.
To be sure, it does seem a hardship and a pity that Lamb’s letters should be so divided, and that lovers of Lamb must either spend much money*or lose much Lamb. Moreover, as Mr. Lucas explains, the evil will continue, for more letters are likely to come to light at any time, and with them more copyrights, each with forty-two years to run. By the way, Mr. Lucas sighs In this connection over a matter which is rather a source of pride on this side the Atlantic—the circumstance that 4‘ almost without exception he best manuscripts that now come into the market are bought for America-” Mr. Lucas finds fault with the closeness of Americans about these newly acquired treasures. Hta words are:
Private owners of Lamb manuscripts In this country have been cheerfully willing that copies should be made, but I regret to say that my request for cooperation printed in American literary papers met with no response. The view that the temporary owners of an original document of an author so peculiarly the world's, friend as Lamb is rather a steward of the property than absolute possessor, seems as yet not to have attained anyi great measure of popularity across the Atlantic,'
Yet, in spite of greedy and ungracious Americans, Mr. Lucas has got together a great number of Lamb’s letters which have not been printed in the previous collections, end many of these new letters are ^exceedingly interesting. A glance over the tablex>f contents (where a double star marks the new from the old) will serve to convince you of the first fact; the reading of tfie starred letters is proof of the second. The series begins, of course, with “ the earliest of Lamb's letters which .has come down to us," that written May 27. 1796, when the author of the ** Dissertation on Roast pig *• was just ■ a little over twenty-one and was living at 7 Little Queen Street (since demolished) with his father, mother, and sister Mary. - He. had already begun his long service in the India House, and the letter—with its frank admission, ** The 'Six weeks that finished last ^ear and began this your humble servant spent very agreeably in a madhouse at Hox-ton "—was written to Coleridge, then twenty-three, and just done with the brief experiment with his paper The Watchman. It was in the same letter (which every student of Elia will remember) that Lamb added In his quaint fashion, “ I ajn got somewhat rational now and don’t bite any one.’1 Even this famous letter, however, through collation with the original in the possession of Mrs, Alfred Morrison, shows here some verbal changes. To turn to some material entirely new and also entirely Lamblike, attend to this excerpt from a letter written to Wordsworth in October, 1S<M:
Dear Wordsworth:	I	have not forgot
your commissions. But the truth is, and why should I not confess it? I am not plethorically abounding in Cash at this present. Merit, God Knows, is very little rewarded; but it does not become me to speak of myself. My motto is, ** Contented with little, yet wishing for more.” Now the books you wish for would require some pounds, which I am sorry to say I have not by me; so I will say at once, if you will give me a draft on your town banker for any sum you propose to lay out, I will disnose of it to the very best of my skill In choice old books, such as my own soul ioveth. In fact, I have been waiting for the liquidation of a debt to enable myself to set about your commission handsomely, for it is a scurvy thing to cry Give me the money first, and I am the first of the family of the LUm'os that have done it for many centuries; but the debt remains as it was, and my old friend that I accommodated has generously forgot It.	v
So Lamb proceeds with the enumeration of the books—a Ben Jonson, a Beaumont and Fletcher in folio, and many others very tempting, some of which he fears are not to be found in the shops.
Along with this letter is one (also new) from Mary Lamb to Dorothy Wordsworth,

and;yet another from Mary X&mb to Hrs, T. Coleridge. Lamb at the head of "the jsheet. writes; “ .Turn over ■ leaf- /of more ■ letters." Mr. Lucas has included in hlfl edition, hy tVjr» wav, Mary Lamb’s litters • along with her brother's. 1	-	■	.	:
In her letter accompanying the .one'of Charles's just quoted* from." she-writes to. Dorothy Wordsworth:
Will you he so kind as to forwardJthe opposite page to Mrs. Colerfdge?_ ■ This sheet of paper is quite a partnership af-; fair. When the Parliament meets you shall have a letter for your sole use.; My brother and I have been this Summer to ■Richmond; we had a iodgtag there for o month; we passed the whole time th^re in wandering about and comparing the views from the banks of the Thames with jyour mountain scenery,- and tried to persuade ourselves that.it was almost as beautiful.
Upon that v opposite/page of the partnership affair ” you read this:	_	.
William Hazlllt Is painting my brother’s picture, which has brought us acquainted with the whole family. I like William Hazlitt and his sister very much indeed, and I think Mrs. Hazlitt a pretty good-natured woman. She has a nice little girl of the PyoOii kind, who Is so fond Of ' my brother th«t. she st<yp$ strangers. In the street to tell them when Mr. Lamb ■ is coming to see her.	.
Hazlitt’s portrait spoken of here I#, by. the way, reproduced' as the frontispiece, of Volume IV. of Lamb’s works, of which these isttcrs	up Volumes VI. and 1
VII.
Another new letter, also addressed to Wordsworth, is that of which the follow-, j ing is a complete copy. It was written in January, 1S07, and is taken from the | original in Dr. Williams's library:
Dear Wordsworth—We have book’d off ' ffom Swan and Two Necks, Lad Lane, this day (per Coach) the Tales from I Shakespeur. You will forgive the plates, ! when I tell you they were_ left to the : discretion i i 6oawin, who left the choice ! of subjects to the bad baby, who from 1 mischief (I suppose) has chosen one from damn’d beastly vulgarity (vide Merch. Venice) where no atom of authority was , in the tale to justify it—to another given a name which exists not in the tale, Nic Bottom, and which she thought would be fanny, though in this I suspect his hand, for I guess her reading does not reach far enough to know Bottom’s Xtlan name—and one of Hamlet and Grave-digging, a scene ‘which Is noft hinted at In the story, and you might as well have put King Canute the Great reproving his courtiers — the rest are Giants and Giantesses. Suffice it to save our taste and damn our folly, that we left it ail to a friend W. G.—who in the first place, cheated me into putting a name to them, which I did not mean but do not repent, and then wrote a puff about their simplicity, ,&c.t to go with the advertisement as in my name! Enough of the egregious dupery—I will try to abstract the load Of* teasing circumstances from the Stories and tell you that I am answerable for Lear, Macbeth, Timon. Romeo, Hamlet, Othello» for occasionally a tail piece or correction . of grammar, for none of the cuts and all of the spelling. The rest is my SISTER’S. We think Pericles the best of hers and Othello of mine—but I hope all have some good. As Tou Like It we like least:
So much, only begging you to tear out 'the^ cuts and give them to Johnny as , “ Mrs. Gat}-yin*s fancy."	C.	L.
Our love to all.
The total number of new letters in^Mr. Lucas’s edition Is upon a count between seventy and eighty, and the plan already mentioned by the editor in 'one of the passages quoted above from his preface— the plan of references in his notes to letters which he has been unable to in-elude, contributes no little to the Interest and bicgraphical value of the series. The ! notes, by tie way, are very copious and Informing, and are most conveniently In- | serted immediately after the text of each letter. The illustrations of the volumes, which are, as cxangples of typography and book making, all that the most fastidious 1 could desire, include reduced fac similes of several unpublished letters written by I Lamb to Wordsworth and others and tw6 excellent portraits of "Elia *’ himself. One of these is a reproduction of a painting by I Henry Meyer which is preserved at the j India Office; the other, serving as frontispiece to the second volume, is a charming likeness from a drawing made by Thomas Wageman in 1S25 or thereabout. This same second volume is furnished, after the excellent and sensible English fashion, with an admirable index, and, more than that, a list of letters alphabetically arianged according to the names of the persons to whom they are addressed. To admirers of Lamb—and who. that reads English at all is not counted of that company?—whether possessed of all the other “ nine or more ” volumes of letters or not —this edition will be one of great interest and value. To students of Lamb It is of coursc indispensable.
