Tliat Mr. Cyrus Townsend Brady should be “ filled with disgust with the state of things " which Mr. Grnnt so vividly portrays in “ The Orchid," rather than immensely entertained hy the under- 1 current of Yankee humor that brightens | almost every page of this wonderfully clever piece of modern satire, is probably I due to his having read it at a time when I the mood of his original calling possesssd j him. This state of things which Mr, Brady objects to so seriously ts such an exaggerated counterfeit of reality that Mr. Grant's intention is hardly to be mis, taken, it would seem, ny any other than i i clergyman or the proverbial Engiish-, man. And, even if the book were a true transcript from life and serious instead of satirical In intention, the “ state of I thingsM it presents is hardly so serious i as that which Mr. Brady himself lately used for the background of one of his novels, entitled “ A Doctor of Philosophy." Compared to the gTim tragedy of that vivid and veracious story of what is perhaps the most hopeless phase of the negro problem, Mr. Grantis tale is simply a social comedy of unusual merit skillfully done.
