There are lovemaking and troth plieht-Ing In this novel, else -wliiit claim could it have to that title? Nevertheless the old-fashioned ethics of fiction are not strictly adhered to, for the hero floes not marry
tbe heroine. Indeed* although he falls In love a sufficient number of times to become hopelessly involved in matrimony, his carefer closes -without the necessity of an engagement ring, while he sees his level-headed* unsentimental Irish friend carry off the lady toward whom his own heart first warmed.
Sentiment and lovemaking, however, are rather the incidentals than the prop upon which this rollicking, jovial story is built. It relates the exciting experiences, occasionally bordering close to the tragic, lhat befall two friends on a runaway yachting trip from Gibraltar to the South Seas In order to retain possession of their own boat.
The owner of the yacht, a young Irish* man, who is not on good terms -with hfs stepbrother, suddenly hears that his father, the Earl, has died, and although ! possessing a letter saying that the yacht ! is to be his, no confirmation of this appears in the will. At this time the Irishman's friend, a celebrated marine painter and a typical wanderei, appears on the scene. Belligerent to his finger tips and with the quick wit of his race, the Irish yachtsman tells the painter he has been requested by his stepbrother to take the boat to England. Holding’ the letter and being in possession, he boldly announces that he intends to go to the South Seas, there turn merchantman and cam a living. The artist, who usurps the hero’s portion of the book, agrees to go along, i
They offer passage to Singapore to two American ladies who have lost their steamer through a desire to do a little more shopping. The father of the younger and of course the prettier of the two, a professor of botany, is on the steamer. She speedily becomes reconciled to the exigencies of the case. The run through the Mediterranean is full of amusing incidents and they are delightfully told. At Singapore the ladies leave and the yacht, destitute of all femininity, sails on.
In the South Seas the yacht is forcibly abducted by the crew, who have overheard the precarious tenure on which the Irishman claims ownership. The artist is cast adrift in an open boat with his hands tied. The outlook is gloomy. Happily a party of friends is found In port about to sail for the Philippines on a chartered steamer. The cast-off yachtsmen joyously accept an invitation to acompany them, the more readily, perhaps, because the professor and his daughter happen to be in the party. Quite unexpectedly the stolen yacht is discovered. A clever ruse is conceived to regain possession, which, after a violent fight all over the ^deck, is successful. The thieving crew ultimately get their just deserts, the supposedly cast-off Irishman receives word that the yacht is his, and good bit of property besides. The professor's daughter accepts him for a husband. “ Art, and its limitless possibilities; after all—it is enough,” is the, somewhat cold moralizing by which the artist forces himself into contentment.
