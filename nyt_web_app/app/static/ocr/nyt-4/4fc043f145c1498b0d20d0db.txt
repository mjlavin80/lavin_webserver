New Tork Times Book Review:
I note the inquiry of J. M. Parker, Winthrop Street, Rochester, N. Y-, ask- i lng ** What periodical, if any, has taken 1 the place of The Magazine of American History, edited by Martha J. Lamb, some years ago? ” This magazine was published from 1877 to 1893, In the latter part of 1901 the magazine was revived, and is now published at Port Chester, N. Y., under the old name,- at $1 a year or
10	cents a copy. The Magazine of History, started in January, 1900, by Mr. William Abbatt, and published at ?5 a year or BO cents a copy, has no association whatever with Tho Magazine of American History. The names being so near alike will probably cause a great amount of confusion for these two periodicals, and it would greatly assist readers if they bad not almost the same title.
