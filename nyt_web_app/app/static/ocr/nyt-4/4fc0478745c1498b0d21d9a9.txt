A " Handbook of Homeric Study,” by Henry Browne, S. J., of University College, Dublin, Ireland, is shortly to appear through Longmans, Green & Co. It has been Prof. Browne's plan to “ lay before the reader the elements out of which he could form a judgment of his own, rather than to force on him conclusions to which the author finds himself inclined." He has tried to *' steer ” between the two extremes pointed out in the following from the preface:
In his two-fold capacity of learner and teacher, the writer has found that at tho very threshold of his task a student is confronted with a mass of complex problems which hardly grow less entangled as he proceeds. He cannot ignore them if he would, unless he be content with merely translating the poetry line by line; his ordinary commentaries, handbooks of iit-erature and history, his very dictionaries, teem with allusions to controversial topics, and may often contain statements which are mutually destructive, as well as over-confident, in this matter of decisiveness there is a danger of defect, as well as of excess.
The volume opens with a consideration of the Homeric poems, followed by commentaries on the Homeric bards; historical outlines of the Homeric controversy, chapters on Homeric life, the Homeric people, and " The Epic Art of Homer.” There are twenty-two illustrations in halftone. an "approximate" chronology, and an index.
