Kcw York Times Book Review:
My attention h&s been called to a translation, given in The Book Review April 1, of Dante's lines in the Episode of Francesca, (D. C. Inf., c. V., v. 100-103,) so different from the accepted meaning and so difficult to accept as seeming to call for another word in the same columns.
The words, almost too familiar to every Dantlsta to bear rewriting in full, are: “Amor che al cor ^entil ratto s’ apprende, Prese costui della bella persona,
Che mifu tolta, e il modo ancor m' of-fende."
The translation above referred to as i given with approval is:
" Love which quickly ignites in noble heart, kindled this one of fair person that was taken from me, and the manner still afflicts me.**
The difficulty of accepting or quite understanding this translation lies in that it neglects the individualizing use of the article in the "della," i. e., making " persona," while referring of necessity to a single human body, an abstract noun, or name of a class or species! Otherwise the article has no place there; for if a concrete body is meant (i. e., the individual body of Paolo) the only possible grammatical expression must certainly be " costui di bella persona ”; and if the article is used it must be followed, as in the present case, by a relative clause, of which the article (its only use there) is used to designate (individualize) the intended antecedent So fundamentally is this principle of distinction between the abstract and the concrete grounded in the genius of the language that it is a notorious rule, never violated- by good writers, even* in the case of ordinary proper names, to use the article with the family name only, (which is the designation of a class,) and if the individual is indicated by giving his personal name, then, to omit the article, e. sit is possible to say " la poesla del Carducci," but improper to say “ lajioesia del Glosue Carducci"; the latter form must be ** la poesla di Giosue Carduci."
It is true that the article is very often used as or for the corresponding demonstrative pronoun, i. e., “ il,” “ la," for, or as a shortened form of “ il suo ’’ or *‘ il suo proprio,” ** la sua” or "la sua propria." Applied in this case, the sense, or nonsense, would be " took this fellow of his own beautiful body"!
It is to be assumed that the learned contributor well knows all this, but under what light, or from what point of view, he is able to regard “persona" here as the name of a class it is hard to see. It is well known how much discussion and disagreement of opinion have arisen through all the ages over the exact meaning of " il modo *' in the third, line, but the meaning of the second line I never before heard disputed or doubted.
