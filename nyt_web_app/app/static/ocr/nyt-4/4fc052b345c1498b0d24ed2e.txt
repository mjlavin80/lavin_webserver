This volume, entitled “ The Greek Painters’ Art," by Irene Weir, is a most important addition to the popular literature of the subject. Its scheme is as original as it is entertaining. The introduction to the subject, which occupies nearly half the volume, contains impressions of the present treasure (pounds Qf Greels art obtained by personal visits. The second part ~ Is a compilation of the opinions of tho best critics and connoisseurs. We thus have classical Knowledge and judgment brought into close intimacy with what an observing specialist may to-day see at Argos, Mykenae, Athens, and Olympia. The result is that the art of Hellas in its conception, Its execution, and its finished and permanent monuments is brought very near to us.
Two features of this book are worthy of special mention. One is the a\ithor’s personal Impressions of the only authoritative sculpture of Praxiteles, the Hermes, which to-day reposes in the museum at Olympia, and the other is the nearly ;00 pages devoted to a description of the use that the Greeks made of pigments in architecture and sculpture. The first forms a natural introduction to the second, for the acnthor writes, as she views the beautiful Hermes and expatiates on the fine quality of the marble, ** giving to the figure a lightness and grace which are still more emphasized by the transparent texture and highly reflective character of the stone";
Faint traces of color, red and gold, still mark the lines ot the hair ana sandal, and add an interest to the figure apart from its workmanship, proving that color was used at the best period of Greek sculpture upon figures not intended fcr architectural decoration.
This may be a surprise to the layman who has not yet been impelled to free himself from the " immortal fctich ” which is supposed to be symbolized by the pure white marble statue. That the Greeks applied color not only to their buildings of marble, but also to their sculptures cut from the same material is no longer an open question for expert speculation. And aside from her own Impressions, inspired by the actual traces of color which her own eyes have beheld, the author makes copious and always popular extracts and paraphrases from works of Francis Cranmer Penrose, O. Hamdy-Bey, Theodore Reinach, J. P. Mahaffy, Ernest A, Gardner, and others.
Although the pages In this book devoted to the rambles of a lover of Greek art and culture are entertaining as well as are the pages which contain descriptions of mural painting and Grecian portraits, and a brief history of tho development of these departments of art, yet the fact-remains that the importance of the work for the amateur rests in the comprehensive and authoritative exposition of the truth that the Greeks at the most exalted .stage of their culture not only tinted their marbles but actually painted them, not in
an attempt to Imitate life but to idealize ft.
The illustrations from drawings and photographs are numerous, and show that they have been selected with the utmost care, either from the author’s own portfolio' or from the collections of archaeologists. The frontispiece is a reproduction in color representing the portion of a facade of Mykcnaean Temple, Knossosz Crete. The half-tone reproductions 01 photographs which reveal light and shade-and tones in an unsurpassed manner—owing to the artistic finish of the plates and the heavy, fine texture of the paper—include Views of the Alcropolls* Mykenae, Olympia, Delphi, Ithica, inscriptions,
. statuary, frescoes, monuments, &c. The book is printed in large, clear, modern type on cream^calendered paper.	.
