BOSTON NOTES.
Dickberry’s “ The Storm of London Prof. Hyslop’s “ Science and the Future Life Other Forthcoming Books.
FIFTEENTH English edition of Mr. F. Dickberry's The Storm, of London " *.vill appear almost simultaneously with the first American edition which Messrs. Herbert B. Turner & Co. are about to issue. The story tells of one woeful morning- when London awoke to find itself suddenly destitute not only of clothes, but of everything from which clothes could possibly be made, down to the silver-lined clouds worn by the anonymous poet just now the object of such anxious search. For some days terror keeps good and bad, gentle and simple, from venturing into the streets, and when at length they go abroad none can recognize his neighbor and no one dares accost another lest by chance he address a stranger, a hopelessly inferior person, or, worst of all, an immensely superior being. The author has treated the subject with much ingenious satire, introducing many a sly touch at the expense of well-known persons.
*.*
Prof. Hyslop's " Science and a Future Life," to be issued by the same firm, has been slightly delayed, but will appear In May, and in Autumn they will bring out a new book by Mr. Charles Warren Stoddard, who has returned to his Californian home, partly to visit his aged father, partly to write a series of descriptions of the California Missions for the Sunset Magazine and to execute a commission for which the National Magazine has been so fortunate as to secure his services. The papers in the Sunset will be published in book form, by Messrs. Turner &. Co.
Mr. Alleyne Ireland's " The Far Eastern Tropics ” contains not only the two series of papers written for/The Londun Times and The Outlook while he was in the Far East as ’* Colonial Commissioner ” for the University of Chicago, but also a sum-
mary which, agreeably neutralizes the editorial paper in which The Outlook spoke of the American conduct of Philippine affairs as tho expression of a spiritual faith. The book has a statistical appendix showing the trade and shipping, tinances, population. and area of Hongkong, British North Borneo, Sarawak, Burma, the Federated Malay States, the Straits Settlements, French Indo-China, Nethcrlands-Intiia, and the Philippines, and giving the figures of the latest census in regard to the last named. Mr, Ireland's book will be published by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. to-morrow, but his report to the University of Chicago will form at least ten volumes, and will be issued from time to time during the next four years by Messrs. Small, Maynard & Co. of Cambridge. As neither birth nor training
binds him to allegiance to any cause or party in the United States, they may be expected to be quite us independent In tone as this book, and as the lectures which he baa been delivering in Washington in the very hall of the Douglas.

This month Messrs. Small. Maynard & Co. are issuing “ The Aftermath of Slavery," by Mr. William A. Sinclair, to whose book Col. Thomas Wentworth Hlg-ginson gives an introduction; also a somewhat imposing volume written by Mr. Alvin Francis Sanborn, entitled “ Paris and the Social Revolution." The book is " reverently inscribed " to " The American Proletariat." It is a royal octavo, excellently printed, and Illustrated by Mr. Vaughan Trowbridge with twenty-five
full-page plates and almost twico as many smaller pictures. It shows the revolutionists of the artistic, laboring, rtu-dent and criminal classes and makes tho Paris of to-day seem ominously like that Paris of a century and a quarter ago In Which even the happy and contented played at being revolutionary. As to
Mr. Sanborn, he sn.ys: ** The author Is not
a revolutionist, but there are monjenia when he would (sic> rme to be one."

Mr. George Cary Eggleston is henceforth to be counted among the Interpreters of that lower Mississippi region just now occupying the attention of so many Southern novelists, and tbe book which he is preparing, " A Daughter of the South," will be Issued by the publishers of his “ Dorothy South," the Lothrop
Company, in September. Two further additions to the company's list are •* Hand- 1
book of United States Political History," ! bv Mr. Malcolm Townsend, and *‘ The j ftunaway Donkey,” by Miss 'Emilie I
Poulsson. Tho former shows the legislative evolution of the Federal laws, their amendment or abrogation, and it is in~ tended to keep it abreast of the times by such additions and alterations as may become necessary. Miss Poulsson’s book is a quarto containing rimes not only about Barney Gray, the mischievous donkey, but about many other creatures, all of whom appear in a long series of pictures by Mr. L. J. Bridgman.

Messrs. Little, Brown & C.’ci. will publish Mr. Walter S. Cramp’s “ Psyche " to-morrow. It is an uncommonly clcver story for a first book, presenting such a. study of the* imperial eourt of Tiberius as to impress the weary desolation of the time upon the reader, without plunging
too deeply into the mire of sensuality. Mr. Cramp is a Philadelphian, and. after being graduated from the higher schools, studied shipbuilding in the yards belonging to tho elder members of his family. When these possessions became the property of a stock company he found time to fulfill ids youthful visions of studying Rome, ancient, mediaeval, and modern, and for some years lived in Italy and Northern Africa, accumulating detailed knowledge pertaining to the subject, paying especial attention to the reigns or Augustus and Tiberius.
V
The May Atlantic will contain a paper written by Mr. E. A. Ross, entitled " Sinning by Syndicate,” a subject in which, judging by the volume of advice bestowed upun the A- B. C. F. M., in the case of Mr. Rockefeller, Americana are profoundly interested; and ** What Should College Professors be Paid? ’* by Mr. Guido H. Marx, a theme in which the syndicate is also concerned, Inasmuch as the college expenses are limited by the college endowments. Four critical papers should please the Serious, although that written on "Tendencies in Current Fiction " by Miss Mary Moss may be expected to be wickedly humorous at the expense of certain authors. Mr. W. IL Thayer will write of ‘‘Schiller’s Ideal of Liberty," and Prof. Kuno Franck© of " Schiller's Message to Modern Life"; and, lastly, Mr. Paul Et-
wer Mon? wifi contribute “ A Study of Samte-B&eve," a subject to which he has long applied himself. Mr. Wiliam Garrott Brown's papers on 41 The Tenth Decade of the United States" wilt begin, and Mrs. Candace Wheeler will write on “The Decorative Use of Wild Flowers."
