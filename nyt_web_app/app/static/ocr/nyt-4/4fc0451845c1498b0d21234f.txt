Xt'w York Timr* Book Ilcricio:
I was surprised the other day in a conversation with a friend by his advance of the opinion that In Mr. James's “ Golden Eowl " Charlotte Stant was the intrinsically finest of the quartet of remarkable charactcrs who .held the centre of ihe somewhat topsy-turvy stage. Mr. Jnmes’s own comment that this, "The Golden Bowl," is "the solidest yet " of his fictions toucaes one with wonder as to wh-t he considers firm ground. I put the question for the readers of The Review, because, in looking back. Mr. James’s own sympathies are not with any apparent solidity vested in the Princess, at whom, for all his wonder at her marvelous subtlety and capacity fbr " seeing through ” situations highly beyond—Or below—t he average, he seems to peer below h:s vril of words with a sarcastic amusement.
lie says of it: •* It is only too deep and abysmal an artistic trap."
Is the trap tiie condemnation of Charlotte Stant for tho exaltation of the : Princess? Mr./James further says: “It i is a real feat ot engineering.'' But the r/3cret of his “ feat ” is on the knees of flio gods for some of us, and we grope a little blindly in a dimness he allows us very little candle light to illumine.
Mr. James’s men and women strike one sometimes as marionettes in the leading strings of an analysis so magnificent and interesting in itscif that one rarely attempts to imagine them with a volition and development of their own. It is the author's magic as well as his power to make his analysis the wonder and despair of hia readers; but still one would like to know, if Charlotte Stant were a human being, what Mr. James would think of her.	------- M.
