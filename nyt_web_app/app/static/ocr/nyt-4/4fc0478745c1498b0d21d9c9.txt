The history of ivory carving goe^ back to the most remote antiquity, Centuries before the Christian era we can point to examples in the days of the earliest dynasties of Assyria and Egypt. Earlier still than these far-distant days shall be confronted with the artists—for SO we may call them—of those prehistoric epochs which are accustomed to term the stone or bronze ages. It will not be liy conjecture merely, but with actual examples in our hands, that we shall commence the chain, and pass from £L [JOTiOtl
of which no written history exists to *-uch comparatively modern times u.s those of which the records are the Holy Scriptures, and we shall be able to illustrate the allusions and records by objects in ivory discovered among the mounds Mild rains of the cities which are there mentioned.
So speaks Alfred Maskell, P. S. A., author of *' Russian Art and Art Objects in Russia,” &c., in his new book on " Ivories,*' which G. P. Putnam’s Sons have in active preparation for early publication in the Connoisseur’s Library. The author has gttempted to eive only a sketch of the history of Ivory carving, and to make the book more than “ a merely descriptive catalogue,” he has included remarks concerning the use of the various objects mentioned. The narrative begins with descriptions of prehistoric ivory carvings, and goes on through the different periods down to the nineteenth century and the present day. Mr. Maskell has not added footnotes, but there is, however, an extended bibliography.' The examples described in the book are principally from the collections in the ocutli Kensington Museum, the British Museum, the Mayir collection at Liverpool, (England,) and the Wallace collection. There will be numerous illustrations.
