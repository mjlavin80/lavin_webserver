j Two little volumes from .the pen of the j late-A'nna Mac Man us, each with a preface by Seumas' Maciianus, -whose wifte' She was, cannot but stir an almost Indefinable sadness even before a perusal of the exquisite short stories of Irish love and lore contained in them. In the preface Mr. MacMonus says:
She who wrote these stories of our people lov^d them ivjth a love that was deep and. tender beyond what words or mine could convey. When she -wrote of our people, when ehe spoke of our people —her people—her eyes went wet with fondness.
The stories which Anna MacMaims lias left to the worid in those little volumes must surely affect the reader- as the writing of them stirred her. They are ' full or the beautiful pathos of' Irish poetry, the magic of Irish music, and the elusive charm of Erin’s folk-lore. : ; The love stories contained Ui “ The Passionate Hearts " appeal with all the simplicity, tenderness, and fervor of the Irish people and convey that atmosphere' of sincerity which * only flows from a pen dipped'In- the author's .own heart.	.
One does not read the sad loye story of Brighld Ni Bhrlain and John Gilchrist, or the quaint record of The Men of the Music,” who, crossed in love by the same woman, lived as silent, brothers, whose only communion was in the harmony of an old flute and a whistle; one hears them to the music of the sputtering peat,. the sighs of the ttreside folks, the croon of a violin In a corner of the hut, and the 44 girning” of the Atlantic gale against the little windows. Of the stories contained In “In the Celtic past" Irish mythology, when scanned without the bias Of humorous recollections, savors* to the Imaginative, of classic. Biased or unbiased, however, one may not read those sketches of legend and folk-lore without feeling the full force ot that ancient atmosphere which the author succeeded in bringing, still full of color and throbbing with human truth, into our prosaic twentieth century. The ** Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gralnne,” "'The Ked Whistler," and “The Sorrowing of Conal Cearnach" come like cohoes of that famous "harp that‘once through Tara’s halls the sou\ of music shed.”
