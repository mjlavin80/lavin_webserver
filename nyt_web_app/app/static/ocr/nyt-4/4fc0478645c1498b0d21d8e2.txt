These sketches, which were punished originally In Blackwood’s, purport to deal —save as to proper names—'with facts about the. war In the Far East and the parties thereto. The keynote they strike as to the war itsolf is ruthlessness—deliberate, advised, scientific ruthlessntiss—and as to the Japanese, a carrying of this scientific lack of consideration for the individual, for anything but the idea and the efficiency of the ma<HiIne which promotes the idea, to' the utmost logical limit.
In themselves the sketches are dramatic episodes of the war on. sea or land or bear upon the multifarious activities Ot tbe Japanese at home and. abroad, all
subsidiary to the war In one way or another, In one ~©f them " O." tells how a young naval Lieutenant took his ship into the channel at Port Arthur and sank it there (with some assistance from a Russian torpedo) in a fiery hall of shrieking shells, one of which at the last moment carried away the Lieutenant's head. His bloody trunk fell among his men as they took to the boats. Again " O." tells of one of those charges of Japanese infantry when company after company withered away under the " driving sleet" of “ nickel aiid steel and lead " which came from the Russian works.
He tells how the individual Japanese scl-illers behaved at these times, how, as they ftood under fire, they laughed when a Shell carried away the better part of a file of comrades, how they charged and died crying “ Banzai,** “ Banzai,” and still Throne Room of the lofty-placed Potala
the . rRuB^ian lincsAwere -stormed^ and j
talterw 7 Hck*/ telfi^ ioo, how . the little^ yellow.' men trapped through snow- and slush, frosfcnand .patient, and gives -a terrible^ picture of a strayed column, of Russians . attacked and annihilated hy Japanese;V.-first withered by rifle fire as they stood dazed and helpless,; and- then, when they had thrown down . their arms, slaughtered with the bay*::
oaet,-the Japanese officer leading; the
butchery with his two-handed sword. This, very officer Is represented as a man'whom; the story teller had met as .Military Attache in Paris, again posing1' as an undergraduate at Cambridge, again disguised as a, barber In Port Arthur before, *he outbreak. It Is into this versatile young officer’s mouth that the author puts the remark—he was a frank man when he lived in London—** there is one creed which rules all Japanese public morality: Balance the chances* and then pursue tne
wisest course.”	'	.
You gather that “ O.” thinks the modern 'Japanese has attained a height of perfee intellectuality, where no act is condemned or praised per se, and no trick desptse which will contribute to the end. On tne whole, It is a book of blood-stirring rca
ing-a sort of prose glory song of tne wonderful little yellow man, who- real y has his body and mere feelings under-obedient to his brain as a good 8hip tO HC helm. And as each little yellow man is obedient to his own brain, so the whole mass of them Is obedient to the brain ol the army centred in Oyama, Kodama, ana Fukushima, the "mlUtary triumvirate.
In short, “0.” thinks.the Japanese spell peril and that peril ** militarism." ,
