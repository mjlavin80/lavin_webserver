This historical novel is different. It is not made of the ■ same materials as the others or in the same fashion. It aims at something good; It partly achieves that something; yet it drags. For it Is- overweighted with talk—though much of it excellent talk—and errs by excess of quaint fancy. To be ssurc, it is a quaint time and a quaint place, the Prussia of Frederick 'William, the famous collector of those giant grenadiers whose badge was the red cravat. That grimly fantastic monarch plays In fact, the providence of the piece, though a kind fate transposes some of his chessmen. - Freiherr von Gundling, the King's ^Chamberlain and jester, introduces the story, and an arrant but scholarly knave named I*assman, his understudy, takes care of the rest of it— to his own undoing. For, in spite of hts years and learning, he falls in love with the beautiful and youthful Lady Joan Chrystal, (a subject of King George of England.) and having a rival in Jack Catherwood, a wandering and impecunious Englishman, has that taJl fellow crimped by Prussian recruiting officers and sent--To- Brandenburg to learn the goose-step In the King’s guards.
He even gets the King’s order (given after the usual grim royal fashion) to marry his- tall fellow to a peasajxt lass— but as already hotedf theVpaw'rigets ;
