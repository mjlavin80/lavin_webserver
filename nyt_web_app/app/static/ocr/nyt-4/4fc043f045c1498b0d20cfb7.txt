The leading: article In tbe April Cosmo* 1 politan is David Graham Phillips’s interesting story o t ** The Assassination of a Governor/’ 'dealing with the killing of William Goebel in Kentucky and "the extraordinary events which have fol- ' lowed the attempt to tiring the perpetrators to justice.” Another paper hardly less interesting: is Poultney Bigelow’s account of the German Army manoeuvres, with many pictures of the Kaiser and lesser military personages. Cyrus Towns- ; end Brady ’writes of the famous sieges of j Acre and Constantinople, and Charles Wagner, of " Simple Life"" fame, about | “The French Mother.” The fiction includes several good stories—the beginning of a lively serial, " The Occupation of Florian’ Amidon,” by Herbert Quick; a chorus'girl story, by C. Bryson Taylor; "A Sacrifice of Graces/’ by George Hibbard; a newspaper story, ** Cory of the Woman’s Page,” by Edna Kenton, and “The Ghost Extinguisher,” by GeJett Burgess. 'Moreover, Israel Zangwill ha? written about *' The Future of Vaudeville in America.” Altogether it is an excellent number.
