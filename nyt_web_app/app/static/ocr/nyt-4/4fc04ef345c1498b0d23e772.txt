After a reading of this latest .novel by i Mr. Cahan, who knows his Russia—particularly "underground” Russia—as the New Yorker knows his Broadway, one gains, perhaps for the first time, a real flesh-and-blood picture of the struggle for freedom of that martyred band which generally ends its game in Liberia, the fortress of Peter and Paul, or Ellis Island.
The central character ot the novel Is Prince Boulatoff, who as a boy Is full of. the prejudices of his class. Later, however, he learns to view the obverse side of the question, and finally becomes one of the leading Nihilists in St. Petersburg. His rank gives him greater facilities for aiding the cause. One of the incidents that first stirred him to a stu*~y of the people’s side of the case was when a young woman cried out In a crowd against the unjust arrest of a poor teacher who endeavored to explain to his pupils the meaning of " limited monarchy/' For this he was exiled. Prince Boulatoff later meets the daring girl who protested, and finds that she, too, has become an ardent Nihilist. They, of course, fall in love and are married. It is not a happy marriage while It lasts. There is the sword of arrest, separation, and banishment always over their heads. In the end the sword falls, and at the close of the novel we find them in the Fortress of Peter and Paul, signaling to one another through the damp walls of the prison.
It is a sad story; it could not he otherwise. Strictly speaking, however, Mr. Cahan does not appear to have set out to tell a atory at all, but to draw a graphic picture of conditions, with a thread of narrative to relieve the natural gloom of the subject. The most brilliant part of the book—and here, indeed, Mr. Cahan excels himself in description—is the chap-i ter entitled “The Blot," It Is real, and charged with more horror inasmuch US the true facts are only suggested. Here is the picture after the Jewish quarter i has been swept with lawlessness:
i The moon came out. Her soft, mys-tcrious light streamed through the rugged holes of shattered, unlit windows; over j muddy pavements carpeted with silks.
1 velvets, satins; over rows and rows of I dfibris mounds on streets snowed under i with down, (bedding;) over peasants drivIng home with wagons laden with plun^ i der; over the ghastly figures of sprawling , drunkards and the beautiful uniiorms of ; patrolling hussars. Silence had settled , over most of the streets * * * there I was not an unbroken window pane to be ! seen, not a light to glitter in the distance.
I The Jewish district, the liveliest districx In town, had been turned into “a city of | death.”
I To those who seek an education on ! w underground " Russia Mr. Cahan*s lati est novel can be recommended.
