As to art at large, there is Ruskin, and various other phases of the city are treated by such authorities as Taine, John Addington Symonds, Yri-arte, ThSophlle Gautier. This is the way Charles Dickens describes hfs approach to Venice:
Before I knew by what, or how, I found that we were gliding up a street—a phantom street, the houses rising on both sides from the water, and the black boat gliding on beneath the depths of the black stream with their reflected rays, hut all was profoundly silent. So' we advanced into this ghostly city, continuing to hold our course through narrow streets and lapes, all filled and flowing with water.
As to the origin of Venice, in ancient times the district from Verona to the sea was known by the Romans as Venezia, and was inhabited by an Etruscan population. Many centuries after, when Attila and the Huns ravaged Italy,' the people left the islands of the lagoon and built Torcello, which in a certain way is to he' regarded as the mother city of 'Venice. : The closing of some of the small ports by encroachments of the sands brought about the selection , of Venice as a harbor, and a new town, Rialto, was chosen then as part of the Republic of Vehetia—Venice arose. In S09 the Doge's palace was built. Soon the republic embarked on a career of commerce and conquest. Territory was acquired in the Levant and the Greek Archipelago. In the time of the Fourth Crusade, Constantinople was taken. Grant Allen writes;	.
The greatness of Venice dates from this period; it became the chief carrier between the east and the west; Its - vessels ■ exported the surplus wealth of the Lombard .plain, and brought in return hot only the timber and stone of Istria'and Dalmatia, but the manufactured wares of Christian Constantinople, the wines of the Greek isles, and the Oriental silks, carpets, and spices of Mohammedan Egypt* Arabia, and Bagdad. The crusades which impoverished the rest of Europe doubly

enriched Venice; she had the carrying and transport traffic in her own hands, and her conquests gave her the spoil of many Eastern cities.
Venice adopted an Oriental tone, due to her close connection with Constantinople. She imported many of the works of the Byzantine realm, and the probability is that she laid violent hands on them.
“ The older part of Venice Is thus to some extent a museum of applied antiquities.’* Here are the bronze horses from Constantinople, the pillars of St. John of Acre, the Greek lions of the Arsenal, and the porphyry figures near the Doge’s palace.	*
John Richard Green declares that the “ City of the Lagoons ” inherited the grandeur of old Rome, and that her leading families bore distinct relationship to the men and women of the famous empire. The ~ Venetians were the patricians of the past. “ The older genealogies of the Senators, whose names stood written in the Golden Book of Venice, ran, truly or falsely, not to Teutonic, but to Roman origins. • * * The nobles of Venice were not Lombard barons, but Roman patricians, untouched by feudal traditions, or by the strongr Instinct of personal independence which created feudalism."
John Ruskin dwells principally on the Venice oE the past. This passage is quoted from him:
The most conspicuous parts of the city have been so entirely changed in the course of the three last centuries that if Henry Dandolo or Francis FOscari could be summoned from their tombs, and stood each on the deck of his galley at the entrance of the Grand Canal, that renowned entrance, the painter’s favorite subject, the novelist's favorite scene, where the water first narrows by the steps to the Church of La Salute, the mighty Doges would not know in what spot of the world-they stood, would literally not recognize one stone of the great city, for whose^sake, and whose ingratitude, their gray hairs had been brought down with bitterness to the grave. The remains of their Venice lie hidden behind the cumbrous masses which were the delight of the nation in-, us dotage; hidden in many a grass-grown court, and silent pathway, and lightless canal, where the slow waves have sapped their foundations for five hundred years, and must soon prevail over them forever.
Every important church or monument in Venice, and there are many, has its special chapter given by a great authority. Then the various aspects of the city are described, as Venice in a commercial sense, for the city-was once a great manufacturing centre* There was a time when though England grew the wool, it was Venice that converted it Into cloth. The glass makers of Murano fashIoned the drinking vessels for the European world.' The first mirrors were made there. In Venice were the great printing houses, for the elder Aldus exercised
