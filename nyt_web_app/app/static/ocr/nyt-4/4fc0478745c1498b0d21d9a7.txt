Theodora, it is to be feared, was a sad fUrt In spite of her literary tendencies. We draw our conclusions from her own letters written to her dear friend Felicia Cabot, instructor of drawing at Rackwell Institute, Rackwell, N. J. Theodora herself *had been an instructor at college for several years before she decided to give up a steady income and turn free lance in the literary world. At college and before —even as far back as her little girlhood days—Theodora had known that John Gilchrist was In love with her. Furthermore, Theodora was in love with John, but it was quite against her spirits to marry the man she loved—at Ieas£ yet a while. So she gave up her position at college and came to New York without giving John her address and found in New Tork that the publishing world was not nearly as excited over her writing as she hoped it would be. In fact, but for a MS of compiling given her by an eccentric old gentleman who made all his nego-tiationa in writing and never had an interview with Theodora, she might have actually come to want.
In New York, quite accidentally, she ran against John. He -was teaching at Columbia and was very good-looking. But Theodora, being twenty-five and of an independent spirit, would have' none of him. Instead she continued to write unsalable articles, bluffed her way as a lecturer on polite topics suitable* for parlor discourse, flirted with a number of different men, all of whom were eager to marry her,'and continued to stumble quite accidentally across the ubiquitous John wherever she went. In the course of fifty-nine letters, mosf of them addressed to Felicia, some few to her brother Frank, whom she loved, but whose wife Corinna was no favorite of hers, she tells ail this, and it must be confessed that Teddy has a vivacious way about her which makes her letters very pleasant reading. There is a Congressman who figures in the letters and also in Teddy's life very largely since she permits herself to become engaged to him even while she Is loving John.
After she had broken her engagement with Jerome (the Congressman) she felt it her duty, by way of punishment to herself* to run away from John again, and so we find some of her letters written from abroad, and one from Paris finally announces that John, having heard of the broken engagement and the subsequent departure, hurried across the Atlantic and claimed the elusive. Theodora.. But the marriage la not yet.. Theodora still requires self-chastisement, and so the long- j .suffering John continues to wait. How ; many more letters there might have been we are unable to surmise, had not Jerome the fickle transferred his affections to Theodora's good friend Leigh Brandenburg, an estimable lady in the neighborhood of forty, but whbse wit and wisdom still had ft youthful sharpness. After that Theodora's spirit was sufficiently chastened and the marriage took place. But she has her. own ideas on wifehood.
I shall never be " a good wife ” in. the
common acceptance of the term, but I mean to do something better for John, and that Is always to be Interesting to .him. He will not be able to tell exactly what I will do under any given circumstances, for I will make it the aim of my life to do something new, or at least something unexpected. This may not sound orthodox, but it ■ is good sense. What greater kindness can a* woman do a man than to keep up hiB interest in life? If, when we come to the John-An-derson-my-Jo stage of life, John Gilchrist can say, “ Age cannot wither nor custom stale her infinite variety,” I shall be satisfied, and I fancy he will.
It was fortunate for John that he was able to conceal from Theodora the fact that he’ was the aged and eccentric Mr. Champion before their marriage, otherwise the letters might have continued indefinitely.	■	■	-	_
