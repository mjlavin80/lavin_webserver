old miser spent. The lad ran away in fear, as he admitted to his neighbors, that he might be tempted to kill his uncle. Shortly afterward Constantino returned," bccame reconciled with his guardian, met Giovanna, with whom he fell in love, again quarreled with the old miser,- and against his wishes took Giovanna to wife by civil contract. It was while the young couple were preparing- to. be married by the priest that Basile Ledda was found in his house murdered. Constantino was arrested, and at the beginning of the story sentenced to . twenty-seven years' imprisonment.
Giovanna Returns heart-broken to her mother. Thereafter an old lover, Brontu, very handsome but addicted to drink, renews his suit. The story describes Gio-yanna's fight against the wishes of her mother, the entreaties of Brontu, and relates realistic passages of the unfortunate Constantino's life in prison. At last Giovanna, taunted ^or having a convict for her husband and driven to the belief that she is doing her duty in casting away a convict husband by civil marriage for a rich, honest husband with ‘.benefit of j clergy, yields. Splendidly written is the scene where Constantino is summoned by the Superintendent of the prison to give his consent to the divorce, and cruel the . result when, upon Constantino’s refusing tho same, he is informed that -the question was only a formality and that his refusal makes no difference.
Giovanna marries Brontu, and immediately regrets it. His habils become worse; he treats her like a menial; the friends who jeered the convict husband Jeer the "bigamist” wife. She* lias a
child by Brontu. It Is baptized, but the priest does not honor the feast with his presence. Just as things reach a crisis, i one Glacobbe, a servant-^f' IJtrontu, who was formerly in the employ^of Easile
Ledda, is bitten by a tarantula, and in tho fear of death confesses that he murdered the old miser..
Constantino returns to visit the ruins of his castles in the air, but with no desire to see Giovanna, whom he believes he hates and scorns as a degraded, woman. Yet he cannot tear himself away. Why he does not know until one night lie hem's that Giovanna Is alone, when his footsteps drag him to the placo where she lives.	^	.	■
Brontu 'Ts Inter burned nt his own fire
into which he falls in a drunken stupor. Previous to this Giovanna and lier'.first husband have been holding secret meetings, and Constantino has confessed to himself that, although he cannot drag
himself from her nelghborhood^he can never love her in the same old way again. On the night of Brontu’s death, however. Giovanna pays little attention to this event, having heard that Constantino was wounded by Brontu’a mother in her fury at discovering him after a tryst with Giovanna. Giovanna sends a flying messenger to know if Constantine is ill. This is the little thing of Hfe which, coming at that moment, changes the hardened heart of Constantino and results in the big jojt of living for the hitherto unhappy couple.
It is a human story, and the fact that it
apparently has lost something in the translation does not alter, the fact that it
is still well worth reading.
