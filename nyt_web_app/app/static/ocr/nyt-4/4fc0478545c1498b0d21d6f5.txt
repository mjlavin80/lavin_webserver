AST AMEHICAN GIRL IN MUNICH. Impressions of a. Music Student. By Utibel W. Danlda. Ltttlc, Brown & Co.
Delightfully readable are the letters of an American girl studying music in Munich, who writes an account of her life to an intimate friend at home. The
•	book will, be primarily interesting to another girl who has'been or is thinking of studying! abroad, but it is written in a chatty, gossipy manner which' makes easy reading. Every one nowadays knows mu-
s!c, or at least the names' of the musi, clans, more or less* well, and it is pleasant to hear about them in their home land fn notes made at first band.
Miss -Daniels tells of the good music she hears,.the operas,. oratorios, and concerts, ot the cost of admission, of methods of instruction, and a little of the private life of . the students. There is Folly, who is in despair because she has been complained of to the police by the poet on the floor below .ana must move, and that only two weeks after she has gone to the expense of a damper for her piano I to.appease the same genius; and there , is Edith, who will not be satisfied with German shoes, D width, though they , are * exactly the thing worn by Frau Ex-| cellenz von S. &nd Frau General Secre-, tariat M. Between seasons of hard work I there are the carnivals and fetes, and we are given pictures of German life, with ^a pretty Little German love story thrown in,	-	.
