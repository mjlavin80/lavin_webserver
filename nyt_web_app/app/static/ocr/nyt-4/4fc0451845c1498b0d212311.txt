The purpose of the author “ is to present, in a clear and succinct way. the real aims and methods of the physica[-culture i movement that Is marching onward in England and the United States. The novice, who has just begun with the realization that he owe3 it to himself ti take good and rational care of his body, encounter? at the riutset so much ps»«do-instruetion that is confusing, he meets with so much contradictory advicc, that ho longs for a comprehensive and yet brief exposition of what is, after all, a very simple matter. The physical-culturc lire is not a complex one. Only obedience to the simple and readily ascertained laws of nature is sought. Be sim-j:I?, Iiatmal. and sensible, and it is easy to get on the physical-culturc road and keep there. ”
Physical culture is not athleticism. The former ends where the latter begins, so that the physical culturist may readily become an athlete if ho wishes, but the aim of physical culture is not to develop abnormal strength, but normal strength, vitality, and endurance, which are “ the rightful .i^ritape of every man and woman." The author believes that 93 per cent, of illness in early and middle life is
easily avoidable and would be eliminated “ if the plain and easiiy learned laws of physical culture were followed by aU human beings.*' How to exercise the individual muscles in the body, to bufld up the bodv by exercise and proper food, to use water us a medicine, to load and enjoy outdoor life, are among tho more important topics treated. The bcok is well illustrated.	,
