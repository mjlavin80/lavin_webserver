Hugh Price Hughes, the Methodist preacher, whose biography is here written by his daughter, was a man of tnany ac-compUshments. fond of the best music, even an art critic of merit, well up hi the classics and in ancient and modern history. He was a reader of prfetry and romance, yet he was fervently devout.
Miss Dorothea Price Hughes gives in detail every step In her father’s career. She tries to explain his precise mental state at various periods. At one time,
-	for instance, early in his life, Hugh Price Hughes saw nothing but nonsense [ tn the temperance movement, later he I was its earnest advocate.
! He was a Welshman and his mother was ! of Jewish origin. He was born in the ancient town of Carmarthen in 1847. As a child he was delicate In health, yet frail as he was, the boy had a great lovtf , for cricket, and throughout his life was I fond of encouraging athletic sports. He ! was well educated, and an eager de-vourer of all kinds of books. Very early his religious tendency was perceptible. A< school be instituted prayer meetings. Then began his desire to preach. The author writes:
The gift of preaching iimong Methodists, especially among the Welsh, has always been regarded ver> much as the gift of song or painting, a natural endowment which needs cultivation certainly, but which is born tn a man or woman, and which can show itself at an early age. That Hugh PrW^ Hughes should preach at fourteen was i»o stranger than the singing of birds, and his youth and slightness of stature only added to its effectiveness. Such a gift was really from above, straight from the source of all things.
When old enough he decided to grad* uate at I^ondon Cniverstty His first entry as a preacher was at Dover. From there he went to Oxford, and a religious revival followed him. After that he held a mission in London. It was a new scene of labor. His work was never ending He was married now, and his wife said.
" For months we seem to have only passed each other on the stairs '
On one occasion some one said to Mr. Hughes: “ You are acquainted. Sir. with many good and pleasant women, and I am wondering if you would recommend mt one for a wife, as I wish to marry immediately.” “ I longed. said Mr Hughes afterward, *' to kick him out of the room.”
In 1890 he acted as the English repre sensitive at the Methodist "Ecumenical Conference in America. On his return u> England he entered into the politlca.1 and other controversies of the time. He was often scored as " a meddler ” in political matters. Sometimes he was a Conservative and at other lime* a IJberal. At first he was violently opixieed to the war In South Africa, but afterward changed hjs nund Hughes insisted that there were two *’ great tyrannies in the earth, one in the clerical profession and the other the medical one ' He thougbt, loo, that the women were mostly to blame for this.
In 1896 Mr. Hughes was President of the Free t'hurch Congress held at Nottingham. Numerous trips were rmlde by Mr. Hughes abroad, and in hi** letters lie describes moM particularly the an of Ital>. rtnd remarkably well done tn it
