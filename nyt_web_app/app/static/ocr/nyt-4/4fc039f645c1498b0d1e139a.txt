"Being more acutely interested in Mrs. Ward's new heroine. Lady Kitty Ashe, than in any other woman In fiction for years and years, and having- heard remarks about her from some of my friends which savor of “ malicious gossip,” I wish to defend her. Poor child! Badly horn, badly reared, and badly, or not at all, chaperoned, what could be expected of a witty, brilliant, audacious temperament such as hers? One might li?ve suspected what would happen when she married so admirable a man as William Ashe. Better, in her case, that she had . mated with a man less obviously “ good " —a man (though f am reluctant to say it) with a little more of the brute in him; that would have stunned her a little, caught her airy, vagrant attention, held her in check. But William! There was a husband ideal enough for a very correct, well-balanced, woman (not for Mary Lystcr, though—r detest her.) Kitty did not really care for Cliffe. She was only fascinated—and there wasn't anything to do in her aristocratic, social life but be vapid, as she couldn't be. or get into mischief, as she could. Even her child was taken. And she was so young—pitifully young and frail, and withal so sparkling, so torn with a sort of futile and product-less vitality.' Poor Kitty! I for one hold that husband of hers largely responsible. You can’t blame a butterfly, or break It on a wheel of sophistry.
