To the current Harper’s Charlotte Wilson contributes seven fluent stanzas entitled " The Love
of Elia,” treating of Lamb’s '* Alice W-----------n in a
manner that will appeal to every habitual reader of the essays:
Her image glides from page to page,
A Presence, frail and fair,—
Scarce more than sweet averted face And glint of shining hair.
In The Bookman this month Mr, Robert Underwood Johnson has a sonnet called “ The Spanish,. Stairs ” protesting against some proposed changes near the house in Rome In Which John Keats died:
Home, symbol of all change, oh, change not here.
Tn The Reader Carolyn Wells rises to remark that “ fiction shows notable names. Lady and Lord and Grandee,” and that of them all, these three her favorites be, “ Trilby, and Tommy, and Kim/' While in The Century’s ° lighter vein ” Charles D. Stewart tells anew in rhyme the story of the strange, tragic death of Aeschylus, with apt interlocutory romarkb by his own popular “ Fugitive Blacksmith,” Finerty. Talking about current verse, what a pity it is that there was no editor of Tom Watson’s Magazine with time to spare to touch up the quatrain about the President of these United States so as to make the first half of it worthy of the closing couplet;
His sword within its scabbard sleeps.
But, mercy! How it snores! With two other lines that would decently scan, that audaciously droll quatrain would have swept the land, so to speak, like wildfire.
