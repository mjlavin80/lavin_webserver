BANK. AND TR.EASU
Dr. F. A. Cleveland, at present Professor of Finance in the School Of Commerce, New York University, has written a most useful and interesting little volume called “ The Bank and the Treasury/' which is published by Longmans, Green & Co. It is a careful * and quite minute, though succinct, examination of the American system of banking under Congressional organization and Federal supervision with reference to its efficacy and Its soundness in serving the essential jmrposes of
banking.
It is especially careful and informing in its discussion of the actual responsibilities assumed by banks and the means provided to meet them satisfactorily, The main contention of Prof.
Cleveland relates to the distinction he rightly holds should carefully he maintained in banking between resources properly to be classed as capital and resources available for current business. The former should be ample for all permanent and continuous requirements and should be at all times convertible into cash or its equivalent. This necessity arises from the peculiar nature of the business of banking, which practically is the malting of loans the payment of which should be assured. There are three sources of the money, or credit, thus loaned* One is the paid-in capital of the bank and its accumulated profits. The second such money as may he deposited with it by its customers. The third the pro* ceeds of the notes discounted for its customers. In effect both the last two sources are loans to the hank, which it again loans out, and the greatest caution is needed to make sure that payments can be made in accordance with current requirements.
Dr. Cleveland places a great deal of emphasis on the fact that the business of banking, through the sight drafts, the checks, to which it gives existence# does in reality supply the great body of what is regarded and used as money in the exchanges of the country. It is money in this form that is expanded when credit is good, when men of business in the community are trusting each other readily, and is contracted as soon as this condition of confidence is impaired. Therefore it is of the last importance that the provision for the redemption of this form of accepted ! currency should be sufficient. That
can be accomplished under government tal supervision by requiring sufficient capital resources to begin with and by requiring that the. burden placed on these capital resources from time to time should vigilantly be watched and definitely and .firmly restricted. Dr.
- ■ - - - % Cleveland believes, that at present this is not adequately done, and that the defect is particularly great in the “reserve ” cities,- and greatest of all in the 'City of New Tork, We think that * he is substantially correct and that his discussion of the matter could be studied with' profit by bankers and by members of Congress called upon to take part in legislation on the subject.
In regard to what he calls “ elasticity ** in banknote issues, we think that Prof. Cleveland is misled by his perfectly sensible aversion from all forms of inflation. He^eems to think that an " elastic ’* banknote currency is one that can stretch only. Now, as a matter of fact, the true quality of elastic substances is their inherent tendency to return to their original condition when released from the operation of the forces that have stretched them. It is entirely feasible to provide banknote issues that will be elastic in this sense. The principle of the Suffolk Bank system, which, as Dr. Cleveland points out, maintained specie payments j in New England when all the rest ot the country suspended, will accomplish that end. That system required that no bank should pay out over its counters the bills of another bank, and that every bank should redeem its notes on presentation at a central clearing house every day. That re~ qulrement simply forced the notes into redemption the moment they could not profitably be used in the actual daily exchanges of the community. In other words, such notes were the most convenient and the most profitable form of loans the banks could make consistently with absolute certainty of their payment. Dr, Cleveland is so clear and sound a thinker In regard to the main subject of his book that we regret that he should seem a little confused on this important phase of banking.
