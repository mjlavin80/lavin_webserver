ITALIAN HlfcH LIFE,
Mme. Waddington’s Letters Written “ During Two Visits a Quarter of -	a	Century	Apart.1*5
[E, WADDI>:GTO>: in Italy is not perhaps Mme. Wad-dington at her best. Her familiar letters thence tend to the trivial!ties which may, without spice of malice and scandal, or sultlclem wit, or overpowering glamour of courts and high cosmopolite life, breed something not re' mote from contempt. However, of the last, at all events, there is no lack—Kings, Queens, Princes, PopeSc Ministers of Stale, Ambassadors, Dukes, Americans 6t the sort who mingle freely with the great of the older earth fairly crowd the stage. And to people who know their Italy, past or present, tliero is, of course, an added interest, for Mme. Waddington as Miss King spent much of her girlhood there and had a chance to renew and revise her impressions in middle life, in 18SG, and again, jn old age. last year.
The earlier visit, that of 3SS0, followed Just after the retirement of her husband, M- Waddington, from the Premiership of France. It was undertaken, in fact, as a season of rest and readjustment on the part of the ex-Minister, who, strangely enough, had never been to Rome before.
Mme. Waddington describes, first, her departure from the. official residence* Quai d'Orsay, her own feelings at return' ins to private life, and especially those of her youthful son Praneis,
I really think the only person who hated to leave the Quai d’Orsay was Francis. He was furious at seeing all his things packed up. and was carried out to tho carriage kicking and screaming— ‘* veux pas quitter ma niaison—veux pas aller vllatne petite maison (“ don’t want to leave my house, don't want to go to any horrid old little house.” The hulsslers (six all standing in a row to say good-bye) were much impressed, and the old grayheaded Pierson, who has been there for years and seen many Ministers depart, remarked: " Au moins Monsieur Francis est d^sole do partir.” " At least Master Francis is grieved to go away.” It seemed funny to drive out of the big- grates for the
last time.
In Florence the Waddingtons found many old friends and made new ones. Mme. Waddington records this incident among many:
W. [Waddington] has his opinion of my Italian. He came to my room this morning followed by the Italian servant to tell me to tell him that his razor must be sharpened. I began, and came to a dead halt—hadn’t the slightest idea what razor was in Italian. W. was much disgusted, but I explained that when I was living in Italy before as a girl I hadn’t often had occasion to ask lor razors.
To be sure, all tho Waddington family could not have been weak in the language Of Dante. Evelyn Waddington, uncle to the Minister, married art Italian wife and became in time Sindaco, or Mayor, of Perugia. That was when the late Pope Leo XIII, was Bishop of Perugia. The two were good friends.
In Florence the Waddingtons called (by special invitation* upon Mile, de la Ram6e. (Ouida-) It was a rather large party distributed in several rarriagvs, and the lady arrived first.
Ouida came to the gate to meet us. She was civil, but before I had time to say that M. Waddington was coming in another carriage, she looked past me, saying,
" Et M. Waddington,. il ne vient done pas/' with such evident disappointment and utter indifference to the presence of Mme. Waddington that I was rather taken aback; but I suppose geniuses must not be judged like other people. I was rather disappointed in her appearance,
Tn Rome casual persons who saw M. Waddington in hotel dining rooms and such public places declined to believe that he was the latf Frt-n^h Premier. “ Never,” they said, " that man is an Englishman." At all events, his name is English enough for Hip most fastidious. One might suppose that the English Waddingtons had a /genius for expatriation. If M. William Henry Wndtlingion was beyond question French, was not Evelyn Waddington, aforementioned. Pinrtaeo rf Perugia, Italian?
Mme. Waddington is proud also of the Kings—she is. as th’ world knows, a daughter of Chari *<7 King, sometime President of Columbia College in the City of New York—and of the Schuylers. with whom also she is connected. Proof in this paragraph—she Is writing of the American colony in Rome, where Eugene Schuyler was at the time Consul General:
They don’t seem pleased with Marsh — our Minister. Always the i-amt,- eJd story and jealousy—the Ministers consider themselves so far above a Consul. But really when the Consul General happens to be Schuyler and his wife King, one would think these two names would speak for themselves—for Americana at any rate.
Here is an umu.;:n^ bit:
Do you remember Mrs. S., who was so severe with us—first because we were Americans (she was English) and then because we knew everybody and enjoyed ourselves? When she was young people came to Romtj to educate themselves and enjoy the pictures, museums, historical ■

Of course there are audiences with the Pope—two Popes, in fact—for M, and Mme. Waddington were presented to Leo X1IL, in lSbO, and Mme, Waddington to. Plus X., in 1904. In the first case, the audience was somewhat special:
We went in at once, the Monslgnor closing the door behind us 'and leaving us alone with the Pope, who came, almost to the door to receive ub, so that the three regulation curtsies were impossible. There were three red and gold armchairs at one end 01* the roonv with a thick handsome carpet in front of them. ^The Pope sat on the one in the middle, put me on his right/ and W. on his left. • * * He risked W. all sorts of questions about home politics and the attitude of !'the <. lergy, paying that .as a Protestant^ his opinion would be impartial. • * * W. was Tathcr guarded at first, (decidedly “ banale,” I told him afterward,) but the Pope looked straight at him with his keen bright eycp, saying, " Je vous on prle, M. Waddington, paries sans reserves/*
When her husband waited upon King Humbert, Mme. Waddington Records ’ that he went off most properly attired with his Italian ribbon,” and adds quaintly:	'
He generally forgets to put on his orders, and was decidedly put out one day m Paris when he arrived at a royal reception without the decoration the sovereign had just sent him. The explanation was difficult—he could hardly tell the King he had forgotten,
Mme. Waddington says the audience with Queen Margherita was not like a royal audience at all. ** It was a very pleasant visit to a charming woman in a pretty room with all sorts of pictures and ‘ bibelots ’ about.*^ She does not speak in Quite tho same terms of her audience last year with the now Queen Elena, who "looked tired";
We (the other was the Marquise**de Bailleul) had the usual royal questions as to our children. As X only had one child my conversation on that subjcct soon came to an end, but Marquise de Bailleul has three small ones, so she got on swimmingly. The Queen talked very prettily and simply about her own children and the difficulty of keeping them natural and unspoiled,
A comie incident relates to sport on the Campagna. It was the last paeet of the season:
There were quantities of handsome horses, but I don t know that it was quite comfortable walking when the hunt moved off. Some of the young men, principally officers, were taking preliminary gallops in every direction, and jumping backward and forward over a large ditch. One of them knocked down an Englishwoman—at least I don't think he really knocked her, but he alighted so near her that she was frightened and slipped getting out of the way.
The letters, as the title page of the book shows, cover a period of only five months in 18S0 and another period of only three months a quarter of a century later.
