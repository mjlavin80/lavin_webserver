THE-ODORIL THOMAS.
Auobiography of the Famous Orchestra Conductor and the Documentary Record of flis Si illiant Career by Mr. Upton.
Written for The Net/ Tork Times Book Review by RICHARD ALDRICH.
HEODORE THOMAS’S autobiography is a small part of these two good-sized volumes. Nobody who knew the man and his nature would expect from him a copious or an engaging flow of reminiscences. "What a volume he could have written had the gift of literary expression been atTded to the gifts that were hist As It is, his own writing is a highly characteristic expression of the man, and the book as a whole makes interesting and important contributions to American musical history, and to the knowledge of the part played in it by Theodore Thomas.
Mr. Thomas never meant to write his autobiography; he wished only to preserve in some permanent form his programmes. He was persuaded to the autobiographical sketch as an afterthought. This was completed in the Autumn preceding hi3 death. He lived only four months after it was finished; and so it is practically the whole story of his life as he himself wished to tell it. He did not record his satisfaction at attaining a permanent home for his orchestra, which is the burden of much of his aspiration his life long, and which it wa3 granted him to see before the end came. But others have seen to that record. Mr. Upton gives a full measure of “ Reminiscence and Appreciation/' in which he tells many things that Mr. Thomas left out, and completes the story of his activities. Mr, Upton, too, undertook the arduous and responsible task of selecting and arranging the programmes that are given in the second volume—a record of much importance—and of adding such explanations as were necessary.
Mr. Thomas’s account of his early life Is candid, and It has many humorous touches. His father was the town musician of Esens, his birthplace. Mr. Thomas had not the slightest remembrance of when he began to play the violin; but he was soon able to play and to read music as well as his father. They came to New York in 1845, \yhen 11 the Metropolitan city was a provincial town of two-story houses and the pigs ran through Broadway and ate the refuse." Young Theodore had to fall to at once to help support the family, and played In a dancing school and In theatrical orchestras—they played better music in the theatres then than they do now, and he made his first acquaintance with Beethoven's " Coriolanus ” overture in a performance of ShaUe-speare’a tragedy.
He gives a diverting account of a trip through the South that- he made- alone in 1849, as a lad of fourteen—and an amazing record it is, too:
I do not remember taking anythingwith me but my fiddle, my little box of clothing, and some posters which I had had printed announcing a concert hy v Master- T. :T." I kept a supply of these posters in my trunk, and when* I had no money I first obtained permission to use the dining hall of a hotel for a concert, and then X went around on the day before the concert took place and put up my posters with tacks. 1 Wlten the. time for- the concert- arrived I would stand at the door of the hall and take the money, until I concluded • that my audience was about gathered, after which I would go to the front of the hall, unpack my violin, and begin the concert.	,
In one place in Mississippi he affirms that he was ordered by the authorities to leave town because they believed the devil was in his fiddle! All this speaks as plainly as need be or the energy and selfreliance that characterized Thomas’s whole subsequent career. He puts much stress on his experience in the next following years in New York, when he played in orchestras that supported Jenny Lind, SJontag, Mario, GrIsVBoslo, Alboni, and others. The pure and musical quality of their art was of great value in forming the taste of an impressionable boy; these years gave him the preparation for his later

task, shaping his future as no other Influence could have done.	.
' He takes occasion to emphasize the important musical Influence of Karl Eck-ort, the conductor-Who-was brought over with Henrictte Sontag to lead her orchestra. It was in 1S52. He was ‘‘the only really fully equipped and satisfactory conductor who visited* this country during that period,** and his influence, Mr. Thomas declares, laid the founda-
■	tiou of his own career. The next year Thomas became concertmeister under Arditl In the orchestra that supported La,-grange, Mirate, and Badiall—Mlrate being, the greatest tenor he ever heard in voice, compass, method, and musicianship. In 1S54 Thomas joined the Philharmonic Society, playing under Theodore Elsfeld, whom he characterizes as a " time-beat-er,” and then under Rergsaann, "What he says about the latter is interesting as touching an important figure in earlier days of musical New York. Some have thought that Eergmann was Thomas’s model in conducting1. Mr. Thomas would undeceive them. Kckert was the one who influenced him. and from whom he learned- Bergmann was without most of the qualities of a first-rank conductor, but “ he possessed an artistic nature and was in synsa,thy with the so-called * Zukunfts-musik ’ ”—music of the future. He lacked the force to make an impression and had no standard; nor did h^ study.
His qualities are shown in a similar light by Mr. Thomas in his account of the famous chamber concerts established by William Mason, which forms the next interesting chapter in Thomas's career. They *' sounded the war cry of death to stale, meaningless music and proclaimed progress" under the leadership of the young- pianist, who carried them on at a loss with devotion and enthusiasm for fourteen years. Bergmann was only a moderate i*rformer on the violoncello, with a small tone, because he never practiced; but he did everything with a certain grace. And w'hile he was interested in modern music, Thomas never had his support in placing the later quartets of Beethoven on their programmes. It is characteristic of Thomas that he could understand why Mosentlral and Matzka were not enthusiastic about them—they were “ still somewhat under the influence cf their European training.'' But *' Bergmann and I had no training,” and were presumably, therefore, open to natural impulses!
In 1SG2, at the height of his popularity as a concert violinist, Mr. Thomas 11 concluded to devote his energies to the cultivation of the public taste for instrumental music,” Thus he registers the decision that was to govern all the rest of his life and to have so great an influence on the future of music in this country. The record that follows is a familiar one, but Mr. Thomas’s account discloses the difficulties and perplexities against which he had to contend. The concerts in Irving Hall, at Lion Park, at Terrace Garden, were the first steps, varied from time to time with symphony concerts. An amusing glimpse of what the Terrace Garden concerts and Mr. Thomas himself were in those days is given. These were open-air concerts;
On one occasion, while playing the
*' Linnet Polka,” I requested the piccolo players to cUmb up into the trees before the piece began. When they commenced playing from their exalted position in the branches it made a sensation. At anI other time, for " The Carnival of Venice,*’ the tuba player had been sent not up the trees, but back of the audience into tho shrubbery. When he began to play tb* police mistook him for a practical joker who was disturbing the music ajid trio*# to arrest him! I shall never forget tb* comical scene as the poor man fled toward the stage, pursued by the irate policeman and trying to get in a note here and there as he ran.
But these were generally serious days, with problems to be solved to obtain sufficient engagements to keep the orchestra together for the higher ciass of symphony concerts that had already de-
Iveloped from the humble beginnings. Wearisome traveling was the outcome of' ihis necessity. Always the question of a hall in New York suitable for symphony concerts came up. In 1872 Mr. ’ Thomis thought the hall was in sight, and an-m unced his next traveling season as his last. But the last of his traveling was to by thirty years in the future! There ir, no note of discouragement in any of this, but rather the note of a perfectly understood purpose backed by unyielding resolution and persistency.
Mr. Upton's chapters of “ Reminiscence and Appreciation ’* add many interesting details to the account of Thomas’s life and work. They trace also his development as an artist and describe his methods and ideals. It may be that even some of the warmest admirers of UTr Thomas will find these chapters pitched in a somewhat too ecstatic key. somewhat lacking in critical balance and sense of proportion, somewhat disposed to measure all the rest of the world by. the standard of Mr. Thomas's beliefs and practices. In such- a -book us Mr. TJp-ten’s this is no doubt inevitable. All Mr. Thomas’s friends and admirers will rejoice to possess so detailed a picture of the man, even if all the lights are high lights, and there Is little sense of relief. '	'	'
And all students of music will rejoice to i possess in the second volume the very
copious extracts from-Mr. Thomas's programmes. The extracts have been judl* clously made. In certain lines 'Completeness has been secured: and there Is a. thorough representation of all periods of the conductor’s activity* and of the varf- , ous kinds of concerts that he gave In different parts of the country. It is needless to dwell upon the long, slow advance in public taste they indicate, largely brought about by..Mr. Thomas’s own efforts. The fact is familiar; but the concrete expression of it is here for the first time. The list of first productions will interest sticklers for the rights of history. There is an illuminating and suggestive little essay by Mr. Thomas prefixed to this collection, giving his Views and practices in the composition Of programmes and expounding the philosophy of his opposition to what are usually (though in no language known to man) entitled “ encores,” and . to late comers in concerts. His views on Wagner’s music in the concert hall are well founded—since the dramas have been per" formed. Thomas discontinued as many of the excerpts from his concert programmes as the public would allow him to. In general, he concludes, Wagner's , methods are “ too realistic” fpr the concert stage; and the difference between music for the concert room and the operatic stage is not enough understood.
There is special point to-day in some of his comments on modern music and musicians. Berlioz did not understand the soul or spirit expressing the deepest humanity, and tried to replace soul by adopting a text that should interest the listener and to cover up the lack of musical expression with material effects. Liszt’s orchestral scores show too plainly that he never entered into the secrets of that world. He made valuable suggestions, but " he was never able to reach the heights to which he so ambitiously aspired.” . True, and a valuable word in these days of renewed attempts to exploit Liszt as a composer. Strauss’s orchestral style, involving as it does practical impossibilities for the players. Mr. Thomas calls lacking in gelf-control and good manners. R. A.
