Helene Vacaresco, well known as a com-_ p&nion of Queen Elizabeth of Roumanla (Carmen Sylva) and as a writer on vari-otis topics, has a second Ume ventured into the region of folk-lore, and again with success. Her first venture- resulted tn a collection of Roumanian folk-songs, published under the title of " The' Bard. of the Dtmbovitza,” the Dlmbovltza being the river on which stands Bukharest, the capital of the Kingdom of Roumania, The new trial produces 11 Songs of the ' Valiant Voivode,’* a collection of folk- I lore in prose rather than ol folk-songs. 1
In a dedicatory epistle to a cousin. Mile. ! vacaresco says: •• You will not find here , Oine single tale that Is already inclosed in tne boohs of our learned and patient folklore searchers. They are as new to the I public as if they had not lain for centuries m the souls of our country people. * • * : And whereas. In moat parts of Europe, the simple charms of country life, the ancient customs and rites are hushed to silence by their great foe, civilization, here you ; will find them as alive and fresh as In the '' Virpiiian days, when they delighted manKind, * * * These tales are Latin, Dacian, and Asiatic, while the mysticism of the Slavonic race may sometimes be traced in them.
The persistence of the same stories in the folk-lore of all countries is, nevertheless, Quite apparent in Mile. Vacaresco1 s newest collection; and suggestions of the brothers Grimm abound, yet never to the same extent as in some recent Irish folk-lore stories," which seem to be merely Grimm’s fairy tales told in the brogue. The " Songs of the Valiant Voivode *’ simply suggest the folk-lore of other countries; there Is in them no reason to doubt the author’s statement that they are all published for.the first time. Some of them are done into, a metrical version apparently reproducing the rhythm of the peasants, others are in prose. All are Interesting, and show that their compiler has profited by her position as companion to the only monarch in literature at the present time.
