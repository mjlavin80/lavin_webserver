Blue Cloth. $1.25 net.) Of all the arts of
expression that at one time or another
absorbed the mental and physical activity
of this Incomparable painter, sculptor, and
architect, the writing of verse came to
him late in life. But whether the inspiration of the sonnets was that beautiful and gifted youth Tommaso Cavalieri, or that pious and accomplished lady Vittoria Cc-lonna, we find the same care of detail and patient labor which characterized bis plastic work. In the brief notes which follow the text in the book before us Mr. Symonds explains the circumstances, as far as known, in which the sonnets were written, and makes note of the various
manuscript versions over which Buonar»' 1 . rotl worked* Even the translator- him- J self has attempted more than:one version i: of a . sonnet, as, for example, of Sonnet-VS! HI.. '• Celestial-Iiove."	j
John Addington Symonds -was a very great connoisseur and historian of art.
He knew the Italian language hardly second to his own. Had he been more or a poet and possibly less of a linguist, his -translations might' have conserved morc^ of the spirit and atmosphere of the origi- - I;-nals. Such as they are, they are Ingeni- | ‘ ous word renderings, which,, while not entirely devoid of fine lines, for the. most. . part lack color and lightness of rhythm, -r and'once more confirm the'truth of "that : old Italian adafee, traduttore Iradltore ” -—M the translator is a traitor.” .
