" The Freedom of Life” containssound-. I logic—and some sophistries; tr^uclv K90t?; | sense—and just a little nonsense; * ^	I.
The opening sentence of the irifro^uc-' 1 tlon gives the key to the book:. “ Intpri-,or freedom rests upon, the principle of -non-resistance to all the. things which seem evil or palnfui to .our natural love* of! self," . Eut?*i# is. a peculiar kina of. active and strong npn-resistance,. which _ Miss Call .expialns ois .her .work, proceeds*, . and there .we often * fail to follow her. Here are some of the, puzzles, presented to the plain-minded: A certain youthful " Margaret 'V began to worry “ lest she should fail in -her lesSons, especially . in; Latin.*’ Her mother sent .her; to some , teacher (presumably Miss Call) of the art of not worrying. ,	.	’
The teacher, after giving her some Idea of the common sense of. not worrying, taught her quieting, exercises which she practiced every day, and when one day, in the midst .of one of her lessons, ~ Margaret seemed very quiet and restful. the teacher asked: ...	-
"Margaret, could you worry about your Latin now if you tried? V	■
:	" Yes,” said Margaret, " I am afraid I
could."
Nothing more was said, but she went on .with her. lessons, and several days, g after, during the same restful quiet time, ■ the teacher ventured again:	1
" Now, Margaret, could you worry about fl your Latin if you tried? ’*	■	9
Then came the emphatic answer, “ No, I I could not.*’	I
After that the little * girl would say:	1
" With the part of me that worries I l do not care whether X get my Latin or. | not; with the part of me that does not worry I want to get my Latin very much; therefore I will stay in the part of me
that does‘not worry and get ray Latin.*’
i „ „
Again: A woman during all her life had suffered an anguish for nervous fear when, the dentist was in prospect. On. one such occasion “ she remembered her new principles,” (of non-resistance,) and declared to herself:	-
“ Yes, I am	afraid.	I am awfully
afraid. I am'	perfectly	willing to be
afraid," and the	ease with	which the Tear	I
disappeared was	a surprise—even to her-	B
self.I
Now- these passages and others of the 9 I same -kind are nothing more nor less than 8 the cant^of a cult. -Who is "perfectly I | ^willing to bn -afraid *’? Nobody: it is a :most .unpleasant sensation. If one’s hearf is set upon successful . achievement, whether in a Latin lesson or in the great’ affairs of life, one will certainly be able to worry, if one tries! We cannot blink | facts by denying them.
-Xhese objections are almost wholly con-
i fined to the earlier chapters of the book, in whfch the author .pushes her theories into a fad. The chapters on “ Self-Consciousness,” “ other People." "Humtm, Sympathy,” ** Dependence and Independ- . 1 enco,” “ Self-Con trol.’* “ The Religion. of . I It,” " About Christmas." "To Mothers," 9 are altogether Admirable, full of truths to 1 live by, of sound counsel, and of clear 1 vision. Delightful is the quotation from I the old lady who said: “ My dear, it is I Impossible to exaggerate the unimport- I ance of things." “Therein lies the whole philosophy of-life. Excellent, too, is the definition of self-control, as the subjugation of selfishness in whatever form it .may exist, and Its entire subordination to
*	spiritual and natural law; and very forceful and trut ts the chapter on " The Religion of It.”	,
Although we have entered a demurrer in regard to certain parts of the book, be it understood that we j criticise only the universal application which the author makes of her fundamental principle of non-resistance. The excellent little volume should be widely and thoughtfully read; It is written in a style at once sue-cinct and limpid, and it holds much truth upon which it is safe to build. To follow the lines here laid down will be to attain a twofold “freedom of' life,” freedom from, the burden of self, and from that* unrelenting " Wheel of Things,** upon _ which this generation is bound.
