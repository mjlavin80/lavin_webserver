BOSTON NOTES. .
New Books by C. H. Henderson, Archibald Marshall, and Other Au-thors,1 Old and New* .
R. C. Hanford Henderson's “ The Chil^Wi of Good Fortune,” to be ^gjubUahed next Wedpesday by 'ilesars. Houghton,* --Mifflin & Co., is ' dedicated “ To those gracious spirits who in life and . literature are helping me to discover in what good fortune consists." It Is divided into fifteen chapters, in which the author considers " What la conduct? ” and ",What makes tt right or wrong,” arriving at last at the decision that when enlightenment Is come the image of good fortune made by each man's splrtt will be the serene and beautiful face of morality.

Other books to appear Wednesday are the four printings of “ Isidro,*’ Mrs. Anna Hempstead Branch’s ** The Shoes that Danced," the second volume of Mr. Charles Waldstein’s “ The Argive Her-aeura,” containing Dr. George H. Chase's section on terra cotta figurines; Dr* J. C- Hoppen’s chapter on terra COtta reliefs and his elaborate account of vases; Mr. Herbert De Cous‘s catalogues of bronzes, and Prof. R. Herton’s descriptions of engraved stones and gems and ivories.
Messrs. Herbert B. Turner & Co. have secured the American rights for Mr, Archibald Marshall's “ The House of Mer-rilees " and announce its coming publication. Its author's first book. " Peter Bin-ney. Undergraduate," was a pleasant whimsey, carried out something in the manner of Mr. Anstey, but with sufficient originality. The second is in nn entirely
different style, for such Is the fashion or the day.

Miss Marion E. Grey, the young author of “ Greselda," is busy on a second book, which will probably be rsady in the Autumn. The next boolt to be Issued by this
firm will proably be Prof. Hyslop’s *' Science and a Future Life,*’ for which advance orders have been coming with a frequency as indicative of the deep interest in the subject as the swift sale of Prof. Miinsterbcrg’s “ The Eternal Life,” published Saturday. No two books could differ more widely in treatment and substance, but both seem to promise light on a topic concerning which this generation seeks instruction everywhere except in church manuals and theological works. Meanwhile Harvard is naturally rejoicing in its good fortune in retaining Prof. Miinsterberg, in spite of the German Government's offer of the KOnlgsberg Chair
of Philosophy, the chair occupied for so
many years by Immanuel Kant*	~

Fences and irrigation, stampedes and cut dams, are rivaling mC.iicipal politics as American interests in fiction this season, and, moreover, they are connected with State and Federal politics in the stories quite as much as in real life. Mr. John H. Whitson finds place for all these things in his “Justin Wingate, Ranchman.'* and adds two races for life and a grass fire, and a divorce-seeking woman whose deeds save him the trouble of uttering an explicit opinion to her species. The book will be published tomorrow, together with the new illustrated edition of Miss Anna Chapin Ray's " By
the Good Sainte Anne." The photographs included in the latter book and the story itself give it the place with this generation that “ Their Wedding Journey ” held with the last, as a sentimental guide to Quebec.

Miss Ray's new book " On the Firing Line " will appear Saturday of next week. Mr. W. R. A. Wilson’s " A Knot of Blue *' and ** As the World Goes By.” by Miss Elisabeth W. Brooks, Mr. John R. Carling's “ A Weird Picture,” and Mr. Roger Pocock's “ Curly *' will not appear until May 6.
The Lothrop, Lee & Shepard Company has in press a fac simile reprint of " The Only True Mother Goose," as produced in Boston In 1833, with “ A Complete History of the Goose Family " and reproductions of the wood engravings of the early
edition. These pictures had the merit— comparatively rare in these days—of following the text with perfect accuracy. The cow jumped *' over the moon" instead of gamboling feebly, and only a head or two remained visible of the children trho went “ sliding on the ice, all on a Summer's day," Dr. Edward Everett Hale writes an introduction to the book, which, setting aside the Goose fable, is really a valuable collection of political squibs and old songs, anywhere from a century and a half to three centuries old.

The company has received the manuscript of Hr. Harry Leon Wilson’s “ The Boses of Arcady," with the illustrations by his wife, the “ O'Neill " of Puck.

Mr. Hear' Wood's pamphlet, “Arbitrary Price-Making Through the Forms
of Law,". attained a. circulation of 8,000' as soon a3 it met the eye of it leading railroad President, for he promptly .ordered!; that number for distribution,	“-P
' . • Among the Lothrop books pn the company's list is Mrs. Paulino Carrington Bouvfi's ‘ *' American Heroes and Heroines.” Mrs. Bouv£ is a cousin, of the ""Princess Troubetzkoy, formerly Miss j Anieiie Ttlves, and a kinswoman of Mr. ' Thomas Nelson Page, who, like her, is ; descended from the owner of the first Ii- i brary ever brought to the Virginia colony,

. ' i " With Rogers’ Rangers," to be published in the Autumn by Messrs. L. C. Page & Co., is the last of the scries of “ Woodranger Tales," written by Mr. G. Waldo Browne. It will appear at about
the same time as Mr. Ruel P. Smith's “ The Rival Campers,” which is to be illustrated by Mr. A. B. Shute. The artist speaks enthusiastically of the story.
In '* Thoreau's Journal" Is a delightful pioce of criticism of his adoring friend, Channing. Quoth the stern Henry:	"I
think it would be good discipline for Channing, who writes poetry In a sub-llmo-slipshod style, to write Latin, for then he would be compelled to say something always, and frequently to have recourse to his grammer and dictionary."

New Varieties of Sin," by Mr. Edward Alsworth Rose, analyzes the real nature of actions so disguised by association that the individual hardly perceives their scope. It is a strong plea for thoughtful consideration in all dealings with one's fellows.
