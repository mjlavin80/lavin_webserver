' To live * in, one's imagination, with • th§ aid' of! the* author’s, in old. Condon town •during the reign of Elizabeth, In an atmosphere charsed with the fighting‘glory of England’s’ best' days, the" poetry t of* England's greatest -writers, to talk with* Edmund- Spenser in a qiilet corner .of a garden in the Strand, to watch the Virgin ;Queen blow kisses from her carriage In the street, to; brush-shoulders with ..one WillShakespeare late arrived from Stratford with a.pocketful of manuscripts, and 'to smoke a reflective pipe with Sir Walter 1 Ralegh, (or Raleigh, or Rawleigh,) te. to say the. .leasts of it, a pleasant way to,, spend a. few hours; even when the; storyr : in hand is not overcharged of incident. . .
This pleasant dream may be derived, from a..reading of .Beatrice. Marshall’s latest novel, 11 The Queen’s Knight Errant,” who, by the way, does not figure so largely in the. story as, one would ‘ expect. The story is a great deal more about other' people in -the book. .	.	.
The tale begins with the rescue from* the sea of a little girl wrapped in a queer old cloak like a minstrel's on the shores of the ancestral home ii\ Devtfn of one Gervaise Vidal. This Vidal is’ a much- . hailed recluse, who lost his parents in a storm which upset their light pleasure boat. Vidal potters in alchemy, and is a mournful figure, a kind of Hamlet of a fishing hamlet. He waives his right to possess the waif of the sea, which, falls* into the possession of Christopher Fane, a neighboring Esquire, who rears It with his own sturdy little sons, one of whom is called Robin, The girl, who has beeri called Iris, is strangely attracted by Gervaise Vidal, whor rescues her from a perilous position in a storm. He is struck by a certain resemblance in her to his mother, and attracted because she is gifted with second sight, in which she talks of banshees and bogs, and an old man who sings. Later, for her sake, "he fights for the Protestant Queen against Spain. Iris becomes a maid of. honor to Elizabeth Throgmorton, who afterward married Ralegh; and Rdbin becomes a yeoman in the service of the knight errant.
Thereafter little Is -heard of Vidal, and Robin and Iris only play cat>-paws in the story of Ralegh’s love affair with airs. Throgmorton and the subsequent se?cret marriage, ’which so enrages the Queen that she cdsts Ralegh and His wife into the Tower. Then the author takes us back to Vidal, who has been cast in prison as a heretic and sorcerer. Iris obtains his release through Ralegh. The knight- errant is struck with the face of Iris, which has puzzled him with a vague familiar memory every time he has seen it. It recalls a mother; who pleaded, while he was fighting in Ireland, that a little child might be sent in j safety to England. This woman had been j picked up at sea by a notorious pirate who married her. It becomes clear—if it was not clear before—that Gervaise Vidal and Iris are brother and sister, particularly when a cat scratches a package of letters out of a cloak of the old minstrel who had taken care of the waif and was drowned on the voyage to England. Gervaise Vidal, who might have proved a hated brother-in-law to Robin. | is burned to death in his own ancestral home by the machinations of the same , convenient villain who had him arrested ! for sorcery.	!
One has a feeling that* the cat and the convenient villain were introduced for the | purpose of wflinding off a thin plot, 1 However, the plot may well be overlooked for the sake of the conversation of the 1 wild "Kit” Marlowe, who strolls in ' here and there, the musings of the mel- j ancholy Spenser and that delightful scene where Elizabeth bids Ralegh light his 1 wonderful pipe and Spenser read his latest stanzas of the “ Faerie Queene.” ! Alas, poor Sponsor! She fell asleep looking at Ralegh's smoke-rings.	i
