A PRINCE TO ORDER. A. Novel. By Charles Stokes Wayne, 12mo. Pp. 317, New Tork: John Lane, The Bodley Head. tl-60. ,
Here we have still another-modification o£ the Zenda story and one which shows Ingenuity. This time the Prince is really an American broker. His sudden eminence arises from the scientific theories and studies of the learnea and not en- . tirely sane Dr. Schlippenbach, one time tutor to the Crown Prince of Budavia. Dr. Schlippenbach had experimented upon the royal infant with a view to develop in him certain kihgiy qualities—using to that end cunning pills and curious electric machines of his own invention. In consequence of these practices, discovered hy the royal mother, the doctor had lost his place. Not to be outdone, he had taken an early opportunity to spirit away the child, who, however, had shortly died under his hand. Still: Dr. Schlippenbach was not to be beaten. He fled to Amerlca, and after a discreet, number of years set about finding a young: man of distinguished presence as material for a Prince. His eye fixed upon Mr. Carey Grey of New York, whose valet was bribed to assist in the drugging and kidnapping of his master. Grey was conveyed to Dr. Schlippenbach* s house, and the modern kingmaker worked with his batteries till he bleached the patient's hair to a Teutonic fairness, reduced his bump of reverence, and enlarged mightily.-.his selfesteem.	"
By means of the pills he robbed Grey of his memory, and, having forged' documents to prove the changeling was th® missing Crown Prince of Budavia, was on the very edge of placing his manufactured monarch on the throne (the old King being about to die) when death overtook Dr. Schlippenbach himself in Paris, Then the spell was broken. Grey reverted to his own personality, went to bed one night as Prince Maximilian, waked up as Carey Grey. Naturally things were in horrid confusion. He did ! not know a soul about him. He was pre- j tender to a crown to which he had no' right, and ii appeared he had embezzled funds in New York. Moreover, he had been engaged to a beautiful New York girl, and he was supposed to be dead. How he disentangles himself is the story. It includes several sentimental episodes, a royal entry into a capital, a fearful wrestling match in the dark, a hurried railway journey, an escape from a tower, an Irish dragoon officer, a financier, a Chancellor, and Miss Hope Van Tuyl. ,
