New York Times Book licvicw:
The length or brevity of a novel, to which Mr. Allen makes reference in his recent article, seems to one who reads many of these books of little importance so far as the success, or even the popularity, 01* such works is concerned. Two very recent novels, certainly the mcnt talked of, “ The Sccret Woman M and " The Divine Fire,” are of considerable length; indeed, " The Divine Fire '* probably exceeds 300,000 words; yet people are reading these books without regarding the number of pages, although, toward the end, “ The Divine Fire,” with its excessive analysis and subtlety, is certainly a little tiresome. But I think the great point with a novel, as with a play. Is, Is it good and entertaining? IE so, readers will care nothing for locality, period, or bulk.
The shorter novels are not many—those of Mrs. Wharton and a few other readers ; but most of the novels, good and bad, run from 75,000 to 100,000 words or more. The novelist may be as lengthy as he pleases, if only he be not tedious. Two things seem to be growing in cxcess lately—the tendency to overanalysis and to overdescription of scenery. The searching dissection of motives, moods, shades of feeling, and of the current of thoughts in some novels within recent years is extraordinary. Nor is there any remarkable skill needed for this; one might write chapters of this sort of anatomization. To me tho essential seems to be to construct a good story and tell it well—interesting plot, well-drawn characters, flowing movement, and something in the nature of a surprise at the end. For my part, I do not even object to a little touch. _of melodrama, provided always that it is discreetly supplied. There Is melodrama, well kept in hand In “ The Secret Woman,” as there is .in some of Thomas Hardy's books; also in " The Sheep-stealera/* and numeraus other clever novels of rustic life. One of the most successful books of the present year, "The Masquerader,” is drawing-room | melodrama of a distinct type. It is near-i ly as much so as Mrs. Braddon's M Henry , Dunbar/' which it slightly resembles, ali though certainly It is far less clever.
! I should like to add one word of Mr.
, Valontlne'8 new story, " Hecla, Sand-wlth/' of which Mr. Allen speaks. Not only is it a graphic picture of the life in the region where the scenes are laid, but it has the quality which is indispensable to a novel—it holds the reader’s interest. Tho descriptions of scenery are vivid and not in excess, and there is not too much analysts. I can find no serious fault except the ono that Mr. Alien points out— too many characters. The most advanced playwrights, guch as Ibsen, are inclined i to use few figures in the development of their imaginative schemes, and almost any idea can be worked out with a short cast Novelists cannot iio with so few, but there can be no doubt that the fewer the dramatis personae in a story the stronger is our Interest in following their fortunes. In " The Secret Woman/’ which is full of incident and action, the characters comprise scarcely more than half a dozen. For a novel which has no great tragic motive as its basis, such as we find in " The Secret Woman/’ but which is intended more as a simple picture of life and manners in a certain locality, I think Mr. Valentine’s story extremely interesting.
