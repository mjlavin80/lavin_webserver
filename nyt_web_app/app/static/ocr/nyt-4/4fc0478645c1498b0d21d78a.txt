Although it is possible that what we pwe or should owe to the Greeks and their ^obus-t imitators, the Homans, may be inordinately appraised in pertain pseudo-educational quarters, it is good in these days of energy and practical things *to be touched by the fine enthusiasm of one
-	who makes a sane plea for Hellas through il\er finer bequests. Such a plea has now received permanent form through book publication of a series of addresses made i by Prof, Sidney G. Ashmore. He pleads for Hie retention in our.schools of Greek and Latin; he defines the true significance1 of our classical inheritance; and he {jeraonstrates the meaning that. Greek ; tragedy and comedy, Greek archaeology, ■and. the Olympian games have for our
feverish, elbowing, persisrtest, and material existence.	~
If Prof. Ashmore's plea for llie classics ‘ were merely SMft'iciem unto	there
would be nothing yirikinfjly original or inspiring in hi* 1 i t: 1 f ■ hook. He would simply b<* telling th** aesthetic ,or linguistic or rhetorical lover or' the classics What is already known. But Prof. Ashmore goes further. Me siiosvs how a training in the classics may. be responsible for the best work in a material, scientific age. Of the m:my answers to the question,- “ What can the chissk-s do for our intellectual growth that cannot be
done equally well by other agencies? " the following concerning the English method of thinking is pertinent. As we all know, the words in an English sentence are artificially arranged, and an independent study of logic is necessary to arrange the sentences themselves in rhetorical form. With the study of the Greek and Latin languages, logic and rhetoric go hand in hand with the acquirement of those tongues, Hence U16 classical scholar thinks naturally and is enabled more readily to arrange his English forms so as to produce the desired effect than is the student who has been brought tip solely on English “ as she is taught,” and who has been obliged to acquire logic and rhetoric as something pertaining to and yet per so remote from the mother tongue.
The point cannot be too often emphasized that neither Greek nor Latin is a dead language and that the inheritance which we have received from each is among our choicest yet most neglected possessions. All that is vital and permanent in literature can he traced to the Greek; scientific demonstration owes its origin and perpetuation to the Latin mind; in the tragedies and comedies of the Greeks we find the beginnings of all that is shown in the modern drama—in-1 cident, dialogue, tragedy, pathos, and humor^-all magnified expressions of actual Ufe. Even the introduction of steel as an element of architectural construction has not caused us to be utterly unmindful of Greek forms, however theso„ forms, for the time and in the age of eager development, may have lost their harmony by the transitory exigency of practicability. And as to the Greek athletes, their influence is a constant balance wheel to excesses, muscular, sensational, and sordid.
These are some of the things convincingly set forth by Prof, Ashmore. However well it is to he reminded of them in a sane manner, their most essential quality should be seen to lie at the very baso of our modern thought and expression as a striking necessity. No ungrammatical, slovenly English is possible from' the youth who has been brought up on the Greek and Latin classics; and no inharmonfes of work, mental or physical, are possible from one who has absorbed Greek thought and appreciates its posltlon-^in Ufe and culture. Every one who places utility, practicability, and I material gain above everything else, who imagines that these things, are alone worth striving for, may read Prof. Ashmore's book with^proflt to himself and ! to those' tipon whom his works and enterprises cast an influence.
