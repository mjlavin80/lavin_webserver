In publishing; through Longmans, Green -& Co., his book on “ The Historic Martyrs of the Primitive Church,” the Rev. Dr. Arthur James Mason, author of " The Ministry of Conversion," &c., has aimed to present nothing which may not be relied upon as historically true. He has not introduced stories that to him -were of a legendary character; he has endeavored, he writes, to present the stories of the
acts of martyrs during the first three centuries of Christianity in a plain and straightforward manner, with only shell explanations and illustrations as the ordinary reader may require; he has omitted lengthy discussions, unnecessary dates, questions of genuineness, &c.
Tho book contains twenty chapters, and among Mie records that appear in English for the first time are those of St. Polycarp and the martyrs of Lyons, of St. Perpetua and St. Cyprian, of the martyrs of Palestine under Diocletian, and the stories of Mortaaus, Piorius, James and Harlan, and others.
