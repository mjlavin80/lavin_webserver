Once more—and more than ever—Mr. Zangwill has made a play which has fallen into the hands of an actress who. knows how to make it as charming- as lie intended it to he. No doubt he wrote '* Jinny the Carrier/’ performed last night at the Criterion Theatre, especially for
Miss Annie Russell, but other playwrights have written plays for Miss Russell.
It seems, rather, that Miss Russell and this play were made for each other. In the first place, “ Jinny the Carrier ” is a real play, and, in the second place, Miss Russell is perfectly and utterly the Jinny of the play. That Jinny is a happy-hearted, good girl with a lively wit, not quite rustic, and very pretty ways.
She is the carrier of tne countryside, as sole heir of a family of carriers, and goes singing and laughing upon her rounds, with a horn at her belt and a cart and an old gray horse called Methu-saleh. Thfc place: is an English rural neighborhood, and the time " just before the bicycle period of the Victorian era.'*
Miss Russell made her first appearance
(after a winding of the horn without)
driving in behind the old white horse
and the house interrupted the action then
and there to cheer her heartily. Perhaps on this account she didn’t quite get into i her part at first, but she presently did.
and that peculiar homely beauty ot hers fitted in delightfully with the dress and ways of the carrier girl. She was heart-free then, but, pat to the moment, here came romance in the sturdy shape of Will Flynt, a native of those British parts, but fresh from Canada, And Jinny straightway and visibly fell a victim. “ Oh, she’s falling in love with him," whispered a young woman in the orchestra with her eyes fixed on Miss Russell’s changing expressions. Those expressions were eloquent.
Then the young man out of pure vainglory and excess of spirits and the manly teeling he had about a woman doing a tnan:s work set up a coach with two fine black horses with intent to drive Jinny out of business. Prospering, and being soft-hearted, he proposed a partnership— which, because it was only a partnership, Jinny rejected with scorn and smothered invisible tears. Here was another chance —while she imagined the young man had come a c-jurting—for some of Miss Russell’s excellent work in facial expression. Most people in the house in this scene, It’s safe to say, forgot Miss Russell altogether and believed entirely in Jinny. But ft is useless to cite instances; the part
alter the first few words was wOnderfullv real throughout.
As for the plot, it is one as nearly perfect for the purposes of rustic sentimental comedy as could be devised, and it is admirably hanfdled to the end. There’s a satiric touch besides—and some puns and other English jokes—else it were not Zangwill. All the jokes, however, are not English, by any means, though few of them will bear quoting out of tne context. That should mean spontaneity—
but it doesn’t exactly,
The make-ups were without exception tremendously effective, and Mr. Fuller Mellish’s best of all. He was Gaffer Quarles, the village patriarch and Jinny’s grandfather, a wonderful old man with wild gray hair and beard, most violent aged ways and clothed in a smock frock. The part, no easy one, was perfectly conceived. and as perfectly carried out by Mr. Mellish, who managed to convey at once the humor and pathos of it—for It fell in the shifty border-ground between laughter and tears. That, in fact, is where the whole play hangs, inclining always in a crisis to the brighter side.
Among the other players Oswald Yorke played the young man with the coach and black horses creditably, if not always quite convincingly. Sarah McVicker was a spirited village dressmaker of uncertain age and temper, and Kate Meek, John W. Jennings, George W. Wilson, Grant Stewart, and Charles S. Abbe each made an excellent character part tell. It was Mr. Abbe in her Majesty’s service,, (as rural delivery man,) who having spoken scornfully of the sex was struck all of a heap by Jinny's suggestion that the Queen herself was a woman. The house was as kind as could be.
