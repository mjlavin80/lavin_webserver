MAN’S RESPON8IBIUTV: OK, HOW AMD WHY tHG AUIIGBTY INTIiODCCED EVIL UPO\ THIS EARTH. By Tliomaa G. Carson. New York:	O. I*. Putnam'o
Sons, T!ie Knickerbocker Press.
Mr. Carson's book is formidable and full of food for thought. Its scope is- the broadest. He begins by considering the three great facts which perpetually astonish mankind—death, the devouring of animals by other animals, and the eat-istence of evil on earth.
As for the mystery of death he reflects that it extends to all creation. Vast constellations of worlds are continually coming: into existence to pass away and make room for others. While the ultimate destiny of man Is a secret from us* -It is not difficult (in Mr. Carson's view) to see that it would have been marred by earthly immortality. A boundless ennui might have taken possession of man with the lapse of ages. In other words, If Adam had lived till now he might have grown too tired of life to do his duty as a citizen.
Having reconciled us, by lucid argu-, ment, to death, Mr. Carson proceeds to reason on the subject of preying. That, he decides, is a fact which must be accepted, Moreover, tlie sheep and birds and worms are happy until the last moment. " Their want of sufficient reason to discover their true position Is their most precious possession.*’
Man, alas! is not so fiappily endowed, i He knows what will happen if he does i not take care of himself. The goblins will catch him if he does not wateh out! When ; attacked he must strike. Hence combativeness which leads to courage, but afro i to aggressiveness, cruelty, and destruct-j Iveness. Henee evil!
; Mr. Carson goes on to treat of con*
‘ science as an antidote to evil, of the reasoning and observant faculties, of. ambition, the domestic virtues and religious belief. He devotes a chapter to the phil- ' I osophy and science of Darwin, Huxley, j Spencer, and Gall. He writes lucidly of [ heredity and other topics.
I This is all by way of preamble to his : suggestion for the improvement of so-| clety and government. He goes so far i as to declare that there is not a nation | in the world which selects its public
servants for a high moral standard and i a strict sense of duty. Competitive ex-i amination he calls a failure. The way out ! of the difficulty is by phrenological examination. In short, all of Mr. Carson’s i argumen t is to the effect that phrenology is an exact and useful science, and that It should be* used In the government of the world, and the reclamation of man* kind.
