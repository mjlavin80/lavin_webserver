iT has been somewhat pro-rsaically termed “ the dump in poetsy*’ recently, has aroused "an interesting discussion In the pages of a magazine of' criticising ■ ‘ Among 'the various poets ’/contributing their Ideas of the present re-Uattpn between poetry and the public, Miss
■	Peabody is perhaps the' most reflective
•	upon the actual conditions. “ Unquestionably,” she says, '* It Is the poet’s problem how they may manage * to haunt, to startle, and waylay/ In Order to make sure- of some manner of hearing1 before they die. And here it is that the spirits of Noise and Hurry discourage—where they do not cerrupt-~the poets themselves. They are In too gcgat a hurry to be appre-dated. It is not heart-warming to dream on post-mortem successes. They do not wish to wait. But wait they must. And a poet who has something to say Will say .It and bide his time, in stead of saying something else instead.”:: This may very well be an explanation,. and perhaps the chief and best explanation, of the superficial character, of most modem poetry, the absence In\tt ot deep and definite meaning. There is certainly less tendency to ,wait for conspicuous success In any field of action than might have been observed in earlier years, the years of I>ow-ell, of Browning, of Whittier. Moreover, with many delicately cultivated minds a kind of poetic prose is being preferred to poetry, as easier, one may infer, to write, as involving less of the technical expertness positively required for adequate expression In poetry as in painting.
Occasionally, however, we hear familiar notes of frankly stirred, emotion from the older writers inspired by exaltations of mood that naturally are not so common now as in'America’s heroic age. In greeting the latest and last volume of Mr. Chadwick (" Later Poems/’ by John White Chadwick, Boston: Houghton. Mifflin & Co.) we are sadly reminded that one more lover of his country in the simple old-fashioned eloquent sense will no longer write of it with happy zeal for its moral welfare. Many of the-poems.in the new volume are in the nature of occasional verse, arid all of them- no doubt would have passed under his revising'hand had he lived to publish the* volume himself. As they stand, however; they represent the fine warm masculine' * intellect of which they, with many other virtues and "felicities, are the fruit.- The names- of those persons to whonr the commemorative poems are addressed speak- with tbe historic, the patriotic'' note:* Chancing, J Whittier, Julia Ward Howe,- Sherman . Hoar, Emerson, Edward Everett' Hale, all these are names that belong to the past —the’ past of ;a National conscience aroused to effective . effort. and in the* lines dedicated to • *• » - ■ . * * them the reader of the younger generation may feel at least the mild throb of remembered passion. This sonnet shows. that Mr. Chadwick carried his patriotic energy into the times ot plodding peace: tt rings with the old austere accent of high rebuke:	•
Art proud, my country, that these mighty ones,
*	Wearing the Jeweled splendor of old
days,	:
Come bringing prodigality of praise To thee amid thy light of westering suns; Bidding their blaring trumpets and their guns	.
Salute thee, late Into their crooked ways Now fallen; to their sorrow and amaze, Blood of whose hearts the ancient honor runs?	.
Nay, fear them rather, for they cry with
, v She.has become as one of us, who gave All that she had to set a people free'
She wears our Image—she that loved the . slave! ”	•
Pear them, for there Is blood upon their
■	hands,- •	,
And on their heads the curSe of ruined lands.	•
The ode written tor the inaugural of President Roosevelt by Alexander Blair Thaw (" An Inaugural Ode," Monadnock Press,) breathes the same spirit of desire that the American Republic should fulfill its destiny as that destiny has been conceived by the best and finest of its citizens. It Is agreeable to find in a poem tor such an occasion an abstract idea conveyed with dignity and free from silly optimism;
Is this then our life, evermore to rehearse Those tales that are toid Of the people of old, ■ ,
Who were faithless, perverse,
And worshipped strange gods, which they .	wrought	-
With the work of their hands!
Ye who have climbed the heights and .	sought
The Lord’s commands,
The table of that law which sets us free. And, coming from the mountain, as of Old	.
Have, found our god a beast and made of ' • ; gold.1	,	■ ■
SI) r JfeUr jhrkSmtcs
Help us. to see,	■
When the true vision is at last revealed, This is our portion in that promised land! A sacred sofl. to till; a place to stand Against the Philistines; a battlefield Where we must fight and fall; yea, hand . in hand	-	,	.
Fight on, to fall again—but never yield.
A little volume of poems by W. J. Henderson (*' Pipes and Timbrels," Boston, Richard Badger,) contains many lovely lines and a few successful technical experiments. It Is not a collection in which one naturally looks for warlike utterances or even for any special bravery of peaceful patriotism. Pictures, music, dreams, and reminiscences of the classic world are the flowers that grow In Mr. Henderson’s garden, and from these he makes a. most acceptable bouquet of the pretty old-time "mixed" variety. Even he, however, although he can hardly have felt the fire of the civil war in his veins, singa of Gettysburg with retrospective emotion:
There are no dead upon this silent plain Where burst the cohorts of embattled hell
In war’s red noon with thunderbolts of shell;
The charge of Death across yon field was vain.
Still as the Summer on the sleeping main Lie wood and wold, and where the tempest xelP '
Stands many a stone-to say that it was well,
And nevermore or North or South shall refgn.
Aye, here there is no shadow of the grave,
No shroud of pale oblivion, no tear,
-	Nor coffin'd past; nor shall there ever
■v*be,
.For death Is not the guerdon of the
Who conquered death and set their feet on fear;
Upon this plain dwells Immortality. Certainly one could hardly wish for another National crisis to bring reminders of august traditions. and kindle into life the latent worship of country that constantly abides in the spirit of the best of us, but something sturdy and beneficent, firm and gracious, will have gone out of our poetry when we cease to make it from time to time the utterance of the highest and truest patriotic sentiment.
