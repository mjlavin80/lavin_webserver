Judging from his dedication, " To the Ccmmodore and Officers of H, M. S. Tamar,” and from the remark in the introduction that *' these stories * * * were written during three years' service in China,” Mr. Norris is a British naval officer. If he is, we must hope that he may be sent bade to China to go on with his story writing. For he has turned out capital stories, witty, satirical, yet seemingly jumping with facts, even though Ii?
, says the stories are not true. They are , better than true; they are well-found.
There is in them a suggestion of Granville Murray’s " Queer Tales,” and of certain episodes in Gilbert’s " Mikado as when Lung Fook, the Chinese conjurer, suggests that his friend Hong, accused of parricide, make him his heir; but be, comes " greatly moved ” when he learns that the intimate friends of a condemned , parricide also are put to death! "His anxiety to have mo proved innocent became beauiiful to witness. He raved against our national penal code, he wept for the tortures I was soon to suffer, and begged me to think of some means whereby the law might be circumvented.” But the suggestion is only a suggestion; there Is certainly no slavish imitation by Mr. Norris.
Everything in the stories sounds as if it might have happened—in China. In ” Kwa Niu’s Derby " Mr. Norris tolls of the trouble that arose because some Christians had built a church on the head of the dragon on which a town stood, and a schoolhouse on the dragon’s stomach. In “ The Hunchback's Piety,” he tells how a reform Governor of a province found the | prisons "overcrowded to a disgraceful ex- i tent, and the majority of the unfortunate prisoners had not even any crime registered against them. Yeh’s heart bled for ^ them: this shocking state of affairs had to be at once remedied. The idea of keeping1 people in prison for indefinite periods j Without trial revolted Teh's every sense j of what was right and just. He ordered | them, therefore, to be taken out in batches of forty and beheaded. Forty each day till the jails were empty and cleared of ! all. persons wrongfully incarcerated.” ^ There is more In this than mere fooling.
There arc nine stories in the volume—all good, all worth reading and rereading. If ; Mr. Norris can do as well at home as on
