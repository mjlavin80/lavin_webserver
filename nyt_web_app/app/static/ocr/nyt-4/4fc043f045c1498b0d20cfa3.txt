! Whatever .may be the faults of the Bareness Von Hutten’s new rovel, it ful-' fills tho chief end of fiction—it is interesting, even sinfully interesting, for tlie_ sated reviewer himself is so held In its
grip as to be provoked to " language ” when interrupted. It is a book, too, of startling originality; not In its leading situation, as old as history Itself, but In the way in which the characters comport themselves without the socfal pale.
The characters themselves are, for the most - part wonderfully vital. “ Pam ” (for Pamela) is .drawn with great skill, from the moment she appears, a child of ten, with her monkey in her arms, to that which sees her borne from her lover because of his ** curious mistake *r in regard to her convictions' and principles— and a very “ curious mistake * it was for a man of perceptions and of honor. Why is it almost Impossible to cr&ate a satisfactory hero? He simply refuses to live up to the fine things we are asked to believe of him. But “ Pam ” is full of a whimsical charm, of witching mockeries of dimly guessed depths. Of her, much more than of her somewhat colorless mother, might it be said that she has " a devil of a temperament.” We-disapprove of her immensely, but we love her all the same; and we are sure there is a-sec-ond volume in which she found the master key in her hand and “ lived happily ever afte*.”	-
I Lord Yeoland, her grandfather, is another character evidently drawn con a mo re. We are given to understand that he has a variegated pasW of which the less s.’iid the better, but he is one of those rare human beincrs who, having “dined at the House of Folly, do not dispute the bill,” and he has paid £t~In premature age and paintul malady, but with philosophy, humor, and a sunny temper. The relation between him and "Pam M Is one of beautiful congeniality. Into it the author has put her most sympathetic work.
The chief artistic faults of the story are the episode of “ Pam’s ” visit to *‘ Cousin Susie Kennedy," and the bearing of Sach-overel and Pauline Yeoland in regard to their mutual relation. About the former although it gives opportunity for clever
1 portraiture, and for the dawning of *J Pam's ” romance, there Is something distinctly repulsive. As to the latter, fearful lest we should let slip a hint of the plot which none but its author should reveal, we shall only say that, however eagerly a woman may give “ all for love, and the world well lost/’ a thousand daily wincings at the results of her position, at ils^ acceptances no less than its exclusions, must be the lot of every highbred woman with a woman’s intuitions. Compare Pauline Yeoland with Anna Karenina.	.
In her preface the Baroness von Hutten disavows the sentiments of her dramatis personae, or any intention to preach any doctrine whatsover; the book is intended to show life as it is, in defiance, of the comfortable, old-time opinion that evildoers wore always punfshed and -virtue always rewarded in this present world. But books and people are apt to preach in spite of themselves, and to the thoughtful reader “ Pam " holds both an immoral and a moral.
The immoral is that only those who overstep the conventions are truly clever, admirable, and charming; that the vices are alluring, and- the virtues exceeding: dull* '	'	\	,	•-	:	...
And the moral is that, after all, the straight and narrow way is best. In the end of the ends, somebody has to pay the price of the easy path of selfish happiness, and it may chance that the burden I falls upon innocent hearts, who suffer 1 .vicariously.for the-fatal choice of others.
