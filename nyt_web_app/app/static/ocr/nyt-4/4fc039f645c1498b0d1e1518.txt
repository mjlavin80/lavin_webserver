This little story of a case of mistaken identity has the merit of lightness and brevity. A young- attorney is sent out to keep a watch on an erring wife in order to heap up evidence for the divorce courts. I-Iis clues to identification of the lady arc a gray dress, sailor hat, and purple parasol, it would appear that the purple parasol really had no more to do with tho complications which ultimately ensued than the gray dress or the sailor hat, or, for that matter, than-the Indy herself, who also answered the description of the erring Mn. Wharton in so far as she was young and very beautiful.
It is a bright little story which it would be cruel to spoil by he tvav Ins the denouement It can be read in half an hour and hi.>5 very pretty illustrations in color by Itan‘.ton Fisher and decorations in black by Charles B. Falls.
