1ST England, during the period of the Commonwealth, there was a body of men known as the Fifth Monarchy Men, and . they had for leader Thomas Harrison, best known as Major General Harrison. To have at the head of a community of saints a military chief seems incongruous, but it was by his courage and cleverness in warfare that Harrison first rose to distinction. With Oliver Cromwell, he helped to upset the English monarchy, the conclusion of which was the beheading of Charles I. -
Harrison was born in Newcastle under Lyme in the year 1G1G. Harrison belonged to the middle class, his father having been a grazier and batcher, and in accordance with the monarchical ideas of the King1 was therefore of small account. Thomas Harrison was. young when came that period of transition throughout Europe when Protestantism and Catholicism had their bitter struggle. At the Grammar School at Newcastle he received his education and then went to London to be the clerk of a solicitor. There he remained until the fight between, the King and Parliament began. Harrison sl^ed with Parliament, and as there was to be fighting he was enrolled in the bodyguard of the Earl of Essex and put- himself at the head of an army of 20,000 men, who were eager " to crush the King.**
Mr. C- H. Simpkinson does his best to explain that period which is so difficult to make clear. Not in England alone, but in Scotland and Wales differences in belief brought about bitter feelings, to be only assuaged by bloodshed. There always has been fanaticism, and it will always exercise men’s minds. Distinctions between Independents and the Fifth Monarchy were rife. Both were opposed to the rules of the King, but there was a probable chance that had the army of Charles been at once defeated, between Independents and Fifth Monarchists there would have been recourse to arms. Harrison distinguished himself for his bravery and rapidly rose in command. Cromwell placed the utmost confidence in him. He was sent to Ireland, but not liking the service was soon recalled. In 1G4G he was among the new members of the House of Commons. Charles had surrendered and was a captive. The author rehearses the whole story of Parliament, ending with the dls^ missal of the Long Parliament. Harrison, under orders, brought the King to London. On thfi 30th of January Charles was executed. What Harrison was most desirous of undertaking was the establishment of the reign of Saints on earth. Cromwell, who was rather hard-headed, did not pin his faith to the Saints, He was satisfied that the so-called. Saints were not always good or decent personages. As to the Saints, they were inclined toward faction fights. Nothing is more difficult to establish than a religious Utopia. Cromwell^ in a speech of 1634, did not favor the Monarchy Men, for he said: “ The carnal divisions and contentions among Christians, so common, are but the symptoms of the kingdom," He was decidedly of- the opinion that they “ could not govern nations and give, laws to people, and determine of property and liberty and everything else/* In 16G3 the Fifth Monarchy by its own inherent weakness fell to pieces- Harrison, who had for some short period actually ruled England, was deposed. There had been all kinds of devices used to control the army or the navy by one side or the other. It is by no means Impossible that the Lord Protector would not have been deposed. As it was, there were plots directed against Cromwell in which Harrison may have taken part. At any rate* he was frequently put under arrest, and in February was sent to the Tower. In 1£3S Cromwell died and Harrison was released. With the coming of Charles II. mm ft his arrest and committal. There was no chance for him. He was tried as a regicide, found guilty, and executed Oct. 13, 1660. During his trial he showed the greatest courage and met his death like a hero.
In his study of the man. Sir. Simpkinson says that Harrison bad almost reckless courage an€l was remarkably- frank in his speech. He had a powerful will and the author Is inclined to believe that Charles L was executed more by Harrison than hy CromwelL Among the charges directed against him was that of taking advantage of the situation, for Harrison had enriched himself, and the Author adds:
11	The truth of this cannot be denied." For the leader of Saints he had a great love of display, and on grand occasions would wear aU kinds of fine and brilliantly colored garments. No man ever lived who s believed more fully in his own course of action. The conclusion of the volume reads as follows; ~	—
Far from attempting to conciliate his adversaries by a pusillanimous submission, he stoutly maintained that his . course ox
