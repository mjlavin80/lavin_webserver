Mrs. Mary Stewart Cutting, whose " Little Stories of Married Life" made their appearance last year, has now collected all of her talcs dealing with the days ot wooing and issued them under the general title of "‘Little Stories of Courtship.'* Mrs. Cutting never draws her characters from the exclusive circles, butlers and footmen have no place in her tales of plain* everyday, midflle'Class people—people whof are not overburdened with the world’s goods, but who are educated, cultured, and refined—in short, the people we meet daily about us.
The eight stories which make up this volume are very pleasant reading, Indeed. In ** Paying Guests ’’ poor Althea Bennett, who really had no head for business at all, found the road of the boarding-house lceeper a rough one to travel. But for the timely advent of Mr. Conway her story might have spelled tragedy Instead or comedy; as also might that of Anna Lane and I-Iarland Lloyd in " When Love Is Kind.” Harland had been negligent, Anna quHik to resent the fancied slight, and but for the happy chance of a forgetful brother who failed to deliver her scathing note there would have been no wedding bells at the end. Then there Is the story of the wooing of Latimer Lane, Anna’s brother, and Maudie Caswell, and the frightful anguish suffered by the adoring mother of Latimer at the thought that the object of her child’s affections might be the ouious Miss Anemone Slumbruger instead of the gentle Maudie. “ In Regard to Josephine ” Is the story of the difficulties poor Josephine encounters in her own family circle. She dJd^so want the library to herself on that one particular evening, for the faet was Mr. Martin came expressly to read " Lallah Rookh ’’ aloud to her, and interruptions were not conducive to unalloyed pleasure, and so her kind-hearted mother attempted—in vain—to restrain an eager family from bursting in upon the young couple. It was not until, by a happy chance, the laundry took fire that the reading of Moore’s love poem progressed uninterrupted—that is, until it gave place to the telling of Mr. Martin’s own love story.
These and the other stories of the book are all simple fn their theme, but they gain much by Mrs. Cutting’s sympathetic handling of them.
