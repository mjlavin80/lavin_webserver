GLANCE over the life of the Marquis of Dufferin and Ava suggests; a£ once'the
thought that he was a favorite of fort* ;> une, almost to the close. He was horn to the heritage of a title and a fine tate; he was educated at Eton^and ford:	he received honorary degrees from	|
ford, Cambridge, Harvard, Dublin, Glasgow,^ Mk^l; gill, Laval, the Pun.taub, and Edinburgh Universities; he was Lord in Waiting to the Queen, attach^ at Vienna, Commissioner to Syria, Under Secretaty^ of State for India, Under Secretary for Wag Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and Pay-*-., master General, Governor General of Canada,-Ambassador to Russia, to Turkey, to Italy, and to •, France; he was Governor General to India, Lord, Warden of the Cinque Ports, and Constable of Dover Castle, Lord Rector of St. Andrew's and ot -Edinburgh, Vice Admiral of Ulster, and Honorary Colonel in the army. Moreover, he was yachtsman, =. traveler, successful author, popular orator, and av statesman who seldom failed In any task assigned, to him. Such honors and successes have come toothers; but he was pee^iarly happy in this, that there was a charm j.bout his personality which, seemed to make even his opponents friends. . His' father’s family belonged to the class that has dominated Ireland, against the interests of the people; but through his mother, who was of a different type, he came into kinship and sympathy with fell o his countrymen; and no doubt the influence of his -wife strengthened the maternal traits and tendencies. He was a landowner who strove against the reform of the Irish system ot land tenure; but he \ was so good a landlord that peasants and farmers forgave him for identifying his own generous policy with an evil system. He was a Liberal, but he opposed Gladstone’s most important measure for better ■ government in Ireland; and yet his chief remained hlsffriend, advanced him to the highest offices, and intrusted, him with vast responsibilities,.\ He never turned Conservative; and yet Disraeli sent him as*,' Ambassador to St. Petersburg. ' . Hostility - to the ; Liberals on a special measure neither compelled him~> to break away nor brought about his political ruin,.; but opened the way "for service abroad/' However -party strife raged, he passed for the most part uncensured, for he was associated with the national in-tereste as against foreign’ interests. He was mired by the workman and the noble; he was at once ~ a man’s man and a woman's man.	■	.	.	:
No doubt because of this general good:will the opinion has grown up that his success was due lo^|< amiability and pliancy rather than to hard work, jor native strength; and we conceive of Dufferin.as^ the typical Ii^sh gentleman, courteous, kindly, able, honorable, arid full of gayety and coiirage, but drifi-:; ing carelessly as 1t were into ^easy-achievements. It'V is the'fault of this biography,that, .while it does not ' acquiesce in this conception pf Dufferin. it gives no . clear and vivid picture to take the place of It. We/:'! waver in our opinion of his personality not because. V of the suggestion of doubts,- but because of the dim- < ness of the light. It - is the distinct merit of the/1 .book, on the;’other hand, .that,it dwells in detali on -Dufferln's official labors and gives to the reader an impression of important things admirkbly done; so " that where one looked for the! story of a charming nobleman^ he finds the serious and* strenuous record / of an able diplomat. _The .effect, after a momeatwV; disappointment, is fresh and interesting,“and one; is ; tempted to consider some of the tasks which the hero 1 of the book accomplished for his country.

//of the Preach "nation; they 'had: been for • several-centuries ■ tinder the protection of ' /France,. and even; when Bonaparte was : laying siege to Acre he seat fils secretary : to* the itaronites to greet them as ‘‘ French citizens from time immemorial."'
. : In':May,; I860,, a conflict between the Druses and the Maronttes came, and the - Christians were scattered and slaughtered; and In July there was a riot in Damascus, the Moslems burned the whole Christian quarter and kilted men, .'women, and children, the soldiery; actually taking: part and mur-rderlngr ;many who had surrendered for. ^protection and given up their arms.
-' /On' the first news of the disorder-France proposed a commission, repre-' tEent5iig,.the leading powers of Europe,-to investigate the matter, and asked con' sent/ in the meanwhile, to send troops 'Sbrrhu '/• Great Britain alone refused to acquiesce la the scheme, hut the calam-/ityv at Damascus made it necessary to act at once, and with energy; and so the British Ministry consented that French.
•	troops should land at Beyrout, and determined to join in a convention appoint-Jag a joint commission. Dufferin was made their representative; and a member of-the Government said that the sweetness of his manners combined with the firmness of his good sense would triumph over every difficulty. "While he conciliates he will not be hoodwinked, and. he is peculiarly well suited to deal with, our ally. He is so unassuming that he never gives offense, he is so true that a Frenchman would scruple to deceive him, .and this is my beau ideal of an: English diplomatist”
/ His, task was very difficult He had to /aid in punishing the murderers, and yet maintain English, prestige with the Turks; he hair to thwart French ambition in tbe East, -and yet not seem to betray the cause ot the oppressed Christians and disregard the interests of modern civilization; he had to befriend the Sultan and >et deal severely with some of his official representatives. Had he been only a politician he might have overreached himself ' and put Great Britain .in a false position; /had be been simply a sentimentalist he .Ihight have become the mere tool of his comrades on the commission, but he was both politician and sentimentalist, and so .he could be true to himself, serve the interests of his country, stand for righteousness, and still win the regard of his associates.
. The future security of Syria was of course the greater problem of the commission. The British member insisted on the Withdrawal of the French troops; the stench Commissioner urged the appointment of a Maronite chief as ruler of the mountain region, with a tenure of office for life; as a counter-proposition Dufferin ■’suggested the appointment of a Governor over the whole province of Syria, with "Viceregal powers, and the Turkish Commissioner objected vehemently to such a scheme, as loosening imperial authority. The. natural result was a compromise, "-one of. the many makeshifts that have "postponed the final settlement of the Turkish question and given opportunity for a succession of massacres and wars.
A Christian Governor was to be appointed for the Lebanon district, mixed tribunals were constituted, and administrative councils were established. The French troops left Syria in May, 18G1, and the French General in departing kissed Dufferin on both cheeks, for he had been charmed by the adversary who had baffled his military ambition.
His course met the approval of the Brit. Ish Ministry, and the Queen awarded him .generous praise. His work was regarded as highly successful because, though there was little of a permanent value In the compromise, it served, without dishonor, the far-reaching polity of his country in the East There is no attempt at conceal-meht of the fact that England's jealousy of France rather than the ultimate good of Christians subject to Moslem ruxe shaped the result, and Sir Alfred Lyail, who gives the story of the negotiations in detail, says that he has dwelt on it as a lesson in the sinister school of Turkish statecraft still worth studying, though it had been forgotten by the European Cabinets, whose half-hearted Intervention brought about the Armenian massacres of 1893 and 1SDC. He regards it as a standing example of the “astuteness and au-.dacity with which a weak Oriental ruler can elude the pressure of all civilised Europe,” and evade retribution by his “ skill in fomenting jealousy among the powers. This looks like a simple device, but it has served to make the Turk master and the Christian a slave in the East for several generations. None the less Duf-ferin’s tact in a difficult emergency made his diplomatic reputation.
His second important task had in its accomplishment far more of permanent value, for it gave him a part to play ;n furthering the success of a great piece of constructive statesmanship. He w?<o appointed Governor General of Canada in .1S72. At that time the Dominion had been formed under the British North American act of 18G7; British Columbia had joined the confederation in 1871, and Manitoba had become legally a province in 1SG9, though it had to pass through the Riel rebellion before an actual union. Only Prince Edward’s Island and Newfound—1 land'remained outside the Dominion, More-
over, the; law authorizffig the Canadian Pacific. Railroad had been passed, though , nothing had been done'toward its con--strucffon, In; a word,__the frameworlt for a splendid .confederacy, had been com-/ pleted, but the family spirit-of the polit-leal household/remained to be created.
I Canada had long been practically at a standstill in development, or at least apI parently at a standstill, when its progress was measured by the.rapid growth of the United States.	/
i It was plain that this country, emerging J triumphantly from the civil war, was to be j master of the New World; the opinion of many leading men in Great Britain was that the empire could not keep Canada as a colony* if it would, and should not if it could, and there was a feeling that the colony was of no great value, that it might involve the nation in a quarrel, that it would be difficult to defend/ and that in case of a foreign war it could give no help. There was a strong element in the Canadian population almost fanat* ically loyal to Great Britain, but multitudes looked for independence or union with the United States as the natural destiny of the Dominion. There was comparatively Httle social or commercial Intercourse, and British capital was mainly invested in enterprises elsewhere. Contempt on the one side and distrust on the other flourished in mutual ignorance, aa weeds that love darkness. It is not too much to say that the personality of Dufferin was an element in bringing about a change of sentiment and opinion. It was at once his policy and his delight to glorify both Canada and Great Britain/ especially in their relationship to each other.
He was welcomed warmly in Canada, and his lavish hospitality, his quick appreciation of Canadian life and character, and his adroit administration of affairs added to * his popularity, and so the people who grew to love him and trust him were as ready to listen to his praises of imperial patriotism as to his enthusiastic descriptions of Canadian scenery and his glowing anticipations of Canadian glory in the future.	^
There was no note of imperial condescension to the provincial in his tone; he spoke as one of themselves. And while never throwing contempt on the Ideal of independence or the ideal of union with the United States, he sought to turn Canadian aspirations toward a more complete association \yith the British Empire as the nobler destiny. In the comments of the press of America and Europe one could almost hear this feeling of household loyalty growing. In May, 1875, the Governor General visited England, and in a speech in London'he sald;
If there is one special message which a person in my situation is bound to f™*. Canadian to the- English people it Is thls^that they desire to maintain intact and, unimpaired their connection with this country, that they cherish an ineradicable conviction of the value of the political system under which they live, and are determined to preserve uncontaminated all the characteristics of England's prosperous policy.
He was fairly entitled to make this statement; and this Is said without a touch of predisposition toward the policy which he represented, for the writer has no doubt that it will pass away in due time. Nature has traced other boundaries than those laid down by the politicians: the tendencies to free communication will override our artificial barriers; close association will subdue tradition and prejudice; and the destiny of Canada, union with this country, will be fulfilled—to the married calm of States,” and tli« harmony and prosperity of a continent
In February, 1879, Dufferin was appointed Ambassador to St. Petersburg, but be did not take up his residence -there until the following Autumn, and his first official reception was on Dec. 3, 1870. Ha was too late, therefore* for any share in the brilliant successes won by British diplomacy at the close of the Busso-Turkish war, and he saw Russia flushed with victory in a great cause, and vet embittered by the loss of prestige In a peace without honor, for the Czar, with the ncrvelessness of his house, had withdrawn the triumphant army, already in the suburbs of Constantinople, and surrendered the great prize of the East, long desired, and at ia$t within hfs grasp.
It was the era of the first Nihilist outbreak, and the British Ambassador, almost within the scope of some of the attempts at assassination, wondered at the imbecility of the Russian police, about whose cunning the novelists have told so many strange tales. He had parted from Alexander II. shortly before ihat monarch was killed, heard the sound of the fatal bomb, and was at the palace a few minutes afterward.
He was disgusted with St. Petersburg and Its atmosphere of conspiracy and terror, and he left it In April, 18S1, to go as Ambassador to Constantinople, where the real difficulties as to the practical application of the Berlin treaty were to be encountered. It was not long before an issue rose which put the* enforcement of the terms of tho Berlin treaty in tho background. The revolt of the Egyptian army under Arab! Bey against the foreign control of the-country began, and, so far as diplomatic : skill could influence the course of events In such an emergency, .Dufferin made the
wy /tpr the English occupatlonof
Egypt:	’/';;/ .'• •'-//• /'■• '// •// • /•'
The Sultan: insisted upon asserting that sovereignty over, that country to .which he -was legally entitled; he:secretly favored, as patriots, Arab! Bey and his associates/who were called rebels, and as he had deposed Ismail Pasha and appointed TewXik as Kb6dive at the dictation of tho European powers, he /proposed to depose the latter of his'own motion) send troops to Egypt and turn reformer. France and England Issued an identical note of warning against any interference with the conditions established there,-and then waited for the Khfidive, .who was virtually in the hands of the revolting officers, to make good his authority. A conference of the powers,. represented by their Ambassadors, was called at Constantinople, and the Sultan sent a Commissioner to . Egypt in order to maintain his sovereign prerogative.
The conference decided upon two things: First that the Sultan might send troops to Egypt on the condition that /he would act simply as the agent of the. powers, and, second, that all measures taken there were to be settled upon by the powers, save in an emergency, when the dom-lnant force might act independently. The Sultan met the first- proposition with a stubborn protest && he denied the right of outside dictation and hoped to regain the mastery of Egypt. The second proposition, which was a signal triumph of Dufferin’s diplomacy, opened the gate of opportunity for his country. July 11, 1882, tho British fleet bombarded Alexandria, and the Ministry which had been merely drifting toward a policy sprang at once into activity and dispatched an expedition to Egypt without the co-operation of other powers.	^
It has been commonly supposed that Dufferin merely delayed action on the part of the Sultan, through easy devices, until his own country could strike a decisive blow, but hlk biographer denies the imputation and asserts that he achieved success through foresight and resolute action, not through any series of petty subterfuges. He aimed at two things—to prevent the Turks from -wriggling out of the international restraints on their independent action, and to secure “ for his own Government, so far as the conference was concerned, liberty of action without wounding the susceptibility of any foreign power,” In both purposes he succeeded and cleared the way for the occupation by England of one of the key positions of the world*
In November, 1882, he was sent to Egypt then under English control, to undertake the task of reorganizing the Government of the country. He was, for a time; in reality the IvhGdlve; and Tewfik, when called to account by the Sultan for what was going on, sent many protestations of loyalty, but remarked that all orders came from Dufferin, and be was merely the instrument of transmission. As British Commissioner he restored order and made a valuable report on a permanent system of administration. With the subsequent disastrous military movements he had nothing to do.
In August 1SS4, Dufferin was made Governor General of India, and In that great sphere of activity he did much to add to his reputation'as an able administrator.
From this brief sketch of certain important public duties which Dufferin carried out one is inclined to think that his services heretofore have been underrated rather than overrated, and that his reputation as a statesman will be greater hereafter than at present; so that after the perusal of this biography there will be little disposition to cavil at the eulogy of Lecky on the subject of it: • “ He was a great diplomatist and a great statesman; a man who possessed to a degree* that was hardly equaled by any of his contemporaries the qualities of brilliancy and the qualities of charm; a man of unequaled tact and versatility, and who combined with these gifts a rare sagacity of judgment and a singularly firm and tenacious will." Moreover, as has appeared already, he carried out great works easily, and seldom roused antagonism.
