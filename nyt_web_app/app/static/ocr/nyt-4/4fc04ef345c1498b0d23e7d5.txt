A writer in The London Saturday Review' makes the odd point that Mr. Rudyard Kipling sometimes writes for engineers as ho other author has written since engineering began, and that reviewers condemn him because they do not understand engineering. His inference is that the reviewers are wrong, but if his premise i& correct we fancy they are in the right. It is surely the province of a reviewer, as interpreter between author and reader, to condemn unintelligibility in others and to be intelligible himself. An engineer, to be sure, might be employed as a reviewer/ but then the readers would not understand the review. In the present state of the world's culture no large body of people—and Mr. Kipling surely writes for the many—can be assumed to have special knowledge on any subject. We are inclined to think that Mr. Kipling's self-constituted advocate is all in the wrong, however, and that Kipling's writings are never overburdened with a display of purely technical knowledge. He writes for engineers as he writes for everybody else.
