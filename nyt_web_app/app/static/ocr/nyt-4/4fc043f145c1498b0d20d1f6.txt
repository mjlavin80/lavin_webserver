Volumes VI. and VII. of " A History of All Nations,” edited by Prof. John H. Wright of Harvard University, are to appear immediately through Lea Brothers & Co. of Philadelphia. Both volumes are by Prof. Julius von Pflugk-Harttung, the well-known German historian. Volume
VI., on " The Great Migrations," deals j with the ** paleontology “—the fossil and ; geological remains—of prehistoric times. The author shows how all Europeans are members of the Aryan race, who during the prehistoric ages swept from Asia Into different sections all over the Continent of Europe.
Volume VII., on "The Early Middle Ases," Is divided Into two books—" The , Western People ’* and “ The Orient in the Early Middle Ases.” Prof. Pflugk-Hart-tung here gives the story of the Pranks who settled in Gaul, or Francia, and of
the Lombards who established themselves in Lombardy; the conversion of the Pranks and Lombards to the Catholic faith, the uprising of the Lombards against the temporal rule of the Pope, and tlielr defeat at the hands of the Pranks.
Throughout the volumes are many illustrations, including numerous fac-simile reproductions of old prints, a fac simile of a page of the Codex Argenteus of Ulfilas’s Gothic translation of the Bible, a reproduction in colors of a page from Gregory of Tours’s "History of the Pranks,*' and other reproductions.
