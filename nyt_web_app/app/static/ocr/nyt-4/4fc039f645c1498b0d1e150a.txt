In his latest bqok, a work of encyclopedic dimensions and detail, Prof. Hous-tcn presents to the reader a popular description of the almost innumerable applications of electricity in the world of to-day. He seems to have omitted nothin?, from the great utilities of the arc light, the trolley, and the telegraph to the purely academic laboratory experiments performed by -professors for the entertainment of students. Every form of storage or generating battery Is described and illustrated; every telegraphic instrument and alphabet in serious use is carefully and lucidly discussed, and the history and development of electro-metallurgy is given from Its inception to the present day In the fullest and most satisfactory manner. The discussion of calorimetry and pyrometry, or the determination of high temperatures, is clear and interesting.
In the introduction Prof. Houston follows an average citizen through his day's routine, showing the countless ways in which modern life is simplified and at the same time rendered more complex by electricity—by the trolley, the high-speed elevator, the electrically driven press, the stock ticker, the local and long-distance telephones, the wired and wireless telegraph, the weather forecasts, and so on. The household applications are hardly less numerous or less fully treated. These include lighting, the electric heater, the electrically driven sewing1 machine, the resistance-coll flatiron, the electric piano player, and others of less common use. The list Is endiess. No walk of life but has its elcctrical appliances. Each is described as fully as a popular presentation will permit, and without a confusing maze of intricate detail. The style is clear and pleasant, and the illustrations show what the legends lead one to look for. Abstruse technicalities are carefully avoided, and no part of the book will be difficult of comprehension for the average well-informed man who has made no specialty of electrical subjects.
