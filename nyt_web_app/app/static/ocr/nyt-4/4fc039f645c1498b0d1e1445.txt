“ America:	Its Importance In the
World’s Commerce, and Its Economic Relations to Germany, - Particularly to Hamburg," is the translation of the formidable title of a book edited by Prof. von Halle and published by the Hamburg1 Boersenhalle. It contains chapters on " Hamburg and America," by Prof. von Halle; “The United States and North American Competition,*' by JDr. Paul Ren6 Kucynski, Director of the Statistical Bureau of Elherfeld; “The Development of Shipping Between Hamburg and the United States,’* with special consideration of German general trade, by Dr. K. Thiess; “American Agriculture.” by Dr. Kurt Wiedenfeld; “Industry, Labor Conditions, and Trusts,” by Dr. L. von Wiese und Kaiserswaldau; “ Inner Traffic,” by Dr. Alfred von der Leyen, and “ Banks~
and Banking,” by Dr. Henry Crosby Emery. There is also a chapter on Canada by Dr. Waldemar Zimmermann, another on Central America by Arthur Dix, and several articles by well-known authorities on South American countries and on the Panama Canal.
Prof. von Halle says that while America has Ufccome of growing importance to Hamburg commerce and to German trade, the tendencies of its development for the [ future can in no way be considered fa-[ vorable. A fortunate condition for Gcr-| man commerce, however, is the establishment of banking institutions in fc'outh
America, Independent of English credits. Speaking of American competition in agriculture, the writer who deals with the subject says that it has come to seriously j affect the world’s agricultural market.
! f)T course even worse is the competition in the line of industry, although 'for itself the United States, by its manufact-i.ring enterprises, is now able to supply
■	its own home market. On the subject of trusts the book says mat their history i3 net only billed w*th chapters of conur.cr-vial energy, but also"with corruption and dishonesty. As regards railroad traffic i» tho TTnited States, it is asserted that lh»* gii;;intic construction of roads, foi-Iow«M hy TiulGen restriction of buildiag operations, and the favoritism shown to ccitain shippers shojv that with all the great advantages of American traffic, there are also light and shades.
One of the most interesting chapters is cl'at on the Fanama Canal, by Dr. An-dicas Vogt. He says that although *he Uniied Sratcs is looking out for its own interest, ucvtiEtheless it renders a service to European States by establishing a canal in competition with the Suez CanpJ, and thus opening a new way to East Asia. He- adds that while the' work mutt bo Ocr-e by the United States, it should not be forgotten that Europe has a \ltal Interest that the canal Is not confined to American commerce, by the . establishment of prohibitive tonnage rates Or by an imperial policy exclusively only in the interest of the former country. “The
Panama Canal/' he declares, "must remain strictly neutral, and it 3honId be the duty of European policy to conserve this condition.”	■
