The G reat French Hn morist, Mon-vtaigne, and Others Dealt With in Mr. WfeiMey’s “Literary .	-	Portraits*”*	'
JR. CfUSlLES "WHIBLEY’S “ Literary Portraits ’ ’ treats mostly of the. French writers of - three [ centuries ago, tn-Y eluding Rabelais and.* .'Montaigne, and these ^' Portraits/* partake of the charr acteristics of wrays. Of all'the ■■art-. Icles, ; the one devoted ...to the creator of Gargantua and Pantagruel 13 the most striking: . Some of the difficulties of appreciating: Rabelais aw the differences of language—that .is,, for the, Anglo-Saxon. To get close to Rabelais the reader must -be acquainted with the quips and turns and the slang of the* sixteenth century. ' Added to that there Is to be considered what was tHe morality of the past* There is no. question but khat the morality of the Curate of iteudon'and his little respect for re-ligian may render his writings unpalatable.' .For all that, Coleridge, writing concerning Rabelais, classed him “ with the creative minds of the world—Shakespeare,
Dante, and Cervantes.’*
If Cervantes laughed out of existence Spanish chivalry, Rabelais roared at all the toibles^of a world. To class him in any way with the elegant Erasmus does not seem possible, though Mr. 'WWbley writes that,. comparing the arms of the
■	two, " the one pressed home the rapier’s point, the other laid about him with a bludgeon.” The impressions left by a Voltaire and a Rousseau are special, but It is questionable whether the effects, of their writings have been' as effective or as widely diffused as those coming from Rabelais. There may be apparently no
■	philosophy in Gargantua, but his joyous hilarity effaces the snivel and has helped humanity to wade through the Slough of Despond. There cannot be found a warmer, advocate of Rabelais than is the author of ** Literary Portraits.** One thing Mr. Whibley does is to show that-Rabelais was a wonderfully erudite personage, brim full of the knowledge of the past, and " who in his busy life played the many and diverse parts of scholar, priest, doctor, courtier, and humorist." Indulge in the heartiest guffaws when you read of Gargantua, but try to remember that Rabelais fought a long and bitter battle for Greek learning and was accused of heresy on that account. To put it briefly, the Revival of Learning is as much due to Frangols Rabelais as to Erasmus.
There is some little doubt as to the year of Rabelais’s birth, presumably it was in 1483. He first saw the light in that garden of France, Touraine. It was in that province that Descartes and Balzac were born, and the author calls Balzac “ the truest historian of modern France." The father of Frangols, so it is told, was the keeper of a hostelry, and as Rabelais was the youngest of several brothers, he was educated for the Church, and became in time a Grey Friar in the Monastery of Fontenay-le-Comte. As far as learning was concerned, the young man read on all subjects, and was able to discuss such topics as magic, alchemy, geometry, and philosophy. Above all, he was devoted to the acquisition of Greek. Because he delighted in Homer, the ire of the fanatics ■was all ablaze, and ho was finally dismissed from the monastery. Fortunately, there came a special indulgence from the Pope, and he went to LigugS and continued his studies there. Then he turned his steps to Lyons, at that time a great centre of learning, and, more than that, the city where books were published, and “ he threw himself heart and soul into the proper business of Lyons—the editing and printing of books.”
Rabelais became a bookseller’s hack. He read proofs, and manufactured prefaces, and worked on almanacs, and in the compiling of almanacs Benjamin Franklin followed him. The leading publisher of that time was Sebastian Gryphius. Rabelais wrote several medical books, showing his classical knowledge, but soon deserted the field of scholarship, and took to working in the line of what Mr. Whibley calls the “ larger-world of eternal gayety.” So he contrived trivial chap-books, “which the people loved,” and with no better motive for the work than to supplement a modest income. Though mere fragments remain of many of the almanacs wKich we owe to his pen, there is enough to prove their worthlessness. In vain we look for any hint of tae real Rabelais, we find nothing more characteristic than a casual quotation from the classics. With a chap-book of 1533, the career of Rabelais begins,	-
The title is 1 Pantagrueline Prognostication,” and the author gives his name ” Alcofribas Nasier,” an anagram, and it is dedicated to the “eiddy brained and weather-wise "Would-be’-*/’ That publication and others of the same sort brought dewn on Rabelais many enemies. Rabelais was called “ the drunken buffoon,
