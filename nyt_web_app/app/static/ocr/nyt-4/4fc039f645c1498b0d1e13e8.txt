ALMANACS.
Robert Bai’ey Thomas’s Old Farmer’s
-	Almanack of Nearly One Hundred Years Ago.1*-1
ROUND n. series of almanacs known as the ” Old Farmer’s Almanack.” Mr. George Lyman Kittredge has written an interesting; volume. With such a nucleus the material is superabundant. Robert Bailey Thomas, the author, or editor, of this particular almanac, was born near Shrewsbury in 1TG6. He was a fairly well-educated man, with a taste for mechanics. He kept school, but later took to bookbinding. Thence to bool: selling1 was but one step. He moved to Boston. The first issue of his almanac was of the latter part of 1702, in time for the year 1793. A fac simile of the title page of this almanac is presented and reads. “ Fitted to .the town of Boston, but will serve for any of the adjoining States." The assurance is given that the publication is “ New, Useful. and Entertaining.” Thomas put no fuith in astrology, and precluded all prophecies. Even at the close of the eighteenth ceritur>; there were many apparently inteiiigent Americans who believed in seers, and in New England astrologers were paid to cast horoscopes. This seems to have been particularly customary in order “ to determine the exact day and hour in which a vessel should weigh anchor for* an important voyage." In England the wonderfully silly prognos^ ticalions of Partridge and Badbury were believed in. Swift ridiculed these soothsayers. These predictions even exist today, as may be read in the fustian to be found in Zadkiel and Raphael,
Attention is called to the pictorial portion of the Farmer's Almanack. On the title page of the first number there is a man in knee breeches, who is plowing. There were at first only verses used for
the months, Utter little woodcuts were added. For insta_nco. for January. 1801.
a man is skating and a boy spinning a top on the ice. For May there is a fisherman, evidently bent on catching trout. Thomas, who had cultivated his father’s farm, was fairly well posted in agriculture, and so prints many directions as to the care to be given	to the homesteads. In October
this may	be read: “ Harvest 3'our Indian
corn without delay—or the birds and squirrels, I am confident, will.’* Relative to cider, the same authority writes:
Cyder finish milking as soon as possible.
:	To have	it fine and clear grind the ap!	pics the	evening previous to laying it
up, lay It i:p early In the morning and press It out moderately.
Here Is the soundest advice given at the | end of the year 1703.
Remember, ye wealthy and affluent, the sons and daughters of arfliction and dls-
! tress! Think of those into whose shattered dwellings poverty enters to increase the inclemency and the horrors of the present season. Distribute bread to the hungry, and clothes to tho naked. Discharge all the debts you have contracted the last year with mechanics, shopkeepers, laborers, before the ne^r year com, mences.'
There are some matters In connection with maple sugar which will be novel to many readers. Throughout the entire series of Thomas's Almanack the subjecX of home sugar-making is presented. He writes in 17C4: " If you have maple trees, and have- to buy sugar in the Summer, yon pay too dear for your rattle. * * • Make j'our own sugar, and send not to the Indies for it. Feast not on the toil, pain, and misery of the wretched.” As eariy as 1753 Samuel Hopkins of Springfield pub-llshed a lengthy note on maple sugar. He ev^n suggested that rum could be made from it, and so molasses and sugar from the West Indies would not be wanted, j During the Revolutionary War there was trouble about procuring sugar. In 1791 1 Dr. Benjamin Rush read a paper before ■ the American Philosophical Society on maple sugar. He hoped that ,the homemade sugar would supplant the West Indian sugar, and he “ imagined that the home production would end in the .emancipation of the slaves.''	'
In the Almanack Thomas advertised the books he had for sale. Here is a partial list of them:	" Female Policy Detected,"
“French Convert,” “History of the Bible,” " Seven Wise Masters,” ** Robinson Crusoe/' Tom Thumb's Exhibition," "New Tear’s Gift/’ !* Little King Pippin/’ *' Mountain Piper/' wltti a number of other small, entertaining histories. A-subject treated by Thomas was “.the prevention and extinction of fire." One of the instructions reads:
Never read in bed by candle light, especialy if your bed be surrounded by curtains. Strictly forbid the use of sugars In your family at all times, but especially after night. * * * There-is good reason to<suppose a house was lately set on fire by a half-consumed segar. which " a woman suddenly threw away to prevent being detected in the unhealthy and offensive practice . of smoking.	-
To carry fire In any way through tbe streets of Boston was considered a penal

offense, even up to 1780, when the restriction concerning smoking cigars was repealed. Many years later Thomas ridiculed the smoker in this manner. Bobby was smoking a real Spanish. “ Whiff! *’ see tho columns as they roll away and bring to view his bumps of self-esteem. Poor Bobby, how changed from a right-down, plain, honest plough-jogger to a tippy-dazzlem-fogo-combustible! ”
There are many receipts given, and among them the method of producing coffee. with potatoes. There is printed also a way of scaring off erows from the corn by means of old worn-out shoes. In 1811 Thomas expatiates on the necessity of having good soldiers, and gives information of what are the duties of the militia. Mr. Kittredge calls attention to the many phrases in English which are obsolete or archaic to-day as " a flash in the pan/’ or " hoist with his own petard.” In the time of the Farmer's Almanack the young soldier was subjected to a fine unless he had with him " tw'o spare flints, priming wire, or brush."
Stagecoach routes, the hotels, all had their place in the Almanack. Here is the announcement of the stage from Boston to New York:
Mail stage sets off from King’s Tnn, Market Square, every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 10 o'clock in the morning, and arrives at New' York every Thursday. Saturday, and Tuesday al_ 1 o’clock in the afternoon; leaves NeW'Tork every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 11 o'clock in the morning, and arrives at Boston every Thursday, Saturday, and Tuesday at 1 o’clock In the afternoon.
Besides books, Thomas sold stationery, and among his wares were “ Superfine and common Fools Cap, superfine and common Pot of various prices." He offers, •* Dutch Quills by 100, Black and red Ink, Powder and Ink, Pewter and Lead Ink-stands, Ink Pots, of different makes. Wafers in Boxes, Blank books for cypher* ing. Slates and Slate pencils, Cards, Spectacles, Brass Dividers." You may stray ever so far with the Farmer's Almanack, and still not follow all the roads indicated. In 1S4G Thomas died, after completing Ills fifty-fifth number of the Almanack.
