THE FIFTH CENTURY.
Unfinished Lectures of Prof. "Freeman Revised by York Powell and T. S. Holmes.*
HE editors have done well to stylo- t*ie late Prof. Freeman's "Western Europe in the Fifth Century" an aftermath. It has been gathered up by many hands. Left as an unfinished series of lectures by the death of its author, it was passed for revision to the late York Powell. But that careful scholar was not to finish the, work of hitj friend, and It received its final editing from Mr. T. Scott Holmes, who contributes a brief preface. A pathetic Interest is therefore attached to this volume, which Us author and first oditor did not live to see, which comes to us, as it were, by mortmain, and dealing with Kings and Captains dead and long forgotten, now makes its appeal to their successors.
Though the late Regius Professor left another fragment, " The History of the Eighth Century,” students will regret that no finished'work can now come to them from the hand of this so productive and able master. For, unlike Lord Acton, his compeer m Cambridge, his written wort is of considerable volume. It covers many ..fields. In fact, very little in the domain of history was alien to him, and though he stems to have concerned himself most with the development of England and those phases in tho stories of European nations that most affected England, he could treat authoritatively subjects as diverse as the Byzantine Empire, Federal Governments in Greece and Italy, comparative politics, the general history of Europe. Venice and her subject lands, certain aspects of American political history, and contemporary problems of many kind? In many fields.
With so many interests, such great knowledge, and occasionally so spirited and controversial a manner, he could not fail to be an interesting character. Broader and more catholic in hia tastes than now seems customary for most4*te-toriaDS, he was ever ready to see and publish the excellencies in the achievements of his predecessors; as in the present volume, he ia willing to accept with but slight discounts much of Gibbon. He ! has also pome praise for Tillemont, and j much for Clinton and Fauriel. Yet he accepted nothinp blindly, and very little 1 eodd be allowed to remain in the status 1 of mere opinion. Either it v;n.a false or it 1 became for him conviction. ■ In short, he was somewhat prone to dogmatize. As a
■	historian, however, he was modern in that he spared no pains to arrive at the fact. | Evidence was never to be disregarded 1 even in actions of minor import for proba- 1 bllity. He everywhere attempts to ascertain exactly what happened at each par- 1 ticular juncture, and though he was fond : of threshing his authorities, sifting his ashes as it wore in public, he never failed fo construct an accurate and interesting narrative.
As Regius Professor of History at Oxford, a post which he filled for nearly | twenty years, he believed it his duty to | slum- that European history was one ■ unbroken tab, aim guided by this sane | principle of interpretation he not only hiou^iii into the jfcope of modern history, but also illuminated, much that was once a Unwed to lie apart and in darkness. It i3 perhaps to ihis catholic appreciation
ili.u we are indebted for his work on periods like th“ fifth and eighth centuries^ : long disregarded by historians and left ;*s an almost unbridgeable ehasm between t!i<' ancient and modern worlds. It was unfortunate, however, that so able a historian should ah;*> have felt it the par* ticular duly of his chair to show, as he says in a pass\igi* whose tenor alane would invite controversy, thai “ Englishmen are Englishmen." It is somewhat difficult at first blush to eatrh his meaning. It becomes apparent on a reading in those of his work's which deal with the early periods of Kn^lhh history. He must be taken to hoUe\v that there were, even In early times, certain practically immutable characteristics native to the inhabitants of Britain and to its particular group of invaders; to that "ethnic amalgam,” so to speak. which is the basis of the modern English stock. There Is. certainly much truth in this emphatic dogma. Its propounder, however, on rare occasions presses it in the Interest not so much of history as of controversy. In periods far remote he now and then interprets on this basi? facts which other capable historians would explain on the equaliy plausible theory of England's geographical position and the ;fict that her coasts were open only t0 the invasions of the seafaring and consequently most hardy and adventmous of the barbarians who tramped and ravaged ihe fairest countries of Europe.	■

far-reaching: consequences'. -In thifTgrave crisis tbe Emperor Honorius Had'.been forced to promise: freedom to all slaves,
■who would talce up arms* and to give tho
rights of citizenship to many from whom it had thuR far been withheld. The constitution of the empire was thus radically^ affected. His General, Stilicho, too, had been, compelled "to withdraw the legions from the uttermost frontiers, some even from .Britain.. Reports of t her battle of Pollentia are conflicting, and,' though Prof. Freeman hesitates about conceding victory to either the Roman or the Goth in this, famous^ engagement 5n which the Christian -Alaric and his followers were unexpectedly attacked while at their Easter devotions, the results seem to point to the success of the Roman eagles I under the dauntless and resourceful ; Stilicho. It \tfas the fear of his prowess alone which served as a sufficient bul-! wark. for the now defenseless frontier?* and restrained for a few years longer the hordes of marauders already impatiently gathering on the borders. The spell was broken, however, In 400, w,hen the Alans/ Suevi. and Vandals ‘crossed the Rhine and began to pass southward toward Spain. Everywhere this advance guard of the ter- j rible VolkQrwanderung seems to have tar- I ried long enough to plunder and destroy, ajuL-thelr passage through Gaul, marked ! by the ruin of populous citlos, was a mat- I ter of some years. Though he nowhere'1 explicitly says so. from the general tenor of his work it is a fairly safe inference that Prof. Freeman discounts largely the prevalent opinion regarding the barbaric cruelty of thesS* tribes. /They showed a reverence for the civilization into which they were entering, and they were, in their way, Christians. Yet the difference between Christian and Pagan was not then as now a difference in degree of culture or general attitude, as we may judge from the frequent intermarriage, of the Christian and Pagan Princes and Princesses. Their interpretation of Christianity was essentially uncivilized. It was, as later with Chlodowig the Fran$ a fear of and faith in the Lord ot Hosts, the gbd of battles, and now and then, with their i general appreciation of things Roman, a I belief in the greatness of the '* God of the , Emperor," for Honorius, tt will be remembered, like many of his predecessors and successors, liberally supported the Church,
It need not seem an inconsistency to us> therefore, that their advance was accompanied by plunder and rapine, and undoubtedly much cruelty. This particular instances, such as the murder of.women and children, recounted by witnesses, would prove. But of this side of the story Prof. Freeman perhaps believed too much had already been said. He Is fonder of dwelling on their adaptability, upon how,
In many cases, their barbaric swords were struck into plowshares, and how they settled down to become the comparatively peaceful tillers of the soil. Their aimless ravaging he ^ lays rather to their wild spirit of adventure, their restless desire ot action, than to any practice of cruelty for Its own sake.
The Alans, Suevi. and Vandals had entered Gaul In 40G. The following year tho remaining legions of- Britain, we know not why nor exactly under what conditions, threw off their allegiance to Rome, and. electing one of their number tyrant, likewise crossed into Gaul. Their first two rulers after a brief glory and violent
f ends’ 'were, tollowedby a conimon' soldier, i Constantine; whose only claim to hia new dignity was. the fact that he "bore the name of a former Illustrious Emperor. With his nation of legionaries he made I his way Into Southeastern Gaul There ; seems to have been a certain’ understanding between Constantine’s following and the hosts of barbarians already invading the land, for they avoided all conflict, and, while Constantine took the east and settled in the rich and beautiful City of Arles, they continued their march southward into Spain, and kept exclusively to the centre and west. -Prof. Freeman’s account of the rise and fall of this brief second Empire of the West Is one of this' able investigator’s ablest chapters of historical writing. In describing the cities of it3 ancient capitals I he shows himself familiar with every Inch of ground, and his style takes on color ! and fervor. Unconsciously, the revolting i legionaries had timed their rising well.
I Honorius, - the recognized Emperor, In i character and ability decidedly Constan-| tine’s inferior, was soon to be occupied by , Alarlc's second invasion of Italy and his siege and capture of Rome. He had fur' thermore become jealous of his greatest General, Stilicho, whom lie suspected rightly or wrongly of being In league with Alaric, and murdering him at this juncture. cut off, as the author says, his right hand with his left. Yet stillcho's successor, Sarus, was for a moment able to check Constantine, and even force him for a time out of Arles, then a brave Roman capital by the sea, now a Provengal town of many r.uins, hopelessly inland. But Rome was battling against too many enemies, and Honorius, in the hope of obtaining- his aid against Alaric, was compelled to bestow upon Constantine the title of Emperor, thus making him his associate, But Constantine seems to have conspired for Honorius’s overthrow, and his pretense of bringing aid against Alaric was merely the shield behind which he could enter an unresisting Italy. The plot, if it existed, was discovered. In any case, Constantine was foiled. Alaric died suddenly at Coscnzn, and his Goths, it was said, forced their Roman prisoners to dig a new channel for the river By sen to. buried him on his horse at night deep in the river's bed, then turned the stream back to flow over him to tho sea, and slew those who had unwillingly prepared his _ strange sepulchre. Thus no Roman hand should molest his body or his grave- Perhaps Prof, Freeman regarded this incident as mythical; his subject does not require him to treat Alaric at any length, however, and this miiy account for his not mentioning it. In any case, it is a story worth preserving, if not In history at least in literature, where it has already been presented by the German, August von Platen, Alaric's successor, Atawulf, acted in the interests of Rome, as. contrary to general belief, the Goths did generally. This permitted Honorius to direct his attention to the rival EmperorNut Arles, whom, he Succeeded in overthrowing, and, in spite of Constanffne suddenly having become a monk, he was murdered on the way to Italy in 412, after a career in which, from the rank of common soldier, he hud come to all the pomp and titles of the imperial dignity, Starting as an adventurer from Britain, in less than three years he had grown to be acknowl-edgpd by much of the Roman world as Domlnus nosier, Augustus. Pius Felix.
I
-Peter Patriae; in three moro he had lost all; In hia-desperation he had turned monk andJUeen murdered. Yet his career is not unique, and one may learn from it the lack of solidarity in. the Roman' world and the difficulties Tvhich its historian has overcome in resurrecting his story so full of incident and intrigue from the scant and;confUcting stories of*that time.
The later chapters of Prof. Freeman's work deal with the later settlement of the West Goths in Aquitaine and the conflicts between their ruler, Theodoric, and the Homan Actius. Tile most valuable portion of the author’s contribution to early
European history is in his perspicacious Interpretation of the mission of the Goth.
Much that is here printed, it may be inferred, was picked from-his notes, and the editors have otcasonally allowed flagrant offenses against the ordinary rules of English grammar to face the reader- Thus for instance in his otherwise exceUe.TU-.dc-scrlptlon of the Saxons above quoted; also in With the light the besiegers was again active/' P. 125; " It was a prize for kings to strive,” p. 1GS; *' the more part of Gaul/’ P. 38. These are but a few Instances of faults which we may be quite sure the author would not have allowed to pass had he beenppermitted to revise tits work, and his executors have not done their whole duty. Many of the pages are entirely given ovep^to quotations from Greek and Latin Purees. They should have been more carefully sifted, pruned, and corrected, and the same or portions of the same extract should not, as ofven happens here, appear on successive pages.
