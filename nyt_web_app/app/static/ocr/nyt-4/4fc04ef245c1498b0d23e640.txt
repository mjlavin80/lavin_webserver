•* The Crisis of tbe Confederacy: A His- I tory of Gettysburg and the Wilderness.” is the title of a new book.on the American civil war by an Englishman, Cecil ! Battine, Captain of the King's Hussars. ! The author has " ventured " to write the book, which, will appear in April with the imprint of Longmans, Green & Co.,
“ with the hope of increasing, if ever so little, the interest in military historjr which recent great events Jiave awakened, and of adding a concise account of the most critical phase of the great civil war to the literature which already exists/1 Although it is not a complete history of the downfall of the military pow-ver of the Southern States, the volume ** aims at placing before the reader in i manageable form an account of the prin-1 cipal events which . brought it about.” Capt. Bat tine writes in his preface:
The history ot the American civil war 1 still remains the most important theme for the student and the statesman because ir was waged between adversaries •of the highest intelligence and courage, who fought by land arid sea over an enormous area with every device within the reach of human ingenuity, and who had to create every organization needed for the purpose‘after the-struggle ~had be; gun. * ♦ * Justice has hardly been done to the armies which arose time and again from sanguinary repulses, and from disasters more demoralizing than any repulse in the field, because they were
caused by political and military ineapaci-
ty in high-places, to-redeem which the soldiers freely shed their blood as it seemed in vain. If the heroic endurance of the Southern people and the fiery valor of the Southern armies thrill us to-day with wonder and admiration, the stubborn, tenacity and courage which succeeded in preserving intact the: heritage of the American Nationr and which triumphed over foes so formidable, are not less worthy of praise and imitation. The Americans still hold the world’s record for hard fighting. *
