TIBET AGAIN:
Col. Waddell’s Very Informing. Ac* count of the Country and the Famous 41 Lhasa Mission.”#
N the matter of .authoritative backgrounds, at all events, Col. Waddell's book on the Lhasa mission and its ante. cedents is the most complete which has so far appeared.
It is more detailed In other respects, loo, than any except Mr. Perceval Landon’s, and contains what Mr. Landon’s book does not, an account of the picturesque negotiations and final treaty-making’ between the English on one clde and the Chinese and the Tibetan hierarchy on the other. Col. Waddell was the chief medical officer of the military escort which accompanied Sir - Francis Tfrounghusband, and of all the members of the expedition, perhaps, was best acquainted beforehand with Tibetan matters.
fOn the whole the most interesting part of his book Is contained in the preliminary historical chapters. The story of the expedition itself Is already a more than
thricetold tale, and although much new and much Interesting and important matter Is added, there is much which merely duplicates what has been published by the writers who were earlier in the field. By the way, Col. Waddell is apt to repeat himself in his own text in a manner which suggests lack of careful editing of his notes, and there are inconsistencies of spelling which would indicate the same thing. Incidentally, it is a curious circumstance that except for a very few very common designations cach of the several writers on this Tibet expedition has a ^different way of spelling the local proper names, whether of men, places, or institutions, ’ It Is decidedly disconcerting to the reader who reads after more -than—one of them, and considering that they all belonged to the same column seems unreasonable.
These, however, are trivial matters. According to the author, who gives a careful survey of all the prior European visitors to Lhafea, the number of these has been larger than is the popular Impression. " The first European to set foot in Lhasa,*’ he says, ** seems to have been
Friary Odoric, who Is believed to have reached the sacred city about the year 1330 A. D. on his way overland from China.” In 1002 an Austrian Jesuit named Grueber and a Belgian Count named Dor-ville abode in the forbidden place two months, and in 1703 came two Capuchin friars, followed in 1716 by two more Jesuits, one of whom, Desiderl, “ settled at Lhasa in the hope of converting the Tibetans to Christianity.” After thirteen years he was recalled by the Pope upon complaint of certain Capuchins, who haa established a rival mission. The chief of these Capuchins, Horace della Fenna, reached Lhasa in 1710 with twelve of his order, and his mission " lasted more or less continuously for nearly half a century.” Della Penna was allowed to build a chapel, which the Grand Lama'himself visited, and when he reftirned to Home in 1735 the Pope sent back by him letters to the Lama, These monks were finally expelled through the machinations of the Chinese Resident, or Amban-China having converted her nominal suzerainty into something more substantial in 1720 upon an occasion of civil and religious falling out among the natives.
Coi. Waddell says the only Englishmen who certainly saw Lhasa before the coming of Younghusband’s armed expedition unveiled the city so rudely was Charles Lamb’s eccentric friend Thomas Manning. That was In 1811, and Manning has recorded an interview with the Grand ’ Lama of that time, a “ princely ” child seven years old, with a '* beautiful and interesting face.” Warren Hastings, ** the first and greatest of our Governor Generals of British India,” says Col. Waddell, sent two missions with commercial intent, but neither reached Lhasa, and the Colonel himself, fresh from' the late war in Bur-mah, tried to reach the mysterious place in 1832 In the disguise of a Tibetan pilgrim, but failed. He says the last Europeans to reach the citadel of Lamaism were MM. Hue and Gobet, two French Lazarist priests. That was in 1845.
The legendary Darwinian origin of the Tibetans (they allege that their first parent was a monkey which crossed the Himalayas and there married a she-devil of the mountains) was related by Mr. Landon. Col. Waddell's account of it is somewhat different and more at large. He has of course, too, a survey of the evolution of Lamaism (which he calls a very corrupt and debased Buddhism) and the paVt the Chinese had in civilizing the originally rough and warlike mountaineers—confessed progeny, as aforesaid, of a monkey and a she-devil. As to Russia’s designs and the part of the famous Dorjleff
therein hor quotes'- the St." Petersburg papers, but does not go so deeply JntoJihe matter as Mr. LandongoeY in his book. However, Col. Waddell does; provide a cross-section of the Titan' plateauf which shows why the rampart of India, against Russia must be the northern wall* of that plateau and not the southern wall or Himalayas.

Many diagrams and plans and maps, by the way, are used, and these add Immensely to the understanding of the text. The photographs, also, (the author’s own,)’though many of them, like that of the Gyante - jong, produce - fine ' effects, are selected chiefly for the. information they convey. That of the Potala or Buddhist Vatican, of which so many pictures have been printed, is here In colors, and Is reproduced, Col. Waddell says, after a photograph taken upon the spot by the color process. The effect of It la^fix-traordtnarily good. Other colored pliates give an idea of Tibetan decoration which no number of illustrations in black and white with appended descriptions can convey. For instance, the frontispiece represents the “Dalai Lama as a God/* done in deep greens, reds, blues, orange, purple, gold, and flesh color, a copy after the original* a painting_in the Potala, Other pictures include, cartoons in mock tapestry effects done^by members of the expedition, and reproductions of Tibetan drawings of the inscriptions on proclamations, and the famous prayer flags— even of the Lhasa postmark which was stamped upon the letters sent daily by military post from the moment the mission reached the city of mystery. There Is, moreover, an excellent large ritap at the end with the seals of the two Grand Lamas in red and white. .Being a book of English make, the detail of an index— SO apt to be overlooked by American bookmakers—is properly attended to, Mr, ’ Landon’s excellent book is handicapped by having no index at all—a circumstance which makes mention of the index in this ease, if somewhat invidious, very much to the point.
In the story of the expedition the present reviewer will not attempt to follow Col. Waddell, nor wlTT the available space permit the use of many extracts from his text. However, here‘9 a description of the “ peaceful mission ” climbing tho Himalayas:
The hill coollcs, with their loads on their backs and sticks in their hands, plodding painfully and patiently upward.
stand aside on the edge of the road to let the files of soldiers pass by—and very straggling files they are, and fearfully and wonderfully clad. Every man now has his head muffled in a Balaklava cap, tied around with a woolen cravat; his thickly wadded figure. is befurred with sheepskin coat and gloves; his eyes are sheathed by green gfljjEles, and with his rifle on his shoulder he digs his short alpenstock into the slippery ground at cach step.
And this is too curious to lose:
A peculiarity of the language of the Thibetans in common with the Russians and most arctic nations is the remarkably few vowels in their words, and the extraordinarily large number of consonants; for example, the Tibetan name for Sikhim is “ Hbrasljongs.” Indeed, so full of consonants are Tibetan words that most of them could be articulated with almost semi-closed mouth, evidently from the enforced necessity to keep the lips i closed as far as possible - against tho cutting cold when speaking.

To these were brought tea. and biscuits, and the treaty, resting all this time upon a table covered with the Union Jack, was signed with infinite ceremony in five duplicate copies and sealed by* the runaway Grand Lama’s Regent—ah able old Oriental called Ti Rimpoch6, who ■Was exceedingly disgusted when he learned from Col. Waddell at a private interview that Buddha was not mentioned in the Holy Books of the West. “The English/' said this reverend potentate-with emphasis, 14 have no religion at all.” Col. Waddell himself, as if by way of corroborative testimony, tells how at Gyan-tso in Winter quarters:
