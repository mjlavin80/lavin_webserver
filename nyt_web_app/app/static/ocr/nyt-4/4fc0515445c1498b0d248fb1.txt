H. C. Andersen’s English.
* London Acadoray.
Some extracts from an English letter written by Andersen to a friend in New York are quaint and interesting. The letter was probably revised by a friend, for Andersen's command of English was not so great. The letter is dated " Copenhagen. 24 of March. 3808,” and runs:	.
— " My Dear Sir! Excelent friend! You and your noble lady have not forgotten me, I am sure of that, and as one of my friends, Mr.. Melchior, whose lovely family I visit nearly every day, is starting for New Yorlt, I -can't, omit to send you and yours my warmest compliments. I am, thank God, still well and youthful in mind. I have been travelling1 every year, in France, in Switzerland, Spain, and Portugal to refresh my mind, thus refreshed return home bringing with mo new tales and stories, that fly all over the world- God has been so good towards me, that I am obliged to put the question to myself; What have I done to deserve all the good that be/alls me? You will.no doubt have read in The New York Times some months ago, ho# beautiful my native town Odense has honored me, by electing me to citizen of honor in the town., * * * Sending my kindest regard to you, to your Jady, and to every one who has room in their heart for me, J_remain, yours for ever.
