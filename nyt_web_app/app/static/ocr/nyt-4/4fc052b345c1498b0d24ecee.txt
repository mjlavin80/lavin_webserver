; - Theophilus Bronson^ had reached the'jjjj age of thirty-five and had grown cautious. r: At twenty-two a man boldly rushes in and says '*1 love you" before he even thinks of asking the'object of his affections, to • marry him, but at thirty-five he wisely wins the consent of the lady before ha ■commits himself. At least, so thought Theophilus. He made a straightforward matrimonial propositipn to Miss Eleanor Cunningham and was amazed that she should turn him down. ** Five, six, seven long years . have. I been unobtrusively faithful,"' he tells her. "Fourscore and eleven balls and receptions-1 have been to because you were there. Sevenscore and thirteen gatherings I omitted to attend because you were not going. Only last week I sent you some roses, and this makes twice I have been to see you in five days. If that is not courtship, do tell me what your idea of courtship is, so that I may buckle to and try to realize if.*’ And all the time he quite overlooked the important feature of telling her that he loved her. Finally, however, he tells it accidentally, and the story ends happily—as do all the other courtships in the book.
For instance, there’s the match that
was made up between the anxious mother
of Susan Herron and Judge .Finch, the contracting parties being pretty Susan and tlie Judge's fine young doctor son;
there's Josephine, whose cousin SO ardently admires her that he longs to see her married; and several other interesting matches, to say nothing of a very inter; esting ball given at Madeira's, where everybody from out of town meets everybody else from out of town, and finds ! with amazement that, after all, very few people in New York really live there, and fewer still care to be burled there.
The entire collection of stories is dei ltf?htfully light, breezy, and easy and nt-
tractive reading.
