ORK on the monumental Cambridge Modern History goes on apace, and with	the Wars of Religion we	already
have	before us a fifth volume	of very
nearly a thousand large octavo pages. Large as it is, so excellent and pertinent is every part, that many a grateful worker will find It still too small. It is everywhere conscientious and i\ever hurried. An occasional point escapes in the division of labor, and in the present work, for instance, Giordano Bruno goes down between the many writers unchallenged to oblivion^ Here and there, to be sure, chapters like the first of the present volume fall somewhat below the generally main-t&ined high standard of scholarship and presentation; .but	in the	main it stands for the most advanced	historical	research of contemporary	English
students.
The Completed series was to contain twelve volumes, but the work seems to have grown under the hands of the editors, and they promise us now a thirteenth volume of maps, and a fourteenth of gen-ealojries, supplementary information, and a general index.	.
A previous volume of the Cambridge History, treating of the Reformation, closed with the treaty of Cateau-Cambrfesis, (1559.) which ended for a time the long rivalry between Prance and Spain and seemed to mark a compact between the two great European powers for the suppression of heresy. It is at this point that the present volume begins, and it takes us down to the outbreak of the Thirty Tears’ War, (1618,) though an occasional chapter, like the one on James I., for instance, for the sake of completeness must reach out a few years beyond, -A German philosopher has said that ay every new age interprets past events in a different light, it must rewrite Its histories. The present writer feels In much the same way with regard to his reviews of earlier volumes of the Cambridge Modern History. In a review of the Reformation he deplored the fact thatHhe editors seemed to be giving us political history of the old-fashioned sort,- that they were neglecting the literary, economic, and industrial aspects of civilization- The present volume makes plain that treatment of certain of these aspects of history had merely been deferred to a later time, and in the Wars of Religion we find a careful consideration of the economic conditions of Spain (though not of the Netherlands) and thorough particular studies on the UerfSissance literature of England and Italy; the former, by Sidney Lee, as was to be expected, of abiding excellence. On the whole the editors are to be .congratulated on having presented the most complete and thoroughly rounded treatment of any epoch yet taken'Up in their series. That we may not seem to have forgotten how to cavil, howeyer, we will say that we should have liked to find In the present volume some study of the Moriscos and the Moorish influence on Spain and European civilization in general. As t&a last legislation and final deporting of the Valencian Moors took place under Philip IU., (1609,) such a complete study, which history as yet does not seem have made, can^ hardly he supposed to have ’ been postponed, and will, in the completed work, in all probability be' found wanting. The filoriscos were, as Mr. Hume says, excellent gold workers,, weavers, skilled silk raisers, and gardeners. With their forced migration-Spain ceased to be a producing and industrial nation and took one o£ the last steps'toward the. inevitable bankruptcy already Impending.
“The Wars of Religion " opens rather inauspl-cioiufly with one of its leas satisfactory chapters on the wars of religion In France* by A. J. Butler, M, A.* Professor of Italian Language and Literature in University College. London. Its author's style lacks the ease of one writing out of the fullness of his knowledge^and its matter, not free from a few minor lnacuracies, cannot be .called profound and'illuminating.' It deals almost entirely with the military manoeuvres of the eight wars of religion, some of which, as Duruy says, broke out without cause and ended without reason. The procesajjf disorganization in France we are left to infer	^

\ftatcd by A. B.- Tilley* M. > A,,- of icing's College. Mr, Tilley, gives us In briefer compass-hero a restatement of his *'Literature of the-French Renaissance/'
. R. Nesbit Bain, Assistant Librarian of the British Museum, treats of ** The Catholic Reaction and the Valois and B&thory Elections in Poland/' Beginning' with an excellent presentation or the Poland of the mid-sixteentb century—then the greatest State of Eastern Europe, stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea—the narrative moves forward easily -and rapidly to the death oE „ Stephen B&thory. her Transylvanian hero-King, in 158G. Under SIgismund I. (ISOtMS) Lutheranism was looked upon askance because of Its Ger-map origin. 3t was otherwise with Calvinism and the religion of the Bohemian Brethren, which, although weakly opposed by the State, made rapid gains. The cause of the Reformation received a powerful Impetus from the rise of the gentry, szlachta. and their opposition to the clergy, one of the richest and most corrupt of Europe. The masses were darkly ignorant, btit the upper claves greedily devoured the humanistic culture of tho Renaissance until, as a contemporary has il, ” There were more Latinists in Poland than there used to be in Latium.’^ The Church, for all Us great wealth, refused to assume any of the public burdens, and, already possessed of great privileges, put forward offensive pretensions. Such a course aroused the hostility of the gentry and drove a large number of them into the reformed religions. These, with their
rapid increase in strength and numbers were able to hold the Government to a course of toleration, and it was thus largely for political reasons that Poland became a refuge for reformers of all sects, even such as the Socinians, who could find no other home. Protestantism reached its height of influence about 1559. and its decline was due, as in most of the countries of the Reformation, to two main causes—dissensions among its own sects and the increasing strength of the Jesuitical Catholic reaction.
All this is well set forth in Mr. Bain'* interesting- story, which includes also a graphic description of the flight from his adopted kingdom back to Paris of the Dvike of Anjou, later Henry III. of Franc?, (but one of the many discreditable acts of that dissolute Prince,) and an account also of the tumultuous election and giorious ten years’ reign of Stephen Bdthory, Prince of Transylvania. It may serve to remind us how near we still are to the days of Attila the Hun when we read here that in 15T5 Tartar tribes invaded the rich plains of the Ukraine, led away r*5T000 captives, 300,000 horses, and countless herds of cattle.	.
In the way of careful re-estimate and dispassionate presentation nothing better could have been desired than the chapter on * The Height of the Ottoman Power” by Moritz Brosch, Ph. D. Unless our memory deceives us Dr. Brosch is tho .author of the German history of the Papal States, and it is fair to presume that the present article was written in that language. In that case It has been translated most excellently, for it has the rhythm and sweep of authoritative English. The author treats Turkey as a po- j tttical power “ comme un autre.” and esti* | mates her policy and achievement exactly ' in the same spirit that oo night those of any other European nation. Neither Tureophobe nor Turcophile, Dr. Borsch still finds himself in a position to maka certain unwelcome comparisons not flattering to the other European peoples of that day. The alliance of Francis I. and Solymon II. (the Magnificent) has often been considered an alliance of civilization with savagery, and the scandal would have been infinitely greater, the writer shrewdly adds, had it been known that Solymon’s siege of Vienna (1529) was the result^ of an appeal to the Sultan from Frances, his mother, Louise of Savoy, and Pope Clement VII., for help against the Emperor.
In the matter of toleration the Turkish was in advance of most of the other European nations, for while the Inquisition was yearly murdering thousands In the Netherlands, no one suffered for his faith at the Porte, and our author concludes that in certain respects at least the Ottomans were better, the Spaniards and Imperialists worse than their reputation.
. Chapter V., “The Empire Under Ferdinand I, and Maximilian II./’ is the work of A. W. Ward, Litt, £>., one of the editors. The Holy Roman Empire had now entered upon that period of its existence when, as Voltaire said, it had ceased to be either holy or Roman or empire. It was a loose agglomeration of States that could not be persuaded or coerced into any common policy except the granting of Che Turkish aid for the defense of the eastern frontiers, and even this was the subject of interminable bickerings in the successive Diets, and later met vrith a flat refusal on the part of the majority of the estates. Inherently devoid of any valid principle of unity, religions differences were now rapidly tearing it to pieces. For the religious peace of Augsburg, (1555.) which granted freedom to practice either religion, was merely a recognition of the equal strength of the two parties. Toleration had not yet been .set up as a principle of justice, nor of political expediency even, and either party would have been eager and willing to begin persecu-
! tion on any new accession of strength to •Itself or indication of' weaknessV<m tho part of its adversary. The Emperor was often engaged otherwhercs with private concerns, and what little solidarity there ^ had been was now dissipated by the fierce hatreds engendered by religious differences. This is a juncture of events which Mv. Ward does not seem fuily to \ex-plain. The religious differences /had als-. rupted the empire and crippled rthe power of the Emperor. The Princes of the various estates began more and more to fool themselves comparatively autonomous. flind to pass from the idea of allegiance to the Emperor to a sense of their1 own independent territorial power and sovereignty. All other phases of imperial polity are very fully and intelligently
discussed.
Chapters VI. and VII. that follow, as; well as XIX., treating respectively The-Revolt of the Netherlands, William the Silent, and The Dutch Republic, are the^ work of the Rev. George Edmundson, M. A . formerly Fellow and Tutor of Brasenose. Few of our heroes seem to stand well the lumen siccum of modern research. It is a double pleasure, therefore, to learn from Dr. Edmundson, whose chapter incorporates the results o^ recent work, that later science has not yet been able to take from William the Silent any of his laurels. It is unfortunate for Dr. Edmundson that up to the death of that hero he must inevitably* appear to be following in Motlej<s footsteps, and like him he seems to write with an often forcibly repressed anti-Spanish bias that occasionally asserts itself. Though he does not have the American historian’s intensity or power of arousing sympathies by dramatic presentation of fact, he none the less provides a very readable and acceptable narrative of the events of that time.
Chapter VIII., on Mary Stewart, Is the first of the several on English history which as a whole reach a more uniformly high standard of excellence than their fellows. It is the work of the late Thomas Graves Law. M. A., Librarian of the Signet Library, Edinburgh. With the rare power of discerning motives in the confused accumulation of Machiavellian politics of this thnc, the writer sets Mary Stewart before us as the storm centre of the early Counter Reformation. Tt was In the interests of both France and Spain that England should become Catholic. It was feared that a Protestant England would aid the struggling sects in France, Scotland, and the Netherlands. Elizabeth’s Catholic subjects were a numerical majority; she had no heirs; her title was Insecure, and in the person of Mary Stewart there was offered an active pretender to the throne. Fov nearly thirty years, therefore, it was a question whether the two great Catholic powers would unite to dethrone the English Queen. Their old jealousies prevented them from acting in concert or allowing each' other a fre*e field. France, too. was to be distracted by internal wars and Philip whs too irresolute ever to seize the opportune moment. In Mr. Law’s words: “ Round the Queen of Scots, as the representative and symbol of regenerated Catholicism, the content of diplomatic skill and force of arms raged with remarkable vicissitudes of fortune. The end found Elizabeth the acknowledged champion of Protestant Europe, no longer weak and despised, but snatching from Spain the sovereignty of the sens, and within sight of the long-coveted union of Scotland and England under a Protestant monarch." In the centre of this conflict Man’ s strange courso which destroyed her chances and invjted her destruction is traced with much insight ! into her passionate brilliant personality. ■
The ninth chapter, “ The Elizabethan 1 War with Spain/’ is contributed by J. K. Laughton, M. A.. Professor of Modern History, King’s College, London. It Is a detailed, somewhat technical study of the rise of the English sea power; severely just, yet possessing that element of romance and adventure inevitable to a treatment of the age of t-he first English sea rovers like Drake and Hawkins, and the startling defeat of the Spanish Armada. The latter he accounts for on the score of the disadvantages under which the Spaniards fought in their often unseaworthy, old-fashioned galleys carrying but few guns and relying for victory on coming to close quarters, grappling, and boarding. . This the shiftier, better armed, and more easily manoeuvred English men of war successfully avoided, in the meantime sinking or scattering their unwieldy adversaries-
The two folowing chapters--** The Last Tears of Elizabeth " and “ The Elizabethan Age of English Literature," are a credit to our moat competent student of that period. Mr. Sidney Lee. and will remain for time to come one of the most satisfying expositions in brief compass of the spirit and story or that highly interesting time. He gives in a few pages the essence of Renaissance and Elizabethan literature, traces that quickening of the individual consciousness which heralds the new era and which comes to perfect speech in the dramas of Shakespearo. He confines his attention more exclusively to the greater figures and is perhaps inclined to write down the lesser brothers in that mad. bad, glad chorus. Webster ^is dismissed with a few lines, and Ford
■with .a ‘sentence; Cyril. Tourneur jr.eeelves -hot-even honorablemention. Yet Mr. i^ee gives us a scheme of interpretation in1 accordance with which the reader will readily .be able to .classify any .less^famous favorite. Students of Spanish' literature may be inclined to break a lance with hlm^over hia phrase, u The Renaissance literature of Spain/’ They will say-that Renaissance literature, as he himself defines* It, could not and did not flower In the iron grasp of the Spanish Inquisition, and surrounded by the almost general wretchedness of sixteenth and seventeenth ^century Spain. Cervantes is not Renaissance in a like sense with Rabelais, and the Picaresque novel has spirited kin in the pre-Renalssance old French farce .and fabliau. The perfect flower of its splendid dramatic literature, though somewhat later than the : Elizabethan, is of a quite dif-
■	terent .-cast, Calderon’s successes, with one notable, exception, lie in that isolated field of the Christian drama, a genre whose existence, we are aware, is denied by certain critics. His heroes save them' selves by faith and not by individual strife and endeavor. However, the question is a large one and does not admit of full discussion here.
-	Tuscany and Savoy, 'as the smaller States of this time, were reduced to saving themselves by alliance and intrigue. The succeeding chapter, which treats of them, we owe to Mr. Armstrong, M. A., of Queen’s College, Oxford. Tuscany .-already in the evening of its bright day, and Savoy, that had but recently taken rank as that State out of which was to be developed the Italy of to-day, present no questions of moment in this period. Their treatment at the hands of Mr. Armstrong is all that could be desired..
Not so, however, with the following chapter on Rome under Sixtus V.,' by Count Ugo Balzani of the Reale Accad-emia dei Lincei, Hon. D. Liu., Oxford. We do not know whether Count Balsani wrote his study in English, a language not native to him, or whether it has been poorly translated; in any case tt suffers decidedly from imperfect presentation. follows upon the excellent chapter on the Council of Trent in the Reformation volume, and suffers by comparison. If we take the Counter Reformation seriously, the wars of religion may be taken as its political phase. It thus receives much of its direction, conscious or unconscious, from Home. Count Balzanl fails to give us a picture of the years of Rome's greatest aggressiveness after the closing of the Council of Trent, and to .omit so important a part is very, nearly tantamount to playing '* Hamlet " without the Dane. The Jesuits, too, whose work is of such prime historical ' importance, nowhere come in for treatment, whether through the fault of Count Balaam or through that of the editors, it is impossible to say. He treats more exclusively the personalities of the Popes, particularly that of Sixtus V., whom, as statesman, lit* praises, we believe, beyond his due.
Perhaps less satisfactory than the study of Rome is the summary and rather offhand estimate nf ihe end of the Italian Renaissance by Prof. Butler, who contributed the first chapter. Apparently he was occasionally writing from memory, and his memory seems to have deceived him. On no other basis is It possible to account for the very strange evaluation he makes of Arioso’s work. We are toM that in its metre, the ottava rima, it is j impossible to be poetic or even serious for more than a very few lines togelher. Il may be answered that in exactly the same metre Tasso is pathetic and even serious through twentj uninterrupted cantos, and that, though .Arioso is, of course, not Milton, he himself is serious in his** way through decidedly the larger portion of the Orlando Furioso. According to this critic it would be impossible for a novelist to be serious who is writing to the best of his ability, about events which he knows to be untrue, in the sense that they have never actually happened. He finds Arioso’s excellence in his wit and burlesquing. v,-hieh he seems to believe can be found in almost every stanza, and prefers to the Orlando his satires, now generally forgotten, even in his'bwn roun-try. His merits have usually been found to be in his easy-flowing verse, the facility of his invention, the directness of his narrative, in which he surpasses his disciple, Spenser, and in the often unparalleled beauty of his descriptions, which were accepted as models in their kind.by no less a critic than Lessing. Prof. Butler’s manner of writing is likewise occasionally discomfiting. We are told that Arioso’s wit was *' rather of the Ber-nesque order, however, than of the Boc-caccesque.’*
The remaining portions of the chapter are saner and better wrilten, and deal with the conditions under which the literature was produced as well as with the literature itself. “ The liberal arts weris. deserted, as- Pale.ario said, and the young men wantoned in idleness or wandered about the public squares." Humanism
-	had failed to bring back the golden age; it could not create happiness as many had dreamed. Like those mediaeval elixirs of youth discovered by the Benedictines and Carthusians^ it could make men drunk with themselves for a day, but the evils of this world it could not cure, and happiness it could not bring. It had been too highly appraised, and when its failure
j here became apparent, and its pursuit difficult,* iffor the Coifnter Reformation, implacable in its punishments, was bus-picious of the bold, inquiring spirit and the fervor of Its .earlier joyous paganism,) It.-dled of inanition not to be really revived in Italy until the latter half Of tho ; last century, when she could count and still countsr perhaps, the most perfect type of contemporary humanism in her great pagan poet and student, Carduccl.
, From Italy we pass to events In Spain, In the chapters on Spain under Philip II. and Spain under Phillip III.. treated by Martin Hume of the Royal Spanish Academy. As they stand far along In this volume, much of Spanish policy in England, France, and the Netherlands baa already been treated. The writer’s wings have been clipped, as it were, and he Is forced to stay near home. He gives us, however, a very interesting chapter on Internal affairs and conditions under the gloomy father, who, as one of his Intimates said, put off from to-morrow to tomorrow, and whose only resolution was to remain irresolute; and under his prodigal, ,vain,, and .light-headed son. He begins by presenting a strong statement of the policy of Charles V.:	“The Impos-
sible task undertaken by the Emperor Charles V. In hia youth had worn him out, mentally and bodily, at an age when most men are in their prime. From the beginning he had proceeded'on the assumption that he and his were the chosen instruments by means of which God's cause must finally triumph over impious rebellion. Popes, Kings, and peoples, the institution of the Church itself, were but pawns to bo used according to hig inspired direction. The idea of a Christendom religiously -unified, with a Spanish Caesar polItlcalIj; supreme, was the end aimed at; and the Emperor recognized quite early in the struggle that the life of one man was too short to see the fruition of the dream." Such was the legacy left to Phillip II., and the author treats that unhappy monarch not without a certain sympathy for the hopelessness of his task.
He was never light-hearted, and he did
.not disguise from himself the difficulties of his task. An absolute and crushing want of means dogged him from the first; Italy was in a state of turmoil, and the Flemings were already frowning on their new Prince. But Phillip shouldered his burden with a dull, plodding determination to do his best, and to sacrifice everything to his view of duty. There was no enthusiasm, only the conviction of inevitable destJny, that doomed him to labor patiently with utterly Inadequate means, assured of final triumph in. the cause because it w’as that of God, of Spain, and’of himself.	.
The chapters which follow, Britain under James I., by the late Prof. Gardiner, and Ireland to the Settlement of Ulster, by R. Dunlap. M. A., maintain the high standard set In the treatment of purely English history. Henry IV. of France is presented by Stanley Loathes, one of the editors, who contributed the chapter on Hapsburg and Valois, to Che Reformation volume. It can hardly be said to offer anything new or distinctive. PrOf. Ward, also one of the editors,^ continues in The Empire Under Rudolph :i. this treatment of the Germanic States already mentioned. He draws for us an excellent portrait of that strange prin-.-f, patron, of tho arts, resembling not a little the later Ludwig, of Bavaria, whose latter years were clouded by insanity and under whose failing guidance the empire helplessly drifted into the Thirty Years’ War.	'
The last chapter on Political Thought in the Sixteenth Century by the Rev. J. Neville Figgis, M. A-. of Trinity College, will go far toward compensating by its surpassing excellence and 'catholicity of spirit for any occasional Insufficiencies ol treatment or narrowness of view which we may have signaled. He treats the movement in its broader outlines, philosophizes it, as it were, and sets forth what progress humanity has really made in developing ideas of society, government, and liberty. We can recall no better founded nor more cogently argued treatment of this interesting phase of his-torv.	CHRISTIAN	GATSS.
