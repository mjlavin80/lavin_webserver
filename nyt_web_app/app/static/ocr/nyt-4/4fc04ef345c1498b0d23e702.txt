LORD SALISBURY
The two volumes of “ Essays by Robert, Marquess of Salisbury,*’ for which Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. are the Amorican sponsors, will be a not superfluous remiit-or to many American readers, and to many of the younger generation almost a notification, that the late Prime Minister of Great Britain was a writer at all. As a matter of fact, he was an uncommonly good ■writer, one of the leading British pub*
licists of his own younger days, not only one of the pillars of The Quarterly, but one of the Cmef of those who gave The Saturday Review authority and distinction at a time when it unquestionably possessed those qualities. It was only while hs needed the proceeds of his pen that he continued to write, holding apparently, with Dr. Johnson, that “ nobody but a blockhead ever wrote except for money.’1 But he wrote enough, and well enough, to justify Walter Bagehot in saying, ia 1870:
It is rare to find a peer who Inherits his rank, and-yet who has known what6 it is to earn his bread. Of eminent peers there is perhaps not more than one now living of whom this is true. Lord Salisbury has indeed a right to feel that circumstances cannot ruin him; that a revolution may come, that the House of Lords may perish, that estates may
be confiscated, but that ais abilities as a popular writer will earn him his living as they did before.
To the intelligent modern and American reader the proofs of this ability should be verS welcome. The noble | Marquis, or " Marquess," as the editor of the essays antiquely spells him,
i
would never have taken the trouble to collect them. It is doubtless filial piety, though the name of the editor does not
transpire, which has prepared them ror pu'ulication, and done it very well, furnishing them with needful and no more than needful notes. They stand in need of notes, since, by reason of the lapse of time since they were written, their subjects have become more or less
obsolete. The journalistic Interest has departed from them, and only the literary interest remains. We mean the interest not merely in expression, though this is distinctly high, but the interest which might better be called political if that adjective had not been so notoriously abused and wThich may be called historical, the interest in great questions handled by a born politician who is also a master of expression. For a born politician the author was by the
1 fact of being a born Cecil, even though, when they wertf, “R-ritten, the marquisate j to which he in fact succeeded seemed | quite out of his reach. If it had been | visibly within his reach, they would not have been written at all. They show that conversance with great questions which, according to Matthew Arnold, mainly differentiated Macaulay, as a writer, from his fellow-Philistine, Hep-worth Dixon.
We have, by the way, a curious ver-
diet upon Lord Salisbury as a literary man, to the effect that he is not a literary man in the sense of attaching proper importance to literary culture, from the pen of the critical Matthew himself. While acknowledging, in a private letter, that he owed his Oxford D. C. L. to Lord Salisbury as a “ young ” and “ original M man, (this was in 1870, when I^ord Salisbury was forty,) he maintained his own integrity by disparaging his selector’s culture.
Here (with due execration. upon the editor of the “Letters" for not'fur-nishing - them with an index) is the
. passage:	.
He is a dangerous man, and chiefly from his want of any true sense and experience of literature and its1 betiofl-cent function- Religion he knows, and physical science he knows, but the immense wofJT between the two, which IS for literature to accomplish, he kno\V3 nothing of.
When we compare the political writings of Lord Salisbury with the political writings of Arnold which aimed at any directly practical result, we find this judgment very queer; are, in truth, quite at a loss to know what the arbiter of literary reputations can have meant
V
by it. It is true that Lord Salisbury did not in all cases exercise the same judgment about the bestowal of literary honors that he exercised in the case of i Arnold. But the crucial instance of [ this, the appointment of the Poet Laureate, came long after Arnold's sentence. No doubt in that instance Lord
\
Salisbury rather degraded the honor than exalted the recipient of it. But it ; is quite inconceivable that he regarded Mr. Austin as the foremost living English poet, and it appears that he took | i the matter not seriously but cynically, ^ upon the ground that if his friend Mr. Austin could stand the appointment he could. Certainly one will look through these volumes in vain for evidence of the justice of Arnold's estimate. It really seems that the critic may have rashly deduced a lack of literary culture from an intelligent interest in/fcheinis try.
