HUS far comment upon " Tbe Marriage of "William Ashe ’* seems to have-' gone little, deeper than a protest against Lady Kitty’s • unhappy fate and an effort to fasten upon ~Ashe the responsibility for itie failure of the marriage. It is suggested by almost everv advocate of Lady Kitty that if the hustj^na had done otherwise than as 'he*
‘ did alKwould-have been, not only' dtlfer-ent, but—well. A clearer grasp of psychology, which is only to say a clearer understanding of how the human being reacts to his environment—makes this rose-, colored might-have-been disappear like a; smoke wreath. There Is nothing In Lady Kitty’s character, as portrayed by Mrs.; Ward, there is not one Incident in her career, not one hint iof her temperament, to justify the jbeUef that she would have met any tfttampt on Ashe’s part to “ protect ” her (using the phrase to denote not a^ vague and sentimental relationship, but the use of definite means to a clearly visioned end) as otherwise than an .infringement upon her right to do as she pleased and a provocation to and excuse for any act of madness.	■
True, there was a mojyKnt -When even her audacity quailed before the consequences of her own willfulness and she appealed to her husband to save her from what seemed the Inevitable punishment. His answer wa3 not that of. a '* prig," but of a high-souled gentleman who, in the crisis of his own fate as man and husband, could still think of his responsibilities to party and country. 'He did not desert his wife; neither did~htfleave her unprotected. Besides the presence of a wise and devoted woman friend, she had for protection against the seductions of a man for whom she had no passion and whose character she well knew, the memory of her child just dead, the threaten-*^
fngv“ danger to her husband’s career - through her own treachery, and the recollection of his infinite patience and trust all through the years of their married life. Surely the wife who needs further protection is safe only under lock, and key.	-
In fact, this is the only possible summing up of Lady Kitty's character. Cliffe's estimate of her was more than the gibe of the disappointed lover. She lacked the courage to be wholly bad and the strength and inclination to be virtuous. When at last she succumbed to the temptation with which she had toyed while playing the rdle of wife and mother, she did it without the passion and spirit of renunciation which sometimes lifts such events out of the region of vulgar melodrama and sets them Among the nobler tragedies of human life. When, in obedience to a mood born, not of any strong attraction either of soul or flesh, but of a weak acceptance Of the final step in a train of events set going by her own lack of honor, she elopes with Cliffe, she proves herself again incapable of loyalty. Subjected to physical hardship and the strong hand of a master after the luxury of her English home and the noble confidence of her 'husband, she abandons her lover, as only a few weeks before she had deserted Ashe, and at last
■	realizes the completeness of the ruin she has wrought in her own life.
Nothing less than this experience, bitter, crushing, and final, could have reached the slumbering spiritual consciousness o£ Lady Kitty, Protection, which is but a pretty name for surveillance and restraint, would but have aroused animosity in her nature and awakened a desire to outw)t the selfconstituted protector. Let us be thankful that Mrs. Ward was able so far to resist the spell of her fascinating heroine as to spare us the impossible picture of Lady Kitty regenerated painlessly through conjugal firmness and—happy ever after.
