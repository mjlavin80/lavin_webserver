N “American concession " on the international copyright question is declared, by Dr. Robertson Nicoll, in The Bookman of London, to be a probability. He learns that a “ strong party ” in thi3 country, whether of authors, publishers or members of Congress he does not explain, is in favor of abandoning the simultaneous publication clause of the present law and giving the English publisher and author “ three months of grace.” This much time, Dr. Nicoll says, would have been quite sufficient to save the American copyright of such works as ‘ An Englishwoman's Love Letters,’ and would be hailed with thankfulness by the literary world on this side/' We are led to infer that I>r. Nicoll derives his information from Mr. William Heinem&nn, who returned to Bedford Street, Covent Garden, after a short visit to New York full of the idea that the Americans were willing to make concessions. Two or three months of grace he and his brother publishers have been hoping to obtain. To The London Academy, however, the proposition suggests that a dishonest English publisher might use the period of grace to flood the American market with surreptitiously imported copies of the protected work. If measures could be taken effectually to prevent this sort of thing, The Academy thinks that the period of extension might even be extended with profit to the American publisher, who would thus frequently be relieved from the necessity of rushing the publication of a new book in the dull season.
