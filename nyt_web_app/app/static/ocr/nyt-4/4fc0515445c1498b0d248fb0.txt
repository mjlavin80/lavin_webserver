A PUBLISHER'S CONFESSION.
Most people who read like to hear about writers and incidentally about the gentlemen who make it possible for writers to be read, the publishers. We can all have our curiosity on the latter
subject pretty fully satisfied hy a little book brought out by Doubleday, Page
&	Co., under the title " A Publisher’s Confession.”
The title, however. Is somewhat misleading, The author does not so much confess any fault of his own as he recites in considerable detail the shortcomings and errors of others of his class and those of authors* In this we ‘are bound to admit that tie does not
^ehow always the best of ~ taste, hut be does alj .the same giveuB a Iptvof Interesting information/which for the . general public is not otherwise easily attainable. One point of special im , portance he brings out very clearly. With all the display of activity on the rart of the trade, and despite the ac counts of '-.big sellers " ,scattered over the land by the hundred thousands; our publisher is convinced that a very (small proportion of possible readers— not merely of people who know how to read, but of people of fair intelligence and curiosity—is reached at all. And this he attributes to th,e very imperfect development of the means of dia tribution, the lack of the retail dealers in books in other than the larger towns, dealers corresponding, for instance, to . those who sell shoes. He makes a mis take in Raying that a. sale of 100,000 copies of a book supplies only “ one person in every eight thousand of the population/* Eight hundred is the correct number, but even this is, of course, an indication of the extreme thinness with which books are spread over our immense territory and among our very numerous people. Our publisher does not attempt to account for this curious fact or suggest a remedy, but it is significant at least of the field that awaits development.
Another point of interest ia that " general ” publishers must now depend for their business practically on novels. The publishing of textbooks and of subscription books has become specialized, and is in the hands of houses devoted \o 'each branch. While these may also do general publishing, the houses that publish neither textbooks por subscription books must rely chiefly On novels. It is in regard to novels that most of the discussion in thiB little volume goes on. It is the writers of novels who come In for the severest comment on account of their tendency to change publishers and to take advantage of temporary popularity to exact large royalties and big advance payments. On these points our publisher makes a pretty good case, as it seems to us/ though we express the opinion with some hesitation, for he
is frankly scornful of the value of

opinions from “ literary ’’ reviews. By and large, as the phrase is, the-relation between a publisher and an author*1 might better be based on loyalty than bn royalty. ‘ A publisher can do a great deal to make or mar the fortunes of a writer; if he succeeds at all he must do so at considerable risk for early-books, and if he 4s honest and intelligent. he will see that his Interest is the' same as that of the writer. The ideal relation is one in whicH increased success is fairly divided. There are, or course, black sheep in each fold, unscrupulous publishers and insatiable writers, but for the best of each class a steady relation ought to be the most advantageous.
*	, Notwithstanding the tone of querulousness that runs through this H confession/1 which, as we have said, is hot really, a confession at all, the writer is by no means discouraged as to the future of his " profession.” perhaps he desires for it rather a more Jofty place in the activities of American life than .even Its best members" are likely to attain, but good ideals are easily enough shorn of their impracticability by the sharp conditions of actual business, and they are wholesome in themselves. We felicitate our unknown publisher on his, and heartily hope that they may be found consistent with a snug income and with the acquisition of a large circle of author friends. . J
