It Is a ‘matter of congratulation for | American and English publishers of 1 foreign tests, primarily for the use of 8 1 youthful students, that Schiller has re-| celved more painstaking and talented atI tentlon In 'England and America than ho i has In the country which gave him birtli.
Of course German publishers have vied i with each' other in giving him elaborate typographical and pictorial settings; but they'are not such settings as to appeal to the student either on account of their editing or of the price, asked.
" Wilhelm Tell" has received a quality of attention from English-writing' editors | which is little less than • extraordinary, l and- this attention may be considered | worthy of more than technical notice on j account of the approaching centenary of «
I Schiller’s death on May 9. Thirty years ago a Boston bookseller, Carl Schoenhoff,
I furnished Stuttgart and Tttblngen texts I for American students In German which i depended upon the instructor for notes and incidental explanations—historical and literary. .One of these texts, “ Wilhelm Tell/* was finally furnished with an inI troductlon and a few notes by Prof. A.
; Sachtleben, and incorporated by Henry Holt & Co. in Whitney's German texts^
In all, the book contained 200 pages, 1G2 'of which were devoted to the play. Those j who possess a copy of this edition or j remember it may find it interesting to I compare it with another now produced j by the same"publishers, “ edited, with in-[ troductlon, notes, and vocabulary, by Prof. Arthur H. Paimer,*’ and illustrated with half-tone pictures, and with fac simile reproductions of the first title-page (1804), of manuscripts, seals, and ancient missals which concern the League of 1201. Without going into details, it Is no exaggeration to state that no similar publication has ever included so much really valuable, entertaining, Instructive, and inspiring material concerning the German poet and his masterpiece.
Another excellent illustrated edition Is that^ by the late Prof. Huchheim, as revised by Prof. Schoenfeld. Although It lacks a vocabulary, its notes are very numerous but brief, confining themselves to the actual verbal necessities. The “ life *’ of the author, however critical the analysis of the play, and historical examination of the legend of Tell receive reasonable and intelligent consideration.
The latest addition to the " Wilhelm TellM texts is another illustrated book, the pictures of which predominate with scenes drawn from Toll's country or re* produced from the incidents of the legend that have found expression in art. It is edited by Richard Alexander von Minck-witz, who has so far effaced himself in introduction and notes as to allow the greatest critics and philologists to speak for him. His vocabulary, however, which includes every word to be found in the play, is a most excellent and painstaking piece of work, as each word has its root designated, its accents and syllables marked. Its definitions are brief but to the point. There Is an excellent bibliography for those who may wish to pursue further the study of Schiller, and a table 1 of epigrams which will be found advantageous for the student to memorize.
With such attractive texts of M Wilhelm Tell ” fashioned not only to make study easy, but even attractive and inspiring, there Is no excuse for the student of the present day not knowing more about the play and the poet than did his grandfather and father, who had merely the ill-printed German pages and no auxiliary
. inspiration except that contributed by his teacher's personality and knowledge. Whether the student learns German more readily with these new editions than he did with the old. it is difficult, If not I impossible, to estimate. Bnt surely h© B now has no excuse for not knowing a I great deal of history, legend, and blog- 8 raphy attached to the play of “ Wilhelm i Tell.”	I
