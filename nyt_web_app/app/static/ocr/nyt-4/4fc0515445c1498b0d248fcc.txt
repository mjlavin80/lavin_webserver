The subjects of his .essays are Jonathan Edwards, John Winthrop, Margaret Fuller, Walt Whitman, and John Wesley. Clearly there is considerable scope In the Puritanism these person-allties are supposed to represent or to .

i tSrely succeed In showing their rela- ^ tions to the main topic, He even gives ground for the suspicion that the irialn topic was a matter of title making after the aketches were composed and that the latter ware not the product of a purpose ta develop the topic* It is a far cry from Edwards to Whitman, and it seems that the tracing- to the former of .the influences to whlcK the latter was in such marked antagonism is a little forced. It is true that the notions of the early New Englanders as to what was decent or Indecent were very different frt>m those which governed poor Whitman's choice of subject matter for verse, but these notions are not of the essence of Puritanism on the | one hand or of Whitman's poetry on the other. Indeed, the severest condemnation which Mr. Macphail quotes as due to the Puritanism of the time is not really more severe, though it is more savage, than that passed upon Mr. Whitman by Mr. Macphail himself. |
Though, as we have intimated, Mr. sfn.cpha.il does not. wholly succeed in co-ordinating fcis sketches and does not throw much new light on the Puritanism which they are supposed to illustrate, he does give us decidedly fresh impressions of the characters of which he treats. Especially Jonathan Edwards appears, in his pages, as a very distinct and human person. If we do not quite grasp the relation of his theology to the curious life he led, we understand better the influence of the man, his quixotic sense of an inspiration, the untiring energy with which he was possessed. It was by virtue Of these qualities that he justifies these words cf Mr. Macphail:
The old name for a revival Was an awakening, and Jonathan Edwards awakened the people thoroughly. Once awake they could be trusted to find a way out for themselves. The path they followed has not been precisely the one which was marked out for them by the great divine, but it led in a new and a right direction. To turn the people anew and aright is the greatest work that any man can accomplish, and it is for this supreme reason that the name of Jonathan Edwards is held in remembrance.

“PURITANISM."
In some regards it would seem that Puritanism has been pretty well exhausted as a subject of critical discussion. Certainly ah out all that can be said in denigration has been said, and to renew and repeat the condemnation
of it, either seriously or in the sarcastic vein to which it lends itself cnly too readily, is, as our French friends would say, smashing in an open door.
Mr, Andrew Macphail, in his '* Essays in Puritanism,” (Boston; Houghton, Mifflin & Co.,) is not guilty ol just this form of mistake, for he mingles with his sharp and sometimes acrid treatment of Puritanism a good deal of sound and discriminating comment on its more attractive side, but on both sides of his view of Puritanism he leaves an impression that he has not very thoroughly worked the matter out. One involuntarily wishes that he had done more since he has done so much, that he had made a picture rather than a group of sketches. The sketches are unquestionably interesting. He has, of course, a perfect right to limit himself to the exercise of an art in which he is so clever, and he may very properly complain if we ask of him more than he intended or cared to give* But It is precisely because he is so clever in what he has done, and betrays here'and there such
