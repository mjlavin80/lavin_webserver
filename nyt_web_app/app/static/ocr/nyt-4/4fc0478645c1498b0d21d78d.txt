SAILORS' YARNS*
A VoUimt of Good Sea Stories by Morgan Robertson.*
OHTfXATELV one does no! iif^d to believe implicitly in tho verbal accuracy of the <. ozen or more i.il'-s wh'eh Mr, JtlorRan Robertson has culled “ Di>wn to the Sea.'* Without that one can be mightily entertained and amused b}r them, tor. although to a sailor there must always I*u allowed some leeway in order to spin a good yarn, it must be admitted that, in this particularly thrilling collec-;	tfon, iratiy a good round cable length of
credibility has been paid out. lUit Lhe rc-se.lt is e\eellent from the landsman's pomt ct view, and that Justifies moans. J-'ince satlormen are not generally I	enthush.j-tic about sea stories, and in ail
i	probability one couldn't be written that
suit their, anyway, i " Down to the Sea ” is really more about men than about tho sea. though the men,
I	U is true, are altogether of the generally
:	interesting variety that make their home
,	on vessels of one kind or another, and
Mr. Robertson has been wisely careful not j	to remove them from their natural ole-
nit’nt. There is 'nothing: mystical, awe-
i	insi'-reu. or far-fetched about this writ!	ei-*s view of the soa or of the people
whose business it is to travel upon its surface, and he indulges in very little of the- complicated description of marine phcnunn n-i so dear to tho hearL of the conventional sea story manufacturer. The wonders as well as the terrors of the deep are tn*:;ted by Mr. Kobertson with very mud. lhe same matter-of-factncss that is employ et1 by sailors themselves toward the might) element which so stirs Lhe emotions of those less familiar with it. In his eharacterization of the men whom he brings into these stories there is all the vigor, simplicity, and natural unforced humor that would be expected from one who has been called the “ Kipiing of the S?ea/* There is no end to the eye-opening and hah -raising exploits in which, obedient to their author’s facile and inventive
-	pen. they take successful part, and, as long as they are told In the eloquent style Of which Mr. Robertson is master, the arli'ully concealed fact that the most of them could never happen on land or sea really seems to interfere but little with the very evident fact that they make most

Hat the best <<f all are about the battleships. and the bright particular star i of tbe whole book is “ old man Finne-g-iu.” who does really seem almost fit to rank with Mttlvaiiey. He is as human, though not so witty, and heaven favored him in much -the same way and all men locf,d him who knew hijn. Finnegan’s osp<- ial and most engaging peculiarity was. in the words of the ship's surgeon, that “ when sober, he was a fool; when drunk, a capable man—at least, at his best.” The strange part of it was that some higher power, be it heaven or Tate or what not, seemed to know when great things were to be required of Finnegan, and he was always in the right .state men-tullv, though wrong state morally, whert Cato required hia assistance. The five stories in which Finnegan bears off the palm at the most crucial mbments of interest aie about as good stories us ever were told, and it will be long before Finnegan will bo forgotten by those who make his acquaintance.
tn "* Fifty Fathoms Down Mr. Robert son shows what ho enn do to make a.n absort'ingrly inti*resting1 title out of n maze oT technical detail, and in one of the other stories he makes a picturesque little drama with the various grades (if war vessels its dramatis personae.
