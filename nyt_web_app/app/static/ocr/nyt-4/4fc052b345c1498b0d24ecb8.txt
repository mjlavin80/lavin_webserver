As my name ..J^s'heen published i»y' George Bairi‘e ,& SoftS'.pf Philadelphia as a member ofithe:‘EJdUpflKl3oard of “The History of NorthtAmerica/' I would ask the courtesy of, -ypur .columns to statfc' that their use of my name Is without au-" thorlty and without warrant. . 1 was cn*. gaged some months ago by George Bar~
. rie & Sons to make a Catholic revision of this work, and did revise the first volume and part of the volume on Canada; but as my-‘revision's, for the most part, were ’ not. incorporated- by the editor whero X\ deemed them essential from the.Catholic standpoint, I declined to proceed with the work, and distinctly refused to allow my name to be connected with the history, and. so informed the publishers. I would apprise the public—especially, the Catholic public—-that In no way do I stand as. a guarantor of the character of The Itj^tory of North* America."
