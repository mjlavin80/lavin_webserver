CURRENT COMMEiM TT _
MMjiodfl of a \ew Intellectual luduHtr; ,
HERK i-^ in Washington what wo may venture lo describe as a literary emporium, though it is officially known as an ‘'institute.'' It deals with literature on strictly business principles. Authors are enrour-to son-i thoir manusi : ipts to the Institute, which thru endeavors to “ place " them with publishers or with editors oC magazines. The Institute <-ijnds out every
month a JJniletin of tho M:imisi-ripts Sale
Department. describing briefly the wares which it liap “ listed ‘‘ and whicli it offers for sale. Wo have just received the February bulletin—a little belated. It offers only six manuscripts, fo thiit the Institute astounds US by its moderation. One of these stories Is described us “ well adapted fur a farm journal.” That lets us out. Another is said to be “ especially suitable for a Southern magazine.” That also lets us out. A third is “ a story based «>n superstition and cleverly portraying its existence in the minds of bright. c allured people. The setting of the story is a fashionable home rt the hour of dining. A romantic thread runs through the story.” We aie afraid that wo don't want this. We can too easily divine i its plot. We seem to se<- aln-ady tin* bright, cnlturcd people sitting in their fashionable homes ni the hour of dining—say lli-W. There is a melodeon in one corner of tin; ronm and a highly gilded subscription book is carelessly displayed upon a little black walnut table. A young woman is in love with a young man. When Hie sits down she finds that thirteen .persons are pre^*:it. That seems to spoil her chances with the young' man. The young man is, however,
also secretly fond of her, Hvil ;is he talces his place, he linds that the knives arc crossed. That seems to end his ■ihances. Both of them are so agitated that they spill'the salt. Doth of them, however, throw salt over their left shoulders, and it subsequentiy turns out that the other two hoodoos cancel each other, so that all ends happily in the front parlor after the rest have gone. If that isn’t the story, then we present this plot to any bright, cultured -person who wants to work it out. The Institute also offers to us " a pretty four-verse poem, lofty in sentiment,” :ind good to use as a " filly!'.’* Somehow or other, we should hate to use a poem that is lofty in sentiment as a “ filler.” and so we alEfo turn that down. Then there is “a J,<i00-word dainty storiette.” It is a matter of principle with us never to look at storiettes, seiialettes, paragraphettes, or itemcttes, just as we also avoid booklets, jokelets, playlets, and reviewlets. Such is our invariable rule. Finally the -list contains " a simple little dog story of 1,500 words." Wo might consider that little dog story were it not " simple/' If the lady who wrote it has anywhere in stock a complic-ntetl little Jog
story, let her send il ou.-^Tho Boo kill nil, New York.
A slang dictionary may Orlpin null have its uses. Many Development s]ang words, creeping of the Word ij)t0 tll<J ian&uase from
Humbaff. doubtful sources, have found a place In it unsupplied by the expression which they were once understood to convey. Such a word is " humbug," a slang term which at its first introduction a century and a half ago had j not the meaning Jt has been adopted for.
At first it seems to have denoted fussy and absurd alarm. But there were other expressions ior that; and by common consent, which often works with a mysterious rapidity and precision of agreement,
" humbug ” was presently seized upon to carry a budget of cognate ""“meanings which had never been got Into two syllables before. Slang or not, then, here was a genuine word~a word of worth more than many others; yet to this day it has never overcome the stigma of its origin. The sound of the word, even the look of it on paper, recalls with undiminished cm-, phasls its birth !n slan&. In vain has it been admitted Into the most respectable dictionaries. Because of its ugliness it\ remains slang; and innocent as its meanings are of the base suggestion which is the charm of slang to so many of its connoisseurs, It w’ill * stand under that condemnation for many a day yet. But It. is not to be given up on that account. Careless of the little music in its syllables, J.he wise lexicographer will show the word n humbug ” to its place in the English dictionary with all the ceremony that befits its worth.
But that is not always done. All__thc dictionaries have this "word nowadays, with other slang products of similar merit And that is well, or would be If the best of them were no longer ticketed as vulgar. Rarely, however, does the lexicographer consider himself at * liberty to forget their origin or to omit mentioning It as irregular. After a hundred years of such service in the ranks as no other Word could supply, ** humbug-M cannot bo re-entered on the roll without a marginal reminder that it is quite without gentility. “Iiondon Academy*	~

It is the style of young people and of a young nation. “ The solid eternal granite lay heavy in its statics across the possibility of even a whisper ” is hardly a successful sentence. But here is a happy picture:
“ The moon rose. The night has strange effects on tho hills. A moment before they had menaced black ;ind sullen against the sky, but at tbe touch of tho moon their very substance seemed to dissolve, leaving in the upper atmosphere the airiest, most nebulous, fragile, ghostly simulacrums of themselves you could Imagine in the realms of fairyland. They seemed actually_to float, to poise like cloud-shapes about to dissolve. And against them were cast the Inky silhouettes of three fir trees in the shadow near at bund.”

i The Women Take Highest Honor* In Contemporary i	Fiction.
Although many men are making huge fortunes by writing fiction it would really seem
as if some cf the
best novels from all quarters are destined to be the work of women. I scarcely think that among books published within the past year or so I could name four novels written by men that have given me anything like the same amount of pleasure as four written by women— Mrs. Humphry Ward, John Oliver Hobbes, Miss Robins, and Miss. May Sinclair.— Clcmont^Shoiter in Tho London Sphere.

Mm. Humphry Ward viiiist is in religion, that the Necessitarian is in philosophy; and Mrs, Humphry Ward Is a philosophic Calvinist of the- straitest sect. Neither William Ashe nor Lady Kitty Bristol is a free agent. Ashe is rounded and flattened and crushed into
the orthodox mold by the.to him irresistible pressure of English tradition and public opinion; but it is against his will. The same pressure produces on l^ady Kitty no effect, or rather a contrary effect, for it drives her the faster toward the doom to which her inherited character had predestined her. The transformation of the laughing philosopher into the solemn statesman, and the struggles of the wretched woman with her unconquerable gypsy blood, are drawn with a I sharp and searching pen. It is one of Mrs. Ward's greatest ’achievements, and the sombre picturc so aroused our scientific interest that wc quite forgot who the ghosts might be, and decided to leave ! the identification of “ the men and wo- ! men well known to an.earlier England” 1 to the Escotts anil Cojuu*^iu-*ys Lind other
