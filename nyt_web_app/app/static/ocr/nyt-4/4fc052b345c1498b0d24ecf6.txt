■	"by Arnold Guyot Cameron. A. M., Ph. D., Wbodhull Professor of French In Princeton University. 12mo. New York: The Aracr-lean Book Concern.
The editor of this collection of French short stories has the idea that tho first thing to do Is to inspire the student with the French spirit—to show him, and make him warm to, the glory of the things In which the Frenchman glories. Prof. Cameron would have you feel the-thrill of the martial spirit as the Frenchman feels it, and catch hfs enthusiasm for France—nay, for his native Normandie or Brittany or Picardle.or Provence or Gas-
-	cony—for the Frenchman’s pride Is as local as, say, the Virginian's, to whom his . native cOunty means often aa much as his State. *
What fs more, Prof. Cameront through his introductory enumeration of France’s splendid achievements in arms and literature, through his catalogue of her great names, ancient and modern, as well as through the selected tales themselves, does manage to make you feel yourself as. you read more or less of a vainglor-. Ious Frenchman—meaning by the word vainglorious no term of reproach, Heine said he learned French by listening to a soldier of Napoleon drum, especially the ‘'Marseillaise*' and the '* Ca ira”; this Is a method somewhat'similar, and effective in somewhat the same fashion. The more so as the Napoleonic legend, which so inspired Heine, is here, too, t given the first place, as striking the key of the predominant note of the French character—thirst-for martial glory. For ! this purpose the stories of M. d’Esparbes —little tragedies of heroism, with a touch of grim humor in the midst of their ex-Station—are singularly effective. There Is! not space to show how the idea . is carried out in the other fields by the selections from MM. Marin, Le Braz, Claretie, Copp4e, but carried out It is. The chief trouble about the book is the singularly Involved style in which it has pleased Prof. Cameron to express himself sometimes, both In his introduction and in the running notes. Observe the i following on Plutarch:	*	i
A Boetlan Greek, a traveled philosophi-
cal professor, priest, and patriot^ Imgaor-tal principally, by his analytical and anecdotic biographies of fifty famous men, including' -parallels between eighteen ; Greeks and eighteen Romans, which, as I “ Plutarch's Lives of Illustrious Men," has been by Its ideal and its Influence one of the greatest Impulses In human progress.
j These trivial matters aside, students of ; French who wish to make themselves fit *.o understand a Frenchman in something I more than a mere verbal sense will do well to get hold of Prof. Cameron’s little volume ot *' Tales of France.’’
