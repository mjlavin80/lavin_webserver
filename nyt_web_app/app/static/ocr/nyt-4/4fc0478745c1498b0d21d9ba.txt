| _ CRITICS AND CREATORS. i ________________________
What a very different thing the " Editor’s Easy Chair ” that now is of Harper's Magazine is from the Editor’s
Easy Chair that was when George wili-iam Curtis occupied it! One may say that, of course, of all the forms of Franklin Square publications, saving only the old magazine which, in the tody of it, retains the excellent tradition bequeathed to it from the times when it was the only American magazine, a tradition which we may rea-, sonably hope it will continue so long as the present veteran controls-it, so much to its advantage. But the Easy Chair of Mr. Curtis commanded an outlook upon all forms of human activity. The Easy Chair of Mr. Howells ignores all but the literary form, while it deals with that in the temper not cf a serene reminiscent b&t of a very active partisan. '
Mr. Howells, indeed, in Ms capacity of critic, seems to have undergone m'-ich the same sort of disappointment that has befallen his master and exemplar, Count Tolstoy, in the came fia!d. He is allowed to decry the idols of the hour, even the “ best selling ” historical novels of it. Nobody seems to saitid. Not even the publishers of the best sellers rush to their defense and to the attack upon the assailant of tfcem, The reaction for which the critic looks as a proof that his shot has gone home does not occur. He must seem to himself like the voice of one crying- in the wilderness. So must Count Tolstoy seem to himself. Everybody knows the form Which the reaction against free speech takes in Russia, It comes in the form of an arrest, a seizure of per’ sons and papers, in case cf contumacy, in that of an exile to S^iteria! Yet, Count Tolstoy can go on publishing, in The London Times, the desirableness of
applying the Christian Gospel in its
literalness to the social an3 political conditions of Russia, and none of these
unpleasant things happen to him. He simply continues to cry aloud in the streets and no one regards him. Similarly in all the organs of opinion open to him, as, in fact, every or^an of opinion in the English language would be if he showed a disposition to avail himself of its hospitality, the American veteran continues to denounce the way the literary world is going. A very big public, not so much smaller than that infuriating 'public of the best sellers, reads him gladly. But nobody dees anything to him* It must be disappointing. We are inclined to think that the reason is the same in both cases. It is the official Russian conviction in one case, the popular American conviction , in the other that, in the first place, the critic is much too nice to quarrel with, and in the second place, that what he says does not really much matter.
In the current Easy Chair, if one may attribute currency to an article of furniture' that presumably rolls on casters, he who sitteth thereon presenting himself under the flimsily transparent disguise of “ Eugenio,” and " a veteran author," expresses, with much felicity, the objection which obtains, in creative circles, to being criticised at all. The specific point is that Mr, Howells appears to himself in the light of a vet-
eran author who is nevertheless alway8 breaking new ground, but who cannot" prevail upon the irrespojiflrtl^ft^tftdMebi* reviewers to fregard "faith that light. The reviewers being, as he questionably assumes, by hypothesis young, refer his latest story to those of his earlier j stories with which they happen to be-i familiar, and find precedent for the ex* cellences end the defects, referring them a.U alike to their preconception of hia woi-k. It does not matter to the 1 creator, or pioneer, whether they praise or blame these conformities. His griev-
i
| ance is that they find them conformi-' ties when bis vsry point is that they a*e not conformities, but new depart: ures.
It looks like a case of inappreciatlon,
; or misappreciation. But, really, Mr. Howells has not now to laarn that the Qualities on which authors value them-t selves are by no means necessarily the ! qualities for^ which their readers value them, Take, for example, a novelist who - is a favorite of Mr. Howells’s, partly on the ground that he was not a historical novelist nor eke a romancer, Anthony Trollope. No judicious reader can fail to see that Trollope strove mightily to differentiate hl3 heroines, the “ nice girls " whom he so ; outrageously adulates; that to him | there was cne glory of Mary Thorne | and another of Lucy Robarts, and another of Lily Dale. ^But it is impossi-: ble for the most willing reader to follow his distinction. The most willing , reader has simply to lump the heroines i as nice girls. To him, saying that their I individual peculiarities ware lost In i their family likeness, Trollope would doubtless have retorted with rude language. But here we are confident that Mr. Howells would speak as a reader and a reviewer, and would assert that Trollope had not broken new ground, as he falsely imagined himself to have J done.
The real point of the discussion be-[ tween tae critics and the creators Mr.
Howells puts searchingly. It is the ; necessary dislike of the creator to be criticised because criticism is definition and definition is limitation, and nobody likes to have his limitations set down. " To be taken for granted in any wise,” says Mr. Howells, "is to be limited.” " Now, Eugenio's theory of himself was that he was not limited.” Alas for human nature, that is the case. Hence real criticism can never, by the nature of the case, be relished by the creator, who necessarily prefers indiscriminate praise, Indiscriminate because unlimited and unlimiting.
