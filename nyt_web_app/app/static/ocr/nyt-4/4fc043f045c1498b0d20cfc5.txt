“ Art is long	and life	is short,"	really	I
too short for novels of 544 closely printed pages 1	■
In “ Return ” the authors tell a love-' J
story with plenty of color and movement;' I
with a “strenuous'* heroine,	an	over--;;;
angelic hero, several minor romances, .
various historic persons and events, -
Indians galore; a tragedy, a search, a /
finding—the baby, “Return," being the-
deus ex machina. It is all very well done, *
vivid, dramatic; but the story is too over- :
crowded with characters: there are too
many side issues, and so much too much .'
of it! Moreover, the heroine, Diana Cha-ters, oversteps the extreme limit of the , reader’s forbearance, not to speak of sympathy, and he loses patience with young Marshall for his persistence In loving her.
Those who care for-.the “ neo-hlstoric school of fiction will be interested in the fairly successful attempt to reproduce tne~ people and'scenes of Colonial South Caro- ' Una and Georgia, and in the portraits of’ Oglethorpe and Whitefield,. (the illustra- -tions, by the bye. are singularly modern * for nearly 200 years ago.) but the readers -of “ Return ” neet to have detached mlnd3 • and abundant leisure. Not a little excision as well as condensation would have greatly improved a vigorous story. .
