Sir Charles JEKpt’s BooK About tbe British Protectorate and the
■	-	Syndicate.*	‘
PTER three and a half years as tils Majesty's Commissioner for tbe East Africa Protectorate, Sir Charles Eliot, who wrote " Turkey in Europe " under the pen name ot "^Odysseus," is wen qualified to tell an interesting story about xhls interesting land* His work on the country is written with the avowed intention of calling attention to what he says are the advantages and attractions it oners, both in climate and products, as a field for European colonization. But Sir 'Charles goes further than that, and shows this British possession to he a paradise for big-game sportsmen, goes into a very full history of its geographical position and history, its slave record and Its missions, and throughout makes the book a most readable one, even to those who have no intention of being lured to it by the globing "pictures he paints.
Sir Charles tells, incidentally, in a preface how it was that he came to resign his position, which leads to the impression that our oversea cousins who occasionally delight to tell how we are dominated by corporate interests have not been able to find the mote in their, own eye. He was ordered, he says, to cancel grants made by him to private persons which were in uniformity with his general instructions, for the reason, that these grants, which were relatively small, were infringements on native: rights. At the same time he was ordered to make a grant ten times as large to the East Africa Syndicate. He would gladly .have reasoned this untenable position with the foreign Office, he says, but as it was not disposed to listen to argu* ments Sir Charles quit. Yet he is loyal to the home Government and to the country which lie ruled, and which he says fs essentially a white man’s' country, inasmuch as it contains large and open tracts over 5,000 feet high with a scanty native population, a healthy and temperate climate, in spite ot the "fact that it is bisected by the equator, and a soil excellent for pasturage and agriculture. It is a possession of no small importance, and merits far more attention than it has so far received.
The Uganda Railway, which, by the way, does not touch Uganda, but runs from Mombassa on the coast to Victoria Nyanza, 5S4 miles, cost the British Government six millions, and annually two or three hundred thousand sounds are expended on grants, without. Sir Charles says, any appreciable return. He is surprised that the public, after expending this enormous sum on building a railway, should take so little interest In the result of that building or In the countries through which tt passes. Sir Charles hopes that in time the Colonial Office will take hold of the affaire of the country, and, managed with more system and experience, he feels that It will rapidly advance In prosperity.
Waxing enthusiastic, the writer says that if it is properly administered the Ea^t Africa Protectorate will become a flourishing: European colony. As such it '-vill have in virtue of its position in "Equatorial Africa a more than national im-portrvE.ee; its development will mean the opening of a new world, and its destinies will influence the whole continent On the west it borders on Uganda and ihe sources of the Nile, whence it is now proposed to regulate the water supply cf Egypt. There is already fairly regular communication with Khartoum in the north and through Tanganyika and Ny-assa with the south. Both travelers and goods are beginning to use the Uganda Railway as a route to the Congo. On the eastern side the accessible information is ampler for the British possessions than for the* or hers, and it would seem that the high, healthy plaUau is continued, at least intermittently, through German and rort^sncse territory to Rhodesia and the Transvaal. On the whole there is a considerable area, Sir Charles says, in which Europeans can live and from which they can direct exploration and development oE the territories less suited to their residence. In spite of the fact that Africa in general is low lying and tropical, Sir c karles asks if there is any reason why i i time it should not be as civilized and humanized as Southern India. He says:
I doubt not that before Africa can be so changed hecatombs of lives will be offered in every important locality, tutt to me this contest with the powers of n;*ture seems a nobler arnl mole profitable .struggle than the inteinational qtiarn-Is which waste the brain and bhmd of Europe and Asia. A time must come when militarism will b“ f'-It to Ik- intolerable, and it will be recognized that the fighting and self* sacrificing instincts will find a better expression in feats of endurance and exploration than in obeying the dictates of national animosities.
Considerable attention was directed to Sir Charles's former domain late in llKJtf by the proposal to make part of it a

Zionist colony,, the part knOwA, AS the ! Uasin Gfshu plateau. While such' a coio-: -nization scheme generally-* has been-deemed'impossible of execution, itoS' au-
thof's remarks on the suhjcflt^fti'e Inter-estlng*. It appears that whea the. plateau was uninhabited and the: Zionist proposal was made he gave it a sort of qualified * assent bee a use he thought the Zionists
Would bring capital Into'the country and
because the locality was remote from all other Europeah settlements. Then came a rush of Europeans a year later, while the Zionist scheme still held fire, and Sir Charles amended his views:
It is practically certain that In the near future all thi3 surrounding area will bo occupied by people of British race, and being so, though I am no anti-Semite, I greatly doubt the expediency of puttint? in the midst of them a botly of alien Israelites. To do this is to reproduce that distribution of population which has been the bane of Eastern 13urope and Asia-Minor, namely, enclaves of races with business capacity, such as Jews and Armenians, who differ in language, religion, and manner of life from the surrounding Russians and Turks, with the result that racial hostility is inevitably produced.
Sir Charles also thinks that such a colonization scheme would not benefit the Jews, and that the district is too small to materially relieve the congestion of \ the Russian and Polish towns. He thinks also that they cannot be made agricultur- ! ists. which is not flattering to his ex- j perience. Sir Charles also discourages ; the scheme for Indian colonization, for the Indians, he says, send their money to India instead of spending It In the country of their residence.
Although the Uganda Railway was built at a time when the wants of the colony were little known, it is the general opinion, shared by Sir Charles, that it justifies itself, and that by proper management much can he done with it. There must have been some amusing features con-. nceted with its construction, lor the natives stole railway material as uoon as it was put down. A railway, says the author, appeals in the strangest way to both sexes of African natives. Telegraph wires art- regarded as a most ornamental and desirable article of female attire, and the male sex find, in various bolts and rivets, weapons obviously intended for braining their enemies. One could imagine what would happen tn European countries if tho telegraph wires were pearl necklaces, and the rails sporting guns, so it is not surprising that the African yielded to temptation.
Kuropeans can live in the East Africa Protectorate, and so can the children of Europeans. New Yorkers will be likely to concede that the climate is all right after this statement from Sir Charles;
This, of course, does not mean that the climate has no faults. Europeans, although not critical of climate near home, become exceedingly exacting in their demands as to the tropics. To my mind the worst climate I have ever experienced is that of New York, which presents alternately ttvi disadvantages of the arctic and the torrid zones; but I never heard of any one being deterred from going to America by climatic considerations.
If tbe game in the Protectorate Is as big and vigorous as some of the stories which Sir Charles, not always on his own authority, tells about it the place must indeed be a sportsman’s paradise. The elephant is looked on by the natives as being a human, respectable sort of a beast, and there is a story 4n Taveta that a‘ native woman once met a huge tusker’ who appeared to be in a furious temper and was disposed to stop her. Although half dead with fear, she bad the feminine intuition to pluck a bunch of ijrass and offer it to the elephant. The creature’s demeanor at once changed; he accepted the offering-, picked another bunch himself, and with a graceful wave ot the trunk offered it to the lady, tor whom he now most courteously gave way.	.
The stories about lions take the palm, however. Some of these. Sir Charles says, are “ exaggerated,” but more are true than the skeptical stay-at-home pub-lie is inclined to believe. One tells about a lion entering a first-class railway carriage and carrying off a passenger, and the author says it always seemed to him that there was a touch of humor in the emphasis placed on “first class,” us if the oth-?r classes offered a safeguard. The mo?t .-t-markable yarn is one lor which Sir Charles will not vouch, but it was tokl to him very often, he says, by an oxer lie-it man who appeared to believe it himself and resented incredulity in others.
He was marching up the country with a caravan of donkey?, which usually went very slowly. One day they went at tho most unusual speed, all except one which lagged behind. It was as much as the rest of the caravan could do to keep up wit Ii	When	they arrived In c;imp
a very :;imph' and natural explanation of this haste was discovered. A lion had got in among the donkeys the previous night and had devoured one entirely—ears, hoofs, and all. with the result Lhat he
overall' himself to such an extent that he
could hardly move. In the gray, uncertain U^ht of the dawn he had been taken for the missing donkey and saddled with the rest. In his gerg**d and torpid condition he offered no resistance and trudged along with his load, but the other don-tteys, recognizing his tmell, wore much alarmed and ran ahead as fast as they coul<3.	■'
At least If donkeys cannot be mistaken for lions, Alrcsdales can, for a traveler Whose two dogs ran anead of him for some distance, had them shot by a hunter who was looking for some easy game to bring'
