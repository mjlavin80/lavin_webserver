A NOVEL BY NORRIS.
“ Barham of Bettana " Is a Great Im* . provement on Soine of His'- , Recent Stories.# '	.
NORRIS has forged . far ahead of his novel of Lord Leonard the Lucltiess," pubr\ llslied two year3 ago. That story, although giving * evi-: dencc of~ very; real powers, was almost as luckless as
•	its hero, and we remember it as but-weary reading. “ Barham of * Beltana,*’
. on the other hand, 13 fresh; .vigorous,
: interesting: orlghial in its situations*.
unusually clevcr in its dialogue. The :. reader. Is genuinely sorry when the'last
■	page is reached—and Sam Weller s def-
■	inltion of “ the great art o’- letter writin* *’ is equally true of the art of fiction.
The book has an added charm* from the : novelty of its locality. Is it not the first
■	romance with Tasmania as Us setting?* The most comprehensive maps fall to
•	discover Be l tana—across the Derwent from Hobart, we are told; but we do find Beilerive so situated, for which “ BCUann ” may be the. slight disguise. So full of Interest is this new land that it is much to be regretted that the Barhams soon depart for the mother country via Malta, arid that Mr. Norris Is not as loyal td* the Colonies as is the Senior Barham.
•	The story holds two 'pairs of lovers,
-	“ well set up,” healthy minded young . people, riot as exciting.afe lovers In novels
arc wont to be, but infinitely more comfortable to live with, inasmuch as they have other occupations' than love-making and other loyalties and affections than those absorbed by the beloved object. They behave well, these young people, under very trying circumstances.
Their elders, however, hold the centre of the stage. The protagonist who gives the tale its title is a virile figure; an un. couth, unmannerly, masterful Australian, who *%never from first to last was In-defjted to anybody but himself; never had to thank a single fellow-mortal for aid, pecuniary or other.'* He abhorred England, and “looked forward to the day ; when the United States of Australasia should declare their Independence."
-	Through him, by-the bye, we have interesting side lights upon Australasian poll-
■	tics’.. Nevertheless, “his bark is worse than . his bite," and, after air said and done, he
is a soft-hearted fellow, sure to be twisted around the . pretty finger " of his only daughter. “Mr. March?’-the ether father in the case, must surely be an English cousin of Mr. Howells’s delightful middle-
aged hero of the same name. He has .the same large tolerance, gentle ironies, clever way. of putting things. ^ For the rest, he has the shivering repulsions of the aristocrat and much " mute stoicism ” under poverty which necessitate spending his whole time “ in desperate endeavors to make a pint measure hold a quart." Qld “ Lady Warden ** is still another type,
1“ with her amazing eccentricities, her caustic tongue, her fiercely guarded secret, her long and unrewarded sacrifice.
All these diverse elders are alike, however, in a rather unusual sympathy v/ith the. young lovers. Barham, although in the prime of his powers, ** was conscious of having reached a time of life when we grow unselfish perforce. To get our own way In our declining years at the price of displeasing and disappointing the younger generation Is scarcely' worth while: more and more, important does it be.come to us that others should obtain their desires: less and less ardent are our own." Mr. March and Lady Warden-recognize that “ of all human passions love Is by far the strongest," and there is no greater opposition to the little god tlmn circumstances seem to make inevitable.
For, of course, there are obstacles, and things look pretty bleak for a while; but however one father may bufty and bluster and fhe other present a surface "of polished hardness, where there Is so much real sympathy deep in the paternal hearts tliere can be but one ending.
Mr. Norris conveys us ih*ther by ingenious winding ways, with well-kept surprises. sprung upon us at just the right mofnent. “ Barham of Beltana is a thoroughly enjoyable book. Mr. Norris must “ do it again," and next time he must permit us to tarry^fonger with Mm In that fascinating, topsy-turvy Sngland lying south of the equator.
