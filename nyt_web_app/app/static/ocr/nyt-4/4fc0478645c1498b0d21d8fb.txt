Will some one who can reach the eye or the ear of Mr. Andrew Lang- inform him that Dr. William Osier was appointed Regius Professor of Medicine at the University of Oxford about a year ago; that he was born In Canada and was educated in Toronto, Montreal, London, Berlin, and Vienna; that he got his degrees from Oxford, Aberdeen and Edinburgh as well as from American and Canadian schools; that he has been a lecturer at the Royal College of Physicians for twenty years; that he- has long been a member of the Savile Club in Piccadilly? Mr. X-ang infers that “ somebody/* an “American physician/' he thinks, “ has been proclaiming that a man is of no use in literature, art, or science, or not of much use, after forty.’' Mr. Lang’s inference shows that the perversion of Dr. Osier’s recent droll remarks by the sensational press of America and England has penetrated to his consciousness. But his manner of referring to the subject shows that he does not habitually read any newspaper. Mr. Lang's implication, however, that no man in America more than forty years old is worth much, except Mark Twain, is highly interesting.
