Quiller-Couch has a deft hand at character sketching:, and in this latest story of his one finds many character sketches and little story. In the blood: of the Rosewarnes was a strange mixture of patrician and peasant stoct. .For centuries the men alternated between reckless dare-devils and hopeless^weaklinss. As a young* man John Rosewarne had borne all the recklessness of his race; as an old man, he was still a majestic, commanding figure, stern, proud, even cruel, and looking back on the wild havoc of his youth ‘without visible regret. Although not a lovable character, as Mr. QuiHer-Couch presents him, still in John Rose-warne one sees a man to win-respect If not love. He was a figure diametrically opposed to his. son Samuel, a man steeped in Scriptural lore, and who interpreted the Bible literally to his own purposes. Peter Benny, on the contrary,' quoted few passages from the holy books, but loved his neighbor honestly as himself, an4^ saw nothing but blessings in the eleven small children which a bounteous Providence had seen fit to send him. And these characters, with Hester Marvin, robust Term Trevarthen, Mother Butson, Myra, and little Clem, the blind boy, together with many others, all alive and acting their parts in a sleepy little seaport town make up the company in Mr. Quiller-Couch’s " Shining Ferry.”
There Is a fine question of ethics as to the possession of old John Rosewarae’s estates after his death, which the author raises and which he allows Mr* Samuel to settle not exactly according to Scripture. although he had' his quotations always at hand. The development of the bruf« In the man, his petty tyranny; his final downfall, and repentance too late, all make part of the delineation of hi3 character rather than incidents in a dramatic plot.	_
In the book, too, runs the thread of a love story, but one is not vastly interested in this side of the tale, although -there is no reason to be other than-pleased at the ultimate happiness of Hester and Tom, and Nuncey, Peter Benny’s eldest daughter, and her Arche-laus Libby, a young man' great at figuring. but not “much to look at.
Mr. Quiller-Couch - has a goodly humor whlph saves his story from a certain* melancholy gloominess which it mlgh^ otherwise possess too abundantly. In the portrayal of the character of Peter Benny, the little man’s sweetness and strength, his big heart and gentle nature, there is a touch strangely recalling some of the better studies of Dickens.
