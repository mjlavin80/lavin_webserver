j The present eclipse of the wider public interest in the Near Bast due to the mo-mdntous activities of Japan in the Far . East Is’, of . course only temporary* Indeed* the domestic and other/troubles of Kussla, may. contribute powerfully to i change conditions in the Balking and hurry Events, there. The volume before us j undertakes .to supply, the. public •with Lihe. facts about the - Ottoman Empire, its relations with its subjects, with j the Powers and. with the smaller Balkan States/ and to that end employs upon. the various phases of the matter the pens of a number of persons who are familiar at.first hand with those phases. Edwin Pears, long leader of the Consular bar in Turkey, writes a description of the Turkish Government-theoretical and practical—which is most informing* James D.*BourchIer discusscs 'the Balkan States and their attitudes toward Turkey and Russia and. Greece and other interested parties. Evidently he thinks the Balkan States aim at ultimate independence and for the present prefer to have the Sultan in Constantinople. Victoria Buxton contributes a.: history of Turkish reforms—these chiefly on paper. A chaptcr by Luigi VHIari, ‘the editor, does something toward explaining the tangle of conflicting races and religions; another chapter shows up Turkish misrule in Macedonia, another the Macedonian, committees and the insurrection. The very important matter of the attitudes of. the Powers, Russia, Austria, Germany, Great Britain, is discussed by Valentine ChiroC^well known as a writer on the politics of the East, Far and Near, while special chapters by a Frenchman and an ' Italian respectively discuss the attitudes of France arid Italy/ Finally E. Hilton

: that the Turk must go, and that England, Frahce, and Italy, at least, have no Inter?
. est; In : delaying his. exit,. The qtiestion/ ' . says • Mr. * Bryce, i3 one of “ facilitating with* as little strife and bloodshed;as may be that extinction of Ottoman rule which is plainly inevitable.’* He avers that the governing class; in Turkey Is incorrigible. Itsrfaults are always the same. It cannot or wiil not change .the policy which has brought the , country . to ruin/1 This, though he aV&hits that 11 the present Sultan is; probably the ablest, and certainly the morf lndustrTous, who' has sat on the throne of Othman for; many generations/* He declares that, Mussulman and Christian almost equally will1 gain by the extinction . of Turkish rule, -and' everything in the other contributions seems to buttress , that opinion.

The plain question is this: Whether Turkey Is to pass to certain greedy States already overgreat—Russia chiefly, Austria and Germany secondarily—or whether the aspiring little nations which have been carved out of Turkish territory are to fell heir to the whole. And if so, whether it shall be Greeks or Slavs, specifically Bui’ gars, who are to inherit. You gather the impression that the Bulgars at least are very touch alive and full of ambition. Already they’ have made head against Russia. Mr. Bryce insists that at all events the desires of the Balkans themselves deserve consideration at the hands of the giants.. These Balkan aspirations are some of the many factors to any Intelligent consideration of the whole vexed question1 which the book puts at the disposal of the reader. It is a most informing and interesting volume and may well contribute materially to one of the best causes in existence—the cause of civilization against the Turk/ and the' Powers, his guardians.	.
