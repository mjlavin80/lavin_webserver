A*cic York Times Hook Review:
Concerning the alleged continuation of ** The Mystery of Edwin Drood ” by Wilkie Collins, as to which C. W. Thompson (“ Queries,” April 15,) Inquires, Charles Dickens the younger, in his introduction to the novel, has this to say:	*’	I have
frequently been asked by unknown correspondents lor particulars of a continuation of Edwin Drood, which is supposed to have been written by Wilkie Collln3 ‘ at the request of the Dickens family.’ Of course there is no such book. Neither the Dickens family nor Wilkie Collins would have entertained such an idea for a moment." The titles of several other *' continuations ” of Dickens’s groat novel are given in the introduction alluded to. All these were pure guesswo'rk, as " no Clue to the plot or to the manner of *ts working out was found among Charles Dickens’s papers after his death."
