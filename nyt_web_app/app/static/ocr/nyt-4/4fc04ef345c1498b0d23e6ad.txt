• ' 1 • HE enthusiasm and ingenuity with which Mr. Walter Littlefield supports his reading of Dante*s reference to the fair form that Inspired the love of Paolo and Francesca give charm and interest to a controversy that would otherwise be somewhat profitless. Neither in the sense of history nor in the sense of poetic art does it make much difference whether the " bella persona ” belonged to Paolo or to Francesca. But it is all-JmPortant that here and throughout the Commedla we should i catch the poet’s true meaning in every I line* the meaning that was in his own thought.	-
i The argument from grammar might be considered convincing, tout the whole structure of the passage throw's such a revealing light upon “its purport that no one need go wrong about it. In modern editions of Dante the tercets are made apparent to eye and sense by indentation. That device of the printer's art is here of the high' est service in making the poet's *mean-I ing unmistakable:
Amor, ehe al cor gentll ratto s’ap^ j	prende,
;	Prese costui della bella persona
i	Che ml fu tolta, e il modo ancor
m'offende.
' Amor, che a nullo amato amar per*
I	dona,
Mi prese'del costui piacer si forte Che, come vedi, ancor non mi abban-dona,	•
Amor condusse noi ad una morte.
In these lines, the thrice-repeated word “ love ” beginning each tercet, Francesca tells Dante three things: 1. How and for what reason love seized Upon Paolo, li. How and for what reason love seized upon her. 3. How love led thom to one death. Love flamed up “ quickly ” (ratto) In Paolo's heart. Love seized upon her heart " strongly ” (forte)—so strongly that it holds her yet. That is the how of it. The why of it is equally clear.
Paolo’s love was kindled by the fair form (la bella persona) of Francesca, riven by a violent death from her soul, which is telling the story of it to the poet. Francesca's love was kindled by the joy Paolo had in her, (del costui placer,) a meaning that is imposed upon us by the law of the amatory world just cited by her, that love " excuses no loved one from lovinc." In other words. Paolo's passion kindled hers. Finally, love was the slaying of them both.
The arrangement is almost too beautifully logical for poetry. The first tercet tells what love did to the sw'ain, the second what it did to the lady, the third what it did to them both.
Novy this fine, orderly succession of the thought is broken up, the perfect balance is destroyed, the technic becomes lame and halting, and confusion enters if we accept Mr. Littlefield's reading. For then we should be left quite in the dark as to why it was that Paolo so quickly fell in love with his brother’s wife, and the del costui placer motive of her love for him is bereft of its mate and counterpart in the reciprocal bella persona motive of the preceding tercet. It was Dante’s purpose to tell us that Francesca’s beauty won Paolo’s love. If Paolo had been the possessor of this beauty of person he would have found somewhere about the Rimini grounds a' fountain over which, like Narcissus, he could have drooped gracefully in admiration of that supreme and incommunicable attribute. His grace of person would have formed no motive for loving Francesca; and as for her, she lost her heart to him for another reason, which she expressly mentions. Dante wouldn’t have so mixed things up. Besides, it is most ungallant for Mr. Littlefield to deprive the lady of this opportunity to tell her visitor how lovely she was “ up there,” a quite pardonable vanity in a soul.
We must remember that it is the soul of Francesca that speaks. This beautiful body that was taken from me, she says, kindled his love. The manner of Its taking off offends " her yet. That is, it is the cause of her eternal torment, for being slain in mortal sin without time for repentance she went down to hell, while Cunizza, wTho was an unspeakable sinner, (recto fiiia Veneris, the False Boccaccio calls her,) repented to such good purpose that Dante found her a ** blessed spirit " in Paradise. Manifestly it must be her

own fair form that she mentions as ■ having been taken away from her, for Paolo has never been taken away at all. He was very much with her, body and soul, after her marriage with his brother; the deception practiced upon her at the -wedding- did not prevent
that. He is with her yet, blown about in the dreadful wind and, as she says at the end of her discourse, “ never from me shall be parted," (mai da me non fia diviso.) Of course his body has been taken from himself as well as from her, but as that would inevitably have happened anyway, she would not amid so many preventable sorrows have dwelt on the matter.
Had the view Mr. Littlefield takes of this passage been the view of its author, I am confident he would have written “ Chi mi fu tolto who was taken from me," instead ot “ that was taken from me." In that case there would have been no ambiguity. But the ear of the poet would hardly have tolerated a line beginning with the assonance " chi mi."
For an opinion practically cotempo-raneous upon this passage we may turn to Giovanni Boccaccio’s “ Co-mento" prepared in 1373. This is Boccaccio's gloss:
" Prese costui." ciofi Polo, il quale quivi mostra essere in compagnia di lei; e di che il prese? " Della bella persona,” la quale io ebbi vivendo, " Che rni fu tolta,” quando uccisa fui: *‘ e’l niodo,” nel quale mi fu tolta, “ anco
m’offende," cio& mi tormenta.

That is, love “ ‘ was kindled in this one,’ that is, Paolo, who is here in her ^ company; and what kindled it? ‘The fair form ’ which I had while living.
*	That was taken from me * when I was slain. And The * way * in which it was taken ‘ still offends me,’ that is, torments me.”	C.	R.	M.
