|HEwBLy^Sl[ fiction, it plays with equal _ mastery on-all the stops of human emotion. At limes It iB as farcical as Dickens in'his most freakish moods;-at times it plucks at your heart with the irresistible pathos of a Lear mourning over Cordelia. The various actions of the | dramatic movement dovetail into one another, with inevitable consistency, leading up to a denouement which is simply Greek
■	in the grand lines of its Nemesis. Yet all ‘ Is deduced logically from the very human characteristics of the eponymous character who dominates the action with the placid cruelty of an Egyptian deity. And iback of it all there is the suggestion of a great social cataclysm which from one aspect might be called the Epos of the fall of the English landed gentry.
■	■ The character of Lord Bosket alone would be sufficient to place this book in a class by itself. At first sight a maudlin ** sport,” whose sole talk is of horses and drink in the vilest horsy and music hall slang, he turns out to be one of the truest and tenderest-hearted gentlemen that have been drawn in the pages of English fiction. If one could understand a Tom Pinch grafted on a Falstaff, one could get something like the diapason covered by Charles Bosket. It starts with the pure farce of his entry when he demands his " mornin* prayer ” (alias whisky and soda) from the butler, and declares that the water is very good water. He plays the part of a Greek chorus in the central scene of the fiction where Broke of Covenden lets loose his animal passion upon the Iove-hero, and thrashes him within an inch of his life without our losing respect for the thrashee. Lord Bosket voices the verdict of the gods In 1 declaring that the fellow “ took his gruel well. He is only a featherweight, but he was game right up to the finish. I like to see that. Give me the fellow or the horse that don't know when he is beat."
When the heroine—if she be the | heroine—shakes the dust of her father’s , house off her feet and takes upon tnem tho dust of a forty-mile walk through the Summer sun without food or drink to join her lover, It is Lord Bosket who rises to the occasion and rescues the stanch soul. And in one of the greatest scenes, of the book Lord Bosket ad, ministers two ceremonial spanks upon the ! cheeks of his priggish and henpecking wife as punishment for the aspersions she casts upon her niece.. TJiat scene alone, as Xord Bosket would himself say, is " worth the entrance money."
Take another test. Any one of any consequence can make something of the j principal characters of a novel. It is only your big man can give real vitality to the minor personages that flit across the stage. Yet there is not a character in this book which is not itself indlvl-j dual, however small the part it plays in the evolution of the action. Even Porson i the butler, a type of the machine-made and the machine-moved . man, suddenly develops a' pure spring of tenderness as he connives at the heroine’s evading the dinner table after her great adventure on the tower. “ If you Will forgive the I liberty, I don’t think If you were my | own daughter you could be more to me than you are.” That is a touch worthy of the divine William—I mean him of Mr. Shaw's " You Never Can Tell." Or take Mr. Breffit, Jr., in wha.t Is practically his sole appearance—at the luncheon table of the Brokes. When he finds he has been placed side by side with the Duke he immediately asks his Grace whether he knows Lord Huffey, and then canters him gently up and down the peerage from Lord Huffey to Duffey, and then to Tuffey and then to Snuffey. That is j pure Dickens, and is a direct crib from “ Blea'k House," but the retort of the Duke when he finds his interlocutor is the owner at third cost of one of his nearest relative’s estates is original and effective enough to create two minor characters.
The eldest son, Billy, and his milliner' wife, Alice, are etched in a few lines. Even the six sisters Broke, whose distinguishing characteristic is their Indis-tinguishability, develop traits, that enable one to place them in the memory, The imperious Joan and the impetuous Priscilla are differentiated- from the submissive Harriet, and from the heroic Delia, that chip of the old Broke block. But ..she, like *her father, s something more than a minor character.
In one respect, however, the eponymous hero shares the qualification of a minor Character In that he has very few lines to say. Yet the whole book Is dominated by his crass pride, his immovable stubbornness, his granite egotism. It is a wonder Lord Bosket does not call him *' Stony
-	Broke." His colossal family pride consti-

tutes what thi'*technical students of the drama call the enveloping action of this tragedy. Yet this Imposing personality speaks, but a couple .of thousand words throughout this very long novel. It is what he does, and how Jie does it, that constitutes his grandeur, anti rightly gives the title to the book, Just as - *' Julius Caeanr *’ is rightly named, though,-whether dead, or alive, the eponymous hero of that drama does not speak moVe than a couple of hundred lines.
And Mrs, Broke of Covenden is^a-worthy pendant, though her preternatural cleverness niid courage make her almost Impossible. The scenes between man arid wife at the end rise to almost Aeschylean intensity. They touch the very founts of life. It is difficult to read the last fifty pages of the book unmoved and un-wrought.
There Is only one doubt about the inherent greatness of the work, or, rather, the writer. It is great in a particular way and in a particular manner. Both way and manner are George Meredith’s. Even the style Is in large measure his, though without his anfractuosities. Almost every incident In the book may be paralleled from others in Meredith’s works. The tutor hero of the love incidents, half prig,- half knight, comes from ** Lord Ormont and His Amlnta,” the final catastrophe has reminiscences of both “ Rhoda Fleming” and " The Ordeal of Richard Feverel.” Even Lord Bosket has a forerunner in the Lord Pag«t of *' Beauchamp’s Career.” Broke himself is but another attempt in a coarser medium to build a statue to the " Egoist.”	JOSEPH JACOBS.
