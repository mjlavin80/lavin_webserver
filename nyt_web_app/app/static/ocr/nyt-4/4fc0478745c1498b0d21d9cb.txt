The author of this life cf Commodore Perry—the Commoi)orc Perry tn distinction from his brother, Matthew Galbraith Perry—has prepared a eulo;ry rather than a biography. Yet the result Is not wholly bad; *m fact, as an elementary history tlievbook Is good. It should make rather a good *' reador.”
Comparatively few persons appreciate how short was the career or’ Oliver Hazard Perry, He was born in 17sr», his father being1 a naval oficer. In 1700 he became a Midshipman on his father’s ship, the General Green, seeing- service during: the war witli Kranec and winning a Lieutenancy during the Algerian war while serving on the old Essex in 1804. In 1&13, after various years of pcace service, Perry was sent to Sackett’s Harbor, where Commodore Isnnc Chauncey commanded. From that place ho was sent to take command of Lake Erie, and, building most of his vessels, sailed out of Erie to meet the British flotilla, and defeated it on Sept. 10,	In	the	Canadian
campaign he had distinguished himself also on land, receiving the thanks of Gen. Harrison for his gallantry at the battle of the Thames on Oct. 4th of the
same year. Thereafter ho was sent a5)
second in command of the American squadron in the Mediterranean, and in the Summer of 1S10 was sent to Venezuela as tin envoy for a purpose which Mr. Lyman omits to mention. (It was to negotiate a treaty of friendship and commerce, however.) There he was stricken with fever, from which he died on Aug. Ii3, 1S19, his birthday. He had just completed hia thirty-fourth year. He was buried at Port of Spain, Trinidad, and seven years later his body was brought to his home, Newport.
Mr. Lyman has padded his book tremendously, and has Indulged in " fine writ-fng ’* of the worst sort. In fact, his life of Perry seems as if it had been prepared orislnaJly as a lecture, with pat- j riotic passages to be declaimed at an audience. The author Is very chary of dates, and almost everything that one looks for
