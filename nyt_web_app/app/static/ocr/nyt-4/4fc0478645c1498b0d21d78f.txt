Following this rule, therefore, and i studying the works of those whom he j loved to study, together with his own, j I think one can reach the best inter- j pretatton, for it will be the exposition j of Dante according to -.Dnnte. and I therefore believe it to be the only interpretation of the sacred poem.

Dante's ** Divine Com media.”
AYic York Times llook Rtvicir:
Your notes on Dante have so interested me that I take tho liberty of adding my mite, a liberty which I hope may be permissible to one who spent three years of his literary course on the study of the " Dlvina Commetfia "—the Opus Magnum—to which Dante owes the glory which has in the past, and will in the future, attest to the height of excellency
to which the human Intellect can reach.
Mr. Walty Littlefield Is vecy right in saying Dante asserts tnat " White Is white and black Is black,” while other commentators and translators say, " He means gray or possibly light brown."
Now the meanings of the "DivinaCom-media ” are various—that is. literal, figurative^ and political. Political from the condition of the political troubles of Italy at the time in which he .wrote; figurative if referred to moral truth, and mystic if referred to God's scieneo and doctrine. Much light is given to a student of Dante's works from a letter which “Dante Alighieri wrote to Can Grande' della Scala, Lord of Verona (in whom Dante placed his hopes for the deliverance of Italy; he is twice remembered in the author’s writings—in the first song of the " Ihferno’* and the seventeenth of the " Paradiso/') ' This letter, <5*hlch is still preserved in Italy, gives the poet’s own idea o£ the meaning1 of his works. It becomes to tho reader the Ariannc's thread by which he can enter the‘labyrinth of the poet’s mind, and easily move about the intricate periphrases of his poem. In thte-fetter the following quotation is to. be found: “ When Israel catne- out of. Egypt and the house of Jacob/from* among a strange people, Judah was his sanctuary and Israel, his dominion."_____/The words merely
stated the departure - of Israel from Egypt:	the	allegory alludes to our re-
demption by Christ; the moral meaning refers to tho freedom of the* soul from the slavery of sin; the mystic alludes to the passage of the soul lrmn the. bonds of present corruption to eternal Joy nyid glory. ,	.	.	.
