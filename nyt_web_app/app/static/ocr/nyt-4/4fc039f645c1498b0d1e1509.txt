| A vivid picture of conditions In the old-Cnarlestown in the Colonial days -of Soutli Carolina Is litre presented in simple | fashion by a writer who says In her preface that the book -was not a deliberate I act, but the result of enthusiasm engen-; dered by the reading ot what she calls a i " wonder story ” of the early days,
| charged with the spirit of the men of brawn who became the country's fore-i hears. There are three strong characters ( in the story—Goy. Johnson, who struggled 1 between love of iifs comrades and duty to his King; Mistress Damaris, his daughter, who is really a wonderful type of fern-lnine mystery; and her suitor, Capt. Martin Maynard, Indian fighter, pirate hunter and general lion of the camp.
The book deals much with the conditions which led to the rebellion against the Lords Proprietors, but the story itself hinges upon the love of Maynard and the flightiness of Damaris, who covers her true heart with a mask of frivolity. Maynard pleads his love, but is repulsed •with a half promise which may or may not mean anything. Maynard’s heart is further tortured by the attentions Dam-aris receives from a London beau named Francis Yonge, who is half villain, half noble. In a moment of despair Maynard sets sail for ljhjgland. His vessel is captured by pirates. He escapes, but Daxna-ris does not know this. To one ot the pirates who come ashore to demand a medicine chest as ransom for some of the prisoners she gives some flowers and asks him to deliver them to the supposedly captive Maynard with a message which xrould certainly have gladdened the despairing lover had he received it. The pirate, alas, looks upon the wine and misses his chance to deliver the gage d’amour, with the re/ult that when Maynard returns his cold manner stirs tlie wounded pride of Damaris to rage, Maynard presently goes off pirate hunting, and while he is absent the girl, in a moment of pique, gives her hand to Yonge. At the same time a dying pirate on the deck of a ship which Maynard has attacked hears him addressed by name and with his dying breath gives the message. Maynard comes home happy, only to be hurled to despair once more by the news of the troth of Damaris and Yonge.
In time the mistake becomes apparent, but the giTl will not break her word already made. Maynard on two occasion? after that saves the life of Yonge, once nursing him in the forest through a contagious sickness. Finally, struck by the nobility of Maynard and the loyalty of Damaris, he releases her from her promise just at the moment when Charlestown is in the hands of the rebels and Gov. Johnson and his daughter are leaving for England. It Is a picturesque tale, prettily told.
