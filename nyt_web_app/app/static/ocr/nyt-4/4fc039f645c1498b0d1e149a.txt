Prof. Folix Adler's volume on the principles, purposes, and Ideals of the ethical culture movement, “ Tlie Tteligion of Duty,” to appear in a fortnight through McClure, Phillips & Co., has a preface by Louis Willis Sprague, who edits the book. Mr. Sprague says:
There has been a growing demand on the part of many people interested in the ethical and religious problems of the age for a book by Prof. Adler, giving the results of his thought and practical work along these lines. To gratify this demand has, naturally, been a wish on Prof. Adler’s part, but -his exacting labors as leader of the Society of Ethical Culture of New York City, and his Interest in the constantly enlarging international fellowship of ethical societies, together with Mg work as a university professor, and the no less exacting service of the various public causes which have challenged his efforts, have rendered impossible the needed leisure in which to formulate his thought and Kive .it appropriate literary expression. Through the past twenty-eight years, however, Prof. Adler has been uttering his best thought to the large audiences which have gathered on Sundays to listen to his teachings, and, fortunately, these public utterances, while delivered extemporaneously, have been faithfully recorded by capable stenographers, whose reports afford a large revelation of his best thought through these years. In the absence of a more carefully prepared volume, St has seemed that to draw upon these spoken addresses for some expression of those principles which are most central in Prof. Adler’s thoughts, and to place them within the reach of the many people who are anxious to know more fully the conclusion of this earnest moral leader* would be ’ a real service to the ethical and religious interests of-the present time. .
