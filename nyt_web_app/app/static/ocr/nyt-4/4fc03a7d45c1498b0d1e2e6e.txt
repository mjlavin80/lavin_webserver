ilfANDA OP TAB MILL. A novel, lijx Marie Van Voral. New York: £Jod<3i McaJ & Co, fl,60,	.	.	.	-
When the sun shone thus full on A man- i da she was as though molten in its rays— I a golden image 1 Such a pretty image | that the god. might well he enamored of I her and Infuse Tier; and fhis the full mid- I day «un of April—dtd.	’
These are the words -with which Marie Van Vorst opens her hook, ** Amanda ot the Mill," and introduces its heroine. In plain language, U means that little * Wanda Henchlfey, aged sixteen, standing on the hirch'bordered banks of Puddam [ Pond In primitive simplicity, is about , to take her first outdoor hath of the Reason,
The hath is in honor of a new pink .ribbon with which *Idanda wishes to adorn her pretty person, and the ribbon, picked up TU.ter hy Henry Euston, *' tramp, vagabond, drunkard,*» but of gentle birth, is a thread, a very slender one, in the web a of Amanda's love story.-'Mandfl. is a charming creature ot gray eyes and copper-colored hair, a tender, loving disposition, and strength of char- . acter which one feels later Mrs; Van Vorst maligns somewhat. The hath is a commentary upon' the family to which	■
Amanda belongs. •• Henchley’s ** is cue	,
of the "show"* places in this part of tha	:
backwoods of the South. It has three	)
rooms, while in the other shanties of the	-
hIJl-fOlfc whole families live, eat. and-	’
sleep in one. The Old “ grandmaw ** U a chief in the distillery trade, but clean and	:
respectable, and she has‘done what she	1
could for her two granddaughters, with	•
whom she Kves atone.	■
“ Ih cay n’t dew nothin’ fer *«m but to teach 'em manners 'n* to wash thayr	;
faces/' she says/’ Sometimes Ih dew recken lh ain’t worked ’em 'nowgh. AU 1 Ih ever ast o’ ’Maody and Lily Bud was	*
to act pretty 'n* look pretty."	.
Into this family comes, the sick and | drunken tramp, to fall in love with	I-
Llly Bud and later the agent of the rich I millowner of Kexington appears with a drag net, which takes in these happy,	■
easy hill-folk and draws them into the maelstrom of mill life and the atory really begins.
Mrs. Van Vorst paints with a strong hand the terrible life , in the mills, its women dirty* sodden creatures, the men	?
brutalized; pitiful httlo children working	.
through the,night shifts for a pittance— thin, scrawny, unwashed, and un-	,
nourished. It is Amanda and Euston who lead them eventually to better con-	.
ditions* Amanda by means of education and wealth, and Euston through his power as a leader. But the love story	:
Is not the satisfactory part of the book.	.
Amanda is sent to visit Grlscon, the millowner for several weeks, unchaperoned, except by a French maid, for the express purpose, apparently, of allowing him to fall in love with and ask her to	:
marry him, which he promptly does. Euston, whom Amanda has always loved, would be more of a man if	he	was	not	'
ready at the first mOment	to	giye	up
ihe work he has in hand and	ask	the	■
woman he loves to elope with	him, usurp-
ing the position of her own sister. Poor, silly, morally weak Lily Bud, with hex beauty gone and a slave to snuff-dipping is not a pleasing character, but it is hard to believe tlmt Amanda or the luminous gray eyes" and tender heart could have meditated so great a wrong. However, . Mrs. Van Vorst introduces a flood at the right moment which washes away Lily Bud and leaves Amanda and Euston sitting on a roof ready to commence life together, with no moral in- .' cumbrances, in a new, clean world*
