While the general reader may be familiar with the exploits of Preble and Decatur, as Mr. Gardner W. Allen says.
** the adventures of American seamen and Consuls among the pirates of the Med-iterraean have escaped notice, or are barelv mentioned in most histories.--’ In his volume are given many of these incidents, taken from the original records. As early as 1625 two ships from Plymouth were captured by the Salle rovers in the English Channel. Men from Boston and the neighboring towns were taken and doomed to Slavery. One among them was a Dr. Daniel Mason, who was a graduate of Harvard. He had sailed from Charlestown in lfiTS. and was taken to Algiers, ami nothing more was ever heard of him.
It was after our struggle for independence that the Barbary pirates thought to take advantage of our want of a navy. In 17fc4 an American brig, the Betsey, Capt. Erving. was taken by a corsair of Morocco and carried to Tangier. Her crew was not enslaved, and after six months she with the crew were sent back by the Emperor. He wanted to be at peace with the United States. In July of the next j year the schooner Maria of "Boston, Capt. Isaac Stevens, bound for Cadiz, was captured off Cape St. Vincent by an Al-zebec. and then followed the taking of the ship Dolphin of Philadelphia. All the men were carried to Algiers, and were treated with the utmost barbarity. Are wc to credit the story that the English Consul at Tangier applauded the acts of the Algerines? Be This as It may. , the Algerines were particularly engaged in the destruction of American commerce.
Several more American ships were captured. Occasionally some of the captives managed to send home a narrative of their shameful treatment by the Algerines. When approached by those who represented the American captives, the Dey behaved with the utmost impertinence. He made all kinds of demands, for money, arms; and stores. As to what ought to be done by the United States In the matter there were differences of opinion. Adams seems to have thought that all must be borne, for the reason that there was no help 'for lt.;Eewrote:* in 1784. “ As long as France,' England," Holland, and the Emperor, &c., will submit to be tributaries to these robbers, and even Encourage them;. tdywhat purpose could we make war upon them? ” But Jefferson was of a different mind; He wanted to know wMc&' would /be*, the cheaper, peace or wa£.a^, Was in favor of the latter.
