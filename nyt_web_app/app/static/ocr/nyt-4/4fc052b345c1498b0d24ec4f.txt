ADVERTISEMENTS.
MODERN ADVERTISING. By Ernest Elmo Calkina and Ralph Holden. Illustrated. Pp. acvlil.-SiJl. fivo. Cloth. New York: . D. Appleton & Co. $1.50 net.
The ordinary readcj, no doubt, classifies advertising with the practical and comparatively uninteresting details of business, but one who takes up this book will find with surprise that it Is not easy-to put, down, and will eventually finish it with a sense of entertainment and instruction. Though the authors have not succeeded in supplying a concise and altogether satisfactory definition of their subject* they have certainly produced a very readable book.
It Is rather a bold stretch of the imagination, verging almost on irreverence, to. call Napoleon the prototype of the advertising man, but the argument Is Ingenious and may be given for what it is worth.
Napoleon, following Barfire, contemptuously called Englarwi-a nation of shopkeepers. England keeps shop as well as the United States. The reason why she Cannot keep shop as effectively as we is largely because she cannot *' talk shop " as well. The same Napoleon who sneered at England's commercialism said that four hostile newspapers were more to bo dreaded than a thousand bayonets. Here is the real reason Tor our commercial supremacy. Napoleon sneered at shopkeeping, but bowed to the power of the press. America has forged from her press a power which has helped to make her shopkeeping the most wonderful in the world. The shop and the newspaper joined forces, and the result Is modern advertising. * * * Advertising has come to mean not merely the printed announcement of the merits of an article or an institution, but that high and unusual power of Impressing a great number of people with a given idea.	.
Modern advertising, as the authors understand it, is little more than half a century old. It began with the patent medicine announcements of the middle of the last century, but that form now “does not stand on the same high plane as the advertising. of commercial articles, and, possibly, never will. The advertising of manufactured articles—the real bone and sinew of commerce—is to-day the great field in which the best energy and best ability are being used.*'
But advertising to be effective must benefit the public as well as the ad\Ter-tiser and the medium. Here is what the authors have to say on this point:
It may be doubted if any other force, the public school system, the Church* and the daily press excepted, is acquiring so great an influence as advertising. To it we . largely owe the prevalance of good roads, rubber tires, open plumbing, sanitary underwear* water filters, hygienic waters, biscuit wrapped in moisture-proof
packages, and' breakfast foods at low g prices, well prepared. These are only a 8 few of the things which the public has I been taught to believe in and to demand.
Besides, it is saving time, simplifying bus- 1
iness methods, and reducing the number of I
intermediaries between the-producer and I
the consumer. Chapters are devoted re- §
spectively to the channels of trade, maga^
zines and newspapers, mural advertising,
the general advertiser, the advertising
manager, the general advertising agency,
retail advertising, mail-order advertising, ;
the mathematics of advertising, styles of "
advertising, and some mechanical details.
Many interesting stories are told of the
development of advertising. One concerning Hobert Bonner’s conversion to advertising on a large scale, if not entirely new, is worth repeating. One day Bonner sent, an eight-word advertisement to a newspaper marked “One line/' His handwriting was so bad that the receiving clerk read it .** One page so, next morning a page of the newspaper was covered with the announcement “ Read Mrs. South-worth’s New Story in The Ledger.*' Bon~ ner was thunderstruck, particularly because he did not have money enough to pay the bill, but orders for the paper poured in so fast that he soon recovered -his equanimity.
