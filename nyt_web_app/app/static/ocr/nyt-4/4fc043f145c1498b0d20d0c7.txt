Ami far bo it from me to deny that Socialism is a menace. It is its purpose to wipe out, root and branch, all capitalistic institutions of preSent-day society. It is distinctly revolutionary, and in scope and depth is vastly more tremendous than any revolution that has ever occurred in the history of the world. It presents a new spectacle to the astonished world—that of an “ organized, international, revolutionary movement.”
It is thus that Jack London speaks of Socialism in the course of his preface to “The War of the Classes,” bearing The Macmillan Company’s imprint. The book is made up of Socialistic studies, six in 1
! number, entitled ** The Class Struggle,” 1
: "The Tramp,” “The Scab,” “The Ques- i tion of the Maximum," "A Review,” and I
i *' Wanted: A New Law of Development,” and a chapter on “'How I Became a So-clallst,” which closes the book. It Is Mr. London's purpose, he points out in his preface, to enlighten, to “ some slight degree,’’ a few capitalistic minds. He writes:
The capitalist must learn, firs1^ and for always, that Socialism is based not upon the equality, but upon the inequality, of men. Next, he must learn that no new birth into spiritual purity Is necessary before Socialism becomes possible. He must learn that Socialism deals with what is, not with what ought to be, and that the material with which it deals is the *' clay of the common road,” the warm human, fallible and frail, sordid and petty, absurd and contradictory, even grotesque, and yet, withal, shot through with flashes and glimmerings of something finer and Godlike, with here and there sweetnesses of service and unselfishness, desires for goodness, for renunciation and sacrifice, and with conscience, stern and awful, at times blazingly imperious, demanding tho right—the right, nothing more nor less than the right.
