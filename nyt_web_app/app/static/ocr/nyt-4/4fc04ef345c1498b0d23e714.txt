I have just finished reading " The Marriage of William Ashe,” and it is to me a matter of regret that Mrs. Humphry Ward should have expended her fine power of description in creating such an unlovely character as Lady Kitty Ashe. The story is not only very pathetic, but the portrayal of Lady Ashe, to my mind, very much overdrawn and seldom realized in ordinary experience. While there were fearful mistakes in the lives of each, my sympathy goes out to William Ashe. That a man of such brilliant parts should have had his life embittered by a willful, wayward woman, lost to all reason and common sense, does not tend to improve the morals or elevate the sex.
