jVHE following note concerning
a brief. review of^ Mr. H. F...
Tozer's English translation ot
Dante’s u Commedia/' which
appeared in The new Yohk
.	* Times Book Review March
25, has been handed to me by the.editor:
■m v? JevI®wlne Mr. Tozer’s recently pub-. ilshed translation , of ’Dante’s " Divine Comedy,” your contributor, '* W. L..V suggests an interpretation of one famous rassage that seems to be entirely new. In the eplsoae of Francesca da Bimini," (In-femo V*;-100-2,) Dante says: :
"'Xmor, che £.1 cor gentll ratto s’ apprende, Prese costui della bella persona ' " Che mi fu tolta, e il modo ancor. mv of-', fende.”	.
*	-^r-	Tozer translates, following the
traditional interpretation, “ Love, that ingentle heart is quickly kindled, seized this^ one for the fair person that was taken from me in a manner which distresses me-still. This one ” is Paolo, Francesca’s lover; and “ the fair person " is Francesca’s own body, from which her soul was violently separated by her husband; and this sudden death stfil distresses her.: But. according to “ W. L.,” M Mf,^Toa;er falls into the error of his predecessors; " the real meaning is: “Love* * * seized him tthls one, i. e., Paolo] of fair person,” etc*	°	means by " etc.*' it
would be interesting to know, for, beginning In this way, it is quite impossible to translate the rest of the terzina quoted ‘ above; and, moreover, the antithesis of the following terzina is lost. If the proPosed new interpretation is original with' W. L., ■ he should not hide so important a matter in the obscurity of a criticism of the new (and superfluous) trans-: lation by Mr. Tozer; if it is derived from somebody else, perhaps he will cite his authority. I have no wish to defend Mr. Tozer in general, but in this case he may be right and the reviewer wrong. K. M. New Haven, March 25, 1005. ■	.

So polite a request for information should not be ignored. The translation, which has the approval---of K, M., has
*	+
also the support of all translators—Latin,1 French, German, Spanish et a?.—with whose work I am acquainted. The * episode of Francesca’s death explaining the significance of "modo" has equally numerous and distinguished indorsers among commentators.
. Strike a balance between the merits and demerits of translators and commentators, between the places they have^* cleared and the ways they have obscured^ and T am not sure which way * the* scales would dip. For the student,-.who would make a life’s-study of Dante1 and whoth circumstances-aid1 in making; -such a study from original* sources, they-are, for the most part, ' not only; superfluous, but distracting. Again and again does Dante assert that white is-white, that'black Is black, v J^otr so, say •the commentators; not-bo, echo-4he trane—. lators; he means gray or very. pocaibVy. ^ light brown. Let us consider the disputed^ passage, lii, the light ojt^an^^g^j^Tiem-^ porary history, and the poe^s rhetoric:	:•
**♦
** Prese costui .della bella persona,*’— took this* one of fine person—took this handsome- man here. As. the line stands] .. the words mean nothing.else. , Imagine.an^ Italian who had never heard of Dante andU.
•	Francesca - and their commentators. and; i ask him to paraphrase the entire passage,, with, the usual parenthetical JHustn*tions -taught him at school. He would unhesi-(tatingly write something like the following:	‘
«che raP,id° ^ accende in cuore nobile, si accese in (nel cuore di) questo qui che (il quale), aveva un bel corpo (e) il quale (corpo bello o bella persona) mi i stato to!to, e (il come mi fu to3to questo corpo bello) la guisa ancora mi offcnde.
Omitting the parentheses and we have in English:	.	,	.
Love, which quickly ignites in noble heart, kindled this one of fair person that was taken from me, and the manner sttH afflicts me.
The word meaning is so simple that, had . it not been for the persistency of the early ecclesiastical commentators to hang a moral thereon, we should have, long ago, been reminded of- the actual episode in the “Francesca da Rimini” sjory oyer which Dante was undoubtedly pondering,: when he wrote. What is this episode? 5
V
Francesca, a daughter of Guido Vcc-.. i cbio da Polenta, wa-s, about 1275, married . to GiOvanni, the deformed son of Mala-' : testk da Verrucchio. Giovanni, 'although- ‘ a great warrior, was called, on account Of his deformity, Gianciotto (Gian lo zopppy, John, .the cripple. It was a marriage ar**., ranged for political reasons. In 1285 or / 1289 Giovanni surprised his wife- with his younger brother Paolo, and stabbed the guilty- pair. Such are the bald historical facts.	f *
Among the anecdotes which were, at an early day, used to give these facts a. romantic but not necessarily , a false., setting, is the following: As Francesca was a high-spirited maiden her father, realized that 3lie would certainly t refuse . to wed Gianciotto,"-so- a tri<^~was'f .pracr.’,’

I a deep-rooted deception which blasted I her life. Paolo, who, according to the
■	chronicle,^ was “ molto bello del corpo e I ben costumato, nja acconcio piU a ripo-fl so che a travaglio,” (mark these words:
9 a handsome and well-dressed man, but I more accustomed to ease than toil), was I sent from Verrucchio to Ravenna to fetch I the bride. Francesca, seeing his ap-" I proach, and being informed that he was'i I Guido's son, naturally supposed him to I be the man she was to marry. What was I more natural than that she should fall I in love with 44 costui della bella per-| sona *’ ? .Her father dared not undeceive I her. Paolo acted as Giovanni's proxy in j signing the contract, and the bridal party soon returned to Verrucchio, where the religious ceremony was held. The morning after Francesca discovered that her husband was not the handsome, gentle Paolo, but Giovanni, the brutal cripple. Thus was she bereft of Paolo in a manner which pained her gentle spirit even after death. Most any young woman would feel similar resentment.
Now, Dante was well acquainted with Francesca's nephew, Guido Novello, at whose house in Ravenna the poet passed his last days. Dante knew perfectly well the entire circumstances of the story. He knew that Paolo, when he went as his brother’s proxy, had been married ten years to Orabile Beatrice di Ghiagginolo, who had borne him two children; that Francesca was the mother of a girl named Concordia, born in the first year of her marriage; that the intimacy between Paolo
and Francesca had lasted for at least ten years when a double tragic death cut it short. What then, in this story, caused Dante, the arch-hater of sinners and of sin, to treat these two shades with such great sympathy and pity that he faints and falls as a dead body falls when he hears their story? Is the fact that her spirit was violently separated from her body by death or that she was slain before she could repent, an extenuation sufficient to overwhelm Dante, who, haying justly consigned the lovers to the “ pecca-tori carnali^’ repeats their story with a
I loving pity, and pathos, and tenderness, and in verses, the beauty of which we , find unequaled elsewhere in the “ Com-media ” ? Dante pities Francesca for the deception practiced on her, and does her a personal, poetic justice.

One word more:	Francesca’s	apostro-	,
phe on love can only- be considered a coherent?-dramatic narrative if follow the translation I here give:. .
Love,-which quickly Ignites in .noble
I heart,, kindled this one of fair person that was taken from me, and'the'manner still afflicts me.	.	.	.
"Love, which excuses no loved one from loving, took me so strongly with delight of. this one, that, as thou seest, even now" it' leaves me not. ^
I ' '* Love led us to one death^Calna awaits "him who quenched our life/*" These words from them were borne to us; ‘ ‘
We have, in these three stanzas, a com- -plete picture—a dramatic narrative—ivhicTi will bear the test of technical criticism. The first refers to Paolo's love for Francesca, and the base deceit the pa In of
[which still afflicts her; the second deals-with Francesca's love for Paolo, which* was so strong that even in death it did not abandon her; the third. emphasizes
their one death and the fate which awaits
■ ; * , * - ■ , . *
their slayer. Would Dante have distorted this dramatic form by slovenly introducing their death in the third line, and thereby weakened the climax of the seventh: *' Love led us to one death ”T The poet’s . Tuscan, his knowledge of /the story, and his reyerence for pure drama tic "form permit but one answer.:
