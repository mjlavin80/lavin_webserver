The hlBtory "hag been divided Into lour I part#: “"The Age of Oak/’ comprising : furniture from 1500 to 1660; " The Age of Walnut,** from 1660 to 1720, showing the varied influences of (he Restoration and Dutch designers; “ The Age -of Mahog-t any/* lasting from 1720 to 1770, in which j the introduction from France of Xresh 1 Ideas In design clearly marked another change, and “The Composite Age,” from 1770 to 1820, inspired by an Affectation of all thingB -classical* combined 'with an nn- : | balanced taste. Although the author deals principally with English fnroUnre, some examples of foreign origin are also In- ; eluded In order to explain more clearly the i different types and their close analogy.
"The Age of Oak** has been divided ■ Into three periods; Gothic, .Elizabethan, | and Jacobean. Descriptions are given of j cupboards, chairs, tables, beds, decora- ! tlons in the different churches, &c., in i short, ail classes of lurniture during this period. Pictures are also given of some of
the best examples, photographs ol which
were taken by the author from tbe XIneat
collections in England and elsewhere. There are nearly 1,000 illustrations in the entire work, ana sixty of these are In the exact colors of the originals. These colored fac similes are from drawings made by Shirley Sloeombe of examples selected by Mr. M&cquold. Each part (there will he twenty in all) will contain three colored illustrations and about forty-eight pages of text.
Neither through half-tone engravings nor in the' color wortc of Mr, Sloeombe hnji an attempt been made to idealize the subjects presented. The scars and discoloration of time are reproduced or artistically suggested, -so that we have actual portraits of the furniture as it appears to-day, and not exact copies as it once appeared, presented without feelins and without reverence for the benefit of the modem cabinetmaker. This Is a feature of the work proper to emphasize, for we know of no author other than Mr. Macquoid who has had sufficient temerity to exploit it in a pictorial work of ancient furniture.
