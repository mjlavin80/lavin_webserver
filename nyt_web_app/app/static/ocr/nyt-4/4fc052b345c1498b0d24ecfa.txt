From the press of Longmans, Green & Co. emerges In one twelvemo •volume, and under the title of " Ad* ventures Among Books,” the latest of 'the sheaves in which that most in~ dustrious and versatile of living copy-jrnakers, Mr. Andrew Lang, has thought that some of his copy was eligible for binding. Why, Indeed, not? The subjects are attractive. u Adventures Among Books," by way of preface; ** Recollections of Stevenson/' much •and multifariously as Stevenson has been recollected already; "Holmes,” "Hawthorne," "The Supernatural in Fiction,*’ "An Old Scottish Physical Researcher’’—these are taking titles. One perceives or surmises that Mr. Lang has already had them printed ‘and paid for, and that they are selections from the mass of his general out-pat which seem to him and to some publisher’s reader to “give-the assurance of a longer date.” Why should not there be in them the making Of some small aftermath of checks?
It was once said of Mr. Lang that he ; managed to keep his Journalism and his literature better apart than any oth-* er writer o£ his time who did SO DQUCh Of : both. But that was a good many 'years ago, and k propos, if we remem-‘her rightly, of his translation of the Odyssey, in collaboration With Prof. Butcher; and of his prefatory, sonnet 'to it in which he had no collaborator. ! It may still be^ true of -Mr. Lang's “ serious work ” in comparative folk lore, : the judgment, of ..the vaJue . of, which, as research, the general reader must leave to the other*'experts in that joyous science. But it is becoming : less true ,of his " mere literature M * • - » •
-with the lapse of years. Tbe fact is Chat you cannot keep on until well : toward your grand climacteric being a; ‘phenomenon of copy-making, and be .of much significance in any other ■point of view. Mr. Lang, like eveiy-body else who has tried it, must be ‘finding that the double event cannot repeatedly be 11 polled off.”
There is nothing fatal in having your literature appear first in periodicals. That is not the point. The late Matthew Arnold’s things pretty much all ‘appeared in periodicals before they 'were brought between covers. But nobody called any of them, excepting \* Friendship’s Garland," journalism, or ;even magazine work, on that account. They Were put together with great -deliberation, and in “ the stiU air of delightful studies." Mr. Lang's things :have the air of having been put together anywhere, in a club library or on a train, as it may have pleased the Bowers, and of being written 11 against 'time ” In a sense quite different from that of defying time. When one en-'eounters one of them in a magazine, With the author’s name attached, he recognizes that it is done in a workmanlike manner, and fits its place •with adequacy, just as he would recog-Blze those facts if he encountered it as he used to do and possibly still may do,
^unsigned and in the editorial columns
t'
of a leading newspaper. It is good journalism, sufficient for the day, or even good magazine writing sufficient ftr the month, if not quite, like the • oraclea of a past generation, good quar-
terly writing sufficient for three months.
But between this kind of writing and literature there is a great gulf fixed. Nobody can keep on indefinitely skipping across that gulf, from journalism to literature and back again,. The im pro visa to re is one character, tho literary worker Is another. If-he insists on turning out a huge daily ** stint ” he becomes in the course’ of time a fated journalist. Mr* Lang’s fate has at last definitely - overtaken him. Not that he cares much about that. If he cared much, it is easy to see that, with his gifts and accomplishments, it would not have overtaken him
at all.	4
' « , ’ To have a neat and facile style, a
negotiable sense of humor, a considerable stock of general information, much undeniably curious and out-of-the-way reading is a first rate equipment for a journalist or a magazinist. But the Improvlsatore must . content himself with that usufruct of his talent and his practice. When he offers what has &ot received much consideration in a shape in which it invites continued consideration, it seems’ that he makes a mistake. The most egregious mistake of which we know, on the part of Mr, Lang, is his acceptance of a bookseller’s offer to u edit Dickens,” He might have done that work very well if he had taken the time to it. He did it in fact very ill. More slovenly'and slipshod work than his annotations of the novels it would he hard to find on the part of a writer of equal competency. And yet these careless trifles are exposed to be read by every purchaser or possessor Of the “ Lang 'Dickens” as often and as long as'the novels to which they severally refer are read and reread. To be tied to your author in this way Is a terrible fate for the hasty journalist who In his haste rushes upon literature. . Dr. Johnson’s judgments on Shakespeare’s plays become of a monumental perehnlality in the comparison.
AH through this present volume, which, we repeat, was in its scattered constituent articles ho doubt adequate and acceptable, the student of the collection shares the uneasy sense, that the' writer must hurry through this, particular article to get at some other. Really, the late George Augustus Sala* did not cut so much worse a figure when he "attempted to give longevity to that which its own nature forbade to he immortal ” by putting his work in volumes. Mr. Lang, to be sure, is a scholar, which 4* G. A. S/’ was not, and a superior person in every way, intellectually speaking. But the iron of journalism is imbedded in his soul with an equal and harpoonlike fixity.
In fact, when a man has arrived at Mr. Lang’s age we have some right to require that he should show, that he has opinions about something which rise to the dignity of convictions, and to which he at least attaches some importance. They may be unimportant, really, but he cannot with impunity think them so. A countryman of Mr. Langs, the late Thomas Carlyle, once described journalism as " the California of the spiritually vagabond/* The work of his gifted junior thight have served him as a text for that severe sentence. ~	-	>
