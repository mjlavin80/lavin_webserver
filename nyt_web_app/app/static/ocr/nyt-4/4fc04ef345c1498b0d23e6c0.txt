Paul Sabatier has written a short preface to the volume describing’ “ The Homes of the First Franciscans in Umbria, the Borders o?—Tuscany, and the Northern Marches," by Beryl D. de Selin-court, which is brought out in this country by E. P. Dutton & Co. M. Sabatier writes:	*
No one can hope to know St. Francis without knowing and loving the places where he lived. And here it is not a question of geographical, external knowledge, but of something more intimate and more vital. Without knowing anything about Greecejme may understand Plato; but it is not possible to understand St. Francis without knowing Umbria. A knowledge of the places- where events occurred Is indispensable to political his* tory, but here it is quite another matter. It is not only because the eyes of St. Francis rested, glowing with hope or burning with pain, on these hills which the setting sun leaves so reluctantly, that wo want to see them and feel their spirit. It is because, as we look on them in the light of his temperament, a faculty for transcending our intellect comes^to birth within us—a beginning of harmony, then communion, and if we could follow it to the end there would spring up in us a sincere desire of fellow service* .
The author describes Assisi, the district of X*ake Thrasymene, Monte Casale, and Valllngegno, two Umbrian solitudes, the valley of -Hieti, • the- Marches, and X*a Verna. She has also written an introduction in which she touches on the influence on the personality and tempei*ainenfc of St. Francis of the places to 'tfhichhe retreated. .
