along with hia biography and authority from his daughter, Mrs. Townsend, of the City of Mexico, to use her father's story itself in the building of this. How much of Senator Clemens’s Invention has been used Mr. Pidgin does not say, and the present reviewer is not familiar with the | original, (published in 1S3!>.) but there arc j Indian incidents with a bear and certain French Canadian incidents and several particulars of plot and conversation which suggest the fashion of the last midcentury. The story, which is not very i coherent ag ficlion, begins with a somewhat picturesque account of young Burr {grandson of Jonathan Edwards) gathering, just after Bunker Hill, recruits for the American Army, takes the young soldier to Washington's camp, then plunges with him Into the Canadian wilderness, where lie carried the message from Arnold to Montgomery, then brings him southward again, and involves him in New York in a rivalry in love and a scandal.
The scandal is the result of the machinations of Alexander Hamilton, who is
here everywhere represented as an	•
arch-conspirator, using his influence
with Washington to blacken Burr’s	*
character, and even going so far as to intercept Burr's letters to the Coranian-dor in Chief. Burr is furnished with a humble guardian angel in the person of Abiel Endlong, a Litchfield soldier, who plays the ’* comic relief " as well. TJio narrative covers th*.’ hero's military adventures and services and his political carccr up to the death of Hamilton.
The author's previous works, “ Blcnner-hasselt ’* and “ The Climax/’ finish turning into fiction the long and remark- . able life which this begins. Mr. Pidgin	l;
professes that the trilogy Is but a prelude	*
to a biography of Burr, which lie will . write—a biography in which the man	j
will appear for the rirst time as he reully	;
was.	■	.

Little Burr ’’ is professedly a novel will purpose; that purpose the “ re-hubi..t.tJon of Aaron Burr,” whose name the author thinks dias been consigned to undeserved obloquy. There is. as a matter of fact, something of a disposition among the impartiaf to think that Col. Burr did not get exactly ** the square deal ’* (now so officially the fashion) from his contemporaries, especially Hamilton and Jefferson. There are even found-historians to say as much, and td admit that tho fatal outcome of the duel with Hamilton has colored unfairly the popular conception of the restless and able man dubbed by Tom Watson the first example of “ the New York politician.” But Mr. Pidgin goes much further.
This “ Little Burr_“ is founded upon and frankly incorporates parts of a story written before tho civil war by Jere Clemens, some time Se_na.tor from Alabama. Clemens called his book ** Tbe Rivals," and his preface is here reprinted
