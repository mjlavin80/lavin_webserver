AVw Vorlr Tmcs Book Review:	,
N the April issue ot The Criterion appears a most delightful and entertaining essay on ** Serendipity ” from the pen of Ellen Bums Sherman, With courteous deference to the presumably wide literary Information of readers in general, the author does not ascribe to Horace Walpole the Invention of “ that composite subliminal sense, whose finer vision begins where that of the eye leaves off nor docs she, in the closest analysis, adhere to the psychic lines laid down for " serendipity ” by Jts
illustrious discovcrer. Horace Walpole says plainly and clearly, in “ Letter CCLI,,'* that ** serendipity ” is “accidental sagacity you must observe that no discovery of a thing j*ou ar9 looking for comes under this description,” In each Instance of " serendipity ” given by Ellen Burns Sherman, in illustration of the theme, the individual was In search of the thing found; hence success in ihe quest was not pure “ serendipity," but rather to be termed “ coincidental sagacity.** Miss Brame was seeking the Cave of Adullum, also the spelling of Talleyrand;. Mr. Whitman, the quotation from Lincoln; Franklin Pierce, the intricate problem; Mr. W„ the bits of bright paper and the word *‘ monochord alJ these are good instances, doubtless, of ‘'coincidental sagacity," but not, as previously claimed, cases of the real Simon-Pure Horace Walpole " serendipity.** A more
I delightful drollery and keener interest attaches to tho genuine Horace Walpole brand of “ accidental sagacity/’ According to the Walpole theory, the thing discovered must not have previously occupied the mind ot the discoverer, or the " serendipper,” :is it wore.
In relation to the two coats of arms of the Capello family of Venice, Hor.ice Walpole thus v.’oie Lo Horace Mann;
This discovery I made by a talisman, which Mr. Chute	the sortes Walpoli-
anae, by whirl: I find everything I want, £ point nomniee. wherever I dip for it. This discovery, indeed, is almost of that kind which ] e.ill serendipity, a very expressive word, which, as I have nothing better to tell you. I shall endeavor to ex-,j)lain to you; you will understand it better by the derivation than by the definition. I once read a silly fairy tale callcd *' The Three Princes of Serendip.” AstUeir Highnesses traveled they were always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things which they were not In quest of; for instance, one of them discovered that a mule blind of the right eye had traveled the same road lately because the grass was eaten only on the left side, where it was worse than on the right. Now do you understand serendipity? One of the most remarkable instances of this accidental sagacity (for you must observe that no discovery of a thing you are looking for comes under th’s description) was of mv Lord Shaftesbury, who, happening to dme at Lord Chancellor Clarendon's, found out the marriage of the Duke of York and Mrs. Hyde by the respect with Which her mother treated her n-t table.
Psychologio'illj', then, “ coincidental sagacity," the Ellen Burns Sherman type of sub-consckus exercise, is, jocosely viewed, of the laboring class variety; a sfxth sense, perhaps, but a sense striving to attain further detail of a theme or thing already on the mind.
** Accidental sagacity ‘—charming Horace Walpole’s " serendipity "—is, with equally humorous classification, a diversion or recreation of care-free minds—the intellectual Princes or Princesses of^Se-, rendip— wandering the grassy-bordered, picturesque roads of the great, broad, fascinating Kingdom of Thought—with no intent except the entertainment of an idle, entrancing, sunny hour—interested keenly and profoundly in ail inadvertent trivialities—mules blind of one ej'e and the unpublished marriages of Dukes and Duchesses.
