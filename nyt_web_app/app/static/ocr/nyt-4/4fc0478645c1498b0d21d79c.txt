Local colon,has boen laid on hero in great crimson spashes. Mr. Berton knows how to make the unspeakable slums- of what has been called " tho most barbaric city of America ” very vivid. The reader who will skip the large and variegated patches in the style of Montaigne, Rossetti, Omar Khayyam, and other .similar writers will find the residue to be an exciting detective story. These extraneous portions embellish the narrative like unto the silken splendors in the apartments of Elise, the Denver Aspasia, whose gorgeous nest merely throws Into more sombre relief the squalor of the French quarter -where she abides. The adventures of Drake, the cub reporter, who is pitchforked onto the trail of a multiple murder, make very eood reading. Three women have been daintily strangled, unquestionably by the same individual in each case; superhuman strength and iron nerve combine to keep the guilty man safe; but he willfully leaves a clue behind, thirteen great carnations laid beside each victim. Of course, the wrong man is put on trial, but is saved by the fervid oratory of his lawyer. Drake falls In love with Marcia, the lawyer's sister, and to win her works with might and main to run down the murderer.
The most dramatic Incident In this really exciting book is the spectacle of this lawyer, Henry Woodford, defying and holding In check a mob drawn from the vilest purlieus of the town, a mob which has assembled in its thousands because of the rumor that the strangler could be caught and lynched.
The author has been less happy in his description of a newspaper, unless such
offices are managed very differently ** among those others." Marcia is a rather colorless young Romola, but Elise, beautiful, wicked, alluring, is drawn'with loving care.
