What would you say.V asked Jack,
44 of a. man-who acted like this? Suppose the chap was, in the first place, fn Araer- i ica. Suppose he had a. friend, a friend he j cared a lot about, one he thought more of than anybody else in the world, arid that i friend, was on this side. Suppose the man’s property was-, all tied upt—in trust, you know—and he*d promised not to borrow, so he couldn’t honorably raise the money to ! come over unless his trustee _ would let j him. The trustee, we’ll say. is. a nice old j fellow—really nice, you- know, only rather 1 crochety—who wouldn’t hear a word of : the chap's going. .	\
And suppose that this trustee—of course the chap is his nearest relative,' you know—has jjji able schooner yacht. ■ Now if tho Chap simply couldn’t stand it, j but captured that yacht—not violently, of course; but by stratagem—and came over j to see his triend, and to ask her—"	i
Turn over the page and behold. The ! “ chap," Jack Castleport, who stole the | ! yacht, mixes his blushes with those of Katrine Marchfield, the “one he thought more of than anybody else in the world '* under the olive treas outside Virgil's tomb In Italy. There Is the whole story of '* The Madcap Cruise.” It is light, but simple and pretty. That it covers three hundred pages Is due to the introduction of well-told adventures which befall the hero and his friend, Jerrold Taberman. A vivid description is given of a storm which the yacht weathers only through the skill of Its young navigators; a race in the Mediterranean with an English yacht, which, of course, is defeated, and a thrilling adventure in which the yacht assists “ Mr. Wrenmarsh, the Extraordinary,” an archaeologist and collector, in smuggling art treasures out of Italy. All of these escapades are forgiven by the trustee, Jack's crotchety uncle, who can afford to be generous, Inasmuch as the yacht's carrying off an important letter saves him from the ruin which he undoubtedly would have suffered had he received that letter and followed its advice.
This is the first effort of Oric Bates, who Is a very young man. His youth Is apparent in the first few chapters of the book, which betray the juvenile propensity for an overdisplay of technical knowledge. Mr. Bates is £n expert yachtsman, and in his story he seems to glory in dazzling the reader with nautical terms which, while they may be. delightful reading to enthusiasts, only worry the lay mind and spoil tbe illusion of an otherwise smoothly running story. Either a glossary is necesary or half of the technicalities unnecessary. The finish of the yam Indicates that Mr. Bates may yet be as great a story teller as he Is a. yachting enthusiast and a student of archaeology. While most of the character drawing lacks distinctive quality, the creation of the eccentric archaeologist Mr. Wren-marsh, is splendidly promising.
