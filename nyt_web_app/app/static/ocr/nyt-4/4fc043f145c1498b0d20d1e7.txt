HE Century Magazine for May contains full-page portraits of seven British writers of contemporary renown from new photographs by Alvin Langdou Coburn. The likenesses of four of these, Austin Dobson, Mrs. Humphry Ward, Edmund Gosse, and George Bernard Shaw, are excellent, as one who knows them by sight can testify. It may safely be assumed, therefore, that the others are equally good. Certainly the picture of George Meredith is admirable as a picture, and some of the most striking qualities of the man as we know him in his books are reflected in the face. Shaw poses In his picture as he ever poses in real life. He seems to be deep In thought, reflecting perhaps on the sad overpraise of Shakespeare which, becoming j a universal custom, has perverted the literary judgment of the age enriched by the genius of Bernard -Shaw. Chesterton looks like something more than i a Jester and something less than a wit. He scowls out of his picture as Congreve and Sheridan never scowled. But he is a wit, all the same, of fair stature, and his heavy features are certainly not unattractive. These welcome portraits form an admirable feature of a noteworthy number of The Century.
