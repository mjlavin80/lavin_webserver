The Higher Common Sense.
THE UNWRITTEN LAW. A Novel. * By Arthur Henry, author of ** The House in the Woo Os ■* and ** An Inland Cabin." 12mo. Pp- -401, New York:	A.	S.	Barnes	&	Co.
The burden of this story is that ignorance cannot remain bliss, and that, therefore, to be wise is ho folly, ** Innocence,” says the author, 11 is the daughter of knowledge.** By many tragic instances he urges that ignorance is .no proper guardian of virtue, that ignorance combined tfiUi the sentimental reticence which a certain school of propriety teaches may conduct to fatal things.
^Thls i^ the text. For the story it begins with Karl, a German, an engraver by trade, living in Brooklyn with a flower garden and his wife and two daughters. Karl Is **ery ignorant—very dull—very kindly. His wife more ignorant and more dull. His daughters grow up, therefore, unguided. One is a simple, hearty creature, whose good nature and animal spirits lead her to ruin; one Is cold and selfish. She makes a career. Meantime the failure of a bank has swept away all Karl s savings, and with no notion of the crime involved he takes to making counterfeit bills to provide for his family. Thus (the author says) do good men by their lack of knowledge and the faults of our economic system get into the penitentiary. The young lawyer who defends Karl proclaims as much to the court without doing his client much good. Nevertheless Karl’s case and that of his daughter, Thekla, cry out for sympathy, and Mr. Henry has painted them in colors whose very crudity is argument of truth and sincerity—Karl with his flowers in Brooklyn, Karl with his market basket going to buy groceries, (with counterfeit money.) Thekla wheeling to Coney Island with the boys who live to the south of Washington Square, Thekla with German phlegm and no hint of coquetry trading a kiss to an Irish coachman Tor a ride in hia equipage for her old mother. Tho other girl is different, ambitious; being so she learns things, grows aware of the value of smiles and kind glances; she gets a rich husband while her sister drifts to Blackwell's Island, perhaps.
In another sphere the author la less sympathetic. He deals with the smug hypocrite whose speculation wrecked the bank where poor Karl*s savings were lodged, with the banker's conventional
wife and family* with the upright Judge who enforced, the law against Karl 'and sent that innocent to Sins Sing:. Perhaps Mr. Henry. knows less about such people, yet he certainty has caught something like a notion of what their moral blindnesses are—in which direction their eyes
I	need opening. It Is ignorance here, too— partly but not altogether willful—which brings misery. The Judge had a daughter who was sheltered ^as Karrs daughters were not, yet who was designedly kept as .ignorant as they In essential matters, who was as confiding by nature as German , Thekla, who loved In no manner of wisdom, who had the price to pay in bitterness and tears. The young lawyer who defended Karl with indiscreet fervor la the author’s idea of the earnest young man of the future who will In his degree help the world to better things by" facing facts and trampling some pretty but viperlike sentiments under his feet. j will learn to curb his tongue and will ^oo the woman he loves with a frankness as utter as that recommended by Mr. Bernard Shaw in such cases. Whereupon, though the woman, if she has had an old-i fashioned mother, will be offended and frightened at his plain speaking at first, she will in the end, if she'is fine enough and woman enough, see the wisdom and the -manliness and womanliness of it. Mr. Henry thinks so at all events.
The book has, perhaps, no merely literary merit, it is crude in plot and exhibits much bad taste in incident, but it has a certain sincerity and strength, and a vividness, too, in places. You can, for instance, fairly hear the bicycles hum and feel the hard roadbed slip away behind the spinning tires when the boys and girls ride to Coney Island on a Sunday. As a serious presentation in fiction of the higher common sense which seems to be the twentieth century gospel, ° The Unwritten Law *’ deserves some attention.
This attention, moreover, If you are not 6fraid of thinking, it is apt to get If you are once fairly started Into the reading of the story.
