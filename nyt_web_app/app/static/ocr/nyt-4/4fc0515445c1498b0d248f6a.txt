HE W, B. Clarke company, already publishing a group o£ curious memoirs, is issuing “ Harm Jan Huideko-per/' by Nina Moore Tiffany and Francis Tiffany, with some assistance from Mr. Francis B. Tiffany, a volume nominally biographical, but, like Mrs. Lesly's “ Recollections of My Mother.*’ picturing a vanished state of American society. Huidekoper’s name, once proverbial
S	among Unitarians In the saying-, v What is Unitarianism? Nobody knows but Hu-Idekoper, and he won’t tell,” and still a household word at Meadville Theological Seminary, has become unfamiliar outside the denomination except as belonging to his grandson, Gen. Henry S. Huidekoper, anif the story of his sixty years in the United States will be new to most readers. He was a Hollander, who brought an excellent German education across the sea, and being clerk of the Holland Land Company, became an extensive land owner, and agent and promoter of many enterprises. He made Pomona^, his Meadville home, the centre of a refined and patriarchal life, the | object of admiration to all permitted to I observe it, and each year of his life saw a series of benefactions lavished upon his "kindred and friends. The scries of his portraits included in the book is a little homily on the influence of goodness upon the physiognomy, and the portraits of his family, among whom was the beautiful Mrs. James Freeman Clarke, are hardly less Interesting. The book is printed at Riverside^ and bound in the same style as the Rowe letters published two years ago.

The Clarke Company will also publish a limited edition of the poems of the late Arthur Macy. It will be a thin octavo of about one hundred pages, bound in boards. It is to be printed at the Riverside Press, and twenty-five copies in Japanese paper will compose the special limited edition. The same house is preparing "The Birds of Essex County" for the Nutall Ornithological Society and. will publish it later In the season.

The proverbial American of the four trades is often outdone by the 'wandering Englishman, and Mr, Roger Pocock, whose "Curly” will be issued next week by Messrs. Little, Brown & Co., has essayed so large a number of occupations that the list seems a gigantic joke* He is the son of Commander Pocock, R. N., and with his sister, Lena Ashwell, the actress, passed his childhood bn the training ship Wellesley until his family removed to the Canadian backwoods. At fifteen he went West in search of work. Navvy, dairy hand, and ** boots,** laborer, peddler, book agent, worker on a fruit farm and at an agricultural college, insurance clerk and bookkeeper, photographer, artist, newspaper agent, journalist in the Kootenay mines, and correspondent in the. affair of; the Skeena blood feuds—all these parts he has played. He served in the Northwestern Mounted Ffellee, and was disabled by frostbite, and while acting as Government trader was injured in an 14 argument with a horse/’ to use his own phrase. ■ He was a missionary for one Winter, a wan-, derer among the British Columbia) Indians3 for a Summer,' he traded in the Coeur d’Alene district, rode across the Canadian plains, tasted the joys of the cowboy, the gold miner, and the Captain of a pack train; rode through the foothills of the Rockies from Fort McLeod to the City of Mexico, served as a scout in South Africa, and in 1004 -went to the Arctic regions. During the twenty-four years partly occu-pled in doing these things he has published "Frontiersman/* an autobiography; "The Rules-of the Game.” **The Arctic Night,” ** Rottenness,” M The Black Guard/* and “Tfee X>racon Slayer.” la

Lieut. Col. Andrew C. P.*Haggard, D.
S. O., has served nearly ten years in India, has had four years of fighting in Egypt,,and has hunted at home, in India, Japan, Abyssinia, Turkey, the Soudan, Asia Minor, and the Barbary States, and in Canada, to say nothing of his fishing exploits, but in his “Silver Bells/’ to be I published by Messrs. L. C. Page & Co. next week, he confines himself to stories of bear and lynx, hunting, salmon and trout fishing with the, Cree Indians, with one terrible episode In which the wolf is i the hunter. It Is interesting to note the distinctions between his treatment of In; dian characteristics and that pursued by j most American authors. It differs as , widely from theirs as Mr. Quiller Couch’s ** Fort Amity” differs from American historical romances of the same period, but its most novel feature is its treatment of the question of marriage between a white man and an Indian girL By the time ihat the tender-hearted novel reader finishes expressing his opinion of Col. Haggard's management of this matter, he will know how to sympathize with the sorrows of Mr. Henry Jnmes when he left a heroine in a Carmelite convent and the hero standing outside and remembering happier things.	.
