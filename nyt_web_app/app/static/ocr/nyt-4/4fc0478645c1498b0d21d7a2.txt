NEW SPRING BOOKS.
Some Noteworthy Outdoor Bookr— Works of Biography and Travel —The Classified Li*ts.
HERE is little in the character or volume of the Spring output of printed books which lends itself to comment. As the classified list below shows,* there is no lack of books, and at least as much variety as ever in the subjects, but nothing really now or startlinff reveals itself whether you consider the list as a whole or attend to the individual items which make it up. The most conspicuous and hopeful sign seems to lie in the number, character, range, and general excellence of outdoor books. And the hope in that case is not e^rfotly literarj*
OUTDOOR BOOKS.
We say " outdoor books.” The classification “ nature books" has no longer any value—very little meaning even.
“ Outdoor books *’ may be said to be any which encourage going to the country, (or the park,) sport, travel, any wholesome rural or suburban employments or amusements. They are garden books, farm books, poultry books, dog books.
horse books, books on hunting, polo, rowing, sailing, flowers, trees, birds, photography, wasps, travel at homo and abroad, books on highways and byways, books on tills or that author's country, Illustrated books on picturesque places close at hand or over seas. To show how great the interest in all such matters is, one- of the oldest publishing houses tn the city and one of the newest may bo called to testify. Each mentions the career of the outdoor book as its most active and promising business for the time being, and each declares that, even so. many more such books—and good ones—arc being written than can possibly be Used. Incidentally it appears that the people who buy the books about chickens buy also the chickens; those who buy the books about horses buy also the horses; those who buy the books on the country or on other lands go themselves afield 01* traveling. Therein is much advantage for all the parties concerned, as you may easily figure out for yourself upon basc'3 commercial or other.
BIOGRAPHY AND TRAVEL.
Biographical bookR also are plentiful, and the lives ^re 11 vos of many kinds of men treated in many different ways. One house, for instance, has five literary biographies. several statesmen. St. Patrick, and Florence Nightingale on its list, to say nothing of minor personages. Doubtless in this field the two most important and valuable contributions are Andrew D. White’s autobiography and the life of the Marquis of Dufferin and Ava, but the less Imposing items make in the sum a considerable impression—increased by the larf^e number of reprints and new editions
of older works of the kind of which history is made, from mere documents to the lively diary and letters of Mme. i d’Arblay. The lesser publishing houses are doing more and more valuable work in this matter of reprints.
Books of travel have already been men- I tloned under the head of outdoor books. The accounts of older travelers, more or less forgotten for a season, are reappearing In considerable numbers in the reprints and irs, tho new editions already alluded to. New travelers are hastenIng to remove the veil of mystery from the few corners of tho earth where a.
I	little darkness still Ungers. Of the latter
kind the books on Tibet have been (naturally) most numerous up to the present stage of the season, and of Tibet books the most elaborate and complete has been that , .of Mr. Percival Landon, correspondent of j	Tho Times of L-ondon and The New
Tork Times, with Sir Francis Young,!	husband’s " friendly mission.”
FICTION AND POETRY,
i Turning to fiction, thero’s plenty of that since January, (already out or prom-I	ised,) and th? average pretty good. But
j	so far nothing w*hlch is a shining mark
for praise or excuse for high expectation. No doubt Mrs. Ward's " The Marriage of William Ashe '* is the new novel in which the readers of The book Review take
most interest, but tho-re is other fiction for other tastes—both novels and short stories. In the matter of novels, you may choose among A. T. Quiller-Couch, Dr. Brady, Alice Hegan Rice, Mrs. Wharton, Mr. Thomas Dixon. Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, the William Rons, Robert Hitchens. Eden I	Phillpotts, Morley Roberts. Elinor Glyn, E.
Phillips Oppenheim. Baroness von 'Hut-ten, W. E. Norris, George Gissing, T. Jenkins Hains, 12. F. Benson, David Gra-j	ham Phillips, Afmes and Eeerton Castle.
|	H. B. Marriott-Watson and Andy Adams,
i	Or you may select out of the list several
very clever new persons, to say nothing of the excellent standbys whose names space or a defective memory has forced us to omit. For short stories there are—
among many—Maurice Hewlett, Mr. .Zangr j will, Arthur Colton. Gilbert Chesterton, Booth Tarkington. Hopkinson Smith, Sir ] Arthur Conan Doyle and Gertrude Ather- -j ton.
Moreover, every publisher—or nearly every one—has a ooet or two or a blank verse drama or a book of essays in the j prevailing fashion of benignly humorous common sense. One publisher has something more; a book about publishing which professes to reveal the' secrets of the j prison house. One may not know what prison house-or publishing house.
