! The tercentenary of the publication of 1 the first part of ** Don Quixote/’ "Which i was celebrated In January of this year,
I appears \o be responsible for a new edition of Sir,- Calvert’s ** Life Of Cer-| vantes.” ^'hat apparently was issued first some teti years ago; at all events, its bib-| liographics, except for one item, end with I books published m l&K}. Still the volume has- a real value quite apart from its \ timeliness, for it contains a good short account of Cervantes’s adventurous and romantic life, about the only one of convenient size and real fullness Ttnowii to ; us. and besides tbe bibliographies a list of tho proverbs which owe their being to I Cervantes, an interesting collection of rft-productions of portraits of the great [ writer, and many illustrations from early editions of his story. ■	'	-
