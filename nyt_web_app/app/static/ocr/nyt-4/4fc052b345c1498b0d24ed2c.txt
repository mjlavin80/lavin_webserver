The story which gives the title to this book prefaces a collection of seventeen short stories which, originally published in various magazines. are now brought together in a single volume. Those who are familiar with the late Mr. Robinson’s charming manner of depicting country life in Vermont will appreciate this effort to bring together some of his most interesting1 sketches of farm life and farm people in New England.
The characters are the tillers of the soil and the trading countrymen of the Green Mountains and the Canadian French settlers who have come over the border line. Tho shrewdness and pointed humor of the different characters are revealed with a keenness and delicacy of touch that show lone personal acquaintance among these people. The stories are all told in dialect, but the dialect is kept subservient to the real purpose of the story, imparting by these natural and homely I expressions a more vital Interest in the j f- tale itself.	1
" Out of Bondage " is the longest and ! most ambitious story of the lot. It por- | trays incidents of the " Underground i , Railroad " days before the civil war and shows the patient perseverance of the Vermont Quakers in aiding escaped negroes to reach a home of freedom In Canada. A young farmer who is not an Abolitionist suddenly finds himself aiding a runaway slave, through his love for a Quaker maiden. Mr. Hoblnson evidently knew a good deal about the secret methods of aiding the black men, for he alludes to them again In some of his other stories.
In " A September Election," country election scenes are cleverly and humorously told. “ A Housewife's Calendar " is an amusing sketch of how the good farmer's wife forgot It was Thanksgiving,
owing to a delay of a day In her week’s washing due to a leaky boiler* Other stories give us pleasant pictures of the old town meeting, picking raspberries. Fourth of July celebrations, hunting In the backwoods, and reminiscences of Indian days by the old settlers.
