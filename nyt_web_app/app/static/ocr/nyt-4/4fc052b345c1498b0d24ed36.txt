■gjpgglHAT Gen. Abbot is qualified
—	to discuss the Panama Canal from an engineer's viewpoint is certain. In the Introduction and the first chapter of his book he qualifies as an expert ” by recalling the fact that he was appointed the third member of the Comity Technique charged with collecting the needful data upon which to begin the final study of the canal, which study was intended to induce capitalists to undertake the completion of the widely suspected project. The .other members were engineers of equally high repute. This was in 1S04; in ISOS Gen. Abbot as second member of a special committee of the Coraitfi Technique, visited Panama and made a personal study of the canal and the Isthmus, and he remained on the Comit£ until the NeW Panama Canal Company made a forced sale of its property to the United States in 1S02. He has thus devoted upward of seven years* study to the subject.
The problems, as Gen. Abbot secs them, are four in number—the climate, the Chagres River and the control of its floods, the disposal of the rainfall, and the question of the level of the canal. The climate of Panama is not salubrious; that is admitted- But the General, after a long study of the rainfall and temperature, insists that it may be supported and that if proper sanitary precautions are taken the yellow fever may be minimized and the Isthmus greatly ’mproved as a place of residence for even unacclimated white persons. The labor on the canal, however, must not be ner-formed by whites, but by West Indian negroes or other persons accustomed to i similar climatic conditions.
The control of the Chagres River la the chief problem before the canal engineers. Gen. Abbot considers the various proposed solutions, the creation of a storage lake at Gamboa, which he thinks would not be successful; the creation of a single lake at Bohio, and this, too, he deems inadvisable, and the creation of two lakes, one at Alhajuela, to provide for a flood of 100,000,000 cubic meters, and another at Bohio, to hold back some 100.000.000 cubic meters of flood water. This last he thinks Is the only practicable solution, and the other members of the SPGCUlI Committee agree with him.
While the creation of a single lake at Bohio would call for a dam of enormous height and length and with a correspondingly expensive construction, this dual lake solution will reduce the difficulties in the way of dam building. It will also guard against currents, gravel and sand deposits, and constant dredging, which the single-lal:e plan would not provide against. Gen, Abbot winds up his study of the Chagres River bogey with these
words:
The old popular belief that the regulation of the floods of the Chagres presents unprecedented difficulties, though often asserted, is erroneous. Thus the works of improvement now in progress upon the Warrior and its tributary, the Black Warrior of Alabama, offer conditions far less favorable. At Tuscaloosa an extreme oscillation of 07 feet is of record, with a rise of 20 feet in 4 hours. The discharges range from 150 to 150,000 cubic feet per second. Such extremes have never been approached by the Chagres. All that is required for that river is a judicious plan ot regulation, based on well-established principles.
The flood of 1S7D, the greatest recorded g for the Chagres, showed a discharge Of 78.C14 cubic feet per second, and a maximum height above low water of about 37 feet, against the 150,000 cubic feet of the Warrior, and a rise of 67 feet above low water at Tuscaloosa. We think tliat Gen. Abbot has pretty well laid the Chagres River ghost.
Artificial laKcs—two of them already suggested. At Alhajuela and Bohio, and the third at Gamboa—will care for the rainfall. The question had been raised as to whether the creation of lakes might not be useless by reason of excessive percolation through the soil to be submerged, but Gen. Abbot, though he admits that the ground water problem is important, shows oy many tables that the rainfall can be disposed of by a chain of lakes, even if not hy a single lake. This is another argument for his du il lake solution of the Chagres problem, *
The question of a sea-level canal has again been raised, and some public as well as expert opinion favors such a waterway. Gen. Abbot insists that a canal wholly without locks is impracticable at any expense, since the tidal oscillation at the Pacific, about twenty feet, can only bo controlled by a lock near Miraflores." He continues:
*	In fine. It ts-tlie unanimous opinion of all engineers. * * * that no sea level

Gen. Abbot has made a valuable contribution to the technical literature of the Panama Canal.
