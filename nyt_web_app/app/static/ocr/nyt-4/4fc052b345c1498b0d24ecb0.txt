Prof. McKenzie’s Interpretation of the Disputed Passage in Pante.
ATcto York Times Book	^	~
■	a new Interpretation t* & a proposed. tor a' passage in'
1 s&^Sf wfl I3aate or ^ any other o£ the wttiATm world's greatest writers. Its flgft m m] truth or falsity should be 1	™ —------ clearly demonstrated-as £00n
, j' ‘as possible,. so that; as' the case may be,. it shall either become a part of general knowledge, or be suppressed before it can do harm. In his reply to my letter* whtch you printed on April 2* Mr. Walter Littlefield made, pre-supaably,.his strongest argument in favor . of his interpretation of Dante’s story_of Francesca da Rimini. The excellent Iet-ter signed “ C. R. M.,” which you printed .. on April S, amply disproves Mr. Littlefield’s view: but as there are a few more considerations in regard to the matter, perhaps they also should be stated.
When Francesca speaks of the beautiful*
body that was taken from her, she means
. ■ ' -
her own body, which was violently sepa-
*	rated from her soul when she was killed.
‘ The souls in the ** Divine Comedy ” often speak of their bodies as something separate .from them; for instance, Manfred, in , Purgatorio, Itl.» 118:
Poscia ch* S’ ebbl rotta la persona Di due punfce mortali, io ml rendei.
On the other hand, Dante speaks of himself as still having a body, Purgatorio,
! II., 110:
• L’ anima mla, che con la sua persona
■	Venendo qui, 6 affannata tanto.
This expression is, then, a natural one for Francesca to use; whereas it"seems a little unnatural, and, moreover, not in accordance with the facts, for her to say . that Paolo’s beautiful body was taken from her* The logical and symmetrical arrangement of the passage In Question,
. Inferno, V., 100-108, as pointed out by , “ C. R. M.f” was unquestionably Intended by Dante, and the grammatical construo-tion is the same in lines 101 and 104; '
Prese costui della (mia) bella persona che mi fu tolta * * *
. Ml prese del costui piacer.
-	The “ tolta ** must, according to the rules of elementary grammar, refer to ' ‘‘persona," not "costui”; tt is out of the question that Dante should have used the feminine form if he meant ** costui,”
‘ i* e., Paolo, and the expression is very . awkward if we take “ persona ” to mean Paolo's body. Moreover, " costui della ' bella persona ” would not be natural in Tuscan for " this onffNife beautiful body."
“ C. R. M.” is in error, however, when he says that '* chi mi fu tolto " would mean “ who was taken from me,” for “ chi" is not a simple relative in Italian; yet the grammatical argument is all against Mr. Littlefield.
At this poind in the narrative Francesca is merely explaining to Dante the reason for her punishment; It was the manner of her death, quite as much as the fact of her sin, that brought her to this punishment and that still offends her. It is, then, merely fanciful" to suppose that she alludes anywhere to the deceit which is said to have betn practiced on her at the time of her marriage, and in any case we 8 should hardly expect it at the beginning of the story. The cruel death, not the deceit, is what makes Dante swoon from sympathy.
Finally, if Mr. Littlefield’s interpretation were really, as he thinks, the natural one from the point of view of language, it is scarcely conceivable that it should not have been at least suggested by some of the commentators. In this particular case it is these very commentators, whom Mr. Littlefield scorns as “ for the most part superfluous,’' who have furnished 1 us with practically all the details we have of Francesca's supposed history.
