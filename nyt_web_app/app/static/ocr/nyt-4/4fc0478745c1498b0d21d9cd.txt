A Reader Whj Justifies the Practice of Lowell and Others in Making Unfamiliar Literary References,
Kcic Tork Times Bool: Review:
NCE no one else has seen fit to explain to Mr. Barnes Mott any of James Russell LOW* ell’s literary allusions that he finds so impenetrable, or to offer any apology for authors who draw parallels from history, mythology, or earlier literature, may r be pardoned for doing what little I can In that direction? I would not seek to justify the pedantry ol piling up obscure allusions In books intended for the average modern reader, but I am afraid that if Lowell had written to please his critic his work would be more barren of interesting and illustrative citations than a dally newspaper—for both newspapers and magazines to-day contain
quotations and unexplained allusions which, though perfectly clear at present, will bo blank as a misty, moonless mid,	night in fifty years. Mind, I would not
for a moment disparage Mr. Mott’s learning, for I confess that as he finds that
I bookworm Burton's references " plain as day compared to the Boston man," his reading has been far deeper than mine. Lowell was pre-eminently a scholar. If B	he had not peppered his essays with al-
|	lusions that would make such readers as
I	Mr. Mott and myself stop and think—
I	that would occasionally send us to our
books of reference when we were not too laay—his work would not have been gen-nine, he would not have written as his thought naturally flowed, and the quality of his work would have been materially impaired.
I By the way, I wonder if Mr. Mott ever read “ Paradise Lost,” for I should think that Milton’s “ obscure allusions " would fairly drive him frantic—and doesn’t he find Shakespeare an unpardonable sinner?
Clearly the labors of the writers of the past, whom we used to call great, were strangely misdirected. They wrote for men who had read; men who rather liked books that didn’t do all tho thinking for them, and who didn’t mind spending a lit* tie time in investigation. Those early writers did not anticipate a public brought up entirely on diagramed fact and buttered fiction, to whom reading was not thought, but, as Mr. Dooley says, a kind of “ near-thought,” warranted just as good.
To return tc* Lowell, I have purposely refrained from looking up the allusions that bother Mv. Mott, (whose first letter is not at hand, wherefore I must trust my memory,) so my answers aro merely those of an ordinary reader unassisted by works of reference.
The “ feathered Mercury ” requires no further explanation than the wings on the cap, shoes, and staff of the god.
The absurd derivation of the name “ Antwerp" is about as follows: Two1 piratical chieftains after long contending for the possession of the port that now bears the name, agreed to settle their pretensions by a boat race, the city to belong to the contestant who should first i touch the seaward tower with his hand. The chief in the prow of the lagging boat, seeing his opponent about to win, chopped off his own hand and threw it against the tower; hence the name *' handt-werfen ” (hand-throwing.) or Antwerp.	‘
.	same Gano that betrayed me to
him is an allusion to the Gano, better known as Ganelon, who betrayed Roland and the other Paladins of Charlemagne at Roncesvalles. -I am not defending obscureness. I believe that wherever a writer has not expressed his thought with the utmost clearness he has failed, even though his name be Browning or James; but I do not think that an author’s free and natural* expression should be fettered because a few of the allusions that flow from his pen might not be immediately understood by all possible readers. Remember that
these allusions arc not absolutely n^css-sary to the clear expression of thought; they are for the most part ornaments; illustrations thrown in for good measure to enrich and vivify an idea, and should not be begrudged those who appreciate them.
No one desires a revival of the overburdened style of Euphuea or of *' The An,	atomy of Melancholy," but there is always
t	a happy mean, and I can ee& little ten-
! dency in recent writers toward the mul-i	tiplication of literary allusions, obscure
,	or transparent. Then let us not throw
(	bricks at the ancients for failing to an-
ticipate our modern poverty of style.
