This " Isidro," as readers who have followed it in The Atlantic Monthly may have noted, is no ordinary novel. But the difference lies not in the story so much as in the language. That language has a character of its own and a fitness to the honorable service of the romance of old California—the Castilian California—which 1 reminds you of Maurice Hewlett’s language in relation to his mediaeval subjects. The two languages are (naturally) not the same, but both are marked by a forceful simplicity of word and phrase which is none the less effective for being
(perfectly deliberate and artificial. For that ‘ matter, no doubt, Mr. Hewlett’s Middle Ages and Mary Austin's Old California are as artificial as the languages which the dwellers in them are made to speak. The point is that the people of both dreamlands talk as such folk should talk, and talk and people have a charm (and naturalness, you may say) which grows in each case out of the whole-heartedness with which the authors have surrendered themselves to their illusions and lent full sympathy, to say nothing of literary cunning, to all the dream people. So by a sort of hypnotic effect both dreamland and dream people become real to the reader. ’Vf'hich is an elaborate and round-about way of saying that Mary Austin has the gift of the witchcraft of romance—the witchcraft which takes a stretch of the old earth with the sun shining upon it—mountains, gulleys, water courses, ways over the hills, with a few bits of half-forgotten history, tags of Stories of proud Dons, beautiful women, missionary priests, mongrels, Indians—and makes grow out of these things and melt into the atmosphere of them a something lifelike—a something which, if it be not formed of real flesh-and-blood, is assuredly made of a substance flesh-and-blood-colored—because it is not quite convincingly solid, only the higher colored.
Thus ’* Isidro." The man and the things he does and rays, the people he meets, are all of such substance—all of the same \ substance. It is a pretty story enough, a younger son of a man old and rich and proud, Isidro was vowed In his cradle, and before, to Mother Church. Ho grew up a fine, handsome, level-spirited youth, and setting out dutifully, cheerfully, even singing, to report to the good fathers of St. Francis for his novitiate met as he rode adventures by the way, sheep—and a shepherd lad who was not a lad at all, but a lovely maid. However, that is long coming out. It has been said the mere story is not a new thing. Don Isidro (who may be called a Sir Galahad with a ''ast difference) has his own short ways with some scruples—quite other ways with other scruples. And there is a delightful old priest, who likewise has different ways with different scruples, a man flying Into the desert with gold in his bosom and blood upon his hands, and a half-breed with wild passions and buddings of great virtues In him—fit, therefore, for a gentleman's death—for what else is it to perish saving together the | woman one loves in vain and the hated rival who lias made the emptiness?
All this is not, of course, critical. It is merely impressionistic. If you would enjoy such stories as '* Isidro ” you must imitate tlfc author and surrender yourself
I to the illusion. If you have any taste for matters of mere loveliness, day creams, tender and noble sentiments, and 1 if you like your words well chosen, the i
■	thing is easy in this case.	*
