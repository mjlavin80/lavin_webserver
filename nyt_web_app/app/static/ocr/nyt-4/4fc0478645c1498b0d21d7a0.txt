Mr. Brownell’s critical study of j Henry James In the current Atlantic | one is inclined to call the most impor-; tant thing that "has been written on Its i subject, and this in spite of the article,
:	necessarily and from the place of its
appearance “ monumental/' which appeared three or four years ago in The Edinburgh Review. It might seem either a malicious contrivance of the critic or a stroke of the irony of fate that there should also be in the current North American a specimen, under the title of “ New England: An Autumn Impression,” of the novelist's latest manner, and that this specimen should be perhaps the least intelligible piece of writing that he has given to the ; world. " The Golden Bowl ” was a crucial ordeal for the admirers of Mr.
: James. Some who boasted themselves of being able to read anything that he was inspired to^ write drew the line at that and confessed, after fc«.lf a dozen attempts*, that they could not read it. All of Mr. James’s later engagements have been notable for the number of stragglers. Jacobites have fallen by the wayside, not in increasing numbers, for the number of volunteers has decreased with the forlornness of the hope, but in an increased ratio to the total engaged. But we judge that the proportion of stragglers from the article in The North American is even greater than from “ The Golden Bowl,” although this is but of twenty pages and that of two volumes. The reader who has managed even to stay with the writer through the novel, the reader ” lassatus necdum satiatus ” with his author, lias in many cases confessed his inability to make out what it is his author wishes to say in the magazine article. He makes out that ii is an attempt to present in a few pages an aspect each of urban, suburban, and rural America revisited. But he will be apt vehemently to deny that it conveys to him anything in the nature of an " impression," and he may be par' doned for refusing to take interest in a clinical study of a New England landscape undertaken with a view to a “ diagnosis.’* The effeetlessness of it is emphasized by an article on English Plymouth in the contemporaneous Harper's by Mr. Howells, in which the genial veteran makes it clear that he has tidings and that he can deliver them like a man of this world. It is the final proof of Mr. Brownell's remark that Mr. James may perfectly express his thought without in the least communicating it.
It will be inferred that Mr, Brownell's essay is upon the whole minifying, as that of The Edinburgh reviewer was magnifying. That is in fact a fair account of it, it seems to us. With powers which nobody who has kept any track at all of Mr. James's work in fiction would or could deny to him, and with a use of those powers as conscientious and artistic as those cS any writer of fiction, the verdict of most even of those who remain his readers must be a confession of disappointment that he has not done more and better, that he has not done differently. And, given the conditions, that verdict ■ imputes to him a certain perversity, | some strange astigmatism Jn, the view ; he takes of his art. It would be an in- 1
justice to Mr. Brownell’s study to take, "specimens” from a piece of writing, which so requires to be read consecu-tiveiy ~and judged as a whole, and which as a whole betrays rather that} proclaims the disappointment Of which we speak, but we cannot forbear quoting a typical sentence or two:
We have the paradox of an art attitude that is immaculate with an art product that is ineffective. * ^	9
He has reversed the relation between his observation and his imagination, and instead of using the former to supply material for-the latter, has enlisted the latter very expressly—oh! sometimes, indeed, worked it very hard—in the service of his observation. Of what he might have achieved by pursuing a different course I cannot myself think -without regret.
The critic will find himself by no means alone in his regret. It is the frame of mind, one may say, normal to the student of the later manner of Mr. James. To acquire a many-volumed work on “ The Wonders ot the Micro- j scope " and to find out that th^ micro- ! scope is itself the only wonder, and that it shows us so comparatively little that we care to see, is a disappointing experience.
