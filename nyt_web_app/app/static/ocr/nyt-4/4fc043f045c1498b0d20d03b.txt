A New Edition of His “ Memoirs of the American War.”1*1
*ILE Gen. William Heath may not have been a shining success as a fighter, he certainly wqs as a diarist; which accounts for the value to the historian of this volume of more than -J00 closely primed
paga,m containing a record of Gen. Hcatn’s _ personal experiences and observations from the very opening of the War for Independence to the evacuation of New York by the British in November, 1783. " Our General/' as he calls himself all through this gossipy diary, was oric of the senior Major Generals under Gen. Washington, but was restricted in his duties to services in New England and New York, opeTating* chiefly as a provost and mustering officer. To him also tell the social duties of the army, after he had prcved that he was a bit out of hia element as a fighter during certain operations that he participated in during Washington's retreat through New Jersey In 3777.
His nbiliiy as an entertainer, which Washington seemed to highly appreciate, came naturally to him, probably from the fact that he was a member of that unique military organization, the Ancient and Honorable Artillery of Boston, previous to and at the time of the outbreak of tho war. Gen. Heath was a farmer at Kox-bury, Mass., by profession, and naively writes this record of himself;
He is of middling stature, light complexion, very corpulent, and bald-headed, which led the French officers who served in America to compare him to the Mar-ouis of Granby. P»-ozn his childhood he was remarkably fond of military exercises, which pulsion grew up with him, and as he arrived at years of maturity led him to procure, and attentively to study, every military treatise in the English language which was obtainable. This, with a strong memory, rendered him fullv acquainted with the theory of war in all its branches and duties, from the private soldier to tho Commander in Chief. • • * Through tho inactive state of the militia company to which he belonged • * • ho went over to Boston and entered a member of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company •	« • an^ SPrve<l. first
as Lieutenant and afterward as Captain. Jn the firyt regiment or the militia of Suffolk he became the military favorite of Gov. Barnard, who publicly declared that he would not only make h'im Colonel of the regiment, but, if it were in his power, a General officer aJso.
When the Committee of Safety Was formed, just before the. British raid cn Lexington and Concord, the first .skirmishes in the TYa.r for Independence,
Heath at once became an active participant in the melees, was made Colonel of militia, then Brigadier General, and shortly thereafter a Major General, in which capacity he served to the end of the struggle. At the close of his memoirs be says, referring to the disbanding of Washington’s army in June, 17S3, writing under date of June 10, when he was ready to retire from service and go back to his home at RoXbury;
Our General was General of -the Day.
0	* • It is here a little remarkable that otir General, [meaning himself,] by whose orders and under whose direction the first guard in the American war mounted at the foot of Prosi>ect Hill, on the evening of the Tilth of April, 1775, after the battle of that day, should happen, in the course of service, to be the last General of the Day in the American main army, on the 10th of June, 17S3, to inspect, turn off. and visit the guards. At the first period the roads were full of militia pressing toward Boston to commence and prosecute a dubious war; they were now filled with the veteran soldiers, covered with laurels, returning from the field to their peaceful abodes.	-
, Very early in his campaigning nis Ancient and Honorable Artillery training ai:d his book theories of war showed themselves at Die fclefense of D.irchesler Heights, for he tells of the defenses there;
The hills on which they were erected were steep and clear of trees and bushes. Rows of barrels filled with earth were placed round the works. They presented only the appearance oi* strengthening (he works; but the real design was, m case the enemy made an attack, to nave them rolled down the hill; They	have
descended- with such increasing velocity as must have thrown the assailants into the utmost confusion and have 'idled anl wounded yreat numbers. This project was suggested by Mr. William IwvN*. merchant. of Boston, to our General, who immediately communicated it to the Commander m Chief, who highly approv'd cf it, as did all the other officers; but the credit of it is justly due to Mr. Davis, ar.d to him the writer gives it.
But this unique method of attacking a storming party was never-utilized, tiarly in the game of war he had trouble with the umpires, hs he did at vari him times in his uiKiuesiionably patriulij career. He begins his defense of Ids military Judgment early, for on Page .'<) he writes;
Rome were ready to blame our General for the sentiments which he expressed against the going into Boston, as was proposed, in the boats, and attributed it to the want of firmness, but .ihe opinion of every military man since that time, whether American, French, or British, who have taken a view of the land and water which w:ts to have £><**• n tlie scene Of action, with the concomitant circum-

This was in the Spring of 177G, shortly after which time Gen. Heath was told off to go to New York with the Massachusetts troops. Minute details of that trip are given, but of the arrival of the Commander in Chief he has only to record,
“ April 13. In the forenoon Gen. Washington arrived in the city.** Two woelcs later '* Our General, having been inoculated with smallpox went to Montresor’s [now Randall's] Island, where he went through the operation of that distemper.’* After his recovery Gen. Heath and his troops were stationed in Westchester County while the operations that resulted so disastrously to the Continental troops were being carried on in Long Island and about the City of New York, but he took no active part in them exccpt as in command of the outpost. The following Winter lie had a clash with that marplot, Gen. Charles Lee, who was the occasion of so much trouble until his dismissal from the army.	/
Gen. Heath’s first opportunity to show his ability as a fighter came in January of 1777, when Gen. "Washington, then on his retreat through New Jersey, ordered him to move from his camp in Westchester toward New York, " as if with a design on that cl tv," to distract Lord Clinton’s attention. Of that fiasco, which ended Heath's career in any important command, the editor of the volume says:
Heath’s forces, marching In three divisions. arrived on Jan. 18 [1777] before Fort Independence, whose garrison of nearly -.(A# Hessians were allowed " twenty minutes in which to surrender or abide the consequences.” But the garrison did not surrender, and Heath remained for ten days in the neighborhood without attempting to enforce his demands. Then a sally from the garrison crcated a panic in one regiment at an advanced post, and led, a little later, to the withdrawal of the entire army. Heath’s abortive demonstration- caused Washington to write him as follows; ** This letter
*	• * is to hint to you, and I do it with concern, that your conduct is ccnsured (and by men of sense and judgment who have been with you on the expedition of Fort Independence) as being fraught with too much eaution, by which the army has been disappointed and in some degree dis~ graced. Your summons, as you did not attempt to fulfill your jthreats, was not only idle, but farciful, and will not fail of turning the laugh exceedingly upon us.”
Gen, Heath, who all through his memoirs is very free with his criticism of his fellow-Generals, both as strategists and tacticians, does not refer to this incident in hiii memoirs as one calling for
criticism, but glogsos it over in this way;
This success at the outposts flew through the country, and was soon magnified into a reduction of the fort and the capture of the garrison. It reached Gen. Washington long before the official account, and he had communicated the report to Congress; hence a double di<ap-pointment when the true state of the facts was received.
To this he added, later in his diarj^ as a sort of post obit, when Gen, Washington had written him concerning some operations about Newport, '* You know the critical situation in which this army'' will bo In a position below.’*
This was undoubtedly a very just observation. but if the Commander in Chief with the whole American Army in 17.^0, Well armed and highly disciplined, should so Justly judge at the distance of thirty miles from the spot, what shall wo say of those brave militiamen who continued in the position itself for more than ten days in the midst of Winter.
After this incident Gen. Heath was sent to Boston, where ho did provost duty as guardian over Gen. Burgoyne :uid his
army that surrendered at Saratoga, and later received tbe Frerreh allies at Newport. In the following year he devoted the major part of his time to entertaining the French officers at West Point. Gen. Heath as senior Major General was persistent in asking for active command and pestered Washington considerably. Washington was so very tactful in slaving off these demands, as bis letters Show, that, in the lanpuago ot tho streets of this day. he earned for himself the right to the title of " tl\£ great jc/tiier," for he managed to appease rind seemingly accede to these demands and yet keep Gen. Heath from active service to the end of the war. Then Gen. Heath managed to attract general attention by refusing to b* come an active member of the Soeiet;. of the Cincinnati, formed of the general officers of the army, because of conscientious scruples, though fie paid his initiation fee and was a nomhwil member of the organization.
His diary is, as stated, gossipy, redolent of army life and its trifling incidents, and~ reveals the innate vanity of the New Engiaitd farmer by its record of the courtesies shown him by escorts and reviews whenever he moved about in his restricted sphere of usefulness, for useful he apparently was as a mustering officer. There are pitiful stories of the sufferings of the patriot army In the field, in Winter quarters, and in British prisons, of the General’s efficient services in securing supplies, and a wealth of material regarding the operations of the Continental Army about this city, in tho highlands of West Point, and in New Jersey
*	that is of such value to the student of
local or, National hlfttory- as to-make .the volume well worth • rescuing from tho dusty obscurity *of library shelves Where ** privately printed “ bookH too often recline as too valuable for ordinary eye*, and placed within the reach of every stu-^ dent.	*
