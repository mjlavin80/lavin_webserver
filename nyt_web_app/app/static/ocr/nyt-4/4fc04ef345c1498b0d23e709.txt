These have initial letters designed by Bruce Home, and are printed in large oldfaced type on the fly leaves of the mounts upon which the plates are hung. An introduction, inserted in Part I., has been written by Prof. G. Baldwin Brown, in which he speaks as follows of Mr. Home's | present work:	,
The present publication is based upon a competent structural knowledge of the buildings It illustrates, and over and above the artistic appreciation which the . draughtsman has shown of effects of grouping and light and shade we discern in his work a conscientious study of the characted and growth of the fabrics which have occupied nis pencil. In great measure these fabrics still remain, and he has shown) by the rocklike solidity he has imparted to their aspect they are in no apparent danger of toppling into rtiin. * • * The drawings combine, as will be recognized, the strictest fidelity with a sympathetic rendering of detail and texture.
