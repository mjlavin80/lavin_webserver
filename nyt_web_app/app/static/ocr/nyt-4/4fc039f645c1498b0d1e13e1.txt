“ Trees and Shrubs of Central park ” is a new book by Louis Hiirman Peet, author of a* similar work on Prospect Park trees. It is not only a description of tho trees, but is a real guide and companion, pointing out that which It describes Jn a, manner that is wholly comprehensible to the reader. Mr. Feet say 8: '	'
The purpose of this book is to put within the reach of the non-technical city nature lover a handy means \of-identify-I lug the trees and shrubs which he meets i In hia Park rambles. This Identification j once effected, adds immeasurable enjoy-1 ment to these rambles. It is ex&sperat-ing to walk the Park paths and see the handsome shrubs and trees and not know what they are. Many of them are of i foreign character, and, although theram-bier may know the native species, when these unusual foreign forms confront him he cannot recognise them, for they are seldom given in tbe popular handbooks. * • * It is the aim of this book to supply this want v
The Park is divided by Mr, Pcet into sixteen Imaginary sections, numbering from tho southern to the northern end • L e., No. 1 is entitled ** The Pond and Its Vicinity.” - At the front of the book there is a key map of the combined parts, and for each part there is a separate map, which forms the nucleus of a chapter. As the space covered by these maps is not extensive individually, there Is the possibility of locating almost every physical feature in the vicinity. However, not each tree and shrub is noted, for this would amount to confusion, hut all representative types are given unusual prominence and-distinct position.
Each map has„a chapter for its description, the trees, shrubs, and plants having corresponding numbers 1 in both map and text. There is also a table accompanying the maps, which gives both the common and botanical names. And again, at the back of the book there is an index ttp the common names, wherein the number of the page, chapter, map, and location is placed for easy reference.
Besides these maps, the book contains excellent half tones of representative types. The text is lucid and readable. No previous botanical knowledge is required to understand it. The book might serve admirably as a first book on the
subject of botany. In fact, it should make an appeal especially to this kind of work, because of its simplicity and accuracy. " Trees and Shrubs of Central Park" is published by the Manhattan Press, X7G West Broadway, this city, ($2.) '
