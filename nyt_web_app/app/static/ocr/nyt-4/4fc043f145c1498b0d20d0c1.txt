Not long ago we had an epidemic of Dorothys in fiction, then Margarets, and now comc trooping along a herd of Juiiets and Juditbs^until it is hard to keep the pretty lass^ -quite straight. MIs3 Richmond carries her temerity far Indeed* since she has both 'a Juliet and a* Judith in one and the same .book. Juliet la a member of the fine old family ot Marcys Of Massachusetts. Anthony Robeson Is one pf the Robesons"of Kentucky. Certainly they ,are a well matched pair In spite of the fact that Anthony*s family had lately lost Its fortune and the young man was suddenly thrown upon his own resources—he who had never done a stroke of work in his life.

house in the country—*1 a box of a house" he called It He asked Juliet to help him to furnish it, to select the draperies; the rugs, the pictures; the chaiik. And it was all to be exceedingly chea>-the whole not to amount to* more than $500. Juliet thought it was all for another girl who. Jived In California, and she tried hard to rejoice, hut her heart grew heavy. Then it was, when she had wept a little In secret, that Anthony arrived Jtjst in the nick of time, as only book and stage lovers do—and revealed ~ his J <?ark plot and confessed that there never had been
nor ever would be any other ‘girl; that it was all for her. Juliet’s indifference at that moment came to an end. Not only j that, but thenceforth Juliet, wherever It was possible, aided and abetted gallant ! lovers in dispelling the Indifference of other young ladles. Judith Dearborn was. j cajoled Into matrimony with Wayne. Carey; Rachel. Redding was launched] upon tbe same high sea—although Rachel seemed to have bad any number of suitors' to choose from, and before the story ends ; selected two'of tKe many. ■	.	*.
