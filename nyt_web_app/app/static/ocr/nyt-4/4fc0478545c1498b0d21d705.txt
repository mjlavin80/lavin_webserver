I? all authors whose bocks arc
known to me, James Russell J^owell Is tho most obscure in his allusions. Whether he thought this showed hfs eru-dltion I do not know, but tbe fact remains the same. For instance,
. speaking of. some fanatics In Massachusetts wha .went naked, he says; “The presartorial simplicity of Adam had its martyrs—tailored impromptu from the tarpot by indignant' neighbors, and sent forth to ilustrate tho 4 feathered Mercury * as defined by Webster and Worcester,** What is a " feathered Mercury," and where do the dictionaries define it?
Again, speaking of Walter Savage L<an-
flor, he says: “ Father Thames could
never have come upon his stage with both
his banks on the same side, refreshing
as that innovation might have been to an
au/IJcnce familiar with the humdrum habits of the river." Elsewhere he speaks of “ That awful judgment on the courtier, whose Atlantean thighs leaked . slowly away in bran through his trunk .hose.” In a criticism on Carlyle's Frederick he notices that Carlyle *' has steered clear of a certain ludicrous etymology of the word Antwerp;" And lastly, in ** My Study Windows," he says that 4* Petrarch-has celebrated the laurel, Chaucer the daisy, and Wordsworth the ‘gallows tree"!
I would be grateful if I might be allowed to ask for light on some of these to me dark and mysterious allusions from some of the readers of The New York Times book Review. JAMEiS MOTT.
