Air. and Airs. Peckham's Story of Their Intelltg'ence and Industry.'*1
RE we not very much inclined j to give to insects almost the J role of automata V Wo seem to overlook their special abilities and are prone to use and abuse what we cull instinct. The subject which interests Mr. George W. Peckham and his wife is the wasp. John Burroughs writes “ 1 Wasps, Social and Solitary,* is a wonderful record of patient, exact, and loving observation, which has all the interest of a romancc. It opens up a world of Lllliput right at our feet, wherein the little poo pie amuse and delight us with their various human foibles and whimsicalities, and surprise us with their intelligence and individuality.”
Walking along one day, the author and his wife came across a stream of yellow-jaekets issuing from the ground. On such an occasion the bravest man or woman generally lakes an immediate flight. Without showing the least alarm the two kept near to the place of issue. The wasps possibly knew that the visitors wore iKLtumlists, and showed after a while absolute Indifference. The opening being but an inch across, the observers counted the entrances and the exits. In ten minutes r>02 wasps left the nest and

What Mr. and Mrs, Peckham wanted to do was not to go into any of the dry technicalities concerning tho peculiarities of a physical character, always to be found in certain books, but to learn what were tho individual habits of the wasps. Did these wasps have any appreciation of coJEorV Pieces of paper of various colors, blue, red, yellow, with a small hole cut In them were put over the nesis. For a brief period tho insects seemed uncertain, but very quickly they found where were their homes. All sorts of questions were asked of the Vespa s. Two bundles were made. The one contained chicken bones, the other only gauze. Both packages were precisely alike. The one containing the bones alone attracted attention. Two

wasps having been kiUed, they wfer$.. plax-ed at some distance from the nest. _\t onco they were discovered. Animal, matter attracted their attention, but not the powerful odor of the oils of peppermint or wintergreen. Noises did not disturb them, even the loudest whistlings.-I Darkness seemed to make little dlffer-ence to the wasps, for without a ray o£ light to guide them they found their way to the nests. There were no pleasure excursions, for every Insect carried in some kind of food, and coming out bore, a pellet of dirt. They held fast to their , loads until they came to water, when they stopped to drink, and then let go of their burden, and the authors write that., the dropping of their loads may account in a measure fop the distribution o£ plants. The wasps showed no emotion: when they came-across the dead body, ot one of the relatives. The defunct wasp was cut up and given to the little ones to feed on. There are two varieties of these wasps, and both feed on fruit and flowers, but when a caterpillar is found it is killed, and used for the larvae.
There are solitary wasps, and why they exist can only be explained by the fact that they are the last of their family. These soli tares may live near one another in colonies* Each one follows out the instinct ;ts to the food necessary for its family; some capture beetles, others caterpillars or crickets, locusts, spiders, cockroaches, aphides. With the egg-laying time the female secures her prey. It is M. Fabre who has done much in his study of wasps. He dwells particularly on the killing of the caterpillars used to feed the young wasps. Our authors write:
When the egg-laying time arrives the female secures her prey, which she either kills or paralyzes* places it in the nest, lays her eggs upon it, and th„n, in most eases, closes the hole and takes no further interest in it. going on to make new nests from day to Jay. In some genera the female maintains a longer connection with her offspring, not bringing all the provisions at once, but returning to feed the larva as it grows, and leaving the nest permanently only when the grub has spun its cocoon. The males never acquire this interest, and aid little, if at all,, in the care of the family. The egg develops in from one to three days into a footless, maggot-like creature, which feeds upon the store provided for it.
If only the observers could see a wasp in the act of attacking a caterpillar! After weeks of research at last they saw a wasp stinging a victim. After stinging the caterpillar*the wasp straddled it with, all her legs and literally carried it along the ground. Woriderful was it to notice how the wasp found her way'across the-fields, the garden, the patch of corn, and.
finally arrived at her home. The powers ■of observation of the Insect were Indeed marvelous. Now comes something which is nothing else than astounding. A wasp Jiud excavated its burrow and had used the utmost precautions to hide the entrance. We follow the exact description oL whai lh;it wasp did, according to the testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Peckham:
Tn tilling up her nest, the Ammophila urnaria put ber head down into it and bit away (he loose1 earth from the sid«*s, letting it frill to the bottom of the burrow, and then, after a quantity had accumulated. jammed it down with her head. Earth was then brought from the outside and pressed in. and then morn was bitten from the sides. When at last the filling
■	was level with the ground, she brought a quantity of fine grains of dirt to the spot, and picking up a small pebble in her man-
-	dihlcs. used it as a hammer in pounding .-.them down with rapid strokes, thua making tliis spot as hard and firm as the surrounding surface.
Not once but several times did the wasp repeat the same performance. Here, then, is a creuturc improvising a tool and making an intelligent use of it. Tho industrious ant and the painstaking bee we all know about, only our observers tell of a Iittie wasp, the crabo, that they saw working incessantly during forty-two consecutive hours. " Surely that takes the palm of industry." Were all the students of nature as painstaking and re-Kourcrful as Mr. and Mrs. Peckham show themselves to be, it might be that that strange thing, the homing instinct, might find a solution, for it looks as if a wasp never lost ita way.
