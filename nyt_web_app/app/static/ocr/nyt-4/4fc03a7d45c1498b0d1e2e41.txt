As a husband I rise to protect u:;.unsL the remarks of Vour correspondents who ' hold a man responsible for the character I of his wife. I refer, of course, to Mrs. Ward's hero, William Ashe, and his astounding wife, Kitty. How under the sun h*/ could be blamed for her folly and absurdities, or worse, [ fair to see. Hadn't he behaved toward her with the most chivalrous consideration? What more can a man do for a morally fibre-less woman beyond protecting her with his name and character, and forgiving her over and over again for her rash faults? Can lie make her over again In a new mold? Not unless he has the power of a creator. I should like to know Mrs. Ward’s own view of Ashe. She doesn’t seem to condemn him—indeed, it appears to me that she holds the scales very evenly between her leading man and woman, neither condemning nor upholding either of them. She has not, in my humble judgment, made Ashe a prig, as some one has said. He is a Imply a conventional gentleman, sorely tried by the young, pretty, audacious woman he was rash enough to marry. But what can he do? Can he shake an indiscreet wife into discretion, as one of your correspondents suggested, or administer the sort of training advocated in the nursery? And if he did, do you really think it would do any good?
