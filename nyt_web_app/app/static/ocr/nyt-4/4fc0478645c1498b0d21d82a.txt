A rather long and ambitious dramatic poem by Josephine Preston Peabody will be the most striking feature of Harper's Magazine for May. The scene is Saxon England in the eighth century A* D., and
the teact, which is decidedly out of tlie
ordinary, is accompanied Dy a series or
drawings b>‘ Elizabeth Shippen Green, remarkable for merit and fine effect. The same number will contain also an account of that wonderful funeral procession of Queen Eleanor and the crosses Edward I. erected wherever her body rested. Thomas A. Janvier is the writer and Joseph Pennell the illustrator of this article. John Bassett Moore contributes a paper, an account of the " real territorial expansion of the United States," with some curious instances of Island annexation by virtue ofc guano deposits. W. L. Alden has an article oh the little Italian town
of Subiaco. M. Jacques de Morgan, Honorary Birector General of the Antiquities of Egypt, writes of the latest antiquarian finds at Susa, and short stories are contributed by Alice Brown, Grace Ellery Channing, Philip Verrill Mighels, Justus Miles Forman, Anne O'Hagan, Van Tassel Sutphen, and others. It is In this number, too, that Mrs. Ward’s " The Marriage of William Ashe” is concluded.
