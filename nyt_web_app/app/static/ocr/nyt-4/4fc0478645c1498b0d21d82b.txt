Hugo Badsworth, Master of the Cranston Hounds, Jiad a maiden sister, Miss Lavin la Badsworth, who was immersed in societies for relieving the responsibility of parents and other good purposes. He had also a niece named Miss Lavinia Badsworth, a healthy English girl, who followed the hounds occasionally.
Now, and it Is easy to gather thig much from the story, Hugo made a will, in jest it would seem,. by which it was ordered that unless Miss Lavinia Badsworth followed the hounds for two days a week in the month of November following the date of his decease, most of the property should go to a. reprobate nephew. Hugo, whethei intentionally or otherwise, omitted In the condition to preface Miss Lavinia Bads-worth's name with " the aforementioned, my sister/' with the result that Miss Lavinia, the niece, who occasionally followed the hounds, filled the requirement Toward one of the ends of the story, that is, one of the places where one might suppose the story would die a natural death, Miss Lavinia, the niece, having fulfilled the duty that was really Incumbent upon Miss Lavinia, the elder, finds the will, (the other will, which the reader knows about all the time,) and, of course, discovers that Uncle .Hugo had not meant to perpetrate his little joke at all. and that i the threatened lawsuit of the reprobate nephew Is not to be .regarded seriously* Then, naturally. Miss ‘ Lavinia, the niece, gets ready to marry the young man she Ukes best.
There is the whole story, except that it should be mentioned that Eyre Hu3sey achieved the feat of spreading It into twice the length of an ordinary, unaspiring novel and over 326 pages, with the aid of a few not very exciting- descrip--tion^of the hunt and a vast number of English country society people who talk about themselves and wonder how Miss Lavinia, the niece, could have the daring, to wear the nether garments of a huntsman. The nether garments, by the way, are quite an interesting problem. Why did she wear them if, as the story tells, aha. felt embarrassed about them 7 The will did not require them* -
