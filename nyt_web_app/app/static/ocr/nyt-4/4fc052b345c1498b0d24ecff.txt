But its place and power must be preserved through perfectly frank recognition of the facts concerning It, and use of it for exactly what it is. Modem study shows It to be In some im-* portant respects a different book frdm what it' has been thought to be, and It is necessary that we Jcarn to use it in a manner that corresponds to Its character thus: ascertained;Outof unbelief or iear concerning- the future of*; the Bible* wo must cotne to .a'.livlng confidence In tho abiding value ‘ of "our Holy Book, ' and to the practice of using it in .the new manner, which our new understanding of it, requires.' \	'	.	■.
