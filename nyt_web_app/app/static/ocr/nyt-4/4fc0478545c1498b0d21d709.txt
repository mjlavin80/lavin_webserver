writer with less^at stake in the matter of literary repute, and with a smaller actual knowledge of the routine of life among those New York persons of wealth who are in “ society,” might be accused of , using vivid and startling colors too freely. Indeed,
| apart from the authors generally admirable employment of the language, the April installment of ” The House of Mirth *’ is strangely like the '* society novel ” of writers who know good society only from a distance and abuse it for the entertainment of folks who know it not at all. Miss Lily Dart, the heroine, is exactly the kind of woman these inferior sensationalists love to hold up to the scorn of the humble but comparatively virtuous. She is a bad woman now, and promises to be a much worse woman before the story reaches its climax.. Nevertheless, we must be grateful for these glimpses of the inner social circle, given by one who has the magic password. “ The House of Mirth,” indeed, must be accepted as a “ document,’* and its descriptions of the functions and foibles of “ our best society ” will surely be treasured by historians as testimony.
