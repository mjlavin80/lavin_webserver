Whatever we may think of the "talents of those New England writers who 1m-agtne that the torch has been passed on to them from the literary Brahmins of their locality, there is no reason to doubt tho sincerity of the reverence in. which they hold their inspired masters. There is something peculiarly European and— unfortunately be it said—entirely un-American In the manner in which the aforesaid Brahminese inheritors do public and oratorical honor to such men as I^ongfellow, Curtis, Emerson, Lowell, and others. The manner of bestowing this honor is most worthy, and its spirit , could, with advantage. Inspire emulation In other parts of this country.
The latest-episode of the kind indicated above took place in Concord, Mass., last ! July, on the occasion of the centenary of Hawthorne’s birth. Papers were recited there/ addresses made, and letters read hy those who had Known the American romanticist—Col. Higginson, Sted-i man, Keyes, Conway, Dr.- Hale, Mrs. i Julia Ward Howe, and Mrs. Fields; varl-; ous phases of his literary career were presented by Mr. Copeland, Mrs. Elliott, j Charles Francis Adams, and Messrs.
I Sanborn and Stearns, and pertinent letters j of regret, punctuated with anecdote and I breathing1 the spirit of revered intimacy,
^ came from well known New Englanders whom circumstances forced to be absent. Now,; these addresses, papers,, and'letters have been given a permanent form, in a volume edited by Col. Higginson.
It Is a volume well worthy of preservation for all those who have a reverence for one of the few names which is identified with the beginning of purely native American literature. It is, moreover, a ; volume of Interesting contrasts, for it ‘contains personal and intimate material, objective panegyric as well as remote critical appreciation. Take, for example, the papers read by Mrs. Julia Ward Howe and by her daughter, Mrs. Maud. Howe , Elliott. The first introduces us, with a wonderful power of visualization that has rendered naught intervening years, into | the social conditions In which Hawthorne i lived and among the friends hy whom he was surrounded, and defines and picture*
I the influences which shaped his literary j career. The second, which deals with Hawthorne in.Italy,, is necessarily more objective; but what it lacks in personal Intimacy is more than made up by a fresh and sympathetic intimacy>wlth locality— j the Rome of Story, of the elder Crawford,
, of . Thompson; of . Read, ( and of Miss : Bremer, “ the funniest little old fairy you | can Imagine/' This Rome of theT early fifties; which inspired " The Marble Fau1i,’| is brought dellghtfuriy near to us by the author of 4 • Roma Beata// .
