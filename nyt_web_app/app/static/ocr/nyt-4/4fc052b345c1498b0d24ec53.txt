NEW ART BOOKS.
An Enthusiastic Appreciation of Albert Durer by T- Sturge Moore.*
LTHOUGH it Is not an open question as to -whether or not Albert Durer was the founder of the German f school or perfected the art which already existed in his country, the fact that he touched several phases "of the arts of expression with a» superior hand is a source of never-failing interest to the connoisseur and the historian of art. In him are combined, possibly to a greater extent than in more prominent individualities, the two great elements of perfect artistic expression-mathematical. contemplation „ and imaginative execution. Nor did his mathematical acumen find realization merely in an admirable technique. Its dominance of mind was such th^t-it sometimes sought a purely scientific outlet; as his literary works on geometry, the art of fortification, and anatomy, show. As for the rest, the sculptures* the architectural drawings, ' and the canvases, bristol boards, they have found myriad reproductions in plaster, blue print, and engraving.
A singularly gifted man and an altogether human individual was Albert DQ-rer. Naturally he has found many interpreters, but few, indeed, are there who have been able to treat with equal success his varied talents. In the case of T. Sturge Moore, whose biography of DU-rer lies before us,' we have a young investigator and critic who, better than any one with whose work we are acquainted, has been able to do full'justice to the va,--rious phases of his subject.
As yet untainted by scientific criticism, Mr. Moore is brimming over with enthusiasm which, emanating from a mind of less scientific poise, would surely run riot, quite probably to the detriment of Durer. Like Durer, however, his mind is primarily mathematical,- and hence- his-thought, imagination, and feeling, however they may lack the breadth of ex-perienee, never trespass beyond the bounds of judicious comprehension. What Prof. Thausing, Allihn, Zahn, and Scott never suspected we find brought forth with the pride of discovery and illuminated in the language of a poet by Diirer's latest and-
•	youngest biographer/ The peculiar form of his work is also worthy of emphasis. Many biographers deal with their subject in the following form and sequence:	Narrative
and biographical, condition in which works were produced* and an exposition of those works, and a critical review. Not so proceeds Mr. Moore. His plan -is psychological. We are shown the state of society in which Durer was born and grew up, the influences which guided his chisel, brush, or pen, the creative genius ' which owed its inspiration to nothing that had gone before, arid an analysis of Diirer's critical acumen,; which -was developed to a point of introspection reached by no other great artist—save, possibly, Michelangelo'Buonarroti.	'
:	In the history of biographical writing*-
of art criticism, ‘ and connol&seurship; ’ "Albert Dtirer.” by T. Sturge Moore;'is an epoch-making work. Its form and.execution present a new model study and imitation. More years of Itfe, of study, and of experience may cause the. auth'or to qualify some dicta and even to change some impressions in ia new light; but no amount of specifi>| knowledge can supplant his unequaled gift in. grasping the essence of essentials at first acquaintance. He Jays bare the mind, the soul of the artist; and shows the inevitableness of what DUrer achieved.
WATTS AND VAN DYCK.
The late George "Frederick Watts r-nd Sir Anthony Van Dyck form the:,subjects of two volumes in Newnes’s Library of Art, the scope of which has been fully set forth in tliese columns. (Square 8vo, Boards, Vellum Backs. New York: .Fred-., erick Warne & Co. $1.25 each.) . W. K. West has written a biographical sketch of Watts, and Romualdo F&ntini has contributed to the volume an essay on. “ The Art, .of - George : Frederick Watts.1’ M. • Pantini gives an outline of the pictures Jn the hook, sixty*five in number, and their meaning. He writes in his opening paragraph:	.
' It has been said that Watts is the kind of .artist who can be looked for and fpund in England alone. The assertion, is not perhaps of such absolute value as it appears to be -at first sight; but it Is cer-' tain that the high disinterestedness which-guJded him in his work I3 a glorious example in tHe-artistic history of our agfe. His early triumphs and the immediate and permanent recognition, whiclii he..received assured, him of .'a . very comfortable position, from which he might easily-rave risen to higher-honors and. .have amas3Cd great wealth. But Watts sought nothing beyond a life of peace and security. * * * Thus he was- able to accumulate ahr 1m-mense number of works, never seeking to' sell them, but keeping them by him to., present them at last to the country. .	1
