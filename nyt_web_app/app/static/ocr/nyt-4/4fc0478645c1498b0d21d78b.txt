The autobiography of the late Theodore Thomas, and its companlon'volume, containing^the documentary history of that great orchestra conductor's life, edited by Mr. Upton, -rnust wait for a thorough review by~a specialist in music and musical history. But the two volumes are already at hand and deserve a word or two of cordial welcome. The autobiography is a frank, straightforward narrative of facts and opinions. Most of the former are exceedingly interesting, for Thomas's life was full of purposeful activity from the very beginning. The expressions of opinion are characteristic, of the man. Writing In 1003, or thereabout, Mr. Thomas said he considered M irate, who sang with Lagrange in the fifties, the greatest tenor he ever heard. Mr, Upton's chapters of " Reminiscence and Appreciation are valuable. The book will be treasured as the record of the Ufe of a remarkable man andjisan authentic history of musical development In this country.	-
