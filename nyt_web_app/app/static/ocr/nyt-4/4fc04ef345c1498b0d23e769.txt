Of the things that give to war its glamour and its terror, of lighting and carnage, of endurance and bravery that seem superhuman, there lg enough in these sketchy pages by the veteran war correspondent to furnish the thrill go cherished by thpse who know war only at second hand. But neither the vivid relation of such things—though probably no man of hi3 profession now living can do that part' Of the T7ork more skillfully than Villiers— Tior the (act that the narrative deals all the time, directly or indirectly, with one of the most striking and important events in the history of modern warfare, gives to tbe book its chlefest charm and its strongest claim to attention. Its pages . are full o£ something else, something more vital, that makes it Interesting to all lovers of literature* belligerent in. taste, or not. It is as a study of human nature exposed to exceptional conditions that it holds the interest of the reader from the first-page to the-last. Officers, war correspondents, servants, non-combatants harvesting their maize fields to the music of bursting shells—these are the objects . of observation, and as the^mlnd ot the observer is both keen and kindly and as the writer—to quote one of his colleagues-" is always prone to lay in some loca) color,” the result is both entertaining and instructive. We are. dealing with the by. plays ^ of war, those little daily incidents of life within sight of the battle's forefront of which ordinarily none learns but those on the spot. And as one petty but picturesque detail is added to another, jotted down as if by chance, yet as part df a clearly conceived design, characters grow on us. The reader finds it hard to tell whether he is most excited concerning the snail-like and sanguinary progress of the besiegers' toward their goal or by the state of health of Cho-San, Che corespondent’s faithful Chinese servant, whose stomach troubles are the cause of constant and sincere concern at a time when ( brave men are being mangled and killed by thousands all around. Pew recent | novels contain a figure more sympathetic or more amusing than that of the Irish-American San Francisco correspondent, who is ever reveling on jam and imagination and who one tlay, in the midst of war’s hell, receives " five letters, all in the same handwriting, sweeter than jam j even/’ which he pores over in his shanty,
1 while strayed shells insist on coming hfs ' way. There are glimpses now of a ! trench, " where men munch hardtack, held in one hand, while they pull the trigger with the other, and now of the Chinese hut, where a noble Italian scribe dwells 1n one room and in the other "a 1 donkey, a dog, ze chicken, ten women, les | enfants, and one pork." While one ! " Osaka baby *’ (eleven-inch siege gun) i after another is dragged into place and ■ i made to add its bark to the prevailing 1 ! pandemonium of sound, Mr. VUliers’s j landlord, a young Chinese husbandman, i finds the time opportune to marry, and the ceremony, performed in the open while*" one of the forts is being assaulted, brings forth this little gem of descriptive writ* i ing:
It is a simple little ceremony, full of, brilliant color, for the women are in their jackets of embroidered blue homespun, with trousers, or bloomers, of the same ! hue. Their tiny, pig-trotter feet are in-j cased in red and green shoes, with ankle ; bands ot red and white. Their jet-black topknots are embossed with silver and blue enamel, and their ears hung with pale dove-color jade. The thunder of the guns makes tho music of the wedding march, for the bombardment of the Russian forts has commenced. The white purrs of shrapnel are spreading death on the adjacent hills, and the wounded of tho previous night's butchery are trailing up the valley, but the scene is not incon-! gruous, for, after all, love and war make up the sum of life. • \ .
, And men and animals have gradually 1 become so Inured to danger and death
