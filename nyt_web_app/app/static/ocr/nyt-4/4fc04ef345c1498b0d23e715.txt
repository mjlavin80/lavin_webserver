I.—THE KEST OF THE NOVEL.
A NY of us	are	philosophizing or are attempting	to	philosophize, at	present,
about the fiction of our country—about all pf it, or some especial part of it, or some particular piece of it. We praise, we	overpraise, we underpraise. We	express
wonder,	perhaps, that,	as a whole, it	can be
so good without being better; so bad without being worse. Or we may be offering our sympathy to the geniuses who have small editions, and our insults to the no-geniuses who get both the green and the gold, the laurel and the checks. Before the huge, new, vaguely perceived, ill-defined, ever-growing mountain of the nation’s fiction many of Us are regularly or irregularly encamped, for the moment or by th^year, for our wages or for our pleasure, with the determination to dig the truth of the matter out of the heart of the matter. So there Is a vast, busy spectacle of blasting* mining, probing, surface-scraping, before each turns away, carrying his little personal sackful of philosophy, driving off his poor little donkey load of unearthed treasure. No doubt each digs up exactly what he is determined to dig up. He brings away only what he has taken thither. And what be wisdom and diamonds to him are folly and simple earth to all the others.
Yet surely there is one truth, one nugget of gold, for the top of every man’s sack, if he will but see it glistening before bis eyes all over the mountain; that in our fiction, as in the fiction of every other people, there is but a single test—both first and final —either of a poor novel, a good one, or the greatest. Shake the story out of the finished book, so that you may be able to see it somehow apart in its. brevity and bareness. Then ask yourself the question: Is this story, thus exposed in its final poverty, rich with human truth and human interest? If you say “ Yes,” you may go on to say regarding It,' as the case may be, much more than that, many other great and deep and eloquent and enthusiastic things. But if you say *' No/* then you can add nothing—you have said all.
For, while it is a worthless commonplace to . declare that many a story, red with life, throbbing, .with' interest, is ruined by defective telling and so becomes, lost to literature, perhaps. it •may be worth -while stating, at least by /way of reminder, tha^ on the* book" shelves of the-world- no-.man can lays‘his

finger upon a. single. volume., wherein the, craftiest exercise of the craft of writing has.ever,been able to place there and to keep' there one false, dull story. The novelist, without this well-packed core of vitality and soundness and charm for his work, can assemble around it all the resources of his profession In vain; these will only servesto complete a * ■ < i
failure:^ He may*have gained the whole world for his art, but he has lost its soul. He haa built a house, but cannot people it; he has fashioned-a Cremona that will not sound; his 'Wild olive tree^has thfe true shape, the true leaf, of the species, but It is Of pasteboard.	_
There seems to be need to bring this familiar -matter up anew, because, of late, voices (that ought to be better empl6yed) have been raised among * us in depreciation of the value of fine writing, in . contempt of the mere drapery of words. As though words were ever a drapery. As though style were': -some cheap trick, some unworthy artifice/by which nothing,1 having been welt written, is made toyac- /

though any deficiengy or ^dfemerit^ any i loss or lack, or crudity or -perverstori, or flatness and failure in ourr^cent or. in our current fiction, could in any wise be traceable to •whatsoever re-. gpect, whatsoever. - reyerence, whatsoever cultivation; "whatsoever prac< tice may exist among us, as a reading and a writing people, of the always fnanly and bold and fearless and noble and ennobling fine art of literature. .
:	XL—ART AND THE STORY. .
-	It Is not the business -of style to make riDthing appear something. It Js not its business to make a weak story appear strong, a false one true, a dull one Interesting, a shallow one deep. It is not its aim to do any of these things: It could not do them if it would. The exact reverse holds good. If >*ou would find nut whether any man ^ a small man, require, him to fill a large place; to expose his Imperfections, give him a .perfect chance, a perfect setting. If you would realize what rags are, throw ermine down beside them. If you wish tojcnow whether your foot is a normal foot, try to thrust It into a normal shoe. The vaster, the more varied and all-searching an orchestra, the more impossible for it to do anything with shallow, insincere, dull music. It brines out with final and unrelenting cruelty exactly what the music is: the revelation of the orchestra is that the music is not a revelation.
So the fine art of fiction, which rests wholly and solely upon fine writing, never seeks to hide a story, to cover it up, make good Its lack, straighten out its deformities, apologize or atone for ts shortcomings. In truth, there is about every art an internal dignity and sacredness that makes of it a divine guardian figure before the temple of Its rites and mysteries. The figure bids all truth enter and all lies stand back. If both would enter, it forbids neither. But to every lie it says: Enter you may, but live long within, you cannot. The more perfectly you array yourself, the more perfectly you are exposed and the sooner you die; the immortalities of art are ' for truths alone.	‘	;
Thus the fine art of literature as re- ; gan3s fiction is simply a test and a rev- , elation of the story. The richer the story Is, the more it can reveal; the j poorer the story is, the less it can re- j veal If any good story has ever been j hurt or ruined in the telling, not the art j of literature is at fault, but the Incompetent workman who misused the art. 3ut never since the world began has the Whole art of fiction, most sagaciously and prodigally exercised, ever been able to make a success of a dull, false story.
Therefore, if there is anything the matter with American fiction at present —and all seem agreed that something Is the matter—then the Xwrnble does not lie in the fact that the novelists of the land may be trying to write their stories in good English. It is not because they may be clinging to the old notion that fiction is essentially literature and literature essentially an art. inasmuch as many others are expressing their opinions in some wise on this subject, one more brief opinion, if it do no good, will scarce do harm.
In my opinion, then. If our national fiction is suffering just now from the lack of anything, then it is not from an excess of fine writing, and it is not from the national lack of stories. Our civilization has always thrown to the surface of life an amazing wealth of splendid stories. Our race in the New World, our mixture and competition of races, produce great stories. Our wars and our times of peace, our religions and our politics, our industries and inventions, our manners, our morals and mmorals, humanities and inhumanities, endlessly produce colossal stories. The whole civilized world to-day stands with eyes riveted upon the single unfolding story of the Nation itself. Every needed external resource for great national fiction has existed within our civilization from tfe&Ja£ginning. Every needed external resource exists at this moment. The lack is not there; it is not external. In my opinion it lies within—it lies in a certain national attitude of our men of letters and the public they address toward this very subject of the fine art of fiction.
For what is the very first thing that the fine art of fiction requires of any man who would undertake in any masterly way to use it? What is the first step of necessary training, Without taking which he need never try to take a higher second step? It Is that he
*hallHrsan hlii&ll-
•when^t Is beforeTiis .eyjse, ^ fcearfcj* fpr 'it until he has toun% It; t^ *«ah*ll .acquire, the judgment to pick it out ‘ amongfa thousand inferior ones, Next that he' shall train himself to ..see tho great story which he has chosen j&eply, see it as deepjy as life itself i£ deepi Next that he shall train himself to fix this f deep, .vision-of;-his great story clearly within his own mind, as clearly as he would behold faces and forms, lights and shadows, groups and distances, in some wonderful, pellucid, unshaken mirror. And next and finally,:that lie shall learn how to . transfix-hia .vision, -whole and true, for the eyes and minds of mankind. That is what a great novelist. Is, and that is what a great novelist does when he produces a masterpiece. ,And. that is why the fine art of fiction is not the despicable pastime of turning out pretty sentences, but the grave and most diffifcuit. toll -of seeing and choosing and fathoming, and then of delivering faithfully to others some part of the realities of our human life.	.	.
HT.—HASTER-SEERS LACKING.
We are given, a4 little unduly perhaps, to boasting that fiction to-day is a finer art than it was in the day of generations gone. It may be, if we are thinking' of master-grammarians, of master-rhetori'cianfi, of..details ’of-proportion and symmetry and formal considerations such as these. But if we are speaking of the master-seers, _ I do not. believe it. To my mind, tho broad fundamental difference between the best work of eaxller novelists and the best work of our contemporary novelists lies just here: that the great men and women of the past; more than we, held it to be the very first commandment of their art that they should look, for and find the greater story, see it more deeply, know it more thoroughly, and write it more exhaustively.
Take “The1 Scarlet Letter/' our greatest piece of fiction. Do you think, the story in “ The Scarlet Letter " the greatest story ever put into an American novel? It Is riot. It is no greater than the story in many other novels, no ’ greater than .the story in some that will never have a place in-our literature. But Hawthorne, in addition to his crude; ' unique, original genius, made use of hia trained aptitude and intelligence as a man of letters to .discover and recognize a great story in our civilization, to see it as-deeply as life is deep, to understand it perfectly, and to write it fearlessly and flawlessly.
A mere glance at the best achievements of our best living American novelists fails to reveal any such single piece of work. Stories as great are all around us, In many ways far greater. But for some reason the great American novels of our generation, as compared with the greatest English-written novels of the past—where are they? There la some lack, some falling off, some inferiority. We seem either Indifferent about discovering* or unable to discover the great storied of our country; or, having discovered and chosen one, we view it superficially rather than profoundly, partially rather than completely; or if we have attained a profound and complete comprehension of it, we do not with patient waiting and vigil, under the older faith, the older enthusiasm, master the vision of It until the vision masters us; or having done all other needful things, we lack the courage, the conscience, or the requisite art bravely and completely to write down what we have ourselves found out and known and accepted as the truth.
Thus, It is what we think of this same great art of fiction that is settling the fate of each of us and that settles the fate of our national literature. It is the opinion we form of our duties and responsibilities to it, of Its duties and responsibilities to the rest of our civilization. The more gravely and highly we think of this art, the better will be any story that we ever attempt to write. For fine writing—what Is It? Fine writing in fiction is nothing more nor less than doing a story justice; and justice can be done it in no other way; and In all literatures no stories have any place but finely written stories. The poorest thing that any human being could say on this subject would be a proclamation—with a wave of the ° Big Stick#t—that what the United States needs just now is men and women who will write the stories.of the nation with as little art as possible, or
no sift'at.	Similarly/ the painters of
the nation oi^ht; to be paintlng Vthe pictures of the nation, without regard to colors; thes sculptors, -creating the marbles and bronzes of the nation . without considering form; the jfhusl*: ^ciaua to be writing the music of the nation regardless of the musical scale; the candlemakers to be making the : candles of the nation ^without thought of wick and mold; its engine guilders to be building its engines' without thought of machinery and construction* Leave these latter trifles to the. engine critics! The engine is the thing!—just the big; simple, natural engine;’and as for the man who merely knows how to make one, keep him near you to fetch your lunch or to blacky your boots!
IV.-~HECLA^ SAND WITH."
The foregoing has been drawn out in connection with a new novel—the first novel of a young American novelist— entitled "Hecla Sandwlth/* It furnished an extremely interesting illustration of some of the views fiere set forth.
. To begin with, the story in the novel Is a great story. It is an-American story of the first magnitude. Thomas Hardy, had he been an American, might have been glad to come upon it. George Eliot, had she'been an American, could have built upon it one of her masterpieces. There can be no mistake here: The young novelist, with a grave, high sense of the art which he was newly essaying to use, looked out upon our civilization for a fresh, original, great Story, and he found it. He discharged, in the highest degree, the first highest duty of his art.	^	'
Having found~his story, the question next arises: How did he see it? XJeeply or superficially? Partially or com- ■ pletely? A careful reading of his book makes it plain that he took a broad and deep view of the elements—American and human—that entered Into the greatness of his theme. One by one they are marshaled before us:	The
lonely, solemn mountains of Central Pennsylvania; the entrance into these of rude, Btrong pioneer folk; the sweep of the human tides across the continent; the charcoal burners, the Ironworkers, the rugged, iron-framed, iron-willed type Of ironmasters; the due place of the industry in our civilization; the elfish of races and religions around the furnace; the struggles of | national politics in the village, near by I —all the forces, all the elemental Amer-! lean values, that gave weight and a massiveness and a dignity to this i theme are gathered together for the using, p * ^
, And the purely human forces; they i likewise are brought in with unstinted abundance upon the scene. There is a | crowd of people, living characters, enough to stock two or three current i American novels: Old age, middle age, youth, childhood—caught Into the same web of life around a lonely furnace; passion, governed and ungoverhed— climbing toward heaven, toppling into hell; pride of family, of race, of religion, of money; miser and spendthrift; selfishness and self-sacrifice; weakness and bigotry; old manners changing, new ideas coming In; hopes wrecked, disease, death, love, and peace and prayer, life somehow tolling,
I if not actually climbing, toward truer, better things—all this and much more Is embraced In the young novelist’s vision of his theme. So that his preparations in their scope and in complex; ity suggest an intention to break away | from the lighter, shorter book which is i the popular American type to-day. With a mind steeped in the traditions of the greatest English novelists, he , preferred to go back, to their ampler, j more patient plans. Furthermore, evi-i dently he resolved to discard from his book all the fictitious machinery which at present is so often relied upon to produce noise, excitement, ** action" In the fiction of the hour; he would succeed by the quiet, honest analysis of human'nature alone—a pledge he faithfully kept. From the beginning to the end of his work the reader encounters only rational psychology of thought and emotion; higher praise who can give?
So far, then, the Influence of the past seems to have prevailed with Mr. Valentine. But no man escapes his present; and the keen student of his completed work might now declare that, at this stage of it, he became another person and proceeded witji It upon another plan, That is, having laid broad and deep the foundations, of a long, elaborately constructed character-novel
j ofCttie old^	*°	i
real’ upon them }h.e structure of the ' shorter, lighter American . novel of our : prevalent school. He succeeded, and he succeeded well* But one does not escape the feellhgi perhaps, that those foundations would have borne a more massive edifice. One Bees; -the 'teal .greatness .behind the book as one*thing /
. and the genuine success which clowns it as another thing. And, in classlfying . it, one cannot judge it by jts founda-tlons, but only by its achievement. Thus It passes over into the American novel of our time—but unattended. by the noise, the rush, the\ adventitious excitement of •" action ” which ordi-narlly characterizes its type; for it holds on to . its high faith that the deliberate portrayal of human- nature shall be Its sole aim and only field of triumph.	.	.	.
■ - 'There "la perhaps reason for thinking that the young novelist, in his transition from an earlier to a later purpose, found himself incumbered with an excess of material. Had he started with half the number of his characters, would he not have made some of them twice as impressive? (His novel contains some four pairs of lovers alone!) Into one small room you cannot well crowd many large* persons; and, if the celling be low, the very nobility of their stature places them at a disadvantage.
But If we pass to the final one of those fundamental considerations which have been. Insisted upon as underlying every great novel, namely, the art with which the novelist delivers his vision to his readers, then once more we shall iave .to leave the typical American novel jot to-day and go back _to earlier models to - discover the true •types and kindred of this book. I .mean to . specify tho . extraordinary literary quality which distinguishes Mr. Valentine's work. It is unevenly written—how many novels are riot?—and there are. places where the reader feels that the novelist Is not putting forth his best resources. But, on the whole, the sense of the art of literature la so high and fine and the adhesion to this sense so accurate and faithful, that the entire result should be greeted as a reawakening among us,
In this first novel of a younger man, of the older reverence for good English. There are pages that any novelist, living or dead, might have been glad, to claim. Mr, Valentine has written more about Nature than about human life; and whenever he turns to the former, he finds familiar to him the language of exquisite interpretation. Throughout this novel there is a series of Nature studies wrought Into tho story, yet standing out in relief from it, which surpass anything known to. me, for truth and beauty, in the range of our modern fiction.
But aside from all Its merits his novel has had for me this extraordinary significance: that I see in it the fresh warring of two tendencies, the one or the other of which is likely to dominate our national fiction more exclusively ere long. Are our novels to become longer or shorter, lighter or heavier? Will the present tendency toward lightness" and shortness run its course, until they become so light and so short that It will be worth no man’s time to write one? They will bring no credit, they will bring no cash; and cash and credit both having ceased, their natural vanishing point will have been attained. Thus will the trade of novel writing under the influence of other trades and of the *• Big Stick" be ended? And afterward will the art of fiction reappear among us, reborn into its old classic proportions and nobility? Some time will the millions of future Americans find their Fielding, their Thackeray, their Scott, their Jane Austen, their George Eliot? If it is not to be, It ought to be; and I can never believe that the deeper and the more careful our national life, the more shallow and careless our national literature.
No attempt has here been made to write a review of Mr. Valentine’s novel.
I have been more interested briefly to discuss it upon the single ground that It illustrates the reappearance and reunion of certain elemental forces in our National art. It does not drift away with the flattening tides but makes its pathway up stream against the rush of lowering tendencies. My faith in it and for it rests thus upon four grounds: Its choice of a great American theme;
Its reliance upon the dramatic presentation of human character as the novelist’s true business; Its insistence upon giving human life its due place, in nature, and its adherence, for all this, to the lofty standards of English stylo.
