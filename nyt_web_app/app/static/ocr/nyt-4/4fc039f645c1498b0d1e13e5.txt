Ernst Haeckel, author of ‘‘ The Riddle of the Universe,” " History of Creation,”
" Systematische Phylogenie," &c.t points out In the preface to the fifth edition of his *' Anthropogenic," -which has been
translated into English by Joseph McCabe and is about to be brought out by G. P. Putnam’s Sons, that he has considerably increased the number of illustrations, in order to make the work more accessible to a wider class of readers. There are now to be thirty plates, 512 illustrations in the text, sixty genealogical tables, and the text has been extended to sixty-tWO sheets, Some of the chapters have been " substantially " improved, and others rewritten. It has been the-author’s purpose to introduce ** the thoughtful reader into the great and wonderful realm of the evolution of man, ana stimulate him to reflect on its significance.” He writes in his preface:
Paleontology is even more neglected than comparative anatomy and classification by most of our modern embryolOgists. Many of them are totally ignorant of it. Nevertheless, the fossils, the historical succession and systematic arrangement of which taught in paleontology, are just as important documents for the history of the stem as the embryos which are taken by these one-sided embryologists to be the only fitting subject of research. We must, it is true, grant that most of the paleontologists are equally narrow; they commonly lack the necessary preliminary training in comparative anatomy and embryology' which is indispensable for the correct appreciation of the fossilized remains and their phylogf1 netis significance.
In preparing this fifth edition of his
work, the author adds, it has been his
" chief and constant care to avoid this
narrowness, and to use all three docu- J
ments bearing on our ancestral history in even greater force and harmony than in the preceding - editions—paleontology. ; comparatfve anatomy, and ontogeny. The work will be published here with the title.
“• The Evolution of Man; A Popular Scientific Study.”
