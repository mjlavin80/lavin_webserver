Of tho six volumes to compose the " Diary of Mmlamo d'Arblay." with preface and notes hy Austin Dobson, (the Macmillan Company.) the third and fourth arc now out. The r^vi^w of tho first two volumes, written by Mr. II. J\V. Boynton, and published in The New York Times Hook Review several weeks ago, will su/fice 'as to the critical aspect for the third and fourth volumes as well* Mr. Dobson continues his method with Maoame d’Arblay’s t/'xt as edited by her niece. Charlotte Barrett. That method is simply to provide an index and to supply in foot notes such Inform tPtior. as wilt serve to identify per- , sons and events mentioned in Fanny Burney's lively narrative. The period with which Volume TIT. is oonccmed is by no means Lhe least interesting of thi- authors life. It covers the years 17SG, 1787, and 1788 when Miss Burnc‘3' was attached to the household of the Queen, and the pages are full of gossip about the famous personages she met about the Court, about their Majesties and the Princes and Princesses, and all the famous people of a period whose lights owe so much of their peculiar radiance to Horace Walpole and tho author of " Evelina." It is not necessary to go largely into particulars, but the trial of Warren Hastings is one of tho events described in this part of tho work. You read how Mr. Pitt spoko and Mt*. Burke and how Mrs. Siddona played Portia. The appendix is a letter in which is described a visit of the Queen to Fanny when she was sick. It is a delightful letter, the writer of which is Mrs. Phillips.
The illustrations in the volume are ex-celicntJy executed reproductions ot portraits of Mrs. Delany, of Warren Hastings, and William Wyndham, with views of Beaumont Lodge, Chesaington Hall, St. James’s Palace. St. George'a Chapel, St. Jameses Park, the Prince of Wales House at Kew, and the Trial of Warren Hastings.
The fourth volume of the " Diary and Letters " continues the period of the authors life in the shadow of a Queen, (to say nothing of a mad King,) talcing up the thread in 1788 and covering the years 17Si> and	till	Miss	Burney's
final relinquishment of her placo about the roya! person in 1T91.
