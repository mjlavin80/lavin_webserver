Kcw Ycrk Times Boon Review:.	.
Mrs. Humphry Ward apparently Is fond of discussing questions of feminine misconduct; but it would bo Interesting to ‘ know, after reading “ Lady Rose's Daughter ’* and *' The Marriage o£ William Ashe*" what are Mrs. Ward's views as . to the proper masculine attitude toward otherwise charming women who have a tendency to fly off ths handle. If Mrs, Ward intends both Jacob Delafleld and William Ashe for models of masculinity, there is a singular difference in their behavior toward the prospective objects of their affection. Delafleld used Interference in the affairs of his sweetheart before he had any legal right, to do so, while Ashe was supine when he had all the right in the world to Interfere. Is It Mrs. Ward's position that one should assert one’s self only in the prenuptial state of affairs/and after marriage make the best of it by letting things drift? It would be Interesting to know.
