mS.CHESNUT’S DIARY.
A Chronicle of Southern Lite by the * Wife of a Confederate States*'
-	man	and Soldier.*
TILL the civJJ war literature grows!. Volumes of. reminiscence, letters, and formal < treatises have made tlielr appearance every year since the close of tfie great struggle. More than 300 separate ] works treating of the events of IStJO to
*	1863 are listed as authoritative historical sources in the best bibliographies of ihe subject, and twice as many others have probably some.claim on the student's at. ten Up n. The demand for information
about the war has not, however, been satisfied; each new volume meets with . readir sale, and the story teller who can i dress up the war heroes with a little to*, mance and less historic incident is sure of his fqvtuot and his fame. ’The truth ir -we are all beginning to see that great j crisis In American history in proper per-spectfve. As Gen. Gordon said in his val-liable book last year,’ and as Gen. Lee Uught all his life, there was not all of :
; right on one siao nor all of wrong on the : other. And as time goes on it will proh-
•	ably become clear that the war was but
one ot the great stages in the evOhrtlon : of ” democratic Government ^oh the ! earth.”	1
The author of " A Diary from DIsie,” the wife-of James Chesnut of South Caro-Ilna, was a very intelligent woman*, &he f was herself the daughter ot a United ! States Senator from Alabama and- her j husband was a Senator in .Congress for | two years prior to the outbreak of the war; and during the war her time was spent in Charleston. Columbia, Richmond, and Camden, S. C. She was an intimate'' friend of Mrp- Jefferson Davis when both were living in Washington during the late fifties, and the trying years of the war, it seems, brought the two ladies closer together than they had ever been.
A number ot quotations from Mrs, Davis's letters attest this,-In tone and character this new war book is admirable, though, of course, there is no general scheme or plan or even purpose except to record the-talk of the time with occasional expressions of personal views which lu most instances are far from being tedious. Indeed, the circle out of which come these pleasant nates of the past Is a sufficient pledge as to tbe nature of the work. James Chesnut, Jr., was the son o- one of the wealthiest Southern planters, and his mother, still living at the outbreak or hostilities, was the sister or the wife of the famous Philadelphia lawyer, Horace Binney. Both the Chesnuts, father and son, like -so many other Southerners of Tank, were educated at Princeton College. The Chesnuts, with their up-country* neighbors in South Carolina, were notextrdm-Ists; they had not been ardent milliners. The author of this diary regretted the seeming' necessity or secession, and sjie realized, as did her husband, the great odds against which the new government would have to contend. She wrote, at Montgomery, Ala., Feb 19, 18G1:
I am despondent once more. If I thought them in earnest because at first ■they put their best in front, what now? We have to meet tremendous odds by pluck, activity, zeal, dash, endurance of the toughest, military instinct. We have had to choose born leaders of men who could attract love and secure trust.
Bvit she hastens to add, not without a sigh:
Everywhere political intrigue is as rife as in Washington.	» * * Everybody
who comes here fMontgomery. Feb, 25] wants an office, and the many who, of course, are disappointed raise a cry of corruption against the few who are successful I thought we had left all that in Washington. (Page 9.)
From Montgomery Mrs. Chesnut goes to Charleston to witness the attack on Fort Sumter. She had hoped against hope that bloodshed might be avoided; but her own feu^band, ns aide to Gen. Beauregard, bore the final message to Major Anderson announcing ihat the guns of the Confederacy would open fire at 4:30 A. M. on that fateful 12th of April. She fell upon her knees at the firing of the first gun. Everybody, nearly, she says, had gathered in that wealthy centre of Southern life and activity to witness the opening contest—it -was a pleasure to live there, but for the terrible mission on which most men had come. She speaks of Koger Pryo-’s speech urging action an<J of Louis Wifrfall’s abuse of Jefferson Davis for not having been a more ardent secessionist.
A few days later the Chesnuts are again in Montgomery. A portentious conversation with Alexander Stephens is recorded in the diary:
At Mr. Toombs's reception Mr. Stephens came by me.* Twice before have we had it out on the subject of the Confederacy, I —once on the' cars, coming from Georgia here; once at supper, where he sat next me. To-day ne was not cheerful in his \jrws. I called him half-hearted, and ac-

From, the very beginning despondency, intrigue, and bitter hostility dogged the footsteps of President Davis. ,Wigfall Js an open enemy; Barnwell Khett of South.. Carolina waa a .disgruntled politician/ while the friends ot Howell Cobb and Robert Toombs maintain that the Southern President ought to have been. tahen from Georgia. .And some older politicians, still nursed grudges against Davis for supposed offenses dating back to Pierce’B/Ad-ministratlon. .Speaking of a certain unnamed Judge, the author says:
Mr. Chesnut' persuaded the Judge to forego hls-"prlvate wrong for the public good- What a pity to bring the spites of the Old Union into this new one. Itaeems to me already men are willing to risk ah injury to our cause, if they Jn so doing hurt Jeff Davis.
All through the book we find acoounts of the ever-increasing enmity of .leading Southerners, both-in Congress and in the fifcld, toward the Confederate Administration. Soon after the author takes up her residence in Richmond Mrs. Joseph E. Johnston's remark that Mrs; Jefferson Davis' was a " Western belle " was going the rounds of high society. A little later Mfrs. Johnston modified her remark so that it. stood: ^Mrs. Davis Is a Western woman” simply; Other influential society ladles began to criticise the President's family, contrasting them with Mrs. Robert E. Lee and her daughters, who were said to spend all their time knitting and sewing for the soldiers, declining Invitations to take part in social gatherings. The author resents the insinuations and attacks on Mrs. Davis. But the opposition to the President was of a stronger texture than society gossip. The failure to follow up the victory of Manassas must be laid to the account of some one—It was decided to make Mr. Davis responsible for this.
I Then the President arranged tlie appolnt-I ment of tbe general field officers In. such j a way that Joseph E.. Johnston was out; ranked by men who had been his inferiors , in -the old army. Immediately Johnston and all his party took/up the .matter. Newspaper wrangles foilowed. Toombs, ; too, becomes so disgusted with the.Admfn- I '■tstration that he resigned in such a way I that every one understood his action as a t protest against the conduct of public af-, fairs. Wigfall goes so far as to wish he might see the President hanged, <Dec. 5, 1864): " From a small rill in the mountain has flowed the mighty stream which made at last Louis Wigfall the worst enemy the President has in Congress," and a letter from Mrs. Davis, bearing the date of Nov. I 20, 18G4, says: "The temper of Congress is less vicious, but more concerted In its 1 action;** Mrs. Chesnut silenced many a*! tirade against Mr. Davis; she greatly admired him and thought him admirably fitted lor his position. That so many and such eminently respectable characters should array themselves against the Chief Executive was due, she thought, to the Southerners’ views of personal and political liberty. These bold secessionists and ** fire:eating *\!soldiers were impatient of restraint at every point. 'They could not permit any one, even for their own country’s sake, to exercise authority over them.	\
Unconsciously, too, the author rccords a-^ause of this ;Hl-feeling: The Confederate Government, in Its desire to con* dilate prominent families, was too lavish in bestowing Important offices on members of these families. Men laughed when James M-. Mason -was sent to London. Mason liad, to be sure, been a prominent leadeTprior to the war, but he -was al&o a close kinsman of Adjt. Gen. Cooper. Robert E. Lee was thought to be another favorite—he was, a close kinsman of 3fa-1 eon. And Custis Lee was put on Davis’S staff, Northrop, a personal favorite of Davis, was kept in the commissary department throughout the war though protests were constantly pouring Into the President's office. Bragg and Pemberton, as all the world knows, were rapfdly elevated to high commands without hav-mg “ worked their way up.” If the President liked one there was no way of preventing his promoting him—even though the cause for which all were straggling suffered visibly. Still, as has been observed, Mrs. Chesnut had no Intention of criticising the Presideut.
When the end came it seems to have been expected,, and the author consoles herself by the reflection that foreign enlistments, foreign loans, and overwhelming odds were the causes of the disaster. The overthrow of slavery appears almost to have come as a relief rather than as an irreparable injury. Her husband lost money on his negroes during the war, and her father-in-law lost a half million in , bonds or other securities because of tho i necessity of supplying his thousand slaves with provisions and clothing at a very high price and at a time when their labor i could not he profitably employed. Thai i the writer lived within the belt o,r country laid waste by Sherman's march and 1 suffered some rather small losses seems not to have colored unduly her entries concerning the march of the " modern Attila/' as some people term him. Soma sort of proof; though it Is quite inconr elusive to the historical student, that the . responsibility for the burning of Colum-. hia rests upon Gen. Sherraajx is. offered.

.. To suin up: ThU diary has^ decided Msh. j torical value, in that it shows so-ttmuh of . the spirit which prevailed In Charleston arjd Montgomery during the Winter aVifl' Sprfnff of 1801'; further, it ia ah intimate recdrd of an intelligent on-looker In XUcH-tnond daring a^greater portion- of the ; war; it shows thbre clearly'than usual the working or cliques and groups of opposition leaders and the effect of this od ; Mr. Davis's spirit rather , than' ftisjpoUcy; It offers some unintended proof that the Confederacy fell because or the failure of the people and their leaders to cooperate vigorously in advancing the cause they had espoused. ■	■
There are some discrepancies, some events, recorded earlier than the date of thefr occurrences, and the writer's habit of 'accumulating her Information and “ writing up ” the happenings or some wfceks at a sitting” 'militate seriously against the accuracy of the work. Jt Is, however, a lively, picturesque, and honest record o,t what was seen by one pair eyes and heard by one pair of ears at a momentous epoch in American his* tory. Both the student and the general reader will enjoy and profit by a perusal of these vital pages,
