HE- sixth volume of MTiie History of North America," which Prof, Guy CarJeton Lee is editing1, Is on the Revolutionary, period* It is written by two men, ■'and lienee ta a .collaboration -within a coir JUjoration.^ The first thing -which meets #ur,eyes on beginning the book is'a paternalistic and eulogistic introduction By the editor which had much better have teen omitted. It begins thus: "Thisvol-.Oinfe upon the American Revolution was wisely planned and Iws been well constructed,” and concludes with the following astonishing paragraph:	“The pres-
ent volume in its breadth and compre-lensivcness, its accuracy and impartial-Uy, forms a fitting conclusion to the volumes upon colonization that precede It, and it is no less valuable as an Introduction to the volume upon the Constitution* which is next In sequence in the History of North America, of which the Revolution is a worthy part” -What this kst means each reader 'will have to determine for himself.
Fortunately the authors do not share | obscurantism of the editor. They have
*	turned out a straightforward and scholarly history of the Revolution, dwelling especially on its political and economic aspects, though military .affairs are by no means neglected. They receive the attention that they deserve. . The treat-
xnent of the Revolution as a great political event is admirably fair. The authors’ method is whai we may call the* philosophical method of writing history, as distinguished, on the one hand, from the . * patriotic." and on the other from the “ iconoclastic *■ method. The “patriotic ” method* which has been going out of vogue of late, consists mainly in sanctifying everybody who had anything to do with the Revolution, while the "iconoclasts, In a spirit of violent reachon seek to depreciate the principles and the men of *76. This book does neither It shows that judged by the standards of the time. Britain's treatment of her Colories was neithsr inhumane nor excessively selfish. No State accepting the principles of the mercantilists could have acted In accordance with the most approved twentieth century ideals, On the other hand, it Is clearly shown that the colonists had very palpable grievance?.
The point is well brought out that as the Crisis approached there were many Opportunities for misunderstanding between England and the Colonies. Neither Grenville nor his successors took the colonists into their confidence. Their policy was halting and adventitious. Then, too, representation in England, when the composition of the House of Commons was virtually just what it had been under James I., meant one thing. In the Colonies, when changing conditions were far more perfectly reflected in the Legislature, it meant something different From I the English point of view, the "virtual representation ” of tho colonists in Pap, liament was a rational conception. In the eyes of the colonists talk of " virtual representation” was no better than arrant trifling. But even in England there were not wanting those who took America’s side here as in other matters, notably Lord Chatham. The idea that the Revolution 'was a contest between two peoples is, as the authors say, " utterly erroneous.” It is certainly no longer so regarded. It had many of the elements of a civil war, and some of its fiercest battles were fought in Parliament.
Enough has been said to indicate the value of the work under consideration.
It is historical in the best sense of the word and in general folly abreast of modern scholarship. An exception to this statement must be made in connection with the authors* classification of the Colonies. They adhere, for no satisfactory reasons, to the old three-fold classification, or the reasons they give one is of doubtful validity and the other is no reason at all.
■	They say that the old classification is “ useful," but they do not prove that it is not open to the objections which have been brought against it, and if it is, it cannot be “ useful," or anything else, but misleading and confusing. They also assert that it is “ consecrated by tradi-tlon.” This is, of course, no reason at all for a scientific historian to retain it.
It may be doubted if, in January, 1775, Gage had " thirty-five thousand men " in Boston, and "almost as many men en route for the Colony," (P. 152.) On Page 35 Gov, Dongan is said to have been instructed in 1671 to allow no printing press in New York Dongan was not appointed Governor for more than ten years after this date. But the errors are few and pardonable.
Mention must be made of the illustrations in this volume, it would be worth having for them alone. They consist of - «
