Such a beautiful fan! sticks of jade and enamel, beads of jade and amber hooped with gold depending- Irorn It. Most valuable feature of all from the point of view of the Mandarin Lo-Keong and of his enemy, Hop-Sing, hidden under the enamel was a record of the secret place "where poor Lo had concealed the assorted. lot of documents that showed his record as an ex-Boxer leader. Clever as the plot Is, there are several woefully weak links, though a rapid reader Is pretty sure to overlook these while engrossed In the really • thrilling story.
Contrary to his usual custom, Fergus . Hume has given us better character drawing than plot In this tale of a fan* Miss Wharf, the victim, is an aggressive old lady, very proud of the estate of £500 a year that she can leave as she likes. Her niece, Olivia Bayner, disdains this paltry bribe, will not marry Clarence Borgh,
^ the vulgar villain, nor give up Rupert Alnslelgh. the noble hero. Miss Wharf’s sneaking, tale-bearing companion. Miss Pewsey, commonly stigmatized as ** The Pussy-cat,” is more than ready to crawl and lie and cause the death of any and every one if onljrshe can secure that £500. She and her rogue of a nephew cause such a tangle of fan or no fan that it takes all tlie efforts of the- Ainslelgh ghost, the Mandarin Xjo-Keong, hi 9 personal god Kwang-Ho, and a horde of coolies to re. ward the hero and punish the villains.
