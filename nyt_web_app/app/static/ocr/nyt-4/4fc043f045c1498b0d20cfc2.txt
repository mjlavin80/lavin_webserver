One of .these. Is a young man who Is driven Into insanity by the clever application of certain drugs. Among his visitors in the asylum is a gray-haired, ;klndly appearing old gentleman, yet, * as 'is later brought to light, the patient is ^always more violent after these visits. At last he . takes his life. The second murder is that of a wealthy young man who Is suddenly stricken white playing billiards. The nice old gentleman and two friends- were around the table at the, .time., A piece of chalk,, saturated wjth a virulent poison which the young man .nervously nibbled at In his play, explains the cause of his death.

The doctor knows at once what did It. “He died as soon as he put that cigar Into his'fhouth," is his explanation. So the story, ends, but to be faithful to the principles of, an orthodox novel, the doctor marries the-daughter of the woman who was mysteriously stricken with apoplexy.	.	.
