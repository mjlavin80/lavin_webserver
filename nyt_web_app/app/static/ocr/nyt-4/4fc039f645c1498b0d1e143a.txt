Memories of Southern days /following . the reconstruction period are vividly re* called In this splendidly told Story. The picture of the old plantations, their ancient glory, iru. many cases vanished,
• through the Inability of their owners to r j adapt, themselves to new conditions of , life, is delightfully drawn. The. negroes j are still the typical darkles of the South* • j good-natured and laughing and ever
faithful to master and mistress. „ i The love plot that runs through the story, which is intensified by otartllngly . tragic incidents, exhibits the old time ’ Southern, chivalry in both its best and Us worst phases. Stephen RavaneJ, the i hero, never forgets the. awful Impression left upon him as a- little child, at the -sight of the cold white face of his as-sasslnated father. The political troubles following tiie war led to the HO timely death of Major BavaneL 'fEe murderer
was not prosecuted, for it seemed 4iseless at the time. Yet, in Stephen’s heart, the premonition never left him day or- night, that some time .he would meet his father'd elayer face to face.
Twenty or more years later Stephen meets the son of his father’s murderer. Every hereditary instinct rises up lit obedience to the impulse or vengeance. But he'cannot make the son the victim, 1 neither can he taKe the outstretched hand	|
proffered In perfect innocence. That very	I
night. In a hotel room, Stephen suddenly jj meets the man whom he has not sought, but whom he has calmly awaited in the circling events of time. The murderer reveals himself bv a hideous nightmare to which he has oeen subject for years at certain hours of the night. He is haunted by the fear that Major Bavanel confronts him. On tlrc fatal night awakening from one of his frightful visions, he sees Stephen, who is almost the perfect image of his father, in the room before . him. A life and death struggle ensues, hut the young man emerges unharmed ^ and does not deny that he has become a ‘murderer to avenge his father’s death.
I The trial takes place in Vicksburg and Stephen-is acquitted. Then the awTulners of his ciime, the horror of shedding human blood, overwhelms him. His friends fear that his reason will give way* Only one person has a quieting effect upon , him. That is Marcia Greys tone, the delightful, lovable daughter ot his father’s old General, now an old man, but a i Southern gentleman of the best type.
Yet Stephen hardly dares to love her, for i only a short time before his own deed of i blood he was a witness ot the horrible I aversion she feels In even touching the hand of a visitor who had slain a man in a duel.
i The tragedy of the story is admirably i mellowed with its pathos. The characters are skillfully drawn and a genuine depth I Of interest Js aroused which never flags until the book ends, amid all its sorrows, with happiness and cheer.
