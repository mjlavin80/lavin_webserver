Apropos of your article In a recent issue of The Bp^K Rkvikw, I entirely Hgrcc that Dfckcns la past master in,' pathos, which to me never once sinks to bathos. It is said that Dickens walked ' the streets of London for hours the night Ltttlc Nell died. Greater love hath no inan than had Sidney Carton, 'who laid down his life for his friend. Who can read with dry eyes that last great scene when he ascends the scaffold to'fro to the " better place M ? A volume might bo written on yarhetie .scenes and incidents from Pickens. The sorrows of Ramona and Alessandro have been mine,,' and I shed many a tear In my girlhood days vowing that my maturer life should he spent in righting the wrongs of the poor Indian.

The love of Mangle Tulliver/ Romoia's life tragedy, the loves and deaths and partings of the classics even are full of tears; Virgil also seeks to fill our hearts with sympathy, but it has remained for a writer of this commercial age to give to i the world a tragedy of two souls which , has never- been, excelled for its delineation of the inward struggle between conscience and the desires of the world. I refer to Robert Hlchens’s ** Garden of Allah**’ Aside from tho great moral issue in question* the book is absorbingly interesting and beautifully written. Not being a Romanist. I cannot believe that the mutual renunciation of Domini and Boris was right, but from their view it was the only way to save the soul of Boris. In contemplating the crucifixion of these two lives, I can only say with the old hymn, " Would my tears forever flow.”
Perhaps a book of such power tending to arouse our deepest and most sacred sympathies does not work for good in. us to bear tho petty trials of this workaday world; but in contemplating this heartrending tragedy, in which the possibilities forever lure us on like a will-o’-wisp, I can only say that I am thankful the All-Wise One never asks us poor weak mortals to render to Him a sacrifice like the lives of Boris and Domini.
