The new edition of Richard Jefferies’s famous story of a boy for boys, “Bevis,” in which the author writes of his ideal boyhQod;; is brought out this week by ]£. P. Dutton. E. V. Lucas has written an introduction for it, and inserted a map of the “ New Sea,” which was designed, he says, “ especially toy a youthful carto- ; grapher and enthusiastic admirer of Bevis.” Mr. Lucas, in writing of the story, says:	.	.
’ I know no other boys’ book by a man of genius which so eliminates direct adult .’influence as does this. Bevis’s parents •■are- the merest shadows, (as parents-ought' ,to be*!n such-works;) Mark's practically ‘do not'exist; “Bevis” is a long and eloquent, and,- I think, successful argument in favor of the wisdom of leaving boys 'to themselves^ and allowing independence' and self-reliance, to oust for the time •toeing school books and tutors. Through-i out the latter half -of-.the story one notes the - gradual strength ening of character In the boys as they -attempt more, and •more, unaided and, of their own initiative. The Bevis of the end of the book is a very much, finer boy than. the. Bevis of Chapter VII., although only a few weeks
have elapsed.- But in those-weeks he had done much. .As a book for boys ** Bevis,”
I think, stands alone in . its blend of joy in the.open air, sympathetic understanding of.boy nature; and' most admirable writing. * * * M Bevis *' always rings •rtrue in its zest In'Ufe and In Its. natural history, aa&most alwaya in. its psychology-. •* *' 4*Bevt3 V has other value than that of mere' entertainment. 'It tells us’ much not 'only of. boy - nature in general, but of boy. nature in particular—that is to say, of Richard-Jefferies.
