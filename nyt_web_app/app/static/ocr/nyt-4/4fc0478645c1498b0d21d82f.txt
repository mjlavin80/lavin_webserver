NEW; work of fiction called " The . Mortgage on the -Brain,” written by Vincent Harper ana published by Doubledny, Page & Co., embodies a phase of the the. ories of dual personality and . subliminal consciousncss, which if noten-tirely new i8 at least strange to most persons who customarily read what, is printed on those subjects, either avowed fiction or statements ot alleged facts., The psychical research folks have interested themselves In the phenomena supposedly associated with these fascinating theories In the hope of securing by strictly scientific investigation some proof of the immortality of the soul. As we have understood, Prof. Boris Sldis’s purely sclen-i title attitude toward the case ot the now
-	celebrated Mr.' Hanna, of whom he writes in his " Multiple Personality/’ (reviewed Dec. 3, 1904,) is not inconsistent with the Ideas of the members of the psychical research societies. Dr. Sidis certainly believes In the existence of two well defined personalities fighting for the possession of the same body. The author of “ The Mortgage on the Brain/' however, affects to believe that what is known as dual personality is clear proof that (scientifically speaking) there is no such thing as personality, that subliminal consciousness proves, not that man must
•	have a soul, but that character, genius,
, all mental and moral traits, are the result of purely physical conditions. On this account, and this alone, the new novel by Vincent Harper is noteworthy.

The strange woman -who is the central personage of this queer story has three distinct personalities. We must use the word, in spite of Mr. Harper’s theory. In fact, he is forced to employ it himself. His heroine is Lady Torbeth, the cultivated, self-centred, high-minded wife of a British peer, and daughter of a distinguished clergyman. She is also a Miss Errington, neurotic and erotic, and a Miss Leighton, sentimental and innocent. The three personalities are sometimes confused. The problem is to expel the two superfluous personalities from the brain o£ Lady Tovbeth. This is accomplished by a sort of syndicate ot eminent European physicians and other men of science tfy the employment of radio-actiV'-ity, electricity, hypnotism, and mumbo-jumbo jargon.
Stones about dual personality, are as old as Dumas’s CagHostro romances, if not older. There is one. -with some novel developments, which begins its run as a
serial in the current number of the- Cos-
mopolltan Magazine, namely, "The Oc-cultation of Florian Amldon,” by Herbert Quick, which promises to be vastly more entertaining than Mr. Harper’s book. The short story writers have not neglected a subject so fruitful.

As a story Mr,^ Harper's novel is Ill-constructed and unsatisfactory. Ho writes in the guise of an intellectually advanced Englishman, disgusted with the plodding conservatism of his fellow-countryman. The type Is recognizable, but the novelist does not carry the r&le well, Ytis knowledge of the geography of London and Its environment, moreover, and of English polite manners, also, is lamentably deficient. He make9 Lord Torbeth, who ranks as Viscount, speak of his wife in common conversation many times as “ the Viscountess.” He makes a gentleman of good breeding address Lord Torbeth, in common conversation, as " my lord ” a dozen times. These are trivial faults, but they help to weaken the illusion of a story that is otherwise clumsily told, and deals with things that are beyond the ordinary comprehension. It takes a Wells to do this sort of thing effectively. Whether or not it is worth doing fs another matter.

Mr. Harper would do well to give some attention to Mr, James Lane Allen’s analysis of the processes by which a great novelist produces his work in the article on American fiction which we print this week. Mr. Harper may have fancied that he discovered a great subject for a novel in the life around him. But he surely did not see It an clearly, as in " some wonderful, pellucid, unshaken mirror/’ before be began to write, and as surely he had not '* learned to transfix his vision, whole and true, for the eyes and minds of mankind.**
