CAMILLE MAUCLAIR has written at length to explain the sculptor Rodin to an awestruck world and sets out to describe the man, his ideas, and his works. He recalls the person who in Bouffon’s presence described a crab as an insect of a red color that runs backward, on which Bouf-fon remarked that he was sorry to differ with, him, but the crab was not an insect, was not red, and did not walk backward. M. Camille Mauclair does not leave us with the feeling that we know the man Rodin; he gives merely the haziest notion of Rodin’s ideas and to a limited degree only supplies the reader with the sculptor’s works. Some of these omissions, one must hasten in justice to say, are not so much M. Mauclair's fault as his misfortune.
, The nearest approach we get to Rodin is when he is characterized as a man of middle height, “ enormous " head and massive torso, strong nose, gray beard, and “small, keen, light-colored eyes* slightly veiled by short sight and by a gentle irony.” The impression of power of this leonine appearance, it seems, is accentuated by the rolling gait, 11 the rocky aspect of the troubled brow under the rough brush of hair, the bony thickness of . the aquiline nose and the ample curis of beard/' Unfortunately, the photograph does not corroborate all these feral and birdlike attributes; we have an old man with a well-shaped but not an aquiline nose, a rather retreating forehead, and an overlarge ear. Of course the picture cannot give the quick look, (penetrating, simple, and arch,) "one of the most composite glances I have ever seen,” nor the voice which, we learn, is hollow, not easily modulated “ with deep inflections and sudden returns to a dental pronunciation, and of which the meaning and intention are further modified by certain very expressive toss* ings of the head.'' But here, too, we remain a trifle skeptical.
Now, one may understand the gentle irony in the Rodin as. depicted by M. Mauclair, but not those “ tossings M of the head which suggest emptiness in/ that quarter—unless, indeed, M. Mauclair . intended to say “ noddings,” which, as we know, are attributes of Jove. This we are the more inclined to believe, since on page 87 we find Auguste Rodin in full apotheosis, standing over the world with a composite look of gloom and satiric sweetness on that troubled brow, thus:
Rodtn, gloomy psychologist of passion, understands the disease of the age and at the same time pities it. A true thinker, he extracts its mournful beauty without ceasing to retain faith, admiration and affection for the human creature (!) Bending over life and over his work, he is himself his own Thinker, attentive and reverent before an unknown and terrible dignity. .
Thus has M. Mauclair made of Rodin a god admiring himself in his own creation, a kind of artist-Dowie, before whom all must bend In adoration. It-reminds one of the little band of adorers round the “ good gray poet ’* Walt Whitman, who encouraged him In the dream that he was a man apart from humanity who had discovered the only infallible path of literature and thereby proved all other poets wretched bunglers. In this vein M. Mauclair- goes on to say: “Never did any other sculptor attempt to vivify his art with such intellectual superiority and by such meditations, and Rodin is at once the most realistic and most metaphysical of poets ill stone and bronze.”
When we get to the actual statements by Auguste Rodin, however, the turgidity of M. Mauclair is revealed. Judged by what he says about his own art, Rodin is anything but a clear thinker and shows that he does not know what to think about himself. Now he is the only sculptor who understands the Greek way of looking at art without copying Greek methods, and again he is in line with the simple workmen. who wrought statuary in what is weirdly termed the Gothic, or must we say Celtic? style.

This handsome volume leaves one confused between the statements of the biographer and those of the sculptor.. But it. Is of the highest interest in many respects" and deserves careful consideration, particularly with regard to Rodin’s views as to the education of artists (more especially sculptors) and the evil effects of study from the antique before the student Is
Here is a pretty embroilment of Ideas in a great thinker J -•	.	-	;	!
Rodin, says M. Mauclair, Is convinced that he is classical and rebels against the ! school which-clalrfis to be so.- He has tlie I greatest admiration for the Renascence, but declares that he does not clearly understand the genius of the Gothic sculptors. He admires it, but has not thoroughly penetn*i3d it.
I feel it, but I cannot express it, I cannot analyze the Celtic genius to . my own satisfaction. In the Middle Ages art came from groups, not from individual. It was anonymous; the sculptors of cathedrals no more put their names to their works than our workmen put theirs on the pavement that they lay. Ah, what an admirable scorn of notoriety! The signature^ what destroys us. We do portraits, but what we do is not so great. Those kings and queens on the cathedrals were not portraits* The fellow-workers stood for rne another, and thty interpreted; they did not copy. They made clothed figures; the nude and portraiture only date from the Renascence. And then those fellows cut with the tool's end Into the block; that is why they were called sculptors. As for us. we arc modelers.
So, when we get Hodln in quotation marks,, we find him seeing clearly enough that something is amiss, but grasping at any straw to explain the situation, thus disproving the claims made for his piercing intellect by his injudicious friend. M. Mauclair 3s not content to offer certain work by Rodin In proof that he Is a very remarkable sculptor, perhaps in ■Some ways the greatest sculptor living, but must needs make claims for him so preposterous as to do him injury by exciting opposition. The statement often made that Rodin has been greatly Influenced by Michael Angelo irritates M. Mauclair. .who remarks in a foot note:
It is the exceeding obviousness that leads me to distrust It. Rodin Is much nearer to Puget than to Michael Angelo, who Is muscular strength carried to heroic proportions. Rodin, like Puget and more than Puget, is nervous strength. Rodin appears much more akin to Michael Augelo than he really is.
Yet what do we learn from Rodin himself? (Page G4.) In regard to the Renascence and Michael Angelo he (Rodin) reports that he received no "decisive" lesson from eiibcr until after a journey to Italy in ?875.-
I believed before that (hs says) that movement was the whole secret of this art and I put my models into positions like those of Michael Angelo. But as I went on observing the free attitudes of my models I perceived that they possessed these naturally, and that Michael Angelo had not preconceived them, but merely transcribed them according to the personal inspiration of human beings moved by the need of action. I went to Rome to look for what may be found everywhere: the latent heroic in every natural movement.
Whenever M. Mauclair allows the sculpr tor to speak we find him a groper, not a clear thinker, a man naturally bounded by the narrow horizons of his youth, and only very slowly and painfully detecting gleams here and there which he tries to follow. This is very much more to his credit than the fantastic character given him by his well-wisher and admirer.
So with regard to Rodin the deep symbolist:	we soon perceive that he has
usually groped toward a pose or attitude or combination of attitudes in several figures, and then sought a symbolism to fit—sometimes with meagre success. This is what M. Mauclair veils in his remark about ** Rodin’s generalizing spirit,'’ which “ leads him from the realism o£ his daily Tvork to the synthesis of a sort of ideo-realistic metaphysical system.” Doubtless in the untrammeled freedom of the atelier among his cronies Rodin would have a shorter word for this, say the word “ la blague.’’ But that would be very ungrateful to M. Mauclair, who, like the historical musician, is doing his hest.
The strange fact sot explained by this biographer that Rodin likes to show his sketches and the various stages of a monument to the public Is only another sign of the groping and uncertain character of his great talent. He is not the deep mind that conceives a figure, sees it in the marble, carves it exactly as It was conceived so far as the material will allow. He is more Teutonic than Celtic, least of all classical in any sense permitted such a word. But that is not blameworthy. As the French say, he drinks from his own glass. What is mistaken is the attempt to boost him into alien shoes and make brags for him which are immediately punctured by bis own remarks, and, if he k-opt silence, would not tally with his own works. He is like Whitman in attempting more than he can do—small blame to them for their grand
I emprise!—keeping a huge “Noah's Ark” of sculptures called “ The Gate of Hell,” into which he crams anything that comes to his mind, as Whitman crammed ideas irrelevant and relevant into “ Leaves of Grass.” Xow and then Rodin takes one of these half-digested ideas and works away on an enlargement, just rfs Whitman did, and in his case as In Whitman's the result Is all that we have a right to demand from the createst sculptor.
I Invent nothing; I rediscover. And the thing seems new because the people have generally lost sight of the aim and means of art. They take that for an innovation which is nothing but a return to the laws of the great sculpture of Ion" aso. Obviously, I think. I like certain symbols; I see things in a svnthetlc way; but it is nature that gives me all that-, -1 1 do not imitate the Greeks; I try to put myself fn the spiritual state of the men 1 who have left us the antique statues. The
ripe. Though not original with Rodin, j these views come with great weight from [ a man who has shown such marked orlg-inality in his sculptures, and such variety as well. Whatever honors have befallen him are well deserved; but as one listens to the gorgeous twaddle that . ever encircles him one exclaims: " Save him from his friends!"
