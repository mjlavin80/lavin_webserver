I noticed lri a recant number of/Tns-Book Review a comment on tbe. story/ now running: in Scribner's Mngafclne called " The .House of Mirth/* by Mrp. Wharton. ’ What you said seems to me pretty good, but I'do not think you said •quite enough. We are constantly read-*, ing" In what are called %i yellow journals *' about the doings of people In society, the so-called *■ smart set,’/ and certainly their, ways of life and use of time are enough to . make old-fashioned; mothers shudder. Lily Bart, who seems to be the heroine of Mrs. Wharton’s story, is apparently capable of /better things/but she is one of those young women, like so many others of our time, who are brought up In the lap ot luxury, and who can see no possible good In the lives of the great middle, class; people of moderate means, whose. Incomes do not allow them to play bridge for large stakes, and go fattling around
■	the country killing pebpie In big automobiles. If the people in Mrs. Wharton’s story are real people, (and they certainly, give one that impression,) it is about time that the ' so-called " Pour Hundred" should be deprived of their prestige as leaders. Their one idea seems to be to spend money and make a display* and they are apparently utterly selfish and indifferent, to the things that some or us, who were taught to value the New Eng-| land conscience, care for, even In these r degenerate days. Certainly this story is | about a3 scathing a revelation of “socl-
I	ety ” as one might wish to read.
