Mr. JESTS']es ton’s " Iteeollectlons *' were first published in Tho Atlantic Monthly as long- ago as 1S74. when W. D. Howells was editor of that dignified periodical. Later they appeared in book form and have passed through several editions, but up to the present an addiuonal article on
The Old Regime in the Old Dominion ” (originally also written for The Atlantic) hay not been included with the rest. This additional article is the first in the volume before us, which, moreover, is provided with an explanatory preface.
The bock contains in a very readablo form a deal of information about the Confederacy, which Mr. Eggleston had first hnnd. This information is colored and enlivened, us all first-hand information is apt to be, of course, by Mr. Eggleston’s , prejudices—for Instance, he is hardly fair to Jefferson Davis and other civil authorities of the Government at Richmond; but tho fact that it was written only nine years after the close of the war gives it bcth a freshness and an authority of detail. while the other fact that it w'as written for The Atlantic in the very heart of the victorious enemy's camp is warrant of —
| temperatentss of language In the statement of Southern views. To be sure, Mr.
I Eggleston emphasizes a little too much ! Virglni.Vs reluctance to secede—though .that reluctance wag real enough; to be , sure, his picture of antebellum life In Virginia is somewhat boldly Idealized, but, as the original articles must have contributed no Httlc to -the “ era of good reeling/* so I the present reissue will doubtless tend to the wider knowledge of some phases of | the struggle which later and more scien-I tlfic writers have neglected. Most people of the younger generation, both North anti South, who have not read the articles already will certainly get rrom the book some very suggestive Ideas about the Conr_ federate soldier in his raw state—before he was, as J. E. B. Stuart put it, *• reduced to the ranl;s "—since the average enlisted man was fitter in the beginning
for an officer than for a private—about the Confederate commissary and civil administration and about the mustering period Just before the storm broke. It has already been said that Mr. Eggleston overemphasizes certain features, but there Is a sort of advantage in that, for they are just the features which other writers
have been apt to Ignore.
