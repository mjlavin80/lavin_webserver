The Triumph of Judea.

The siege of the Assyrians under the wicked and brutal Holofernes against the Jews of Bethulia Is the field of Mr. Thompson Buchanan's second romance. For heroine he has chosen the Hebrew woman Judith, who risked her life and honor to go forth from the besieged city into the camp of the enemy, there to try to frustrate the plans of the Assyrians. Her adventures in the camp, the consummate evil of Holofernes, the malicious intrigues of the jealous Nin-Gul—a dancing girl from Damascus whom she supplanted in the affections of Holo-fernes—h.	..*n love for the1 Ammonite
Captain, u:c lordly Achoir, his valor and devotion in her behalf, and much war and bloodshed besides;—all this forms the theme of Mr. Buchanan's narrative.
The story, nevertheless, with its rich Oriental setting, its Biblical background, and its highly colored descriptions, appears to possess no unusual or particular qualities to distinguish it from the vast number of other equally interesting and entertaining narratives of the same period. For quick and easy reading, however, with plenty of spirit and no little action it can be highly commended.
