Th is book by Kenyon Cox (" Old Masters and New: Essays in Art Criticism/' 12mo. Pp. 311. New York:	Pox, Duf-
field & Co. $1.50) contains essays, rewritten, that have appeared on the subject during the last twenty years in various periodicals, principally in The Nation. They are written from the point of view of an artist, and express " the feelings, the judgments, to some extent the Special knowledge, of one who practices
*	* * one Qf the arts of which he writes, and who may, perhaps, be supposed to have an insight Into the aims and methods of his greater fellows denied to profounder intellects or more brilliant literary craftsmen.” The volume makes no pretensions to be a history of art; but it deals with more artists than those whose names figure In its chapter headings. It is, as Hr. Cox explains, a series of appreciations of individual masters, and, incidentally, gives a view of the course of painting since the sixteenth (jentury.
The artists principally discussed are Michelangelo, Durer, Rubens, Frans Hals, Rembrandt; William Blake, F. M. Brown, Burne-Jones, Afefssonler, Baudry, Puvis de Chavannes, Whistler, Sargent, Saint-Gaudens, Veronese, Perugino, and the Venetian artists, the Pre-Raphaelites, some of the lesser painters of the nineteenth century, and sculptors of the early Italian Renaissance- The book closes with a consideration of Saint-Gaudens’s statue of Sherman, at the entrance to Central Park, which was unveiled two years ago the coming Memorial Day. The author writes concerning it:
From every point of view the composition builds up superbly. The flow of line in wing and limb and drapery Is perfect; the heads are magnificent in characterization; the anatomical structure, human and equine, is thoroughly understood, and the surface modeling is beautiful in the extreme.
