b'ac Yovlc Times Book Review:
Bliss Carman in The book Kkv;ew has done us a service in pointing out precisely what is the matter with Swinburne. It seems to me that, so fur as a contemporary may, he has spoken the final word; that he has given concrete form to our long-standing impressions and that none could iipnraise the capacities and dearths of the tempestuous Algernon Charles more happily, accurately, and justly. But does not Mr. Carman lay too much stress upon what lie considers the necessity of restraint in poetic utterance? Do the poems that have lived longest and moved men the most deeply—that have captured the heart of feeling if not the brain of culture—betray a servile habit of repression, of nfce adjustment of balances, because, ■ forsooth, art has so decreed? I think not. Poetry is exuberance* Many architects of verse flawless as to technique have—alas!—no^ Impetuosity to restrain. Better that Pegasus should sometimes run away and throw his rider than that he should amble only under whip and spur and prove_ less a true ^charger of Parnassus than a very earthy, raw-boned ox of^ arid nieter-mongering, In poetry, as in oratory, what wo want Is tho dynamic word of earnestness. Be the message righteous, let the steed of torrential diction feel only the bit that Imposes
. coherence. "Art” and "proportion" be | hanged 1	.
Swinburne shocks and nauseates us, but | oh, how he can charm us! His are not ** songs without words," but largely songs with words meaningless as words, yet ' words so amazingly chosen and arranged , that their musical effect is intoxicating. They are the growl of distant thunder. : the chirp of birds, the sport of sunlit waves, the salving harmonies or pine for- | ests, th^ -sweep of harps, the luring crash ! of battle. He is a necromancer in the creation of stanzaic freaks—a deft mixer | of rhythmic cocktails where angel and serpont blend. His sentiment, so far as sentiment may be detected in those vague philistngs that " flash through the darkness of sound,” may not always be the worthiest; yet he has struck notes of freedom that are likely to count for some time to come, even though, as air. Carman has it, they resemble the.hysterics of i an invalid, fiver is he daring, sincere, and truth-serving according to,his tights, | and—he loves children. Give him high j credit at least for these!
