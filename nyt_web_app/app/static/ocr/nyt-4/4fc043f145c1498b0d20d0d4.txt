BOSTON NOTES,
HIRING the four years In which "Truth Dexter” has been passing from edition to edition, ‘*Sidney McCall ” has been writing a second book, and by good fortune she chose to mate It partly Japanese, both in scene and in personages, and set herself the task of revealing Japanese character and the formative 1n- l fluences to which its strength is due, and : thus gave her work an additional claim to attention at this moment *' The Breath of the Gods,” as it is entitled* is, however, in no sense partisan; it is in action, that Japanese traits are exhibited and compared with those of French and American personages. The scenes occur sometimes in Washington, sometimes In Japan, giving the, author a wide range of opportunities for striking description. The book is in press, and an uncommonly large edition will be ready May 13. Judging by the inquiries for a second book '‘.by the author of 4 Truth Dexter/ ” the advance orders will be many, and the best Is to be expected of a second book evidently written without haste to profit by the success of the first.
Psychology Is hardly'regarded as a woman’s subject, but when the woman has for years been the pupil of Prof. Mtinster-herg, holds the degree -of Ph. D-, and has lectured at Baddlffe, Wellesley.

Houghton & Mifflin's Spring list, j is sure of readers. It will contain intro- j dnctory chapters on criticism and aesthet- : Jcs, the nature of beauty, and aesthetic repose, and will discuss the beauty of fine art, music, literature, and ideas, and the nature of dramatic emotion.

started. The chapter on the drama will seek to define the precise nature of the experience Involved in assisting at a dramatic performance.

The hero of Mr. Frank Lewis Nason's « The Vision of Elijah Berl/’ to be published to-morrow fey Messrs. Little, Brown & <_*>., Is a, curious example of degenerate Puritanism; he has an ever-present certainty Of Divine guidance, without the very smallest atom of steadfast principle. About him gathers a group of persons maldng no pretense at holding: aiiy special favor frtfm above but determined to do good engineering work, or to preserve the honor ot a good old family, or to be honest in business, and a group of the pettily dishonest, and the effects which they produce upon one another axe woven into a good plot.

owing- to the general tm certainty 3-3 to what may happen anywhere In Asia wiiQe Japan engages Russia’s attention, and that, consequently, it is possible that Mr. Oric Bates, the author of *'A Madcap Cruise,” may return to Cambridge in time for class day. The Findlater sisters, Mrs. Wiggin’s co-authors in ~The Affair at the Inn,” have gone to Arkansas to visit Octave Thanet, although somewhat dismayed at the distance, which they had estimated on a scale adapted to the merid-13)1 of Greenwich. Mr. C. Hanford Henderson Is In Virginia, resting from Ins
labors upon *' The Children of Good Fortune.”
