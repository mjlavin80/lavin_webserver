'Sew York Times Book Rcvlac:
We are surprised that the editor of Thh Book Review should consider “ The Golden Bowl " the ** crucial test " for tho admirers of Mr. Henry James. Wo are not included in tlie list, yet we have found ** The Golden Bowl" the most lucid of anything Mr. James has written, and of absorbing interest. ** The Ambassadors " comes next. We had, to	!
sure, to give the phraseology our careful study for two days. After that period we : passed our examination and did not waver. We are# perhaps, initiated, but we ! admit we do not care to go through the i ordeal often. We were tired, very tired, j when we had finished, but it was worth the fatigue. We fell by the wayside *’ ! long ago, so far as Mr. James's other 1 book? are concerned. Now we have ! picked ourself up and shall be ready, by i and, by. to enjoy again "The Golden j Bowl ” and ** The Ambassadors." Never before could we have looked a second | time into one of Mr. James’s books. We wish he would not put the tail of his sentences where the head belongs, and the head where the body should be, or the body where one naturally expects to «ee the tail. Still, we know now where to look for the different parts, find can find them. The question really resolves itself, so far as liking Mr. James is concerned, into a matter of chacun ft, son goQt.
