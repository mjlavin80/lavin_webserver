An English Soldier's Study of the American Civil War.*
' ijT IXjrmtY real attempt to analyze' ! HmEs&wsH the results of the civil war BmKft toB 1s potentially valuable. Capt. jraGnwl Ceell Battine of the Fifteenth (" The King’s ’*) Hussars of the British Army, in his' / “The Crisis of the Confederacy/’ makes an honest attempt to deduce the reasons which won the war for the North, and, If his trial is not wholly-prosperous, it yet attains more than the average success, and - is to be. commended-to those who- wish a readable book, as well as to students of the war. Capt. Battlne tries to be 'fair, and'is on the Whole, He .has. kind words for the officers and men of both armies; and, if he comments enthusiastically on the ** heroic endurahce of the Southern armies,” he still admires /* the stubborn tenacity and courage which succeeded In preserving intact the heritage of the American Nation and triumphed over foes so formidable." As to the war as a whole, he say&i
The history of the American civil war still remains the theme for the student and the statesman because it was waged between adversaries of the highest Intelligence and courage* who fought by land and sea over an enormous area with every device- within the reach of human ingenuity. and who had to create every organisation needed for the purpose after the struggle had begun.
Gettysburg is the crisis of the* Confederacy of Capt, Battine, The first three chapters of his book are taken up with a hasty review of the beginning of the war, and of the battles of the Wilderness, down to and including the death of Jackson, and Hooker’s retreat • from Chan-cellorsville in May. 1863. In Chapter IV. Capt. Battine describes the preparations for carrying the war out of Africa instead of into it—Lee’s invasion of the North. Chapter V. covers the march to Gettysburg, and the next three chapters, the three days* fighting around Getty s-burg.	‘
It must be said at once that Capt. Battine has given a clearer and more intelligible account of the great battle than any other writer. This jn itself Is a noteworthy feat; for the hattle lasted so long and was fought at so many different points that it is difficult to maku a complete account of it—it becomes a, sort of chronicle of different battles which simply happened to be fought in the same neighborhood on the same days, Capt. Battine, however, brings those battles Into relationship with more clearness, we -think, than - any previous writer. The ninth chapter describes Lee's retreat from Gettysburg. The tenth chapter deals .With Meade’s campaign in Northern Virginia.
In Chapter XI. Capt. Battine covers Grant’s campaign in the Wilderness in 1864, and in his twelfth and final chapter he considers the American armies. Almost as much as Lee and Jackson, Mahan has taken a strong hold upon the English Imagination, so that it is not surprising to find that a section of this chapter considers the influenco of sea power on the American civil wav. Other portions of this chapter deal with matters more directly touching the subject of the book—American recruiting, methods of making war, use of cavalry, mounted riflemen, &c., and the chapter ends, apropos of the National cemeteries, with Lincoln’s Gettysburg address. Of Gettysburg, Capt. Battine says:
As a tactical study no battle furnishes more instruction than the great struggle at Gettysburg, both by reason of the determined valor of the troops and the experience and skill brought to bear in the leading of the brigades and divisions of both armies. It is also a very Important consideration that truthful records are available for a close and accurate investigation of the three days' contest. The place itself is not inaccessible, and if the study of military history led more British officers to visit America, they would gain nothing but good from the experience.
In no battle was the Importance of cavr airy more clearly demonstrated than in Gettysburg, and on the lucus a non lu-cendo - principle, since neither side had enough to provide cavalry patrols or other service of Information. On this point Capt. Battine, as becomes a cavalryman, is Insistent. In the first day’s fighting both sides were timid, because neither had more than the vaguest Idea of what its opponent was. The Confederates were successful on that day largely because of the prestige gained in earlier battles of the campaign—very , much as Yale goes on the football field with a victory half won. Of the second day’s' battle, Capt. Battlne writes that it " ranks as one of the finest performances | of the Confederate soldier. Had larger reinforcements been available next day ! to follow up the successes obtained, his sacrifices would probably have been I crowned with decisive success. That they | were not so. rewarded then and there was no fault of his, but of the leaders who on so many occasions before and after rose

ment^V i Cond^‘;to.r .the - final battle of— July 3, we find Capt.' -Battlne-jrnmrni ng ' up the result thus; :
After tbe Vw* armies Joined battle on July 1 the main detert&irung cause of the Confederate defeat'was the tactical error * of the commanding General In repeatedly failing to support his attacking columns, at the right moment. . On the Wednesday [the first day's battle] first Heath's division, then Rodes’s and Fender's, were dls--jointedly engaged; and but for the bold and Skillful co-operation of Early’s troops -the day might well have, been lost. So on Thursday the attacks on the Little Round Top position by Hood and McLaws needed but the forward impulse of another division at the crisis of the fight to carry the point. * * f On jFriday the whole army looked on In idleness while Ewell’s daring ’ attacking' troops were * overwhelmed on Culp’s Hill. The grand attack on the Federal centre was not assisted by any ad-* vance or feint against the enemy’s lines; and most important of all, the attacking lines received no timely support after they had penetrated into the position.
*	* * On the Federal side * * * the defense was ably conducted. Less question [than that of awaiting the attack on hjs centre] exists about the mistake of Meade in not following up the repulse of Pick-ott’fl chargG by a blow at ope of the Confederate advanced wings,
Capt Battine's estimates of some of the* leaders on both sides are interesting. Grant had "a somewhat whimei-cal name,” and '’from the start, commanded troops superior in number, resources, and morale, and exceptant Shiloh (where he was defeated) was opposed to General's of but moderate capacity.** Meade, " though tall: and gentlemanly Jn appearance (!) stooped and wore spectacles. He was just, modest and courteous, determined though cautious, and a good judge of men.” Hancock was “ the soul of the defense at Gettysburg." Of Lee’s campaign, Capt. Battine says it was “ the worst battle, he had ever fought *’; but he has the, highest opinion of the Confederate leader. The invasion was “ rather a raid on an immense scale”; Lee’s delay in appreciating the stragetic-al situation ** compromised the success of the campaign." Jcb Stuart, however. Is our author’s hero. He “proved himself In his short career the greatest warrior among the many great men who have been so called”; he had the glory of being “ not only the first but hitherto the only leader of the (cavalry) arm who . understood how to combine the effects of fire and shock, how to render effective ‘ service In fighting on foot without -losing the power to strike oh horseback when opportunity offered.” Stonewall Jackson was ** a military genius of the highest order.’* These opinions are very generally accepted to-day as correct.
X>esplte any predictions or prejudices, however, Capt. Battine has turned out a book that cannot but suggest valuable ideas to military students.	.
