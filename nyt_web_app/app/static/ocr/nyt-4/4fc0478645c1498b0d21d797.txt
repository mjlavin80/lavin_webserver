The new edition of W. C. Brownell’s " French Art:	Classic	and	Contemporary
Painting and Sculpture,” which Charles Scribner’s Sons have In active preparation for early Issue, will contain an additional chapter on " Rodin and the Institute,” which will make the text of the
forthcoming- publication identical with
that of the expensive illustrated edition of 190). This chapter considers further what was a dozen years ago, when the volume first appeared, altogether a ** new movement in sculpture," and considers the chief phase of French art developed since then. The book is to appear In uniform size, with the author's "French Traits: An Essay In Comparative Criticism ” and *' Victorian Prose Masters." Mr. Brownell, toward the end of the chapter, writes concerning the " spirit " of Rodin’s work;
It is Rodin’s temperament, however, not his modeling; superb as his modeling is, that is the conspicuous, the interesting, the noteworthy thing to be discerned in his work. His imagination is one of the tnost fertile and at the same time mcst original, most particular, that has ever expressed itself plastically in the whole history •'of art—not French art alone. To express his imaginings, how-pvt^r personal, he uses. it_ Is true, the infinitely varied material of concrete
nalun1' and tho material world, and in a
way which often appears to elicit its suggestive ness rather than embody its echo in his own susceptibility. But it is, nevertheless, true that his „work shows a wealth of imaginativeness. And wheii to this variety of invention we add the sentiment with which *	•	* big sculp-
ture is saturated, it need hardly be added that his temperament is thoroughly romantic and poetic. Realistic as his work
Is in fidelity to the form and substance
of nature, It is temperamentally as far as possible removed from thiit naturalistic inspiration which is half science.
