** STRIKE ” novel containing anything new la hardly to b© expected, considering that for fifty years the species has been an annual product, and that the trades union has for thirty-five years been one of its features, but in '* The Grapple,*' which Messrs, I*. C. Page & Co. are rapidly preparing for publication thfiFfi fiTfi SOIHG thoughts that may surprise the American reader of labor oratory, and some decidedly novel complications. Further, the author has an eye for the humorous situations which almost invariably develop in a quarrel between laboring men untrained in expressing themselves and capitalists not addicted to unselfish thinking, and with this and with his knowledge Of the latest changes In the coal mining districts he has made a story in which there is much that Is unhackneyed. The book Is to be published anonymously, but
no great detective fiHlll Is needed to discern the hand ’Which moves the puppets across the scene, or the voice in which the comic episodes are narrated.
On the other hand, if Miss Anna Chapin Ray*s "On the Firing line ” had appeared anonymously, 1t would have been . mistaken -for an English reprint, not because Its -descriptions of the ways of man and maid arc not in the SUffiB VGlll US those of "By the Good Salnte Anne,” hut because the battle and skirmish and hospital episodes are so extraordinarily good. Setting aside Mr. Kipling's few stories* no fiction of the -Boer war places a mOT8 vivid South Africa before the -eyes. The Irish soldier is not the caricature which Irishmen find bo bitterly offensive in most army and navy tales, and Kruger Roberts, Kafir, whose sznilo conceals his face, is a most delightful darky. Those who secretly dreaded the possible results of Miss Hay's collaboration with Mr. Hamilton Brock Fuller will be most agreeably surprised, and the English success of the book will probably surpass Its American triumph.

Miss Hay's book comes to-morrow with Miss Elizabeth Willard Brooks'9 "As the World Goes By,” an agreeable reversion to old-fashioned dignity of phrase and manner, combined with the introduction of personages who have outgrown Christianity, and accepted the consolations of metempsychosis or tho mystic arithmetical refinements of Bab ism with Its nineteen months of nineteen days. The characters are musicians, actors, and singers, or members of the very inner circle of the New York elect, unspoiled by modern money making, and the book is quite unique In the fiction not only of this season but of many years.

The third of Messrs. Little, Brown & CO.’S novels for the week, Mr. WilUam R A. Wilson's ** A Knot of Bine," is dedicated to '* Another Aimee, the heroine of my own life story, my chum, companion, and my wife,” The Aimee of the book lives In Quebec in the closing days of New France, but the actual date is of no consequence, as the author does not attempt to construct a historical novel, but places his characters in an indefinite period in whicn gambling and sword play are the diversions, and cheating at cards and plotting against one’s private enemies tho favorite crimes. In such a book anything may happen, and the author has introduced a woman, who, besides being a skillful poisoner, Is well acquainted with the art of hypnotic suggestion.
In the introductory letter, written by the President for Mr. Herbert K. Job’s “ Wild Wings/* is a paragraph showing him in the uncommon attitude of taking the middle course. "I do not.” he says, " think it at all advisable that the gun should be given up, nor does It seem to me that shooting wild game.under proper restrictions can be" legitimately opposed by any who are willing that„ domestic animals shall be kept for food, but there is altogether too much shooting, and it we can only get -the camera in place of the gun, and have the sportsman sunk somewhat In the naturalist and lover of wild things, the next generation will see an immense change for the better in the life of our woods and waters. But I am still something of a hunter, although a lover of wild nature first."

“ The Birds of Essex County/* .Mr. Charles Wendell Townsend's back, published by the Clarke Company for the Nutall Ornithological Society, appears as a handsome quarto, bound in green buck' ram. The birds described are arranged by regions, those frequenting ocean
beaches, dunes. And salt fiiarsllfis being grouped together, and those living in fresh marshes and .ponds being described in separate-chapters. Tabulated information is added ior reference, but tho volume, although prepared for the Nutall 'Ornithological Society. Is not too learned for a simple bird-lover.
