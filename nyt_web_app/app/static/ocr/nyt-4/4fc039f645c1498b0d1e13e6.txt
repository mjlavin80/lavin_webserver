SOUTH AMERICA;
Ex-Minister Scruggs's Book on “The Colombian and Venezuelan Republics.”1*
Unuc‘ to speak of Bogota as having well-, paved streets and wide avenues, with " elegant and cbstly public buildings/' and this is. no doubt, the general notion.. But thtfstrcets are about the width common In Spanish cities— that is to say, or an (rr.practicahlc narrowness— and are paved with cabbie stones, which make driving almost impossible. ..Like the entire country, Bogota shows signs of premature de- : cay. As with all "tilings Spanish, since the ' glories of the Moorish domination—the-: only thing thal; inade Spain and kept .it. energized—decay sets in from birth. Even ( in the infant republics of South and Cen« ' tral America, on a soil of marvelous fer-tillty and amid exhaustless natural re-: j sources, plantations are abandoned, cities falling into ruins, and people still sunk j
in savagery. '	*	;
Caracas is the ^subject of a somewhat I more hopeful picture. The " Little Paris of South America” has better streets and a better general air than Bogota; but here, as everywhere in Venezuela, the impression received is oT magnificent opportunities wasted by the rude forces of • Incessant revolution. The country is immeasurably rich in resources; even'the coffe-e planter may realize a fortune of* $00,000 a year from his estates. In agri- , culture, in mining, in commerce, there are ! untold possibilities of wealth and prosperity, but the countrv is decaying in the very midst of this piled treasure of nature.
The author speaks in the^ terms that'-appear exaggerated of the qualities of the tobacco and coffee of both Colombia aiVd Venezuela. The tobacco of certain regions In Colombia is said to be equal to the best Cuban, while the coffee of Chim--bi. in the far interior of the same country. Is declared to be the '* most delicately flavored coffee in the world.”
In matters of this kind, however, as In others, one is apt to be swept too far by his enthusiasms. For Instance, In his chapter on "The Principle of International Arbitration " Mr. Scruggs says that
one hundred and seventeen years ago Robert R. Livingston of New York first suggested ” arbitration as a substitute for war. Now, arbitration as a substitute for war is one of the old institutions of the world. It traces back through Grotlus and Henry IV. of France, and through a thousand pacific souls, until lost in the mists of antiquity. Mr. Livingston cannot support.this splendid burden of fame alone.
It is to be regretted that in a bool; of this kind, an authority in its field, and so well printed in every other respect, there should be, as the result of cureless proofreading or writing, so many errors of the exact sort to mar its particular excellence. Sir Julian PouneefoTe's name is given with an obtrusive “ r ’’ in the final syllable, "forte”; Mr. CouderCs	i
name is wrongly spelled " Frederick^*. I ^here the k ’ Is a trespasser; and even the great philosopher Hobbes loses an
e ’ in this orthographic massacre. Spanish words farc^no better. Cartagena; is printed as Cnrthagena," Hcrran as " Horan/’ Maracafbo and La Guaira are both falsely written with a " y ” for the “ 1 aspargate is given two ** t's," a i thing utterly impossible in Spanish; Pan-amfi, Santander, Car&eas, and other words are not printed with fbWr due accents, wh'Is Colon is sometimes given without an accent and sometimes on one and sometimes on the other syllable; Guadalupe is spelled in the^ French way,
| " Gauda loupe,** and even f he home of Cervantes is given as " La Manche.’* ini stead of La Mancha. In calling attention to the proper accent on Colon, tho author neglects to put the proper one on Cristobal. This is an unfortunate class of errors for such a book, and many of them seem to have been brought over from the earlier edition.	■
STANHOPB SAMS.
HIS book, which is unquestionably one of the best that have been published concernr ing that portion of South ^America that will be, for years at least, of greatest interest to Americans, was exceedingly *’ timely " when it first appeared in 1900, and is even more “ timelyM now, comiiSg as it does in a period of trouble and difficulty, when our political relations with Panuraa, Colombia, and Venezuela are at desperate tension. Indeed, a work of this sort, dealing with the Latin-American republics of South America, is always timely, as revolutions are almost daily changing political con-_ ditions, and to know Venezuela, for instance, would demand of the student as Irequent diagnosis as would be necessary in the case of a malignant fever.
The volume represents the fruits of twenty-seven years of study of conditions in Colombia and Venezuela at first hand and from the unequaled vantage point of a diplomatic representative, besides five years of intimate study, though at a distance. of the everchanging aspects of public nffnirs in these two volcanic republics. In this new edition the book has een carefully brought up to date throughout, and a special chapter on the Panama Canal and the controversy with Colombia has been added. The new material has enlarged and very greatly enriched the work.	,
Panam'ff begins and ends the book, as it is, in fact, the special reason for reissuance. at this time. The first two chapters, dealing with the Isthmus of Panama and the various earlier projects for a canal, are well worth reading, as they give- an admirable review of conditions up to the tTme. when the United Sttites took an active and survigorous hand in the destinies of the Isthmus. The curious history of the old Gorgoza scheme, which was based on the ancient legend of a waterway connecting the two oceans, and which, strange enough, was tho foundation of the French concessions under which De Lesseps worked on his ill-fated enterprise, is here told as an interesting part of the long story of the dream of an Isthmian Canal. The ancient Spanish Governors of Panama and Colombia were so confident that this waterway existed that they forbade tho navigation of the Afraio River because it was supposed to give too easy access to the Pacific shores of Colombia. A curious reason, but one precisely in line with the policy of the Bogota Government in trying to delay or defeat the digging of the canal, when the time had Imperatively arrived for the making of
this world-highway.
The interest and value of the older portions of MScruggs's book ;.7ay be appreciated bv a glance over the list of chapters. Besides tlie two just mentioned, one deals with the old Spanish Main, its legendary and changing shores, and the developments of the past quarter of a century. Then are taken up in succession the valley of the great Magdalena River of Colombia, a mule ride in the Andes, Bogota, manners and customs, the race problem, which is as keenly felt throughout South America as in the SoutJiorn States of this country; the spirit of democracy in these Spanish-American lands, the " revolutions ” of fiery republics. Venezuela, with a chapter devoted to the supposedly charming Caracas, the great and untouched mineral resources of this latter country, the Monroe Doctrino In relation to Venezuela, the disputed Ei X)orado, the An^lo-Venezuelan boundary dispute, and the award of the Arbitration Tribunal. The latter part of the book, which treats of the Monroe'Doctrine and the long controversy between England and Venezuela-settled through the Incisive suggestions of President Cleveland —is of greater value, though it is not of 1 so pleasant reading as other portions. On these subjects Mr. Scruggs speaks with the voice of authority and in the fulness of knowledge, and his contributions to the diplomatic discussion and to the illumination of the entire matter of dispute are already well known and appreciated.
The chapters devnted to a study of conditions In the interior of Colombia and Venezuela are, also, of the highest interest and value. It ts hero, perhaps, that therp is tc be found the most trustworthy account of the two republics, and this book will doubtless long remain the best authority on the sjbject. For instance, although very much has recently been written about Engota. there still remains a very false idea of the famous capital and its environs, Mr. Scruggs tells us that the geographies and cyclopedias Con-
