ffE cynic _devll in Mr. Zang-will’s brain (you can never feel absolutely sure that- ho, has any blood) has-In these stories the most delightful place for hia impish gambols;
.	Tho	devil	frisks about like a.
; young goat of' Infinite malice and deep ; cunning; so perpetually Ingenious that the pedestrian reader may well tire after a story or two of following his devious arid fantastic career. In that case, however, all the reader has to do is to put down the
book and pick it up-again later.
„ ” rt inevitable,’* says Mr. ZangwM, that the Bachelors’ Club and the Old Maids Club should one day be united.” 8 And her§ they are. All the bachelors are I married and all the old maids likewise— J or, at all events, engaged. The stories re- 8 late how it all came about. One bachelor I was a dramatic critic.' He married in order to have somebody always convenient to use the second complimentary ticket,
: AQd presently the playhouses began to j send but‘one ticket Twinkletop was a , lover of good living. He married his bad ! cook, in order to gain freedom to hire* a more accomplished artist in his kitchen.
I Young Dickray married the step-daughter of his father’s ghost, which sounds more ! ^e^rd than it is. The father was a novel-1st who-did not actually write his own books. The ghost was the literary hack
who did. The young man discovered the ghost driving a cab and reduced to an attic. The marriage was his atonement for parental sins. He was ignorant, of. course, of the circumstance that the young woman was only a step-daughter.
Most tragic of all is the fate of Israfet Mondego, the son of a Whitechapel tailor, born with a gift for comic song, but forced by British (and especially fem-inine)-''lack of humor into becoming a fashionable sentimental tenor. He married the one woman he thought had no ear for music-only to find that her passion for himself had led hsr to conceal really shining musical talents in order to remain the longer his puplL Israfel fled to Australia and hid himself there on the music hall stage.
"The Old Maids’ Club was founded by Lillie Dulcimer, in her sweet seventeenth jear.” Lillie '* divided n er time between making sensations and analyzing them.**
Mr. Zangwill imagines her diary, from the moment of birth and a very witty and pretty courtship of Miss Dulcimer by Lord Silverdale. The Old Maids’ Club nfever had any members. Many applied, 8 but none were chosen. There was Cio-rinda Bell, the popular but prudent actress, who was always accompanied by her mother, a propriety she'had, as she ’ explained, “ on the hire system.” The Old Maids Club tempted upon the boards also Wilkins, the man on The Moon, (a society. journal,) who shivered at the sight of an interrogation point, and	]
Diana, who designed to make a husband 8 of Wilkins and did so. Candidates _for 1 the club were Nelly Nimrod, who was I nothing if not original and defined the I " shrieking sisterhood ” as the “ mice- ! fearing classes,’* and Miss Jack, who " could not bring a husband what he expects now in a wife.” " What's that? *■ asked Lillie. 4,A chum,” answered Affss Jack. “.Tobacco for two is destined to be the ideal of the immediate future."	8
| Which is saying nothing of the Princess . of Portman Square who fell in love with ! a Baritone Voice (belonging to one man) and a Glorious Figure, (belonging to another man,) and- who had for duenna the Honorable Miss Primpole, Miss Primpole “ regarded it as the privilege uf the higher gentlewoman to be bound hand and foot by fashionable etiquette,” but did not include her charming ward in that inconvenient classification.	-
It is clever—only too eleve*, witty, live* ly. Cynical, even sentimental. Yet, after its fashion, human also. Above all, it is Mi’. Zangwill's own.	.
