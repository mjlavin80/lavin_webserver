Photographic illustrations are features of two new books upon farming’ Just out. Especially charming are those in the second volume of The Country Library Series, " The Orchard and Fruit Garden,” by E* P. Powell. (New York: McClure, Phillips & Co., $1.50.) This is a large book of 322 pages, in which the author tells the land owner the best way in which to become a fruit raiser. It is not intended - to be an exhaustive treatise, he says, but a ** reliable bnok for those who are establishing their homes on the Improved basis of Intensive culture, and especially those who are escaping from tbe confinement of city life to the freedom of the country.” Different chapters are devoted each to a different fruit, large or small, while Part III. of the book is Given up entirely to cultural directions, irrigation, pruning, and mulching; it discusses the helpfulness and hindrance of birds and animals, ard gives directions for harvesting and marketing. The pictures show loaded branches of fruit, pretty orchard sccnes, and fruit picking or packed for the market.
" The First Book of Farming/’ by Charlos L. Goodrich, (New York: Doubleday, Page & Co., $1,) goes literally to the root of these matters. A large part of the book is devoted to the soil and development of plant roots in varying stages, with photographs showing the experiments under wtiy. The value of a knowledge of a flower, leaf, and stem, is shown with illustrations. Farming implements are pictured, and sections of drains. At tne back of the book is a helpful Glossary. Mr. Goodrich was formerly Instructor of agriculture at the Hampton Institute, and the experiments he has tried he recommends as helpful for the student of farming.
