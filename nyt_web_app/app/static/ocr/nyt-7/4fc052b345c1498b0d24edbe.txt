" The Noahs Afloat: An Historical Romance,” by H. Rea Woodman, has been brought out by the Neale Publishing Compriny. It is pathetically dedicated to a dead dog, *' Brother Grant’s Irish setter, Dun McGinty.” It treats of the flood, lhe building of the arfc, the voyage; and escape of No&li and his family from an up-to-date and humorous point of view. Noah has all the failings, foibles, and peculiarities of an American family man of the ordinary type. He talks, in fact, like a commuter. His family are ordinary everyday folk of the present hour. Besides Shem, Ham, and Japheth there are Flossie and Jennie and others. Ham’s full name, it seems, is Hamilton.
The book is not nil absolute nonsense, as its title might imply. It is carefully written, and those who like this kind of ^humor may like it very much. Here is a passage which will serve as an excellent example of the quality of the thing;
Ham watched Japheth butter his cakes curiously.
"It would be a sight,” he said, “ to see 'em all sitting there. I suppose they would mob us as they came out, looking so cool and comfortable.”
Mrs. Noah looked deeply grieved, and ; with, difficulty repressed her tears. Her i hands trembled a little as she pushed back 1 her cap.
|	" Please do not talk so lightly about it.
It is dreadful to think of all those poor people out in the rain.”
** Excuse me. Mamma, but Matilda wanted to know what I meant,"
** Whfin you were really not er—conscious of any moaning." his father put »n 1 hastily. " I think, Snem, your fingers are too large.”
“ Will, but Papa, there are twelve hours in a day."
"Do not bring up that old discussion again, my son. We argued that suffi-! ciently in the Research Club, and—and never did decide it," he added, reflectively.
i “You did not decide anything in that : club." said Matilda, “but the discussions ■ i were quite intelligent.”	-

Mrs. Noah was looking at her husband intently.	.
" Your discussion on the Creation was very, interesting,” she said, so softly. ** I remember Papa’s speech—the one in the Opera House; the one where he said that-woman waft made to compliment man. You re member, boys! ”	.
"Complement," corrected Mr. Noah; complement, my dear."
“ I think Mamma is the nearer right,” . Ham .remarked,- gravely.	.
" Anyway, it was a good speech.” said Mrs. Noalu vaguely but conclusively.
** Yes,” said her husband, tenderly,
** that was a great speech.*’
Japheth -was evidently grubbing around in his- .mental storeroom. Now lie had found It, for he smiled an 1-told-you-so smile and'said: “They do say that Adam said that first."	'	.
" Adam said a good many things first." Ham rejoined, politely. Ham never slighted any effort at conversation. " He had a tremendous opportunity to say things first. But to what particular bon mot of
■	his do you refer? "	.
" That woman was made to compliment^ i man.”	*
;	** Possibly his woman wis,” conCed ^l
! Matilda, quick as a flash. " She seems to -have served'no'other purpose. She wasa; weak, gullible creature—the kind of a wo, man everybody calls * so sweet.'" .	;
|	** I am always interested," said Shem,'
1 looking up, "In- Adam's remarks about* i women. He knew the first one.”	*
"He was the only man who ever lived , who had a time* in his life when he did not know women,” observed Japheth, • rolling his ey.es~ and -feeling- his - way* slowly.	-	.
" Why, that's so!" exclaimed Mrs. Noah; much struck with the truth of the observation. -	.	-
“During which time he accomplished nothing,” snapped Matilda. ,	.
