“ The Breath off the Gods.”
2fcio York Times Booh Review:
In reading- '* The Breath of the Gods,** by Sidney McCall, I was both amused and puzzled with the description of Tuki Ouda, the Japanese girt. It says: “Her head, with its pointed chin, bare, like a diadem of Jet, balanced like a regal burden the spread wings of her hair." Then, later, at the end of the same paragraph;
" All the humanity, tho tenderness, the womanhood of her face lay in the red mouth and the small, round chin.’' Two chins of different shape! Ono would scarcely think that tho author would handicap her heroine with a double chin.
