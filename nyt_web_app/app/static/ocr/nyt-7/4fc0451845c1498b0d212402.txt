Grateful would it be to his eager senses! It Is .more time, rather than more poeta, that he craves. To him Olympus appears already overcrowded with gods. For, leav-t Ing aside prose, whoso imperative demand ! assumes monstrous dimensions, what are j twenty years of more or less constant f reading' as applied to Homer, Sophocles,

I Schiller, Milton, Pope, Drydehr Scott, Campbell, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey, Bums, Moore, Byron, Shelley, Keats, j Hunt, Browning, Bryant, I/>wclI, Whittier, Longfellow, Emerson, and a host of others; among whom these culled are a mere sprinkling? The lover of books thus comes upon life nearly 3,000 years In arrears with literature, and with this Herculean labor of love before him is fain to cry out for mercy to press and poet. Should the mountain of desirable reading matter continue to pile up at the present rate, the time must come when all the beauties that have accumulated about tlie *same thought, in all ages, shall be clustered in a composite book where survives the fittest-This absorption In past literature -we owe to balance accounts with indifferent years of the same date. Many a poet besides Keats and Chatterton has died with a broken heart, and posthumous fame is but a just debt that we now assist In paying; to the neglect, perhaps, of contemporary poets, to whom, likewise, justice will bo meted hereafter. White this is the compensation of events, It Is naturally unsatisfactory of results to the poet, since It is not he who reaps either material or spiritual benefit. Still the enndid taste remains permanently addicted to old wine and seasoned poetry. *
It would be cause for chagrin that our time should hereafter be branded as one of unpoetic feeling, but such a verdict would not be just. The writer is told that the* dally newspapers constantly contain good poetry, and newspapers are more widely and thoroughly read than are magazines. If such poetry is not appreciated by the mass—and who can say that it is not?—It Jg the fault of the light, light nature of many Americans, And if, while we have many exquisite singers, their songs are brief and do not sweep us from our feet with majestic emotion, it may be that the circumstances of American life are too luxurious, the poet is too comfortable; that he is not writing with his soul at the stub of his pen and tragedy looking over his shoulder. “ Parts and poverty ** has been declared to he the infallible recipe for success in this world. One Richard Cumberland is quoted as saying that it was only " the bayonet of sharp necessity ” that kept Samuel Johnson at his human struggle, but that “ if fortune had turned him into a field of clover he would have lain down and rolled In it.” It is deplorable that a poet should need success; to an onlooker it would appear that, as being a child is tiliss enough, so being a poet should bring its own reward, without the appendages of bread and butter and fame. Daudet wrote, “ Oh! the worthy poet! It was of Mistral that Montaigne might have said, * Recollect the man^who, when asked why he Look so mucll pains in an art that could come to the knowledge of so few, replied, " A few will be enough-one will be enough—not one will be ^enough." 1 '*
However it be with poets and readers, the complaint that great Pan is dead is ns untrue as ever. Never burned his altar fires more brightly. On Saturday afternoons and Sundays, for whole Summers and on Winter holidays, do not all who can desert commercial centres to attend his rites? For this, mainly, the trolley cars exist, and the long, green blur that crosses the vision of the occupants oC the auto doubtless receives what reverence they are free to bestow. None but the initiated know whither theso wild things go, yet they may be able to halt Cor break down) in some \erdant spot for worship. The telephone is often used to convey tidings of new moons, sunsets, and wondrous rainbows. In all this widespread busying with birds, bees, butterflies, and flowers, surely there is concealed a large proportion of poetic yearning, which is none the less deeply felt that It may not be expressed in meter.

With respect to the arguments, pro and con, relative to tlie supposed lapse of poetic feeling in this country, may it not, from a selfish, individual point of view, be reg^rd^d as a merciful forbearance on the part of tlie powers that be in restraining both delinquents—poets and their readers? To-day the fortunate person born with a taste for literature finds himself plunged into a garden so filled with delights that he is bewildered where to
