Just as de Senancour and his " Ober-mann " more or less successfully elude the compilers of compendlums dealing with French literature, so Thomas Coryate and hla " Crudities" have dodged English compilers from Charles D. Cleveland— possibly earlier—down to E. J. Mathews. For a different reason, however; de Senancour wrote loo late, Coryate too early. Gauged from the point of view of projected influence or rhetorical augmentation. neither contributed anything to letters. From the point of view, however, of literature for th? sake of literature the contributions of each are worthy of preservation. Of Coryate we may say something more, for through bis pages wo receive glimpses of Continental culture as it impressed an English traveler in the first decade of the seventeenth century. It is to be hoped that some day the writers and compilers of English literature may realise this fact.
Thomas Coryate, who was the son of a Somerset parson, obtained at Oxford 44 some competency in logic, but more by far in the Greek tongue and in humane learning/' Later he became a familiar of Henry. Prince of Wales, and on May 14. 1608, he set out on a journey Including five months' sojourn and travel in France, Savoy, Italy, Switzerland, Northern Germany and the Low Countries. His ** Crudities" was the result. This work was published for the first time in 1611, with a bunch of so-called *' pane-gyrlck" verses contributed by Jonson, Donne. Chapman, Drayton, and other wits of the time, not omitting several
European colleagues in letters. These panegyrics are ln mock praise of the much-traveled author and were evidently Inspired by his royal patron. The next year Coryate set out for the East, traveling as much as possible on foot. He visited Constantinople, Smyrna, Alexandria and Cairo. Returning to Alexandria, he sailed to Joppa and thence penetrated as far as Persia and India. Incidentally he learned Persian, Turkish, Arabian, and Hindustani. En voyage he sent numerous letters home. He died In 1617 without living to complete the story of his travels in the Levant and the East. The fragments of his letters that have been preserved show that1 the world has 1 been deprived of a worthy sequel to th«
I ” Crudities."
I The reprint of this work, which la now : before us, is frtm the original edition, but I with additional side notes and with ref-erencea to the pages of the fifst issue In the margins. Coryate's painstaking descriptions of the architectural and plc-torial treasures of Paris. Savoy, Milan, Mantua. Padua, Venice, Zurich. Heidelberg, Bingen, and so forth are naturally pedantic, and, to modem scholars who nave access to the archives of these places, superfluous. His judgments and opinions are egotistical, and in them we recognize the Inviting food for his Iron-leal panegyrists. - At the same time his impressions are fresh, and are not infrequently interspersed with data of genuine historical value. Monumental Inscriptions, however, and the relics of Gre^k and Latin art and literature interes1*^! him far more than the manners and life of the people with whom lie came !n con tact. It is Interesting to note, however, that the value of hi3 observations has not been overlooked by H, Neville Maugham, who. !n his *‘ Book of Italian Travel,** (15S071600,) employs several pages of extracts from the “ Crudities,** particularly in regard to Venice and the Venetians.
The new edition of the " Crudities ** Is ln two excellently made volumes of light linen paper, printed in a modified form of seventeenth century type, large, well shaded, and with lines freely leaded, which together present a format which Is both suggestive and attractive. The brief publishers note. hOwever, with which the first volume opens doe3 scant Justice to the career of this really Illustrious author.
