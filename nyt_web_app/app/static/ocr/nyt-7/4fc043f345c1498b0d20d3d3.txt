Tour contributor, H. W. Boynton, 'who criticises Dr. Br&ndes’s work on Byron, fn lfM occasion to characterize as doggerel Thomas Moore's irielody beginning: “’She is tar from the land where her young heVo sleeps." With an assurance that would be sublime were it not ridiculous, he goes on to instruct us that '* she ” is Ireland and “ ho" Robert Emmet. In other words ho •would have us believe that Moore represents Ireland as being far away from herself, as Emmet’s ashes lie somewhere in Dublin. Every schoolboy knows that i the *‘ She " in question is Sarah Curran, daughter of the celebrated orator, John Phil pot Curran- She was Emmet's sweet; heart and the heroine of Washington Irving^ a inimitable " Tale of a Broken Heart." Tour readers are likely to regard Mr. Boynton's opinion of Moore's poetry as on a par with his knowledge of historical facts. J. P. CON WAY.
