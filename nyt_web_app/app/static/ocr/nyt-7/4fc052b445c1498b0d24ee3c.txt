Apropos of F. Marion Crawford’s brief digression concerning: French writers in his novel, “ Fair Margaret,” commented on in these columns a week ago, the confessions of a French writer in La Revue des Revues seem to the point. He apparently shows that the whole French college of letters of the nineteenth century was a dose corporation which obtained its wares wholesale before giving the personal retail touch and setting them before the public as original.
Alexandre Dumas fils seems to have been a terrible borrower. His " Dame aux Camillas ” is said to have been taken from *' Fernande," (a piece which appeared under the name of Dumas p£re, but was really the production of a poor hack writer named Hippolyte Auger.) and from the ** Beatrix ” of Ar&me Houssaye, subsequently published under the title “ Les Filles d’Eve.” His *4 Demi-Monde ” is borrowed from two works, the " Cour-tisanes,” by Fallisol, and ** Lettres du Marquis de Roselle," by Mme. Elie die Beaumont; " Monsieur Alphonse ’* is wholly drawn from Paul de Kock's " Jeune Homme Charmant,” “ L’Ami des Femmes ” from " Les Lorettes Vengfees,” by Henri, son of Paul de Kock, and *TEtrang6re ” from Miss Bury’s novel, ** Godolphin ’* Gustave 1 Flaubert is stated to have simply republished in " A Salambft" the ** Histoire Celtique d’Aman-dorix et de C§lamaire,” by Hotman, which first appeared in 1834. The alleged source of Flaubert’s work would have astonished Sainte-Beuve, who, when writing of this romance and its author, said:	“II se
fait estimer comme arch£ologue et savant,
ii	se fait aimer encore de ceux ‘qui aiment la force jusou* & n’empas detester Tabus.”
Victor Hugo appears to have been one of the most shameless of plagiarists. “ Notre Dame de Paris,*’ it seems, is only a late and almost timid echo of two or three hundred mediaeval romances on which the generation from 1810 to 1S30 was nourished. ** Hans d'lrlande ’’ is full of reminiscence of that gloomy Irish novejist, Charles Maturin, the author of ’* Melmoth the Wanderer,” “ Ruy Bias ” is said to be manufactured from “ Angelica Kauffman,” a romance by L6on de Wailly, from which the first Lord Lytton took his “ Lady of Lyons.” Much of the success of “ Les Burgrave ” is due to Leon Thiesse^’s “Tribunal Secret,” and 14 Lie Roi s’am use ” is said to be a copy of “ Deux Fous,” by Paul Lacroix.
