Just two years ago the town of Nahant celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of Its incorporation. The chief speaker on the occasion was Henry Cabot Lodge, who is a resident of the place. His speech, an historical address, has just been published by the town fn a limited edition^ Mr. Lodge thinks that the Norsemen were the first whites to see Nahant, and considers that there is “ fair ground to suppose that Thorwald, one o£ the old Norse fighters, lies buried somewhere on Nahant.” He goes on, however, to remark: "There is this advantage at least in our legend, that there Is no one able to disprove the story.” We may expect soon to have the actual grave located; saints and martyrs exist on no better evidence than that of Thorwald’s grave in Nahant. It is »not until ,1629~1G30, however, Senator Lodge admits, that Nahant “ comes fairly within tho range of historical record.” In the second year of | the Puritan coining Isaac Johnson's serv-[ ants kept his cattle at Nahant, and so became the first settlers, and in 1G30 Thomas Dexter bought the place from the Indians for a suit of clothes or a pair of breeches. There were only three families on Nahant at the beginning of the eigh-; teenth century, those of the Breeds, the I Hoods, and the Johnsons. They were doubtless good sized families, however.
^ Tt was the Summer exodus from the
i
cities that created Nahant, one of the Johnson connections building a hotel there in 1802. In 1817 a steamboat ran \ from Boston, the trip taking three hours, and another hotel was opened In 1821. Then Nahant became famous. N. P. Willis, Webster, Choate, Bancroft, Story, Winthrop, Motley, Longfellow, Sumner j were regular visitors; Whittier and , Holmes and Longfellow wrote of the
■	place in verse, George William Curtis in prose; Paran Stevens tried to make it a Coney Island and failed. In 1861 the hotel period ended, and Nahant became a place of Summer residences, whereto the Bostonians hasten about the time the taxgatherer is wont lo appear. Mr. Lodge does not say this in so many words—he does not even hint at it, but it is true,
, and like Thorwald’s tomb, cannot be dis-
i
proved.
