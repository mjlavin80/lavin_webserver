The history of Ivory carving goes hack to the most remote antiquity. There are examples of the days of the earliest dynasties of Assyria and Egypt, centuries before the Christian era. Even earlier workers in ivory are evident from recent discoveries and references in ancient works, j Mr. Maskell begins his history of the sub- ! ject with the earliest achievements. He follows his discussion of the work of our i prehistoric ancestors with a consideration of the articles taken from the ruins of Egypt and Nineveh, which include daggers ornamented with ivory, tiny oma-ments, vases, boxes, &c. These are now in the different Continental and British museums which the author has visl.jd personally to examine them in order to give a ’
i
better description of them.
As Mr. Maskell says, comparatively a
very small	of	Ureek and -Roman
carvings fn Ivory have come down to us
earlier than the earliest of the consular
and other important classical diptyebs and
plaques, to which he devotes considerable
attention. Many hundreds of years before «^ur era ivory carving was done by sculpt-o'rs throughout the nations of Africa and Asia as well as in Italy. This period ' *id the transition of Christianity are hardly perceptible, Mr. Maskell - writes, in this work. There is hardly any evidence of a Christian worker during the time when Christianity had to hide itself, but, with the conversion of Constantine the Great to its teachings, paganism disappears at one blow. He considers briefly the work . of the early Christians, who did mostly animals like the ram, the lion, the lamb, the serpent, &c.
Byzantine ivories are next considered, together with the art in Russia. There is also a chapter on Japanese and Chinese work, ivory sculpture in Spain, Portugal, and West Africa. - Medals, chess and draughts men, &c., are also discussed. The author describes pieces ©f furniture, musical instruments, arms and sporting weapons, and other accessories of the Held and chase made by German, French, Flemish, and other ivory carvers; he has a chapter on artificial ivory, the coloring and staining of articles, and a few words on the world’3 great ivory collections. In his final chapter on the nineteenth century and the present day he shows that in sf ite of the fact that ivory carving has long fallen out, there are still living distinguished artists practicing that very old art. Carving in ivory is still done, although carving in marble and bronze has been neglected by great sculptors for many years. In .this chapter Mr. Maskell further describes the work of George Frampton, the Belgian sculptor Van Beur-den, Thdodore Rlvi&re, Dampt, Madrass), Julien Dlilens, and many others.
The bcok is supplied with a list of the pictures ol pieces of ivory and their present location, the subject, the origin and date, and a very comprehensive bibliography, and an index.
