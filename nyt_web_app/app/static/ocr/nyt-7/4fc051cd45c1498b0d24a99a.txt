Air- Carnegie’s A u t hors fi ip,
Kcir York Times Booh Review:
Reference la made to the following extract from your Issue of to-day: " Andrew Carnegie, who by his recent biography of James Watt, likes to be included among the list of authors, is spending: hfs vacation as usual at Sktbo Castle. Scotland."
Suppose that Ths New York Times Book Review should give its unstinting acknowledgment that Andrew Carnegie is a real author with the record of his early achievement, “ Triumphant Democracy " to his latter one of '* Biography of James Watt’* to back its word? Wouldn’t it tend to impress on the builder of libraries the real necessity of books to make them such? And might it not, by, entering the ranks of real authors, stimulate his oft-expressed desire to die poor and honored instead of rich and disgraced? Don’t keep the blood royal out of the craft.
