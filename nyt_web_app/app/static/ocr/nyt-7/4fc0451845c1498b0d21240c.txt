! The third volume of Dr. Morgan Dlx’s j monumental history ©f Trinity Parish covers the fourteen years (1816-1830) of Bishop. Hobart's rectbrate of New York’s most famous church.* It is practically
■	V	- *
f quite as much a biography of Hobart’s i later years as it is a history of .the parish 'whichhe directed. But It could hardly be. otherwise. Hobart was Bishop of New York,* indeed, but he was also rector of
Trinity, and before he became rector had
, „ ■ . . . *.. . • -
been assistant to Bishop Moore, and the life._of. the' rector;of a parish who dies while in charge of it cannot easily be dissociated from Uje history of his parish. The period of Dr. Hobart’s rectorship
was one of constant growth for Trinity
i. _____ *
and for the Episcopal Church in this city. The General Theological" Seminary was founded ln 1818, and after a stormy youth attained its maturity after Dr. Hobart’s death.* Its early history is told by Dr. Dix at some length, with the quarrel between Bishop Hobart and-Bishop Chase over its support. If Dr: Dix found it necessary to mention the “ sad fall ” of the Rev. Thomas Yardley How, we think he might have told briefly why he fell. His crime seems to have been merely ecclesiastical, for Dr. Hobart remained on friendly terms with him.
Dr. Dfx had hoped to finish his history of Trinity in ^hreo volumes, but a fourth volume will be necessary; how soon that may be expected he does not say.
