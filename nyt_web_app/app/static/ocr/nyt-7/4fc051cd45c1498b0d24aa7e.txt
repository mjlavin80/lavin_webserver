The account of Major S. H. Long’s expedition from Pittsburg to the Rocky Mountains in 1819 and 1820, by Order of John C. Calhoun, then Secretary of War,, has been edited by the editor of the series of Early Western Travels, Reuben Gold Thwaites, author of various volumes on American exploration, from the notes of Major Long, Or. T. Say, and others of the party, as compiled by Edwin James, botanist and geologist to the expedition. Mr. Gold Thwaites has provided the ' notes, introduction, index, and other material The text followed is that of the 1 .London edition of 1823.	.	.
The Long journal will be in four parts, the first two of which are now out. The explorations described were "the outcome of the Yellowstone expedition, that 111-starred project -which had been designed to establish military posts on the Upper Missouri for the purposes of protecting the fur trade, controlling, the. Indian tribes, and lessening British ‘ influence. The object of the new expedition was to acquire *' as thorough and accurate knowledge as may be practicable of a portion of our country which is daily becoming more interesting, but which is as yet imperfectly known,” as Calhoun pointed out in his outline of the plan and objects in the orders to Major Long. According to these orders the expedition was to have explored the Missouri and its principal branches, as well as the Red, Arkansas, and Mississippi Rivers above the Mis-' souri. It also was Instructed to ke&p a : journal of ** everything Interesting in relation to soil, face of the country, water courses and productions, whether animal, vegetable, or mineral."
Owing to the state of the National finances during 1821, the travels and researches of the expedition were far less extensive than contemplated by these orders, the means necessary for further prosecution of the objects of the expedition having been withheld. This is the view taken by James in his preface to the Philadelphia edition of the work, which is here included. But Mr. Gold Thwaites holds that the real cause for the little achievements of the expedition was the indifference of the party to instructions, as well as its inefficency, as indicated In the readiness with which the explorers relinquished their efforts to penetrate the mountains at the cafions of the Platte and Arkansas and the failure to find the sources of the Platte and the Red. •
Of special importance in the work, besides the descriptions of the journeys from place to place and the exploration of the Canadian River, is the account of the aborigines. “As an authoritative source of knowledge of the sociology of the Kansas and Omaha tribes, the ' Account * has no rival,’* writes Mr. Gol^ Thwaites.,	..	-	.
