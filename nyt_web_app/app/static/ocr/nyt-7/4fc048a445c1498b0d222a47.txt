Mr. Henderson names ua all “children of good fortune "-not because we all have such, fortune* but because we all seek it. Wo are. he says, " agents of the heart's desire, we differ from one another not because some men want happiness and some do—«ot, but wholly in the sort of happiness we want.” Wherefore the first ; of the virtues Is wisdom, that we may discern what things truly afford happiness, may know how to pursue those things intelligently*, efficiently. " Morality,” he says, “ must be accounted not as a human device for keeping the rabble in order, but as a very much more august I thing; as a veritable law of nature.*’ Nev-| ertholess, th?ugh the general principle Is j a law of nature, (one we are far too Ignorant to formulate even dimly,) all actual moral rules are mere human gener-, alizatlons derived from experience, and I therefore fallible.
The author* after demonstrating that conduct (morally responsible conduct) really includes the whole of human activity—eating, drinking, sleeping, digestion, with the rest—proceeds to define morality i —theoretical morality. " It deals only with conduct, with human activity, and this in the most impersonal way. It is a judgment of conduct, not upon conduct. Morality has but one function, and that is to measure. It^meaaurea the efficiency of the means and the worth of the ends.”
Of these two things right conduct oon-sists—worthy ends, efficiency In following those ends. For we have no means to teat rightness of conduct but by its fruits. To mean well and do nothing is Immoral; to pursue and attain unworthy aims with Napoleonic efficiency Is not more Immoral —or less so.
Ab for what are worthy ends, Mr. Henderson is bold to say they are the ends which satisfy the " heart’s desire," give happiness—tho more worthy as they afford more happiness. They must be desirable. first of all, to the individual; they must contribute, secondly, to the general welfare, since man. If he is man at all, is a social being. Nor ts there (in Mr. Henderson's view) a conflict Involved; the M chastenlMfir of individual desire by constant reference to objective welfare is tbe time-honored process of discipline. It Is simply a process of correcting the experience of one man by the experience of many men.”
That leads back to the primary virtue of wisdom—knowledge—so that men may know both what 13 best for the “ heart's desire ” and how best to live so as to gain and keep the happiness which is the object of reasonable and moral conduct. In Mr. Henderson's mind these two things are the same. You gather that he th'nks a perfect wisdom perfectly applied would produce a perfect morality and perfect happiness. That way lies the far-off divine event.
It is a very striking presentation of the problem of life. It offers a theory (no new one, either,) which is at once sensible and hopeful; it seeks to substitute'for arbitrary rules a pervading principle by the light of which one may make rules for himseSf. But first one must be wise. There's the rub. Mr. Henderson proceeds himself to nake some applications of his morality. l'’or instance, he declares that certain occupations are " obviously unnecessary,” and therefore unmoral. He names in this category advertising, stock broking, financial exploiting, speculating, patent medicine vending, and multiple shopkeeping. But on the whole Mr. Henderson does not undertake to judge. His morality furnishes the measure; each mas •must measure his own conduct for himself. At all events the book is good reading, fit to stimulate thought and apt even to produce effects unon conduct itself.
