Ifrtr York Times Book Review:
To me, and, I have no doubt, to other I grizzle-pates who remember as an event ■ *Sf yesterday the death of Herman Melville, some recent comments upon him and i his books in your column From Read! ers have been peculiarly interesting, and particularly interesting, not to say I amusing, was the letter of last week from *• Cosmopolitan," rejoicing over the discovery of Melville within the half year. As I read it and then looked at my row of ‘ firsts "Typee," and "Moby Dick/’ and ;	“ Omoo" and “ Redburn,” and " White
1 Jacket," et al., I felt much inclined to fall into the mood of Hamlet and shake my I head and say to myself: " Alas, poor ! Yorickl" But I suppose that when weold codgers were young and strung unnecessary French or German words among our English sentences, we too had our enthusiasms and made discoveries that caused our elders to smile; but it is so long since those days that we forget.	*
In the general chorus of praise of Melville's " epic ol the whale," or ’whatever young enthusia&m may choose to call it, may I question the possibility of the accuracy of statement of this old Herman the Magician? In the sixth chapter of '* Moby XHck.” *' The Street," Melville, in describing- New Bedford, says:
In Summertime the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples—long avenues of green and gold. And in August, high in the air, tho beautiful and bountiful horse chestnuts, candelabra wise, proffer the passerby their tapering, upright cones of congregated. blossoms. Co omnipotent is art; which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright terraces ot flowers upon the barren, refuse rocks thrown aside at creation’s final day.
So omnipotent Is literary magic that it can thus make the noble horse chestnut change its seasons and, if. it will. I suppose, as easily make the leopard change his spots. Now, Melville was a landsman who lived most ot his life on the Hudson , or in Massachusetts, where the horse j chestnut is a common shade tree, where he must have often seen it in its blossom | and in its fruit, as, indeed, his description of its pyramidal clusters of flowers , makes evident. Was it then dullness of 1 observation or inaccuracy of thought that led him to violate the experience of every j healthy, out-of-door boy in this state-1 ment, or is it a fact that in New Bedford the horse chestnut, in some reckless or eccentric mood, reverses its habit and biooms in August to yield its glossy nuts in time for the New Bedford youngster’s Christmas stocking? And if it was inaccuracy, lack of close observation, forgetfulness, or carelessness, how much rell- J ance are we to place in his observations
