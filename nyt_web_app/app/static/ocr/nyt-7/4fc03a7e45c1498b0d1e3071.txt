R. HOWELLS in the current number of the “ Editor’s Easy Chair ” (how changed from that which gave the *' mobile ” in question its name and its fame!) takes up the subject of subject!essness as an obstacle to the work of the preacher, journalist, or essayist. His first paragraph is such a paraphrase of a verse of Lowell's that it is difficult to believe that the poetry was not running through the proser's head: -
We, too, have Autumns, when our leaves Drop loosely through the dampened air;
When all our good seems bound In sheaves And we stand reaped and bare.
It is an odd complaint -for this particular complainant- Because we have come to think that so long as Mr. Howells the novelist is kept at work in his vocation, Mr. Howells the essayist will never lack topics for his avocation. Of him it has been recently and judiciously remarked, " He is not exactly a critic; he is a commentator upon Howells.1* In his commentary he is, however, almost infallibly entertaining, saving when, by strange exception, he becomes splenetic in setting forth the general misappreciation of his latest born, as revealed by Romeike. In those rare moments, he even recalls that delightful observation of Goldsmith: '* When I write anything, the public makes a point of not knowing anything about it.** But these splenetic attacks are few, and even they are almost redeemed by the naivete with which expression is given to them. Almost proverbially, a man with a grievance is a bore. But when the ag, grieved is Mr. Howells, and the grievance is that the *• best sellers are historical novels, when he reverts three generations ago to show, in the language of two generations ago. in the language of the godlike Daniel, that he is one of those who esteem any tribute of regard, whether light and occasional, as in the case of book buying, or more serious and deliberate, as in the case of formal eulogy, which may be bestowed upon Walter Scott, as so much unjustly withholcfen from himself, he is far from being a bore. How can he lack topics so long as his own latest novel is not far away the best seller?
Mr. Howells's total output of copy must be very respectable! even according to the standard of the journalist, who, as Mr. Howells in thin essay sug- , gests, can never lack topics so long as there are dally j papers, and hence proceeds in an eternal and vicious circle of making copy and being the cause of copy in I others. Nay, it is not Wholly contemptible even in ! comparison with the prodigious Trollope an3 the twenty-five hundred words he wrote every morning j before going to work. Nobody Is going to commiser- .j ate a writer so prolific upon his lack of topics when he has never failed to have enough to.talk about to-
commend his copy at the best rate of the magazines. He was great and respected before Stevenson had set foot on Samoa, before Kipling had passed the twenty-thousand mark, when Dumas was still considered an artist in Paris, when Walter Scott was still admired in Boston. And he may still exist in undiminished vigor when the best sellers of 1005 have all gone to feed the paper mills of 1910. What would he?
His conclusions as to this particular topic of topic-lessness- are quite sound. In the first place, want of subject is not in our stars but in ourselves. As he delightfully puts it, the writer “ may not have anything to say, but he certainly has something to say it about.” In the next place, ,4 to talk delightfully is the great matter with any sort of talker.*'
This requisite Mr. Howells always fulfills except when the laurels of the best-eelling romancer, of this or of some former generation, will not suffer him to sleep. Distinctly he fulfills it in the present paper. The only failure of urbanity one notes is the' marked omission of the name of Stevenson from the list of masters of the art of essay writing, which in-eludes Montaigne and Lamb and Leigh Hunt and Do Quincey and Hazlitt. The omission will recall to many a controversy about 4* Realism and Romance ** In which Mr. Howells was not precisely victorious.
