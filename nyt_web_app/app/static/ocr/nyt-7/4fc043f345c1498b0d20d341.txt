Who Wrote “ The Breadwinners?
'What John Hay Said About It.
Hcie York Times Book Review:
U ask in your Issue of July
8 if any one can answer the above question. John Hay served with the writer on the staffs of Gens. GiUmoro and Hunter at Port HeyaL Seeing his name on the book3 of the Hotel Brunswick in New York. I left a card there for him. indorsed in pencil as follows:
“ The author of * The Breadwinners/ from intrinsic- evidence, is obviously a rich man, well married, residing ln Cleve^ land, who has been an officer in the regular array, is familiar with business affairs and political movements, and has such facility in writing 'as implies newspaper experience. Who £s he? ”
This narrowed the responsibility for the novel absolutely to himself. His reply was as follows, and is worth preserving. The italics are his own, and the last clause justifies publishing the letter. T. C. B. Montreal, July 10, 1P05.
IN CLOSURE.
New York, Sept. 17, 1887.
Dear Major:
Thanks for your kind remembrance and greeting. I wish we might have shaken hands and had a gossip over old times.
The subject touched upon on the reverse of your card is interesting to those who would like to see a peculiarly exasperating malefactor brought to justice. " Let no guilty man cscapel "
Yours very truly,
JOHN HAY.
