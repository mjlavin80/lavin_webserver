THE JAMAICAN NEGRO.
Good Pictures .and a Better Account of England's Largest West India Island.
R. FORREST. the illustrator of this book, lias done good work in a little known field, but Mr* Henderson, though officially second fiddle, has done better. Mr. Forrest's {Huntings, well reproduced in color, are, however, the only excuse for the title, " The West Indies," given to the volum**, for Mr. HenGerson*s text deals almost wholly with Jamaica, and with the Jamaica negroes. He presents them from many viewpoints, yet not from all. Or, if he does, he does not say so. Is there not in the British West Indies a real negro society? Are not there high officials who are negroes—Judges and Bishops, for example? Do not they and their families mt-et the white officials as equals? We think we have heard affirmative answers to these questions. Mr. Henderson, however, does not mention the fact, if fact it is; Jamaica Is the West Indies for him. and the low grade-Jamaican negro is his West Indian negro. Quite possibly he is right/ but we should have liked him to say so.
The book is very interesting, and within the limits which we think we have found is valuable as a study of some of the-phases of sub-tropical Amcrica.
It was in the West Indies, Mr. Henderson points out. that the foundation of the British Empire was laid; M tlie Caribbean
Sea is the font of the temple of our greatness.'* “ The West Indian waters formed the training school of Drake and Frobisher. Hawkins and Raleigh, and these men founded the navy. In later days Rodney revived the Caribbean school, and there Nelson learned how to outwit the French in ocean battles. Because of these things, but not only because of these things, we owe a gTeat debt to these Antillean Islands."	~
The emancipation of the slaves In 18^4 flung the industries of Jamaica, out of j<»int; the drv rot of decay set in, and the island fell from her high position among commercial communities.
Mr. Henderson mixes his metaphors, but is intelligible, at all events.
The richest planters sold their plantations and returned to England. The poor remained, terribly handicapped for lack of labor. The freed slaves refused to work for their late masters, and the labor difficulty set in. And this difficulty has remained : more or less acute to this day. * * * If the j black men were willing to work even half ; as hard now as their fathers were once forced to work we should hear no dreary stories of Jamaica’s poverty. The island has an ideal climate, and laborers in plenty:	it lacks but the spirit of labor.
*	•	* Solve the Jamaica labor problem
and the commercial problem will solvo itself.	-
When tlie Panama Canal is opened,
Isays Mr. Henderson, Jamaica will be an important naval base; meantime it is
nothing.	I
In another chapter Mr. Henderson con- j siders *' Commercial Jamaica," Again It j is emancipation which caused the island’s , troubles, but not alone. After emancipation the planters fixed the rate of , wages—on the lowest possible scale—and then charged enormous rents for the cottages leased to the negroes. They levied fines, and frequently the negro found he had no money coming to him after a , week’s work. Then he refused to work ! any more, and was evicted. He found It easy to live on a patch of land, and less and less often would he consent to re- 1 turn to work- To provide labor, coolies I were imported. There are 10,000 of them 1 there now. What the island needs, ac- : cording to Mr. Henderson, is not a | bounty on sugar or any preferential tariff. but ** men—men of the best type that Britain can send. If there were more in- j teliigent, unprejudiced Englishmen to em- : ploy and direct the natives, labor diffi- ! culties would speedily cease to exist, j There is room for strong, young, intelligent Britishers In thousands." Mr. Hen- I derson relates various conversations he ' had, with a negro, with " people *ho were neither white, nor black, nor yellow.** ! and with an English resident. The first j wanted Jamaica for the Jamaicans.
We recognize that It Is a fine thing to be a part of the great Empire of Britain, ; but we recognise even more clearly that ; it is a finer thing to be a free, unfettered j nation. It Is inevitable that Jamaica will be entirely Independent of England. Already tlie more educated colored people feel the bitterness of their semi-Independence* we are not without our politicians, our leaders; we have not yet found our Cromwell, but some day soon a strong man will appear, and Jamaica will become an Independent nation.
The white man—only one of many— looked back to Gov. Eyre's hasty proceed* ings as quite proper.
“ Eyre strung up Gordon, and the black fellows have not forgotten the lessen they

were taught then.** “ If they were to organize and, under the leadership of a strong man, demand absolute home rule?"
" Thrn we should have to tell them to go to the devil." ** And if they refused?*'
“ Well, then, I suppose there d be a bit of shooting. * • * After emancipation the island was in a pretty bad way. One or two of tho^negroes started in business as political agitators. It was about the best-paying business in those days. But as things began to brighten up the negro grievance became less acute and the agitators became less popular. That is about the size of the affair.”
What the island needs, according to this man, is ** thousands of good, educated Britons, with a bit of capital. Fortunes are being made in Jamaica. The railway is going to help the country along, and so is the Panama Canal." The speaker thought that with the canal finished the United States would never let Jamaica become a negro republic.
Put all that nonsense about a free Jamaica and the government of Jamaica by Jamaicans out of your head. We are going to grow. We have no time to discuss the absurd ambitions of scheming gentlemen of the colored class. Jamaica is a British colony, governed by white men, and so it will remain.
The most obvious thing in Kingston, the capital of the island, is the buggy-nian, or hackman. “ A Jamaican buggy is a spiderlike species of the four-wheeled vehicle known in England as the country fly. It is drawn by one horse, which is neither a horse, nor a pony, nor a mule, but something remotely resembling all three and raising sentiments of deep pity in the hearts of all beholders. The driver of the buggy supplies the necessary enthusiasm for the horse and buggy alike. | The buggyman ignores everything in life save possible customers. He drives with a carelessness which Is good for weak nerves, and finally lands his victim at a place where he has no desire to go. Then he blames the passenger for not giving j correct directions and explains that to drive on will be another six-penny fare. Th^law in Jamaica reads, ‘ Sixpence per passenger to any place in town,* and so the driver gallops to an unfrequented cor- , ner of the place and demands an extra sixpence. The fare* must pay, or walk back in the sun through the stench of poorer Kingston. It is really better for tourists to ^uy^a buggy and horse than to hire a driver if tney are going to stay for more than three weeks.” When a buggyman marries, says Mr. Henderson, he usually chooses his wife from among the yellow women; the negress is beneath him. He will teU you that he " married white, and you will wonder how he did it until you see his lady.**
Summing up his study of the principal Jamaican element, Mr. Henderson says:
In character the Jamaican negroes are a mixture of good and bad; of Africa and Europe, with the vices of both the Macks and the whites, and only some of the virtues of the people of Europe. As a iule, they are well-meaning people, full of curious mannerisms, with which it is difficult for the white man to be in entire sympathy. In many ways the Jamaican negro resembles his brother of the States; he is just as arrogant—even more so—but he is not quite so independent, anji by no means so cnergctic. in the country all colored people are approximately of one class; in towns, the buggyman looks down upon the costermonger.
As these are the people who are expected to do much of the Panama digging, Mr. Henderson's book may be recommended to any would-be contractor.
