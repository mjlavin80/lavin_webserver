SCHERER'S JAPAN.
A Popular History and Exposition of Nippon and Its People.*
his selection of a little shows. Dr. Scherer regards Japan as a nation still in its youth. He sets out to relate In this book how the people of Nippon after a sort of prolonged babyhood, during which they followed their own devices, went to kindergarten, common school, and college, to China for several more centuries, and now are finishing off with a modem technical course In which the Western nations serve as professors.
Dr. Scherer was teacher in a Japanese Government school for some four years, and knows something of Japan and especially of Japanese youth. His work, therefore, ts based upon a pretty solid foundation, and will be found both entertaining and informing. In scope the narrative covers (to borrow the author's terms) "the bare outline story of the people of Japan m and a ** more detailed account of their remarkabl® educational development." Dr. Scherer admits that the Japanese are not original, but he insists that they have a marvelous genius for wise eclecticism and adaptation, and he adds that whatever they take they presently stamp with a something of their own perfectly distinctive.
As to the Japanese “ active principle ” he is clear that in the beginning it Is aesthetic, not moral. He quotes a native writer to the effect that the Japanese people, by nature pred’sposed to a right manner of living, had no need to Invent a system of morals. They Imported the system they use from China, where the evil-living Chinese had formd such a restraining invention called for by the conditions of the case. But the Chinese morals in becoming Japanese suffered a sea change. The Japanese took from Confucius (that is, for actual practice) the precepts which reinforced their own predispositions. As Shlntoists they revered their ancestors dead; the Imported moral system enabled them to extend that reverence to the living and made absolute obedience to parents and governors the j first of all the virtues. It In this virtue, obviously, which gives Japan its present marvelous efficiency In the arts of peace and especially (at this moment) in those of wax. Such is the M virtue of the Emperor" of which Admiral Togo (to the i marveling of Western barbarians') speaks 1 when he wins a glorious sea fight, for all obedience to parents and governors climbs up and centres at last in the imperial person.
Dr. Scherer cites tn the premises the book called " Four and Twenty Para^ gons,** which Japanese children are set to read for purposes of character building. Filial piety Is the most eminent characteristic of the two dozen mythical heroes here held up for the emulation of worthy youth. Listen;
Of one of these paragons It is told that although his mother was but a stepmother, and one who treated him cruelly at that, yet his sense of filial duty was so great that in Winter, when the streams were frozen, he would lie naked on the ice, thereby melting a hole with the warmth of his body, so that he might catch fish to satisfy the whims of her appetite. Another would lie unclothed upon the floor at night, without mosquito netting, to entice the bloodthirsty Insects from their attempts to pierce the nets or his parents. • * • But the chief of all the paragons, perhaps, was he who when seventy years of age, wrapped hlmseli in swaddling clothes and sprawled upon the floor in order to delude his very aged parents into the happy belief that they were still a young married couple and he their infant son!
So tn the great war at which the world has wondered, this same filial piety, with tho Emperor and the country for object, caused a poor man who could find nobody to take care of his Infant son to slay the child-in order that he might be at liberty to fulfill what ho deemed his highest duty as a soldier. And among the Japanese this deed got nothing but praise. It was a noble act, not a horrid crime, as to the ethics of the West it seems. Similarly a good wife piously slew herself that her husband, who must otherwise stay at home to support her, might serve his Emperor without embarrassment! Such la^jthe effect of the “ Bushido "—the “ chivalry which takes no account of womanhood "—though, to be sure. Dr. Scherer does not use the Japanese term which other writers have made familiar. Some of these other writers, however, have pointed out that It is not a chivalry which leaves woman out of account or even uncrowned. In fact, it pays its extravagant homage not to the young girl and sweetheart, but to the mother.
That suggests a curious theory noted by Dr. Scherer when he is speaking of
•YOUNG JAPAWi The Story of the Japanese People, and Especially of Their Educational Development.	By Jamea A, B, Scherer,
Ph. D.. LiL. D.. President of Newberry College, Author of ** Japan To-day," &c- .12mo. Pp.’ 321.. Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott / ccznpojiyv'	■	•• ■■	■'	- .. :	-•	' :•
. Japanese poetry, as he does in a manner to furnish the average reader with a good deal of desirable information. The Ern-i peror himself, he says, once upon the occasion of the departure- of a certain elderly and much-beloved Englishwoman from his Court, wrote with his own imperial brush a little verse after a minutely beautiful Japanese form. The words, which were intended to be infinitely complimentary, were these: " Westward the gray goose takes her flight-" One may guess at the Englishwoman’s feelings, but in Japan gray hairs are a crown of glory, and a goose Is not at all accounted a silly bird.
The volume contains a very satisfactory account of the rise of the curious system of feudalism, which overshadowed and immured the Emperor, and made the Son of Heaven a puppet in the hands of the Shogun, or General. It gives the history of the greater Shoguns, of the Fujiwara family, which held the reins of Government from A. D. G70 to A. D. 1050; of the Asliikagas, whose power came to an end toward the close of the sixteenth century; of the mighty rulers Nobunaga, who persecuted Buddhists, and Hideyoshi and Tyeyasa, who made great and cruel slaughter of Christians. Dr. Scherer supplies an unusually complete account of the rise of Roman Catholic missions in the islands In the seventeenth century, of the quarrels of Portuguese and Dutch, and the perfidious conduct of the latter, which led to the practical extinction of the Christians—who had become very numerous and powerful—and of the barring out of all the Western world which followed upon Lhe anti-Christian movement. The author thinks the consequent long period of isolation, during which Japan was all for tlie Japanese, had incalculable influence In ripening the Japanese character, as It now exists. The expedition of Commodore Perry and all tho changes that have come after that event have been made too familiar of late to call for outline here, but Dr. Scherer’s account Ls an excellent one for popular purposes. It even includes the text of the Japanese Constitution proclaimed by Emperor Mut-suhJto in 1S80.
The literary and artistic history of the Japanese receives enough attention in the course of the story to give the reader an idea of these matters ample for ordinary purposes, while ** education " In the current sense gets more space than it perhaps deserves. That is natural In an
