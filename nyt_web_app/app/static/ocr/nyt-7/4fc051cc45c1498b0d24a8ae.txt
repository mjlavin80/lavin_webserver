Why should the sums of money earned by authors interest the world so greatly in an age when large fortunes are so common and men in other callings receive as remuneration for skilled service sums of money that would have seemed fabulous a generation ago? The question is hard to answer. Yet gossip
I about the remuneration of successful authors is always in the air. Lord Rosebery, who is sometimes in earnest, declared in his speech at the Booksellers* banquet in Edinburgh lately that the author's profession was most remunerative in the early part of the nineteenth century, when Scott. Byron* and Moore received large sums for their work. Of course, this sort of argument counts for nothing. Many authors literally starved in those very days. Lord' Rosebery’s remarks, however, have served to excite the usual discussion. We do not doubt that, as Rosebery’s critics say, the present era is the most remunerative for authorship as well as for all other kinds of work. But it is perfectly true that good literature is not paid proportionately with much that is poor and ephemeral, and that most writers of books have to be content with very little. Also It Is a shame to encourage young men and women who might do well in other walks of life to take up authorship with the idea that great fortunes are to be made in that trade. Nobody should write who is not firmly possessed of the idea that he has a vocation for literature, and is not willing to endure the penalties of art for the sake of serving an art. If a person who writes in that spirit makes a living he earns it. If he makes a fortune he deserves it.
