Dutton & Co. $2.50.
Misfortune has so pursued those
two ancient houses of Hapsburg and Wittelsbach that they furnish tragedy and romance ready to the writer's hand. And because royalty downcast is a thing which (nowadays, at least) appeals especially to women, this has been the women's field. For these feel the glamour and the pity of it and can assume a worshipful attitude—as it were, a loyalty—which to men of modern humor is impossible. Thus more than one has written of the ill-fated Empress Elizabeth of Austria-Hungary, of the Emperor Francis Joseph, of young Rudolph, their son; of Ludwig of Bavaria, called the Mad, Now the Norwegian lady who wrote of Elizabeth has written of her sister, Maria Sophia, ex-Queen of N&pTks. These two (as the world has been many times informed) were the daughters of I Maximilian, Duke in Bavaria and ' cousin of King Ludwig I. of that State,
: who was not mad—he who found Munich a country town and left it one of the show places of Europe—he also who | was deeply involved with that Lola Montez who was the most celebrated adventuress of the middle of the- past century. Tou will find here, by the way, an excellent account of Lola.
As for Duchess Maria Sophia, she was married in 1859 (by proxy) to Francis, Duke of Calabria, Crown Prince of Naples and son of that fanatic Ferdinand II., called King " Bomba,” his mother being a Princess of Sardinia. The author has an entertaining account of King Bomba, who was a bad King but a man of many approved domestic tastes. His favorite dishes were macaroni and raw onions. He had his prejudices, and called the English ** fishmongers/* the French “ hairdressers,” the Russians " tallow eaters/’ He was a very good Catholic, always “ crossed himself before mounting his horse ” and " before retiring to rest kissed all the pictures of saints on the walls of his bedroom.” One day, as Bomba and young Francis, his son, stood gazing down upon a crowd before the Royal Palace, the boy asked:
“ What could a King do with all these people? *’
“ He could kill them all,” answered Ferdinand. " He could, but he does not because ot his respect for holy, religion/*
Francis became King of Naples in May, 1859. In May, 1860, Garibaldi invaded Sicily and drove out the Nea-
politan Generals; In July he was in Calabria, in September Francis and Maria Sophia fled from Naples and retired to Gaeta.
It was at the siege of this fortress that the young Queen won her fame, for she was seen everywhere on the ramparts tending the wounded and encouraging the men at the guns. And she went her rounds amid showers of shot and shell laughing and unafraid. It was magnificent, but not exactly war, and it was in vain. In February, 1861, Gaeta was surrendered and the King and Queen saved themselves on a French corvette put at their disposal
I by Napoleon III.
i After the loss of their kingdom Francis and Maria Sophia dwelt in Home till Victor Emmanuel took over the Papal States also, and after that chiefly in
i Paris, though the Queen went often to Bavaria and both to Arco in the Tyrol. With the period of the lady’s life just after her husband's downfall is connected a scandal involving a Belgian officer—a scandal which the present author touches upon els lightly as possible. Francis died in 1895 and was buried at Arco. Maria Sophia is still living, chiefly at Neuilly, where she has a stud and trains racers. For she has been all her life a passionately devoted horsewoman.
The book is entertaining and has less of cloying sweetness than most women’s books of its brand.
