■THE CHINESE PEOPLE,
*• An Interesting Account' of Their ‘L.ife -	by	a	Frenchman.*
L EMILE BARD Is ah exception to the rulo that "a Frenchman is a gentleman with	a decoration,	-who ,
knows nothing about	geog-
raphy." He may have a decoration, bat he knows something of geography, at least-so far as China is concerned. He is a kindly, though Just, observer, has seen China as a business man may see it not as a traveler or a missionary, having lived for four years in the, country; his eyes	have looked	with the proper	focus,
and,	as	he says,	he has tried to	avoid
the optimism of certain writers and not to ‘depreciate the Celestial Empire and its inhabitants.* We think he has been successful.	,
Mr. Bard describes the Chinese regard _ for etiquette, which is so complicated, however, that in' most cases form replaces substance. With the Chinese, a refusal or unpleasaHt truth must be expressed evasively. If a Chinaman does not wish to -accommodate a friend he never gives the true reason for his refusal; that would be discourteous. He lies politely. Our war correspondents have said the same of the Japanese, who fubbed them off with compliments that were Uttle better than falsehoods. Prom this overgrown etiquette “emanate the exasperating practices of ‘fraud, dissimulation, and trickery.'* " I speak on this subject from knowledge,” says the author. " An associati9n of several years with natives of all ranks authorizes me to assert that the bent of . their minds is such that they absolutely refuse to admit that two and two make four.” He says that more than once, having bargained for a sale at the rate of sixteen ounces to the pound, he has found that the goods were to be weighed by a twelve-ounce pound, and had to begin the bargaining once more.

IN a general way the Chinese servants. are honest; that is, they will steal „ nothing belonging to their employers. But they squeeze everybody with whom ’ their employers deal. A foreign Minister dismissed his porter, the principal agent In squeezing the tradesmen. ITears afterward he found that his servants, headed by the new porter, bad - paid the discharged man his regular wages, and had a bank account, the income of which was divided regularly among the servants. Another annoyance to the European is the Chinese disregard of time, explained' as due to the fact that they have no weekly day of rest. The divisions of time are indicated sufficiently, by. the terms morning and evening; if the Chinese carry watches it is because the tick- . ing amuses them. Of the street lighting in Peking Mr. Bard quotes this story as current among the Europeans:
Eighty thousand taels are assigned each year for street lights; the official in charge takes 40,000 as bis share, and gives the rest to a subordinate. This latter hands over 20,000 to his inferior, and* so on, until the original sum is reduced to a few copper cash, given to a coolie to buy oil and a wick; these are placed on a plate on the ground. A beggar .comes along and drinks the oil—and such is the lighting of Peking.
On the subject of religion Mr. Bard makes a striking observation:	"	It	must
be stated, to the honor of the Chinese, that no people, ancient or modern, ever possessed a sacred literature more completely exempt from licentious ideas, and that at no period has their worship been associated with orgies or human sacrifices similar to those of which traces may be found in the history of every pagan people. This vitalizing purity is perhaps the reason for the prelonged existence of the social order of things."
MR, BARD has a valuable chapter on Chinese money. Its unit is the tael, which ia not a coin, but a weight of silver—the ounce, of which there are 16 to the catty and 1,600 to the picul." The commercial tael is that of Canton, which should weigh 37.783 grains, but usually weighs 37.58. Then there is the tael of Shanghai, which weighs 3G.6, and. the revenue tael, used In valuing imports and exports, and each large city hnR its own, that of Tien-Tsin worth from 4 to 6 per cent' more than that of Shanghai. Business estimated tn taclb is carried on by the use of Spanish dollars or silver ingots. The former are weighed and stamped by every South China merchant and have to be remlnted continually. The ingots of silver are cut from bars into pieces that the operator estimates ; will weigh 50 taels. Naturally each one who bandies them weighs them.
** Banks store their money in cellars, in boxes carried back and forth by coolies. This explains the item of transportation which is deducted from the face of a Chinese check when it is cashed at a

Jjank. One can judge of the complications consequent -upon'-this. system of-con version of taels of-different, values into ingots'of different weight and purity, es-. pecially as’ assayers of different localities refuse to honor the stamps of other cities.’’ In-places -where .the- dollar la not used,, small payments are made by;'cutting up an Ingot, "The 'scale- used in weighing these fragments has; two rsets-of markings; one for receipts and one for' payments." , . . ~
The ^national coin of China is the " cash/' a round copper coin, with a square hole through it. The cash or sapek ■ dates from at least 2300 B. C. Eight-, pounds .weight of cash make one dollar. Yea'rs ago an Emperor, decided to. double his funds by giving copper cash double , its value; In certain parts of the country ‘ this- performance is still in effect. In other parts 77 or 85 cash are counted as 1001. In Honan the Chinese go to. market with two klpds of money—one real, the other counterfeit. Some articles are bought with one, some with the other; certain articles have two prices—one in good money, one in bad. ** The dodging , spirit of the Chinaman is well adapted to all these complications.” In line with such methods-are the tricks of trade in China. Mr. Bard says that a merchant never hesitates to deliver fraudulent or inferior goods if he thinks he . can escape detection. He himself has found small shot in cocoons, the holes through which they were inserted being carefully sewed up and covered with silk. He has found needles in the stems of feathers, inserted to increase their weight; bricks and pieces of iron are to be found ln bales of merchandise, finely cut chicken fea tilers mixed with eiderdown.

THE author does more than record the Chinaman's faults; he finds many a good word to say for him. “ Nowhere ln the' world,” he says, “ is such a vast agglomeration of men kept in order and obedience without police or- military
•	force, with such a minimum of public functionaries. * • * Arbitration in cases ofc disagreement is largely practiced.” He says that the yellow' peril, if it exists, is distant. His reasons are:
China has no .capital and never will have so long as its finances are so badly administered, with ihe mandarins in control. Its people. are poor, + +■ * the whole Government budget is'inferior to that of the. City of Paris alone, The danger, if any, will come from industries established with European capital and managed exclusively by Europeans. The only chance of competitive success even then would lie in the cheapness of native hand labor. This is, generally of an inferior quality, for every sort of work requiring muscular exertion three Chinamen being needed to do- the work of one European. This* being the .case, Chinese wages are not much less than those of Europe'. In the cotton milts in Shanghai salaries have - quadrupled* in twenty years, while the wages of coolies on the Hankow-Peking Railroad have doubled. It would be surprising if a land newly-born to industrial life should for centuries find .itself in a con-•drtion to supplant nations haying 'behind them the experience of generations of
*	enlightened capitalists and skilled, alert
workmen. „	.

SOME PAGES FROM THEvBOOK.
THE ceremonious forms of expression •used in "ordinary conversation seem very amusing to the European listener. It. Is a fixed rule that one must speak of himself and of all. belonging to him In the humblest of terms and use the most exalted language ln referring to the' ‘person .or* property of another. Whether two mandarins or two beggars meet and accost* each other, this is a sample of their conversation:
"What Is your, honorable name?”
Your insignificant brother’s name is Wang.”
".Where is your noble dwelling?"
" The hovel in which 1 hide myself is in-----," designating the place. .
" How many precious sons have you? "
"I have only five stupid little pigs.”
IT is a gross offense to call a native by his name. A superior may do this, but he becomes furious if even a twin brother thus addresses him. It must be either " honorable older brother" or ** honorable younger brother," or some such form of expression. Foreigners usually solve the difficulty by applying to their servants the names of their functions, as boy, coolie, gardener, cook, mafoo, (coachman,) and so on.
HE following anecdote serves to- illustrate the self-effacing phase of Chinese politeness: A Chinaman, gearing his finest gown of silk, called at a house where he happened to disturb a rat, which was regaling itself out of a jar of oil standing on a beam over the door. In its sudden fright the rat upset the oil over the luckless visitor, ruining his fine raiment. While the man was still pale with rage, his host appeared, and after the customary greetings the visitor accounted for his appearance in this wise:
" As I was entering your honorable dwelling I frightened your honorable rat; while it was trying to escape it upset your honorable jar of oil over my poor and insignificant clothing. This explains the contemptible condition In which I find myself in your honorable presence." -
CROWNING the edifice of the Chinese Government, we find the Censorate, which sits in judgment on all officials, not .excepting the Son of Heaven himself. When the present Emperor, then
a child of three, wasjbelrig borne along In his~ uncle's fiIneral :proc<3ssIon, a censor delivered. to his attendant;a missive ’pro-' testing- against;; his accession to ^ the; throne, ’ and in proof "of the’.'sincerity of his conviction he commuted suicide 1n presence of the;new monarch. ; *
. In. 1871 a censor boldly opposed hla opinions to those of Prince Kung, then at the Ijead. of the Government^ and _Jhe latter preferred breaking his . -word pledged to tho ‘American Minister to bravFn^ the disapproval of the 'cerisor, although tlie rank of the latter was rnucti inferior to 'tl^at of the^Prince.
:.f That this courageous Independence is still an attribute of certain of their number IS demonstrated by two successive reports ot the censor Aii Wei-tsun, one directed against the powerful IJ Hung-Chang and Tson Yii-yIng/ ’Viceroy' of Yun-nahr an<f another1 against the .Dowager Brnpr ess-herself, the terrible and vindictive, Tze-hsl-tuanyu, for which he -was recalled; and' sentenced to penal servitude at the military posts of Mongolia. We quote the reports, which., were published in the Peking Gazette:	-
': " July 18.. 1894.—When we compare Li Hung-Chang with the'Marquis Tso' Tsung-tarig arid note the ’great riches, power, and influence of-the former and his family and the honest poverty of the illustrious Tso, no great penetrattoiv is needed to enable us to decide as to .which one merits the title of patriot and honest man.”	.	■	-■
:" Dec. 28, 1894.—Her Majesty has always; interfered with matters of State, without any right to do so. How will she be able to justify her conduct to-the -imperial ancestors and also to her confiding and loyal people? "
-
WE might prolong this list indefinitely, but we "will limit ourselves to .	„ one more incident. About thirty
years ago a mandarin was murdered by. soldiers; as a.result thirty-three functionaries—prefects,^ sub-prefects, and super-intendents—were declared responsible and beheaded. and the Governor. and Treasurer of the province were exiled.
The entire family is, held responsible for the acts of any of Its members, and for certain1 offenses, such as-an attempt on. the life of the Emperor, all are executed, even to the babe in arms.
•The tepaom or dean of the village, elected by universal suffrage, Is responsible for the conduct of the families of his domain.' The'sub-prefect, prefect, Governor, and Viceroy are all responsible in different degrees. An inundation and a famine are* laid a€ the door of the Governor or the Viceroy, who are " father and mother to the people." to use an official expression. -	.
