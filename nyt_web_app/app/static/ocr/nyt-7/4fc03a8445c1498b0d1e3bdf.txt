.has grown oil Strauss ‘since he com-^" posed "Till EuTenspIegel to “ mar his picture "by some piece of Tnaliclous folly, to thrust his head through the canvas and grin at. the public, or W place his thumb to his nose and extend his fingers at them in a derisive flourish/'. Mr. Newman finds this tendenc^ at its worst in " Ein Heldenleben "—this was before the : “ Domestica "• emerged. Coming down, in*'a sort of afterword, to that, he concludes that there Is 'something, physically, wrong \vith a brain, that canfall so low-as the “ baby episodes *! in. that cacophonous tone poem. He thinks It is time the world protested against so much of its leisure and its funds being taken up with sheer Inanities of this kind. There is in this symphony, thinks Mr. Newman, a degeneration,-temporary or permanent, of the composer’s artistic sense; in the | thematic invention, in. the orchestra- j tlon. “ There is page after page in the
*	Symphonia Domestica * containing the grossest of miscalculations.”
We have quoted so much of Mr. Newman’s animadversion upon a man whose principles and whose art he has so valiantly championed, to give some hint of his independence and. clearness j of view. He is doing it, it may also be ; added, in the face of a London-enthusiasm as unreasoning and unreasonable as was the previous indifference toward Strauss.
The rest of the Assays are quite as well worth reading. He discusses “ Berlioz Romantic and Classic," from the point of view of an admirer of the much-debated Frenchman. He finds two Berliozes, the earlier, eccentric almost to madness, and the later,
“ touched with a philosophic sense of the reality of things ” and " with an eye for something more in life than hjs own unshorn locks and his- sultry amours," represented by the “ Requiem ” and the final scene of " Romeo et Juliette," a promise whose fulfillment was prevented by the inroads of disease. What Mr. Newman wants to combat here is the " old legend ” of Berlioz’s extravagance and want of reticence in his music. He insists that even in the works that have been most persistently held up as models of Berlioz's extravagance there is little that deserves the epithet, notwithstanding the enormous passion he put into them. The line of discussion through which Mr. Newman reaches the conclusion that Berlioz was a *' genius of the first rank," though also a “ monument of Incompleteness,'* is extremely striking.
The longest single essay in the collection, in some respects the best, as a piece of argument and exposition, is that on “ Programme Music." Mr. Newman is well known as an ardent upholder of the programmatic functijn of music. He presents one of the most brilliant and logical arguments for it that has ever been formulated. One of the striking points he makes, one In which he opposes many who have discussed programme .music before him, is against the dictum that ** programme music ought to speak for itself'*; that it should appeal to the hearer who does not know the programme just as much as to one who does. Says Mr. Newman:
We not only need the programme—the statement of the literary or pictorial subject of the composition—but this is at once answerable for half our pleasure and a justification of certain peculiarities of form which the music may now safely assume. If the shape and color of the themes of a piece of music, the order of their occurrence, and the variations they undergo, are till determined by the composer having a certain picture in his mind, it is surely necessary for us to be told what that picture is. If it was necessary for him when he was composing, it is necessary for us if we are to listen to the music as he meant us to listen to it.
All of which assertions, however, ere not necessarily or always true; since a composer may have been stimulated by certain literary or artistic suggestions to musical utterance complete and cogent in itself. Suggestions of this sort might have been to him as a scaffolding upon which he climbed to erect his structure; and the structure finished, he or we have no more use for ; the scaCfolding. That is one case, and no doubt not the most usual; but the subject cannot be fully traversed here, and it is enough to say that Mr. New- j man argues adroitly and resourcefully. In other essays he combats Spencer’s ! theory of the origin of music--Spencer having done him the honor, as he says, to reply to a brief criticism of that theory which Mr. Newman put into his “ Study of Wagner." In “ Maeterlinck and Music ’* ne enters upon some meta-
R. SONNECK, who is the chief of the department ot music in the Library o* Congress, has done a worthy and valuable work in'* this book on Francis Hopkin-son and James Lyon, a piece of research in American history based on an examination of original sources. There is need of such work, if the history of American 'music is to emerge from that stage which Dr. Burney describes as due to the laziness of the historians who go on copying their predecessors’ statements by their own firesides instead of sallying forth to find out what really happened.
As Mr. Sonneck suggests, there has been a great deal of this sort of thing in the writing of American histories of music. The greater activity of New England writers in the past, who, have written about the psalmody that chief
prevailed there in the early days, has given the impression that psalm singing in Boston was the principal manifestation of music in Colonial America. As a matter of fact, sacred and secular music developed simultaneously throughout the Colonies, sacred music dominating in the North, as in Boston; secular in the South, -?.s in Charleston, while in New York and Philadelphia both were of equal weight. It has been easier for the writers of “ history,” however, to take refuge in the Boston literature than laboriously to ascertain tlV5 facts elsewhere, i ...
BEGINNINGS OF AMERICAN MUSIC.
In tracing the career of HopK'ison Mi*. Sonneck has had to ascertain the state of music in Philadelphia, and has found reason to contravene those who have declared that there were no musical entertainments there before the middle of the eighteenth century. Though the data he has collected are meagre, they are enough to establish a .-comparatively high range of culture in Philadelphia by that time. Hop-k in son, who was born in 1731, was a man of unusual talent; a writer, a politician, an inventor, and an enthusiastic n^usician. In 1754, as we are informed by contemporary authority, the cweet lyre set his attentive soul on fire, and the result was an *' Ode on Music, on his beginning to learn the Harpsichord." He became, if not a virtuoso, an amateur of ability on that instrument, as well as on the organ, and a zealous promoter of orchestral concerts. He also invented a new method of “ quilling" harpsichords, concerning which he corresponded voluminously with Thomas Jefferson. Still more interesting is his career as a composer, and Mr. Sonneck has conclusively deposed William Billings from the place he has hitherto occupied dj the ?irst native composer. It is not entirely certain, however, whether Hopkinson or James Lyon of Newark deserves it, since the two earliest recorded compositions of both were written in 1750. Hoykin-sop’s is a song with accompaniment for harpsichord, entitled " My days have been so wondrous free,'* Lyon's an ode for Princeton commencement.
Hopkinson himself laid claim to the title of first native composer in a letter dedicating his volume of " Seven Songs" to Washington. The Father of His Country accepted it in a reply of considerably more facetiousness than he usually indulged in—a letter not before published. In this he doubts the " amazing powers of Musick ’’ as related by the ancients, because Hop-kinson’s songs had not softened the " Ice of the Delaware and Potomack,"

delayed. He furthermore bewails that in case any doubt the excellence of* them, he can " neither sing one' of the songs nor raise a single note on any Instrument ,to convince the unbelieving." He has, however, one argument which will prevail with persons of true-> taste, (at least in America.) '"I can* tell them that it is the production of Ur. Hopkinson.”
Another interesting letter from Jefferson, at that time in Paris, is given, acknowledging the receipt of songs, of one of which Hopkinson observed, if play’d very slow and sung with Expression, is forcibly pathetic." Jefferson thought it did indeed merit *‘ praise for its patiios," and relates that while' his elder daughter was playing it on the harpsichord, he happened to look toward the fire and saw the younger one all in tears. He asked her if she were sick. She said, ‘ No, but the tune was so mournful.* " Mr. Sonneck reprints this mournful tune. Concerning Hopkinson’s work on the whole; he says that to claim beauty or importance for it would be to confuse the standpoint of the critic with that of the historian:	.
But even the critic who cares not to explain and pardon shortcomings from a historical point of view, will admit that Hopkinson’s songs are not with-, out grace, and that our first poet-com-r poser obeyed the laws of musical declamation more carefully than a host of fashionable masters of that period.
His rival for historical precedence, James Lyon, is a substantial if somewhat less interesting figure. He was a student at Princeton, and at the commencement of 1759 an ode set to music by him was performed—the production that challenges Hopkinson's claim to seniority as a composer. In' Philadelphia.three years afterward he published his collection of hymns called '* Urania." Ritter has spoken of this as ’* a failure,” from the point of view of the publisher, who is said to have been ruined by it; but Mr. Sonneck has found evidences of several subsequent editions, probably four in all. This T collection has been deplorably treated ! by previous historians, like Hood and Ritter, who apparently did not take the trouble to look at it. Its importance deserved more careful attention, for, as Mr. Sonneck says, though it is not absolutely the first of its kind published in America, it was “ certainly the boldest, most conspicuous, and most carefully prepared attempt to ‘ spread the art of psalmody ’ throughout the Colonies. until about 1770." An interesting
*
chapter of this study is an examination of the separate pieces contained in-the collection and their origin, whereby the authorship of Lyon is connected with
*
several of them. It is an extremely interesting monograph for those who are concerned with the neglected past of music in this country; and though the graces of English style are not Mr. Sonneck’s, he knows how to make his history not only minutely correct, but interesting.
NEWMAN'S « Ml!SICAL STUDIES."
MR. ERNEST NEWMAN’S contributions to current musical discussions are among the most original, acute, and vigorously written of any by present-day writers. His new volume of ** Musical Studies" is made up of a number of articles that have appeared in periodicals on topics of present interest, though, as he tells us in his preface, many of them are revised. Their appearance in this form is a veritable boon to the Intelligent music lover. Mr. Newman always has something to say that is worth saying, and he says it without indirection, uninfluenced by partisanship; and there are very few musical writers of whom this can be, said. How fine a thing it is, for instance, to meet such a discussion of Strauss’s " Symphonia Domestica ” from a man who was one of the earliest English admirers and avowed upholders of the composer and who did so much to prepare the way for him in England!	.
Indeed, the way in which Mr, Newman puts his finger on the weaknesses of his subject here is most refreshing. Thus he speaks of the tendency which

' . ***- * FULLER-MAITLAND’S «JOACHIM.”
ri/i k. FULLER-MAITLAND has rot mtfch sympathy * with “hardly concealed invective ” da an ^at- -mosphere in which some mod era bicg-'; raph.ers have chosen to shroud the /ig- . ures they present; and he is willing that panegyric should be the prevailing note In his description of a life :?o :full " of dignity, usefulness, and beauty as that f of Joseph Joachim. It Is well that this should be so; and if it is not necessary . in . recounting that life to dwell on the fact that the man himself * is lingering too long on the stage and playing outrageously-out of tune, neither is it necessary to deny so, energetically what many have heard. The fact^ of Joachim’s life are not extraordinary: and itjs the influence of his personality, the straightforwardness of his character, the singleness nf his artistic aim, and the faithfulness with which he has followed his highest ideals, that count. They indeed have made their mark in the history of modern music.
He 'yas a ** wonder child," as almost all great artists have been, and appeared first in 1831), when he was eight years old; but fortunately he was res- ' cued and put to orderly study under good teacherg. Ever since he has received nothing but adulation In his career. Mr. Fuller-Maitland’s analysis of his style as a violinist gives him a tone of virile energy rather than of voluptuous roundness. His technique as a virtuoso is indicated by the solo part of his Hungarian concerto; and none ever attained to his standard of executing Bach’s polyphony on the violin, and certain of his works, thinks the biographer, can never have been adequately played till Joachim played them. He dwells much on the elasticity of phrase that he commands, and especially notes Joachim’s great mastery of just intonation in practical music. and mentions his passing from a note to its enharmonic equivalent with a perfection that no other violinist could achieve. This, according to Mr. Fuller-Maitland, is the explanation of the assertion that he plays out of tune —people who think he does do not know what he is doing. Which may, in a good many instances, be doubted.
The circumstances of Joachim’s break with what was, in his youth, the " new German school " of Wagner and Liszt, are sufficiently set forth. It was, after all, simply inevitable from the wide divergence of the ideals of the two sides. In his compositions, which Mr. Fuller-Maitland treats somewhat gingerly, as behooves a biographer of his avowed intentions, he is of course a conservative; but it is noteworthy that in none of them does he employ the most usual of the classical forms, the so-called sonata form.
