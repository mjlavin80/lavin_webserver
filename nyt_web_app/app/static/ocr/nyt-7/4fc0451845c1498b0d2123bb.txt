The stream of golden sawdust pouring from the saw mill of Josef Mayer, a wealthy and self-made German -lumber merchant with an insatiable appetite for work, runs through Mme. Longard de Longarde’s vepy original and clever story of the Carpathian Timberlands. The sawdust is not only Mayer’s Pactolian stream and the life blood of the noble pines; it is equally the life blood of the Polish Count Rutkowski, whom the
shrewd Mayer had forced into ruin by a cunningly worded contract, providing 'that the Count should furnish logs from his estate, under heavy penalties for failure to meet the specifications.
. The lumber merchant and the Count are *lhe most interesting figures of the novel, both admirably drawn, and thrown into fine contrast; the one a rough, self-made man, tirelessly working, with a genius for finance, a code of business ethics admitting not a little *' crooked dealing,” all the inconsistencies belonging to a hater of the well-born rich, himself grown rich, and, withal, at bottom, not wholly a bad fellow; the other a courteous, unpractical gentleman, bravely bearing his fallen fortunes without bitterness toward the man who had subtly outwitted him, his mind ripeninglnto philosophic wisdom, his character mellowing into sweetness by his life, close to nature’s heart, in the tiny corner left him of his despoiled Forest of Arden.
The successful workman's college bred son and the Countjp wild flower daughter, with a rude Irate father on the one hand, and a berouged and bejeweled mother of easy morals on the other, furnish material for a romance of unusual interest. The poor Jews of the tale are at once crafty and piteous, and there Is a pathetic flashlight picture of the Austrian Emperor, " with his old man's face and his young man’s figure— a face ploughed with many sorrows, and a figure the spring of whose elasticity neither time nor grief has been able to break ’'—with his tired eyes, his weary, perfunctory courtesies.
Mme. de Longarde has the rare gift of visualizing both people and places by a few vivid words worth whole acres of description. She tells of an " imprisoned fancy ’* liberated from walls of pine branches, by *' a delivering dash of blue ’* revealed by one glimpse of distance, reminding the " dwellers in this solitude . that ' hinter den Bergen sind auch Leute.' " That " delivering dash of blue” is a whole poem.
The readers of “ Sawdust" will find nothing arid in the story but Its name.
It is full of freshness and originality, a book that will be well mated with the ample and aromatic forest depths to whfch, at this season, the " spirit in our feet ” Irresistibly impels us.
