Gen. Dix’s Latin Translations.
New York Timea Booh Revise:
At the recent sale of the library of the late Nathaniel C. Moak I purchased a copy of " Dies Irao " and “Stabat Mater/’ translated by Gen. John A. Dix, (la-te Governor of New York,) Inserted in the book was an autograph letter written by Gen. Dix giving particulars regarding his translation of those ancient hymns which would, I believe. Interest the readers of The Nbw York Times Book Review.
I enclose herewith a copy of the letter, together with Mr. Moakss reply.

THE INCLOSUKES.
I.—Gen. Dix’s Letter.
New York, Oct. 7, 1875.
My Dear Sir:
I I hasten. In pursuance of the request contained in a letter my son received from you this morning, to send you a copy of my translation of ** Dies Irae/’ and I add of my own motion my translation of “ Stabat Mater.” They were both privately printed, as you will perceive, but found their way into Judge Mott’s ** Seven Hymns of the Mediaeval Church and other kindred publications.
The first translation was made during our civil war, while I was in command of the Department of Virginia and when I had many weighty matters to divert my time and thoughts from, literary occupation. Although it had been much commended, I was never satisfied with it; and a few months ago I printed privately and now send you a revised rendering of the immortal hymn. The translation of “ Stabat Mater ** was made while I was Minister to France. It was more leisurely prepared, and I see no reason to correct it, though I cannot say that it is what I i should wish it to be.
The stanza of the former quoted by Bayard Taylor Is as follows:
i *' Day of vengeance without morrow, Earth shall end in flame and sorrow,
, As from saint and seer we borrow.”
[ It is this stanza (the first) which has aJ-| ways proved most troublesome to transla-j tors: and It is the one with which I was dissatisfied more than with any other In i my translation when I allowed it to go to press. My dissatisfaction was greatly increased a few years later on finding In one of Thackeray’s novels—I do not at this moment recollect which—a passage somewhat like this:	When a man Is
i cudgeling his brains to find other rhymes ; for sorrow than borrow and morrow, ho ! is nearer the end of his woes than he im-| agines. I felt instinctively that any one I familiar with this passage would, on reading my translation, be conscious at the very commencement of a sense of the ludicrous altogether incompatible with the solemnity of *he subject, I therefore resolved at my earliest leisure to attempt the production of an improved version of the first stanza, and in doing so remodeled several others to make them conform i moro nearly to the original.
Independently of the foregoing objection, it was not quite orthodox to style King David a saint, though he was in his latter days a model of true penitence. Besides. I believe there is a St. David on the calendar, and there is a danger of confounding them, I have succeeded in the new vorsion In preserving the David and Sibyl of the original ** iis nomlnlbus/’ instead of rendering them by the terms Suint and Seer. How successful I have been in the change I have made in the first two lines of the stanza, I am at a loss to determine, and can only say that after an elaborate effort it was the best I could do.
With a pleasant remembrance of our association in Albany,
I am. Dear Sir,
Very truly yours,
JOHN A. DIX.
N. C. Moak, Esq.
II. Air. Blonk's Reply.
Albany, N. Y., Oct, 16, 1875. My Dear Sir:
Many thanks for your courtesy in sending me translations of " Dies Irae ” and " Stabat Mater.” After writing your son I was much mortified at my want of information, for Mr. William D. Morange informed me of the publication of “ Dies Irae,” as indicated fn yours, and another gentleman directed mo to 4* Sacred Lyrics/' an English publication, in which I also found it However, as Ignorance brought me your revision with the reasons for and account of it, I cannot say I regret it.
I shall prize the copies with your autograph letter very much*
A compliment like that by Taylor— from such, a scholar and In connection, with such a work—must be very gratify;*
Ing to you. Should the revision find Its way, as it undoubtedly will eventually, to publicity, ought not a brief statement of your reasons for the change to be published with It, that those who read It may have an explanation of Taylor's seeming misquotation?
Our acquaintance and connection has left 1 many—Indeed, none but—pleasant recollections. Notwithstanding a deal of talk and writing about reform and the punishment of thieves, I believe we still have the honor of having punished the only public thief who has been brought to justice. Indeed the civil suits against Sherwin and the Bank of North America, brought before Phelps's indictment, to recover the money stolen by him have not yet been tried.
When-Phelps's cases reach’ the Court of Appeals so that the revised and ultimate briefs can be incorporated, I shall ; send you copies of the cases and points as mementos of the promptness with which you caused his return and the cordial assistance you ever afforded me in i bringing so notorious an offender to justice.
With sincere regards.
Gov. Dix.	N.	C.	MOAIC
