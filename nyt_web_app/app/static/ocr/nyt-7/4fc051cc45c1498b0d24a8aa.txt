A new study of Millet fs appearing in this country through the Macmillan Company. It is entitled “ Jean-Frangois Millet and the Barbizon School/' by Arthur Tomson. The other artists considered are Jules Duprfe, Narcisse-Virgilio Diaz, Theodore Rousseau, and there is a chapter on " The Influence of the Romantic School *' on these painters. About half of the ; book is given up to Millet, his early days, his life in Paris, his work in Barbizon, his j greatest works, and his last years. In his introduction Mr. Tomson shows that Millet was not such a martyr as some of his biographers have made him out. He speaks of the qualities that the artist possessed which made him love to suffer; but whatever troubles he underwent were of his own making, and, as he writes:
Millet himself was fascinated by the idea of suffering; one can scarcely read any of his letters to Sensier without feeling- that; he knew that it was noble to suffer, and he did suffer; but, notwithstanding, the good things crept into his life, whether he would have them or not, just as they creep somehow or other into the lives of every one of us.
The illustrations are in half-tone and include some of the ‘best-known works of Millet and of other artists discussed.
