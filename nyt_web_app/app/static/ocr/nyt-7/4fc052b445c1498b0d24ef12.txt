The business of travel now demands Its
guide—not a guide book to the placps
visited, but a guide book to the means of i • getting to those places. Such a guide. Tor
example, though not humorous, as Punch years ago published to explain Bradshaw. Miss Tozier Is the author of the new book, which seems to us admirable so far as it goes; and in future editions we hope to find it even more admirable.
Miss-Tozier, it must be said, is a believer in judicious tipping. One gets to be if ne or she travels much. A franc judiciously bestowed on a conductor"; "by bestowing on the head steward a gratuity of a couple of dollars you will find before you are many hours out that it has been money very successfully invested,” are some of her suggestions, and she devotes a page to . the proper persons to tip on board ship. Her chapters on crossing the Atlantic are wise and full of information. She does not advise her readers if they prefer and can get an outside stateroom to take one on the starboard side of the
ship during the Summer; she shouid do so because that side is cooler, if the portholes can be opened.
She gives good advice, too. about landing in England; and her chapters on traveling on the Continent are so full as to be of use to any but the hardened tourist. France, Germany, Holland, Italy, Egypt, are the countries whose transpor-*
tation methods she has studied; evidently there is room for further extension of research on her part. Austria, Russia, the Balkan States, Denmark, Norway and Sweden, and Switzerland must be looked after. Macon. France, used to be reputed to have the best refreshment room on the Continent; Baku was said to have the best hotel east of Paris—it is in Asia, however —and by the Swiss Postal Service you can send anything except a baby or a bicycle. Travelers are entitled to know such points. But within her comparatively limited lines the author gives much valuable Information, and her book supplements the ordinary guide books admirably.
An unusual chapter for the American traveler is on getting back. One paragraph thereof reads: " Unsuspected tourists are subjected to very little annoyance [on landing in America] .and my experience warrants the remark that passengers on the homeward journey worry very unnecessarily about their encounter with the United States Custom House Inspector.'*
In another edition of the book we hope that the running caption on each page will be replaced by a title or subject heading, and that the facsimiles of tickets, time tables, &c., will be enlarged, and not compressed to the size of the type page. They are now almost illegible in some cases.
A new edition of E. C. and T. L.. Sted-man's ** Complete Pocket Guide to Europe," the third, is just out. This little book has proved its value in the past. It is, as its authors say, " a real pocket guide, so compact as to be carried in a man’s coat or hip pocket, or £n a woman's dress pocket or muff." Despite this compactness, its information ts full and detailed, and its maps are clear. It is to the traveler what Bellows's pocket dictionary is to the student of English-French in everything except its printing, which is very bad.
