,	?	; Whether he regard history ",
as a science or anari: ^whether he side with Froude or Freeman: whether. Jio. set. his heart on style or on correctness—those are secondary questions if. he conceive and .keep in mind" the' proper object-of his work. His final and highest task is neither the collection nor the presentation of facts, but their analy-zatlon and? interpretation. It is to he feared that Mr. Bala falls short of'this Ideal, and to such an extent that at times
he appears in the pact of a textbook manufacturer of the old-fashioned school, stringing -together dates and names and events in chronological order, without, reference to their relative importance or their bearing on the evolution of human society, from, primitive. savagery to • the present state of complex civilization.
True, his case is not without illustrious precedents ln these days when the big men are confining themselves to the writing of monographic instead of histories, caring more that minor details be set forth correctly than that the spirit of each age and country and civilization be caught and comprehended. In a smaller way he has been doing much the. same thing that, on a larger scale, has been attempted by the present-day school of co-operative history writing. His work is expressly called ** a political history ~ on the title page. And yet the Cambridge Historical Series, of which It forms a .part, is planned neither for school use nor as a mere work of, reference, but " for the use of all persons anxious to understand the nature of existing political conditions.” Its editor, G. W. Prothero, sounds the true keynote of history at its best when he says in a general preface^ " • The roots of the present lie deep in the past,’ and the real significance of ! contemporary events cannot be grasped ; unless the historical causes which have led to them are known." fTow can the I American citizen of to-day learn any; thing about his own problems and difficulties from this characteristic sample passage, culled almost at random from Mr. Bain’s work:
j An attempt of the Papal legate, Arclm-i bold us—then on a tour through Scandinavia selling indulgences for the building of St. Peter's at Rome—to mediate between the two countries at' a Riksdag held at Arboga in December, 1518, completely failed, the whole assembly declaring that they would never negotiate with a man who had falsely broken solemn compacts which the very heathen respects. At the same meeting Arclm-boldus formally deposed Archbishop Trolle in favor of himself, and induced the chapter of Upsala to petition the Tc-pe to confirm his own election. The legate then set out for Denmark, but was met on the way by the unpleasant intelligence that ICIng Christian had ccmfis- i cated all his property, including; the rich ! harvest of indulgence money he had reaped, and issued an order for his ar- ! rest. The discomforted legate contrived to escape to Llibeck, where he found a < Papal bull against Sten Sture and his adherents nailed up on all the church doors. His own secretary, Didrlk Slagheck, had ! revealed all his doings in Sweden to : Slgbrit, and thereupon entered the King's ! service. Christian himself sent a strong ! accusation against Arcimboldus to the ; Pope, but the legate ultimately emerged triumphant from these complications, and died in high honor as Archbishop of Milan, his native place.
A large part of the facts here brought together toilsomely and faithfully, are, to use legal parlance, “ inconsequent, irrelevant, and immaterial.” They throw little light on the tendencies and forces ! at work in the Scandinavian countries at j the time, and yet the foundation was ! already being laid for the work to be ; done by Gustavus Adolphus and his great successors. The one point that has .significance is passed over without effort to call the reader’s attention to it. That point Is the first appearance on the scene of the cunning Didrik Slagheck. and his manner of ingratiating himself with King Christian, whose favorite and principal instrument he became later. Yet it is only just to say right here that, in the quoted passage, Mr. Bain has been disclosed at hts worst, and that much of his book, particularly those parts relating to the period when Sweden held supremacy In Northern Europe, is written with better eye to what fs salient and what is not. And it may be well, too, to add without delay that Mr. Bain has taken praise- j worthy care and apparently shunned no ! labor in collecting his data. Mistakes are ^ rare, and those that may be found are too j insignificant for exposure. And he tells ! a good story. Those who are familiar ] with Scandinavian history may read many portions of his book with great pleasure;

" And there' Is another point where Mr. : Bain falls short of what, if it be not the. ideal of modem history-writing, ought to be so.; Beading his smooth-flowing pages, ; ■Where judgment is passed in brief , sen-, tences on men and institutions, it is often hjard to- keep in mind that more than; half a century has passed since Auguste Comte propounded his theories as to what history should be. Morals—L e., the mor- ■' als: of the 'day"we live' in, which are but passing/ as were those of other, bygone days—have nothing to do with the recog-nltion and perception of the great events and'great men . of history. If the sclen-^ tUic . method have any meaning at all,. it requires that men and institutions of the past be judged not in the light of present-day civilization, but tn that of their own day; that each factor that, has gone to the making of history be presented and judged in its proper surroundings. Many a man who must be classed as great in his own time and place would to-day be a mere monster and an impossibility. Although pure spirits have seen truth and justice -in all ages, the general recognition of the necessity, both to the welfare . of the individual and of the community, of man's keeping faith with his* feUow-man Is of very recent date, if it may be said to prevail at the present time even. When treachery and cruelty were the * rule and Christ’s, request that man should love his enemies a3 well as his friends was a euphemism to be explained away by the theologians, It was not to be wondered at that even those who ranked foremost committed acts that today would call forth universal condemnation. This failure of Mr. Bain to enter into the spirit of the time is glaringly apparent in his treatment of Christian IX. of Denmark, whom the Swedes for 400 years have designated as Christian the Tyrant. Cruel he was, and full of cunning, but that he was fighting the battle of the weak ones against feudal lords to whom cruelty and cunning were as natural as breathing seems to be for- * gotten by Mr. Bain. Only the later and latest' days have begun to realize how far Christian was in advance of his own time.
| Mr. Bain refers to him as "one of the Scandinavian hiatory, whoso very crime* i are forgotten in the severity of his punishment.” What Mr. Bain does not toll,
: ;u*d probably does not see, is that Chris-j tian's massacre of the Swedish nobles, unpardonable as that bloody deed must j be deemed under all circumstances, was i Dot an attack on the Swedish people as ; much as an effort to cripple the power of a class that was crushing the peasant and the burgher to death. And objective history, leaving ethical considerations aside, records the fact that but for that slaughter the establishment of a strong national monarchy in Sweden would have been postponed for decades if not made impossible. Gustavus Vasa was able to raise his throne and keep himself and hl3 sons on it only because Christian had rid him of hia most dangerous and powerful enemies, those powerful Swedish nobles who had been selling their country to foreign tyrants in order that their own greed of power and of fortune might be satisfied. This 13 no reason why we should approve of 14 the blood-bath at Stockholm,” but it is a fact to be counted with when the significance of Christian in Scandinavian history is to be ascertained.
At hl3 best is Mr. Bain when relating In terse, telling sentences the varying fortunes of the German campaigns of Gustavus Adolphus and the long line of brilliant warriors raised In his school, or the marvelous feats of the tenth Charles of Sweden, who set the world wondering by marching an army of 12,000 men across the frozen surface of tho Great Belt, a distance of more than fifty miles. And while he fails to give an adequate characterisation of such predominant figures as Gustavus Adolphus and Charles the Twelfth—doubly predominant because of tho truth of the historian Geijer's saying that “ the history of Sweden is the history of its Kings he draws a splendid picture of the great Axel Oxenstjerna, the friend and collaborator of Gustavus Adolphus, and one of the greatest statesmen that ever lived.
One highly commendable feature of Mr. Bain’s work is that it follows the history of the three Scandinavian kingdoms right up to the present day, and that his exposition of the internal struggles of Denmark and the union al quarrels between Sweden and Norway is remarkably accurate and lucid. Perhaps his views on the position of the Norwegian Radicals toward Sweden and the common King are a little too harsh in consideration of the inevitable exaggeration of self-consciousness in a nation which, like the Norwegian, has reached to independence after a , long interregnum of subjugation to a for- i eign poT^er following an earlier age of intense and glorious national life. But on the whole his judgments on present-day men and measures are correct and well balanced, and “they may be read with profit by those many outside of the Scan-dlnavian peninsula who are puzzled by what is going on within 1L
