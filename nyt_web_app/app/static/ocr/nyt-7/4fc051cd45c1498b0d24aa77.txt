V^-A CHEERFUL VIEW. '	I
' 2fcw Tort Times Book Review:	I
THE assumption, implied or direct, that I underlies the arguments of your I correspondents who write about the | “ decline of poetry ” is amusing to my I mind, or, rather it would be were not I so much of sadness associated with it I I believe that greater poenjs are being. I written to-day than ever before, and that1: B those ^ poems deal with loftier themes than ever inspired the poets of old. Why those poems are not before the-eye of the public " is another story,” as Kipling would say. I might as well be told that no mighty ideas are abroad to-day as that no great poets are living. The old order is passing,, away, a day of better things is being ushered In, and that the seers of the new i age are with us you may be very sure. I rpfuse to believe in their non-existence ■ simply because their works do not appear ; on publishers’ bookshelves. No great poets living in the dawn of the twentieth
1 century—when the heirs of the ages are struggling to settle for all time whether the watchword to be inscribed on the banners of mankind shall be progress or retrogression!	■
Given a world like this, where a lofty theme, if it be permitted to fill the heart of a man, will endow him with mighty power over thought and language; given an age like this, when man’s horizon is widening on every side; and it cannot be otherwise than that some are living who, , having been bom with the faculty of ' lisping in numbers, are worthy of sitting on seats higher than any whereon poets i have ever sat.
The theme of universal peace inspiring men’s hearts ns it does to-day and failing to find a poet worthy to give it full expression? Impossible. Be very sure that mighty poets are living who can and do chant in matchless lines of a courage far higher than that which leads men to slaughter their brother men under gory banners. It has been truly said that peace hath her victories no less than war; none | the less Is it true that peace hath her poems—far grander than any of the poems of war.
The theme of labor, all-engrossing as it Is to-day—and to-day failing to find utterance in songs of grandeur? Who can believe it? Have not the poets eyes that they can see what is going on around them? Do they not know that the conflict which has been raging in the realm of ideas is being transferred to the plane of human action? Cannot they see monopoly eaten of worms and about to yield up the ghost even upon its very throne? Though all others were blind the poets can see. What, then, shall hold them silent in this the day of so great promise?
' And the grand theme of man—can it be . that it lacks its mighty poet? Man. emerging from the darkness of the caves of ignorance and standing on the thresh- -old of the palace of enlightenment? Man, after having so long wandered about in i-helplessness, seeking salvation, now accepting the great truth that he himself,. alone, can save himself. Man, after striv- ' ing to pierce tho clouds above him in or- v I der to find gods to worship, now learning to descry in his own person a most marvelous and wonder-working godshtp. We ! may be very sure that this mighty theme has its mighty poet; that he is sending out his matchless lines through accredited channels, and that they are being returned to him with the words not available ” attached to them. And we may be *. very sure that this great poet of our.

times is sorrowfully burying his unrivaled lines in obscure type in corners unknown to the popular reviewer. But V7e may be also sure that the precious 21nes are buried in tlie same hope of a glorious resurrection and that coming times shall behold them with delight, and, looking t backward to this day of ours, hail it not merely as an age oC great material development, but also as the age of the Bublimest poetry.
