with New England. “ I " and Percy get no further from Boston than Plymouth; n nd wo tTitnir we have heard of New London, and Portsmouth, and Deerfield, and Castine that are said to be In New
England, and yet are further away from
Boston than Plymouth. Bjit we will not Insist on this point; It Is hypercritical to a Bostonian—If anything can be—in bad taste, certainly. So we repeat: we like the matter of the book and dislike the manner.
NE "W ENGLAND HISTORY.
IHS TORY PELGBIMAGES IN NEW ENGLAND Among Landmarks of Pilgrim and
*	Puritan l>ays, and or the Provincial and Revolutionary Periods. By Edwin M. Bacon. Portraits, maps," nnii illustrations. One volume. Pp. xiv. -475, 8vo. Clotb. Boston: Sliver, Bnrdett & Co.
THERE is much good material In Mr. Bacon's volume and possibly tho book may prove attractive to the public; bnt we confess that It repels us. The travels of Marco Paul to the Spring-Held Arsenal^ for instance; Rollo and his TJncle George, Mr. Barlow and his trained pupils, Harry and Tommy—all these have had their day, and It is past. At least we thought it was. But then cam© Heze-kiah Butterworth's Bodley book, the best of the lot, for the characters were real; and then an estimable gentleman produced " A Landmark Journey Around New York ”—quite in the Sandford and Merton style—and now Mr. Bacon turns out his " Historic Pilgrimages in New England."
“ Last Summer I chanced to meet my old friend Denison. * * * He had with him his son Percy, a high school lad
•	• * an athletic young fellow, manly ’in person and bearing, spirited, observing— a genuine American boy of the best type.” We know the rest; in the books we have read we have heard of Percy before. They—“ I ” and Percy—go around New England, making historic pilgrimages, or rather nineteen historic pilgrimages. The procedure is conventional—or, rather, was conventional in the old nigger minstrel days.
" No, Mister Bones,” says Percy—Mr. Johnson—" I do not fcnow why this spot is called the Cradle of American Liberty. Why is this spot called . the Cradle Sfc American Liberty? ” And Mister Bones Is straightway off at a gallop telling why this spot, &c.
Of course it's all correct, and the material in the book—" embalmed" seems to us about the right word to use—Is good, a is said tbir>t a chief use of ordinary common or garden Egyptian mummies tn recent years was to feed the fires on the locomotives crossing the desert. We incline to think tHat embalmed matter like Mr. Bacon's book might be equally useful. Does a child or an older person—for the book is not so well written as are tho Bodley books—does a child like to have its history given to it by way of Percy anrt his Mr. Bones* or Sandford and Merton and their Mr. Barlow, or Rollo and his Undo George? Would ho not prefer it as straight history? It Is not a bitter dose and needs no chocolato coating. And do his ciders lita* It in this form? It Is not * every one who can make guidebooks into literature, as Mr. Hare did for Mr. Murray; but we have found guidebooks that were interesting. Is this likely to prove attractive, for example, to any one except Mr. Bacon?
“We entered the old State House Bn j Boston] by the south side door. • • ° I
■	worked Percy back to the old Council i Chamber, and wo had our talk of his to r-tmi happening hereabouts. • * • * Not* Percy/ I remarked In taking up the story*” and then wr go on for thirty-six pages,	of	the Boston " snas-
sacre,** the Boston tea party. &eL, even quoting in display type (!) the various handbills of the time.
Mr,	asa goodNew Englander,
to make out that New Bngland was the mainstay of the Revolution. That Idea used to bo drilled into us all; but of late years historians have pointed out ""there were others ** than the New England colonies that had Bomethlng to do with American Independence.' This book not admit anything of tlie sort ; Every one ia New* England was.a- patriot,, ; a pare; tamest-patriot. *	-	"^7	'	7
