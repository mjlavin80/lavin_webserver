PRrNCESS SUKEY. The Story of a TMpreon nnd Her Homan Friends. By Marshall Saunders. 8vo. T’p. 336. New York: Eaton &. Mains. $1.75-
The pigeon which furnishes the title of this hook is a mere excuse for a deal of curious matter about a rich old gentleman who got into the habit of adopting young children. He had, to begin with, a grandson who was all that was left of a large family. He set out to adopt a hoy to he that grandson’s companion, and by mistake got a girl in boy's clothes. It was a very pretty little girl, and its name was Bethany. Bethany had been very poor, and used to go out into the streets and collect bits of coal to give to her benefactor. Then the old man adopted an English boy, the son of an actor, who, as soon as he reached the house, asked for raw meat. It was supposed he ate the meat, but events showed that he fed with It certain owls, pets of his late father. He loyally carried the birds about with him in a box, though he said he hated all owls, and these in particular. This English boy was a model of good manners, and consequently not always perfectly truthful. When the old gentleman was about to send him away into the cold world again he shammed sickness, and so managed to remain.
Again there was a young woman of the slums railed Airy. Airy " wanted to be a lady.” Her notions of the quality of ladyhood were not exact, but the old gentleman undertook to give her lessons. Also, there was a negro boy. He was adopted, too, bvit his sphere w;is the stable, where the coachman inducted him into the reading of Dickons.
Perilnps the hook possesses charms for the youthful mind—one can't feel sure of lliat. At all events, it is intended to convey sermons to them and to their elders dealing with a number of phases of practical Christianity. It might be a tract promulgated jointly by the societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals and
children. There's a kidnapping in it and a rcscue, tho tubbing of a pickaninny, the feeding of pigeons and hungry children.
It is perfectly certain that some ignorant people at least will find " Princess Sukey ” dull.
