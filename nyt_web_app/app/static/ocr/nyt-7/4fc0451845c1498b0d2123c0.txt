Imperceptibly blended with stirring accounts of the wilderness, the fear that often attacks even men bred in its vastness. the howls of the coyotes, the stealthy creeping of the wolf, the haughty indifference of the grizzly, that monarch of the Rockies, is this story of the treach-‘ery of Aim-sa, who was no White Squaw, but only a woman whose love for a man unwortliy Of her made her play her base part of villainy and treachery until she reached his level; or another tall figure, Aim-sa's brother, hooded and draped in mystery, appearing strangely against the twilight background and suddenly disappearing, leaving no trail behind; of Victor Gagnon, the controlling element in the plot, to rob the brothers of their money as well as of their peace of mind; of that battle with drawn knives of which Aim-sa was a witness: of Nick’s crazy lust for blood; of Victor Gagnon’s imminent peril, and la-.tly of Nick’s tragic end locked in the deadly embrace of the white grizzly.
