TEA AND SENTIMENT.
j AT THE SIGN OF THIS FOX. A. Bomanpo. By Barbara, author of " The Garden of & Commuter's Wife,” " people of the Whirlpool.” and “ The Woman Errant.*' 12mo. Pp. 372. New York: The Macmillan Com* pony. $1.50.	•
At the Sign of the Fox tea "was served to carriage people and motor travelers— tea and very superior sandwiches made by a youngr woman who had but lately herself ridden in carriages and motor cars. Her father had gone to smash in Wall Street, ana the girl had shouldered the family cares as many drls have done in reallife. The author admires this particular girl exceedingly—so much is plain.
She tells with a cheerful delight all about her bread-making and other virtuous and domestic proceedings, and she presents her with a love affair of one of the oldest romantic patterns.
FOr the. girl has been an art student in the days of prosperity, and has met In Paris a wonderful English-Dutch-French palnter-man, and quite unawares-fallen In love with him. She comes one day in a new-rich person's picture gallery across a picture he has painted, and lo! it is herself. Whereupon she has thrills on which the author dwells with long-drawn feminine satisfaction.
In the country where tea is served at the Sign of the Fox, (the girl painted the sign from a real live animal. she found starving In the snow and compassionately fed,) the heroine meets another man—a man no longer young; a silent, sad man with a past and ghosts that haunt all his waking hours. He comforts himself ordinarily with solitude, a dog, and a gun,
■	but when the girl comes he forgets his I ghosts and his past under her influence and falls in love.	'
“ Barbara '* has made friends for her other hooks—especially among the women. In this story she insists on feminine minutiae to a point which will leave the masculine reader hopelessly behind. Her girls judge a man by the maker’s name ln his hat and tell boys that “ men,” ** real men," smoke cigars— but not cigarettes. She dwells lovingly upon the Instance of an old lady who, though paralyzed, did her housework in a wheeled chair. She describes with gusto a large and new-rich social function on upper Fifth Avenue, and enthuses over dainty china and napery as well as bull pups, old family dogs of mixed breed* and a tin peddler who, when ho travels about In his wagon in Winter, feeds the birds from his horse's corn box and is otherwise sentimental.
In short, a very feminine sentimental book, but not nearly so good reading as. Bay, the same author’s “ Woman Errant ’*
