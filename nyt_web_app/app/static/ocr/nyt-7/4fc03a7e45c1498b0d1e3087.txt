New York Times Hook Rcvicte:
In 3S7G The Baltimore Sun printed a letter from a correspondent residing in Buckingham County, Va., containing some interesting statements connected with the career of the naval hero of the Revolution, John Paul Jones, and especially explaining1 the addition of the name of Jones to his original name, John Paul. The communication, -which would seem to , corroborate the claim put forth by the Rev. Cyrus T. Brady in a recent magazine article, reads substantially as follows:
It appears that John Paul before permanently settling in Virginia—to which State he had been called by the death of a brother, whose heir he was—moved by the restlessness of hfs old seafaring life, wandered about the country, finally straying to North Carolina. There he became acquainted with two brothers, Willie and Allen Jones. They were both leaders in their day, and wise and honored in their generation. Allen Jones was an orator and silver tongued, Willie Jones the foremost man of liis State, and one of the most remarkable of his time. Educated abroad, a profound and elegant scholar, he was a thinker and actor rather than a speaker. He served as Governor in- 1T76, refusing compensation; was in the Continental Congress of 1780-81, and in fact Oiled every office in the gift of the State.
Willie Jones’s home, The Grove, was near Halifax, and was not only the resort of the cultivated and refined, but waa also the home of the homeless, Mrs. Jones sometimes having twenty orphan girls under her charge. It was here that the young adventurer John Paul was first touched by those gentler and purer influences which changed not only his name but himself from the rough and reckless manner into the polished man of society, who was the companion of Kings and the pet of Parisian salons. The love and reverence awakened in his hitherto untamed nature by the generous kindness of the brothers Jones found expression in his adoption of thoir name.
The truth of this account is not only attested by the descendants of Willie Jones, but by the nephew and representative of Paul Jones, Mr. Loudon of Charleston, S. C. This gentleman, in 1S40, was in Washington awaiting the passage of a bill by Congress awarding him the land claim of his distinguished uncle, which had been allowed by the Executive of Virginia. The Hon- E. W. Hubard, then a member of Congress from Virginia, had in 1844 prepared a report on Virginia land claims, in which the committee indorsed that of Paul Jones. This naturally attracted Mr. Loudon to him, and learning that Mrs. Hubard was a descendant of Willie Jones he repeated to both Cot. Hubard and herself the cause of his uncle's change of name, and added that among his pictures hung a portrait of Allen Jones. Mr. Loudon was a cultivated and intelligent gentleman, but in exceedingly delicate health, and the suspense and anxiety of 'his long waiting on the action of Congress no doubt hastened his death, which occurred before he had re- ceived the reward to which the splendid genius of his uncle had entitled him.
