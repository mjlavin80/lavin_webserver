BOSTON NOTES.
Expurgated Fairy Tales — Gossip About Forthcoming Books.
----------HOSE parents and teachers
who find uuexpurgated fairy tales meat for strong men, rather than milk for babes, wi!’ be pleased with “ The Oak Tree Fairy Book,” a volume prepared by Mr. Clifton Johnson, and illustrated by Mr. Willard Bunte with eleven full-page plates and seventy-five smaller pictures. Mr. Johnson' has carefully pruned away everything savage and painful, even to the very sad passages, and has thus produced a book unobjectionable to sensitive adults. Whether or not children will like it, remains to be seen, but they certainly will not remember its mild villains and gentle boasts as long as they remember Bluebeard or the Chimaera or those wicked bushes in the sea witch’s garden, known to Hans Christian Andersen. Still, the experiment of making such a book is well worth trying, and Messrs. L*it-Ue, Brown & Co. will give It rather more than fair play by making the book uncommonly pretty*

The theory that stories are vicious unless probable does not seem to have j troubled Lhe lafe Bishop Clark when he wrote the fantastic “ John Whopper,” j which Bishop Potter furnishes with an j introduction, saying that the book is eminently characteristic of Its author,
" of his mental processes, and his curious temper of Interrogation/’ and also “ a very striking expression of his wider vision which bound together Boston and China, the inside of the globe and the North Pole." " No one can read it now,” he adds, “ without seeing in It that large interrogation which was forever a note of the Bishop's mind, and that imperishable sympathy with boyhood which made his heart young and his speech playful to the very end.“ The device by “which the author showed thoughtful and scrupulous children that the story was a joke would naturally suggest itself to a Bishop : to whom Easter tables are familiar ground. His story was published in 1S69, and he carefully dates its first important event Tuesday. Feb. 1(* 1S67. Now, St. Valentine's day, Feb. 14, fell on Sunday in 1S69, and consequently Feb- 16 fell on Tuesday, and even very small boys know j that birthdays and holidays come one | day later in the week each successive j year, and the fallacy of making Valen- 1 tine’s Day fall on Sunday only two years previous would bo detected by a large number of readers. It will hardly be j noted now. except by miniature pettifog- I gers, but it was effectual in Its day.

Mr. Burton Stevenson, whoso “ Tbe Young Section Hand *’ will, like “ John | Whopper,” be issued by Messrs. L. C. Page & Co., has told his publishers that most of the incidents in the book are true, and were related to him by an old j railroad *r>n n_ Undoubtedly they are Quite j true, then. One would as soon doubt an old sailor as an old railroad man, and they will certainly be lively.	:

Mr. George S. Wassnrs new book. “ The Green Shay," is the story of one of ! those decaying villages on tlie Maine coast which the decline of the fishing industry has left to perish slowly, deserted by the young and daring, perfectly
■	conscious of its hopeless condition, but making no effort to retrieve it- All Mr. Wassin’s sympathy for the fishermen can, not duQ his apprehension of the humor of their speech and the auaintness of their dialect, and the story will be found very amusing. It will be published by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co.
Miss Carolyn Wells win appear on the list of one more Boston publisher In the Autumn, having chosen tho W. A. Wilde Company to issue “ The Dorrance Domain," a lively story of a family of children whose riotous mischief sorely tried the grandmother to whose care they were intrusted until the " Dorrance Domain " opened a way of escape, to the great content of every one. The hook will be illustrated by Mr. William F. Stecher, and is intended for young girls.
Miss Amy E- Blanchard, a long-established favorite with this class of readers, has gone farther South this year, and bTug come nearer -to tlie present time for her subject thun in any former season. The heroines are two sisters, who, with their brother, go to Texas not long after its annexation to the United States. When war Is declared the brother and some of his friends enlist In the Texas Rangers, of whom tbe reader sees something, but the novelty of the tala lies In the life of the girls, who support themselves, protected by their neighbors, until-the war ends In their part of the country. Tbe author has endeavored to describe .something of the simple life of tiis Mexican poor,, and also to show what manner of men the Texas Hangars were. They figured in many stories written in
the years following the war, until displaced by fugitive slave stories and tales of hapless ladles who suddenly discovered tliat they were mulatto slaves, and since that clay they have been negleetcd. Miss Biant'hard calls her book “ A Frontier Knight."
Messrs. L. C. Paprc Co. are preparing the- “ ReaJ iind Romantic Russia ” of Alexandre £)um:Ls for an illustrated holiday book* aji<l that remark;uble work will surprise those who for the first time learn something of what their fathers and grandfathers were taught. Dumas saw aristocratic and literary Russia at its best, for both Court and nobility were disposed to lionize him. but he caught some glimpses of lower life, which ended iwth the abolition of serf-holding. The Lrajiilation Is by Mikael Gortshakov.
