There is no single moral instruction method. According to the individual genius of the teacher, the vehicle may be biography, natural history, or a number of varied illustrations. * * * The teacher should extol the good, and show Its reasonableness and its beauty rather than warn against evil and insist on its hatefulness. In every case the teaching should be concrete, and short poems, Quotations, ' and proverbs should with advantage be comizutted to memory. * * * The aim of moral instruction is to form the character of the child. * * * The teacher is expected to take a broad and organic view of life, and at every opportunity te inculcate a love of inanimate nature, of ~
plant and animal life, of science, and of the beautiful. * * * The child should be led to feel that the moral ideal applies to feelings and thoughts as much as to outward conduct.
