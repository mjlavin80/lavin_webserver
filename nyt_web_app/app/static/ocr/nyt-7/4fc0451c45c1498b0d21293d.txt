WILD ORCHIDS.
! A Book Identifying the Varieties found j in Hastern North America and Describing “Their Social Relations and Lives.
Written for The New YOuk Times book Review by
MABEL OSGOOD WRIGHT.
T last, after many years of u*aiting, (for the last authoritative guide to the orchids of New England, written by ■ Henry Baldwin, was issued as long: ago as 1SS4.) we have a book by the aid of which not only may the native orchids of Eastern North America be identified, but one which tells in simple language the fairylike tale of their social relations and lives. For many years before the death of William Hamilton Gibson he had
in mind the writing’ of a book upon this most uniq.ue tribe among Northeastern American flora, and his 8 researches took the form of lectures whicli. are remembered with enthusiasm alike for their profundity of research, delicate imagery, and the wonderful mechanical models by which the various processes of fertilization were illustrated.
At this time Mr. Gibson made a collection of the living plants and in process of his investigations made sketches and drawings of the complete genera, the scope extending from the Atlantic to the one hundred and second meridian, and north from South Virginia and Kentucky to Northern Labrador and Manitoba.	*
Some were finished and would doubtless have soon appeared in the series of magazine articles that were to have formed the nucleus of the book. Others were but the slightest of pencil sketches, and though entirely lacking in the finish without loss of atmosphere that characterized Gibson’s work, still present a valuable accuracy of detail. But, to our endless loss in one sense, here the scheme was ended by the death of the artist, and it is from this portfolio of sketches and a few odd notes of Gibson’s added to her own researches that Mrs. Jelliffe has achieved the satisfactory and intelligible volume under consideration. By a singular lack of accord between printer and cover maker Gibson’s name alone is placed upon the binding, being an injustice « to both author and illustrator. For with the name of Gibson we associate a sumptuous volume, where every Illustration Is either a picture having atmosphere and value, or else a decoration, and the text scientific fact and poetic imagery blended to form literature. To those looking for these qualities the unpretentious volume of little more than 150 pages will come as a distinct disappointment.
On the other hand, the student is eager to identify these flowers, that have so long remained things of mystery because seemingly no one possessed of the knowledge had the courage to simplify their classification and put the key within roach of the eager multitude. This Mrs. Jelliffe has done, and keeping well clear of the temptation to rhapsodize or run hither and thither from the straight path of identification and classification into the poetic and aesthetic side of the subject, whioh so often turns a would-be practical manual into a confusing hybrid that Is neither fishT fjpsh. nor fowl, so to speak, her little book is admirably suited to be one of the few volumes that find their way into the satchel of the outdoor man and woman, whether advanced student or groping amateur.
The plan of the book is simple and lucid. The preface and introduction of a dozen or more pages sum up the present condition of orchid literature, and without more ado the illustrated key to the genera of orchids fs presented. It would be well for every one interested in botany, but who learned his , code of nomenclature ten or more years back, to read the introduction carefully in respect to what it says in regard to the change of technical names:
The scarcity of books on the subject-uf our native orchids is due to the fact that no one had as yet observed more than a few of them. When Darwin published his book on the cross-fertilization of orchids, Asa Gray, his American contemporary, made many observations confirming Darwin. Other botanists loved the orchids, and described their habitat, and even wrote poems about them; but no one

' nas yet done for all our native orchids what William Hamilton Gibson started to do.
- He had collected and sketched nearly , all the North American species that he could find east of the Mississippi and , north of the Carolinas. Then he settled down patiently to watch by night these curiously constructed flowers that are So marvelously adapted to some particular insect visitor. Ilis written observations were only begun at the time of his death, but h.s data for observation were ready to be given to his readers.
Thus modestly Mrs. Jeliffe gives ample credit as to the source of inspiration of her book. The text to, accompany the illustrations has been plainly set forth in simple English from Mr. Gibson’s notes, from the undescriptive statistics of manuals of botany, and from an intimate acquaintance of wild orchids themselves.
The orchids should no longer be a 'mere Latin-named family of plants to ' squeeze to death in a press and to mount in a withered array in a herbarium, but a group of individuals living in a social relation to the insect world and worth}* of the most intimate acquaintance and observation.
To the older botanists, who are accustomed to call the rattlesnake plan' tain “ Goodyera " and the lady’s tresses “ Spiranthes," it may seem like an innovation to use the names Feranium and Gyrostachys. Bvit the latter as well as all the scientific names here appended to the popular titles are the old true names.
Botanists in Europe decided in 1807, at the Paris Botanical Congress, to let the original name of the genus stand. The date to which they decided to go back was the year of the publication of Linnaeus’s 14 Genera Plantarum,” 1753. Since that date there has arisen great confusion by giving new names in America, as well as all over the world, to plants that were'already known in Europe, or by making a new genus out of some species that should have been put In a well-established genus, rt had come to pass that some plants had from ten to twenty different names, and again several plants had the same name.
NAMES OF ORCHIDS.
The Botanical Club, in connection with the American Association for the Advancement of Science, meeting in Rochester, N. Y\, in 1892, decided to adopt the transcontinental nomenclature devised at the Paris Congress, and this ruling was made practical and permanent by the publication of Britton and Brown’s “ Illustrated Flora of the Northern States and Canada ” in 1S96, which put the 4,000 plants listed in accord with the accepted nomenclature.
In the introduction the distinction between the orchid as interpreted by the gorgeous flowers of luxury, as the term suggests, the exotic air-feeding plant, and our own sometimes beautiful but more frequently merely Interesting earth-growing species, both in kinship and difference, Is clearly portrayed, and the various flower metamorphoses form one of the most interesting of nat* lire’s true fairy tales.
To quote Mr. Gibson’s own words:
*' From the simplest and regular type of flowers, as in the buttercup, we pass on to more and more involved and un symmetrical forms, as the columbine, monkshood, larkspur, *	*	*	&c.,
and thus finally to the most highly
■	specialized or Involved form of alt, as seen in the orchid, the multifarious, multiversant orchid, the beautiful orchid. the ugly orchid, the orchid, the graceful, homely, grotesque, uncanny, mimetic, and until the year 1ST>!) the absolutely noncommittal and inexplicable flower; the blossom which had : waited through the ages for Darwin, its chosen interpreter, ere she yielded her secret to humanity."
BIOGRAPHIES OP ORCHIDS.
. Interest aroused and curiosity piqued, we turn to the key of the seventeenth genera, a pictorial key with explanatory text, lucid and complete. This key alone to the amateur botanist is worth the little money asked for the book, for with its.aid are not only the orchids of wood and field, but of more complex botanies, made plain. To this key the frontispiece, wherein the component parts of the orchid, its charac-teristlc parts, are distinctly drawn and named, is a wise introduction.
Then follow the separate biographies,
. each with Its Illustration, sometimes the whole spray or plant, and sometimes botanical section to illustrate special points, but accurate and pertinent in every stroke.
-	Grateful as we are for this invaluable . collection of pictures, the manner of their reproduction makes one sigh for the well-nigh lost art of the wood engraver, where the sympathy of the hand behind the tool was so much more fitted to interpret and perpetuate the delicate work of Gibson than the purely mechanical processes of to-day. Yet in this very mechanism lies the possibility of the profuse illustration of popular books, so that we should be grateful,
after all, for what is more than the " half loaf.”
The biographies themselves are pleasant, graceful sketches, none the worse for their brevity; one does not care to be hindered by involved disruptions and mazes of quotations while on the hot trail of an unknown species, and more than the huntsman is appreciative of a beautiful landscape while the whirring wings of the rising cover delight his ears—for this entirely delightful book Is what its author intended it to be, a straightforward guide to our native orchids in their haunts, and, like all good guides, it knows what to say and what to leave to the imagination.
Though midsummer is upon us, with Its fierce heat, and the delicate blossoms of Spring, the showy orchis, cyp-repedias, arethusa, pogonla, and calop-ogon (I should say Iimodorum) exist only ln their pods of dustlike seeds, the rattlesnake plantain, the beautiful fringed orchises, and the crystal-white wands of ladies’ tresses, that the children call " Maypoles,’* are still to be sought In their mysterious haunts. Near by is an upland marsh meadow that is ablaze every August with thousands of spikes of the gorgeous orange orchis. To those who do not know the native orchid tn any of Its many forms this book should win the gratitude due wholesome novelty, while those who do know must feel £rlad at the successful exploiting of these flowers in a way to win them a wider circle of new friends.
