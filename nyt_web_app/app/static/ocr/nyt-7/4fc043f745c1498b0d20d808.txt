BYRON GLORIFILD.
Dr. Brandes’s Piaise c£ His Natualism in the Fourth Volume of His “ Main Cunents of Nineteenth Century Literature.”*
Written for The New York Times Book Review by
H- W. BOYNTON.
NGL.ISH and American readers who have been interested in the earlier volumes of Dr. Brandes's extensive work on nineteenth century literature will approach with some concern the first and only volume of the series which deals with English writers. Here is a critic whose intimate acquaintance with the modern literatures of England, France, and Germany, and whose fortunate detachment of race and of temperament have given him qualifications almost unique for the exercise of the comparative function. That three of his six volumes should deal with French letters, and two with German, Is, therefore, not a sign of racial prejudice; we have here a reasonable expression of opinion on the part of an unbiased observer. According to his judgment the only main current of European letters which has an Anglo-Saxon origin issues from that extraordinary poetical activity which marked the first two decades of the nineteenth century. Naturalism is the quality which seems to him to be the common possession of all English poets of that period, from Wordsworth to Byron, and from Landor to Moore. Unluckily, It is not perfectly clear at the outset what is meant here by *' naturalism."' As Sir Leslie Stephen was wont to remark, there is no word more misleading than Nature. Prof. Brandes brings us nearest to a definition in one of his closing chapters, where he speaks of Byron as “ a pronounced Naturalist— which means that ha preferred the forest to the garden, the unsophisticated to the civilized human being, the original to the acquired language of passion—” Here the word nature is given a sufficiently broad meaning, but In not a few earlier passages it is used In the mildest of popular senses: “ The English poets, one and all, are observers, lovers, worshippers of nature. Wordsworth, who loves to parade his propensities as ideas, inscribes the word nature on his banners, and paints pictures, grand in spite of their minute detail, of the hills, the lakes, the rivers, and the rustic population of the North of England *	* Vf A botanist might get informa-
tion from Scott's descriptions of nature; Keats and Moore dwell in their several ways upon the sensuous charms of nature. And these specific assertions introduce a generalization in which naturalism and realism are used as synonyms. A realism which concerned Itself prominently though not solely with the phenomena of external nature; this would appear to be the naturalism which the critic says ** is so powerful In England that it permeates Coleridge's romantic supernaturalism, Wordsworth’s Anglican orthodoxy, Shelley's atheistical spiritualism, Byron's revolutionary liberalism, and Scott’s interest in the past." Later, in tho fifth chapter, apropos of Wordsworth's sonnet, “The world is too much with us," this is the comment:
These are remarkable words to have come from Wordsworth’s pen—remarkable, because they show what all sincere naturalism really is, let It be decked with as many theistic trappings as it will. In its inmost essence it is akin to the old Greek conception of nature, and antagonistic to all the official creeds of modern days; it Is vitally impregnated with the pantheism which reappears in this century as the dominant element in the feeling fop nature in every literature. Now we come upon it as in the form of the human being’s self-forget-i ful and’ half-Unconscious amalgamation with nature, as a single tone in the great harmony of the universe.

As for Prof. Brandes’n specific judgments of poets and of poems which are chosen for individual mention, they do not always commend themselves as agreeing with the opinion which English critics have given authority, Wordsworth’s *' She was a phantom of delight” is introduced, and, so far as its poetic quality is concerned, dismissed as “ the following little poera.” Of “ CJxristabel,” after speaking of the high place which it holds in the estimation of English judges, the remark is that *' Danish critics, thoroughly initiated into the mysteries of this style by Tieck and the brothers Schlegel, and by their own poet Ingemann, cannot possibly attach

4* The 'Ancient Mariner” Is not a ^resit poem because it lacks " a poetic central idea”; though it is better than rcost German contemporary efforts in that kind.
On the other hand, our foreign critic greatly overvalues the poetry of Campbell, Moore, and Scott. He seriously regards the “Irish Melodies” as 'wonderful poems, and asserts that ** the mysticism increases the poetic effect ” of such doggerel ditties as that which begins:
She is far from the land where her young hero sleeps,
And lovers around her are sighing.
But coldly she turns from their gaze, and weeps, _
For her heart in his grave is lying.
The fact that “ she ” Is Ireland and “ he " is Robert Emmet, can now hardly alter our 'sense of the paltriness of this stuff* <®nsidered as poetry.
Yet \vhc“i upon the basis of such occasion;! 1 lapses we are about to conclude that Prof. Brandes lacks fineness of ear, for English poetry at least, we are sure to come upon some such passage as this about Coleridge:
The few poems which he wrote in the course of a comparatively long life are distinguished by the exquisite melodiousness of their language; their harmonies are not only delicate and Insinuating, like Shelley’s, but contrapuntally constructed and rich; they have a peculiar, ponderous sweetness; each line has the taste and weight of a drop of honey.
No, there Is evidently " nothing the matter” with the critic's ear; our disagreements with him must be based, not upon his ignorance of poetical form, but upon his comparative indifference to it. By way of his preoccupation with the intellectual or moral content of poetry, with its representative quality or comparative value, he mounts now and then to strange climaxes of enthusiasm.
A BRIEF FOR BYROX.
SO BYRON Is to him—for his present purpose at least, the study of English naturalism—by far the most important English Doet of his period. Indeed, this considerable volume might be called not unfairly if not quite adequately, a brief for Byron. From the first the critical finger seems to be pointing toward the greatly idolized and greatly despised author of “ Don Juan ” as the pre-eminent poetical figure of his day. His defects are not blinked, but they are not suffered to afford* material for contempt. His defects of conduct even give occasion for for some vigorous observations upon the English clergy, the English Philistine, and the unco’ guid of whatever sect, rank, or race. For the rest, little or no attempt Is made to estimate Byron’s poetical product according to any absolute standard; what he was to his own, time is the question at Issue. This is a question which Prof. Brandes is able to answer with no little enthusiasm and With no less explicitness. Byron as a European influence leaves his English contemporaries, it seems, hardly a leg to stand on:
In the intellectual life of Russia and Poland, of Spain and Italy, of France and Germany, the seeds which he had strewn broadcast with such a lavish hand fructified—from the dragons* teeth sprang armed men. The Slavonic nations, who were groaning: under tyrannical rule, who were by nature Inclined to be melancholy, and in whom their history had developed rebellious instincts, seized on his poetry with avidity; * * * The Spanish and Italian war-poets took up his war cry; in Spain the Myrtle Society was formed; in Italy wan most plainly manifest in the writing of Giovanni Berchet, but hardly less po in those of Leopardi and Giusti. H is death made an extraordinary impression in France. * * * Hugo’s Les Orient ales was not a flight straight to the East, like the Oriental poems of Germany; his way lay through Greece, and he hud much to say of the heroes of the war of liberation. Delavigne devoted ii beautiful poem to Byron; Lamartine added a last canto to V Childe Hnrolil":—M£rim£e allowed himself to be i-i.riu-'nced by Byron's occasional si irit of savagery: Alfred de Musset attempted to take up the mantle which had fallen from the shoulders of the great poet, and even Lamennais began to employ a style in which many of the words and expressions recalled the language of Byron’s sallies.
In Germany English poetry was much less generally known; yet even there “ poets like Wilhelm Muller and Alfred Meissner wrote beautiful verse in honor of Byron, and there were other writers who were still more deeply' moved by Byron’s poetry—men of Jewish extraction, whose feelings were those of the exiled and excommunicated — chief among them Borne and Heine. Heine's
best poetry, notably ' Deutschland; eln-' Wintermarchen,’ Is a continuation of Byron's work. French romanticism and German liberalism are both direct descendants of Byron's naturalism.” Exile, revolt, reaction, and an ever-modifying conception of man’s relation to external nature; these have seemed to the eminent Danish critic to be the chief sources of modern European literature, and what name would be. so naturally chosen as Byron's to stand, for all these causes and impulses? Where, moreover, are they so well expressed, is the whole Byronic view of life so well expressed, as in “ Don Juan,” which Prof. Brandes rates above j all other poems of that generation? There we have uttered without stint that spirit of independence which, to be effectively uttered at the moment, had 1 to be stamped, by way of offset to sentimentalism and “ gigmanity,” with a superficial cynicism, and, as it now i seems, a rather cheap and sensation-1 al waiver' of the social decencies. In this day Byron would not have succeeded in shocking any one; he would have waked on that famous occasion not to find himself famous, but to find himself summarily relegated to the ranks of those who rather obscurely protest against and defy conventions of which, short of worship, the world has a tolerably good opinion.
*.•
EPIC OF THE SOPHOMORE.
DON JUAN ” remains, at its face value, the epic of the cad and the sophomore; it swaggers and prates about matters which good-breeding is ready to ignore or to talk of without affectation or effrontery. It does really represent the whole of Byron—one part social cynic, one part intellectual satirist, two parts lover of external nature, two parts lover of rational freedom, four parts lover of voluptuous license. This is a formula no longer much held to; not because we are a
*
generation of prigs, but because we are in some senses a generation of adults. Debauchery may take an innocent pride in shocking prudes and parsons, but the discovery that in the eye3 of well-bred persons it is simply crude and inane Is a sobering cause to your debauchee, real or assumed. Prof. Brandes, where Byron is concerned, makes no intelligible distinction between true freedom and mere license; or, indeed, between absolute and relative achievement in poetry. He admits him a poseur, but for the rest makes him out to have been all nobility. He considers him an abused husband, and warmly indorses Macaulay’s opinion that Byron was a mere scapegoat, and that his exile was the result of one of those absurd fits of morality to which the British public has always been so liable. So, we are given to understand, this noble lord, no longer in his youth, was driven to the excesses, the cynicism, which were to
-be'so defiantly'^advertised in-'Don'Juan. He goes to Venice, and engages a gondola, a box at the theatre, and a mistress. He takes care that the English public shall be regularly Informed of the proceedings which follow. It Is all very much in the runaway, schoolboy style. * * * From these belated pranks Byron is rescued by “ his one perfect ; and fully returned attachment ” for the young Countess GuicclolL ! This connection, we are assured by Prof. Brandes, brought out all that was j best in Byron’s character and genius;
1 I can think of nothing more offensively Byronic than this brief passage from a ; letter of the period; “If anything happens to my present Amlca, I have done i with the passion forever—it Is my last ! love. As to libertinism, I have sickened | myself of that, as was natural the way
■	I went on, and I have at least derived that advantage from vice, to love In the best sense of the word.” Hardly among Cockney utterances could one find anything less marked by taste, by common sense, by right feeling of any kind.
! *' My present Arnica,” ” the way I went on,” ” that advantage from vice, love ”
I —the phrases condemn' themselves and i their author, yet our critic quotes them ; quite soberly.
Byron loved liberty and fought for Greece; he also, as Prof. Brandes thinks it not worth while to conceal, expected the crown of Greece as reward for his services. He does not seem, in the retrospect, to have been one of the I world’s really great men.
;	BYRON'S MIGHTY VOICE.
HAT he was one of the effective men of his day we do not doubt; Dr. Brandes’s explanation of his effectiveness constitutes the somewhat tropical conclusion of the present vol! ume, which we must auote in full:
Naturalism as an ’ntellectual tendency in England maKes Its appearance In Wordsworth in the form of love of all the external phenomena of nature, a habit of storing up natural impressions, and piety toward animals, children, country people, and the poor ln spirit. With him as its representative, it strays for a moment into a blind alley, that of uninspired imitation of nature. In Coleridge, and even more in Southey, it approaches the German romanticism of the day, follows it into the realm of legend and superstition, but avoids its worst excesses by treating romantic themes in a naturalistic manner and keeping an open eye cfti land and sea and all the elements of reality. In Scott naturalism occupies itself with the
■	character and history of a whole na-i tion, and in vivid colors paints man as
the son of a race and a period; in Keats it takes possession of the whole world of the senses and reposes for a moment on the neutral ground between contemplation of nature and the proclamation of a gospel of nature and of i natural rights. In Moore It becomes erotic** and espouses liberalism in politics; the sight of the sufferings of his native island drives this poet Into the ranks of the lovers of liberty, intellec-; tual and political. In Campbell It be-I comes eulogy of England as Queen of

the Sea and expression of English views. In Landor it' takes the shape of pagan humanism, of too repellent and proud a character to win the suffrage of Europe. It Is transformed ln Shelley into a soulful love of nature and a poetic radicalism, which have at their command poetic gifts of the very highest order; but the incorporeal universality of Shelley’s naturalism, in combination with the circumstance that he is much too far ahead of his age, and with his early death, causes his song to die away unheard, Europe never learning what a poet she possesses and loses.	.	.
Then, • like Achilles arising In his wrath after he has burned the body of Patroclus, Byron, after Shelley’s death, arises and lifts up his mighty voice. European poetry was flowing on like a sluggish smooth river; those who walked along Its banks found little for the eye to rest on. All at once, as a continuation of the stream, appeared this poetry, under which the ground so often gave' way that it precipitated 'Itself In cataracts from one level to another—and the eyes of all inevitably turn to that part of the river where its stream becomes a waterfall. In Byron’s poetry the river boiled and foamed, and the roar of its waters made music that mounted up to heaven. In its seething fury it foamed whirlpools, tore Itself and whatever came in its way, and in the end undermined the very rocks. But, “ in the midst of the infernal surge,” sat such an Iris as the poet himself has described in “ Childe Harold ”—a glorious rainbow, the emblem of freedom and peace—invisible to many, but clearly seen by all who, with the sun above them in the sky, place themselves in the right position.
It presaged better days for Europe.
