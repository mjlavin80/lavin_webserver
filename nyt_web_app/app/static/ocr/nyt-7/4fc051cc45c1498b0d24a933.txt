A new volume on heredity Is about to appear tn this country from the pen of Q. Archda.ll Reid, M. B., P. R. S. E., author of " The Evolution of Man/’ " Alcoholism: A Study in Heiedlty/’ &c., through E. P. Dutton & Co. It ts entitled, " The Principles of Heredity. With Some Applications,” and follows somewhat on the lines of the author's book on “ The Evolution of Man.’’
The evidence bearing on heredity, afforded by disease, which has hardly been touched, is utilized largely in this present work. The author writes:
I cannot help thinking tha* most students of heredity-are not aware of the value of this evidence from disease. I believe that If it had been considered In conjunction with the facts of specific, adaptation to the environment a good deal of controversy concerning the transmission of acquirements and tho origin of variations would not have occurred, or at any rate would not have lasted as long as It has done. So far as I am able to judge, it establishes conclusively the facts (1) that parental acquirements are never transmitted to the offspring, and
(2)	that variations are rarely caused by the direct action of the environment on the germ cells—so rarely that racial change is never due, directly or indirectly, to this cause. The great mass of variations have another origin which I have endeavored to elucidate. The function of bi-parental reproduction appears to me manifest It Is very important, but it has nothing to do with tbe causation of progressive variations.
His chapter on ** Recapitulation/* he adds, is the ** crux '* of tho whole book. In it he has " sought to re-establish on a firm basis the doctrine that the development^ of the individual ts a blurred recapitulation of the life history of the race. * * * It follows * • • that the child recapitulates the development footsteps of the parent. Unless it were true, there could be no development of the individual, and no evolution of the race.” The volume Is addressed particularly to medical men. The author has drawn his material mainly from medical sources. He has made no attempt to write for the student; but his endeavor has been to supply a systematic ^udy of heredity for the educated doctor. Nevertheless, the book may be of interest to the " professional ** biologist and tho ** general reader.’* It is fully supplied with notes, in which Mr. Reid explains certain passages or indicates his authority.
