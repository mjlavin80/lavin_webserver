" A Handbook to Agra and the Taj, Sikandra, Fatehpur-Sikri, and the Neighborhood." (Longmans, Gre<m &"Co,,) is the work of K. B. Ha veil, A. R.( Principal of the Government School of Art and Fellow of Calcutta University. The volume, which Is of modest size, with text in large print and good illustrations from photographs, professes merely '* to assist those who visit or have visited Agra to an intelligent understanding of one of the greatest epochs of Indian Art.*' To attain this end, the author has provided first a “ historical introduction "
*
setting forth briefly but clearly (and sufficiently for the purpose) something of the history of the great moguls who ruled at Agra, of Akbar, called the Great, who was Queen Elizabeth's contemporary; of Akbar's famous son Jahangir, and that . one’s yet more famous Sultana, the beautiful Nur Mahal, of Shah Jahan, of Aur-ar.gzib and tho rest.
Then comes the description of the monuments of these potentates, the fort at Agra, the great mosque and the magnificent palaces and public buildings of Fatehpur-Sikri, which Akbar builded, as likewise the Jahangiri Mahal, though the last is named after his son. Shah Jahan It was who caused to be built the Taj Mahal as a tomb and memorial of his favorite Sultana called Mumtaz Mahal, or Crown of the Palace. The Taj Is by most authorities esteemed the very climax of Indan art, and the present author makes an excellent point by comparing it rather with the Venus de Milo than, say, the Parthenon. For it was intended as the expression in architecture of the Ideal -of a noble and beloved woman—the Mogul being forbid by his Mohammedan religion the making of images of the human form* On the whole, the book appears to be at least as good as most 'books of its kind and better than many.
It contains only 136 paces and has an index and conspicuous section heads.
