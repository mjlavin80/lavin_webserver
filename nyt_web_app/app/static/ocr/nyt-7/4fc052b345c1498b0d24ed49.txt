UE*1 —W	OME months ago we had occa-
	sion to^-comment on Volume
	I. Of the Chancellor-Hewes
	history. This second volume
	is like unto the first It is _ 0
herently vicious plan, the evils of which it _is not necessary to point out. As to the execution of this volume, the v/'-rk of Mr Hewes remains slightly superior to that of Mr. Chancellor. Fine writing everywhere abounds. ‘ The new great market turned the Dark Continent into a blood-red bedlam of cruelty, greed, and terror," (P.	14.)
matches ** cat&elysmal terror," (P. 14,) and the " furious enthusiasm of tlie terrible Frederick,” (P. 503.)
Humane sentiments recur from time to time; negro is always spelled wfift & capital N. In connection with this race it Is interesting to learn that ** these dangerous children of the Old World, like wild animals, themselves shrank fVom bringing offspring into a life of captivity," (P. 10.) The narrative Is garnisheil'wlth digressions of an anthropological, ethnological, and ethical nature. The racial inferiority of Frenchmen and Spaniards is proclaimed, and ** New France was caught tn the vicious circle of superstition, tyranny, stagnation, corruption," (P. 252.) Prominent historical characters are liberally decked out with tags. James Otig is an ** inspired madman," (P. 435.) Gov. Francis Bernard is a " contentious
miser," (P. 207.) Voltaire Is the '* paragon of pamphleteers,” (P. 509.)
In short, the style of Messrs. Chancellor and Hewos grows monotonous and fatiguing. They occasionally get hopelessly entangled in the meshes of inaccuracy and irrelevancy. Few worse sentences have probably ever been written, from either the historical or the literary point of view, than the following: " The purpose of the Townshend Acts, which were passed at a time when William Pitt waa dying of nervous prostration, (and but a few months before that event Townstiend himself died or a disease of long standing,) was to secure a regular revenue not, as in the case of the Stamp Act, for transmission to England, but to support the administration of justice and the execution of all laws." (P. 103.) The Townshend Acts were passed 1767 and William Pitt died in 1778. It would be, by the way, a good idea for the authors to look up the date of Pitt's death. On Page 502 we read that, during the Seven Years' War, which ended in 17G3, " the deaths of Pitt of England and of Elizabeth and Peter III. of Russia, together with the accession of Catherine II. to tlie throne of that chaotic empire, changed the face of International affairs."
Historical errors are extremely common. To use a phrase which we constantly meet in this book, our enumeration of these will be “ representative, not exhaustive." " In 1726 George II. come to the throne," (P. 8G.) "The Connecticut colony was a federation of towns," (P. 59.) ** In 17G0 such cities as London, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, and Leeds had no members of Parliament to represent them In any sense at all,” (P. 167.) We may doubt if ** Africa waa set back a thousand years •	*	* that the man
stealers and the slave breeders might have the * goods ’ of European civilization." (P. 14.) The student of English history will be concerned to read that W^hig of the Whigs "Robert Walpole” waa a
stout Tory." (P. 500.)
Statements ln the text are never backed up by references to authorities, and no student or reader is justified in taking what he sees in this book as the truth, without further verification. At the end of the volume about 110 authorities aro cited at large, but volume and page references are never given. The collection includes works good, bad, and indifferent, and shows a surprising lack of discrimination on tlie part of the collectors. Fisher, the author of the " True History of the American Revolution " elbows Trevelyan, and such well-known works as Tyler’s ** Literary History of the Revolution '* and Lecky’s " History of England in the Eighteenth Century " are ignored. Con1 sidcred as a serious bibliography, the references are without any value.
The index is constructed along original lines. It includes '* African Setback," " Fighting ' Puffs of Smoke,’ " (sic,) *• Lamps of Industry," &c. But one consults it in vain for the Stamp Act Con-
