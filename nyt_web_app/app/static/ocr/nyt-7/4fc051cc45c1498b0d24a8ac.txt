. A writer in a recent number of The Quarterly Review, In tihe course of a' review of the works and letters of Lord Byron, recently republished by a well-known London firm,- makes the charge of* lack of originality and plagiarism against the celebrated-poet. His plots, this critic .avers, are often borrowed frpm the writings of his many . predecessors and associates, while many of his expressions and modt striking and supposedly original phrases and poetical flourishes were often transplanted wholly from somebody else's writings into his own without a word of acknowledgment as to the source whence they came., . And so he says—Page 45G— his (Byrpn’sj. claim to originality can only be conceded ** with much modification in its important aspects.” Similar charges Were recently made against one : of our popular American story writers who. in one of his recent works, has introduced several descriptive passages . of several well-known episodes in our history which .he borrowed from authentic contemporary sources without giving duo credit to them. There seems to be, in many minds, a pitiful misunderstanding as to the precise meanings of the terms of ** orfginallty ** and *■ constructive " or ** creative genius," and what they really imply. The writer, even one who is possessed of a bona fide constructive talent, is not expected to “ create " his materials, in addition to the task of molding them together into a comprehensive and adhesive story or drama, any more than the mason—whose work, no one will deny, is “ constructive "—is expected to make his own brick, quarry his own stone, ^prepare his own lath and mortar, and manufacture his own iron and glass and various other of the incongruous materials which, by his work, become a noble and stately edifice. No one will date tb assert that Raphael, Titian, and Michael Angelo were not ^creative geniuses. Still they did not invent their themes, but went to history and mythology and the ancient fables and legends to find their various inspirations.
Tbe feelings which agitate the human heart, oppress or gladden it, are few, and were the same in the days -when a solitary couple inhabited tho whole world as they are now In the twentieth century. Love and hatred, passion and ambition, have ever directed our conduct, retarded or facilitated our movements. The only difference Is as to the intensity of these impulses possessed "by an age or individual. So that accordingly these* passions, and the heart which they inhabit, have forever been the scenes of the author s ardent study and exploitation, and where he oftentimes found real Inspiration.
Every writer, from the days of Homer to Shakespeare, .and from Aeschylus to By^on and Goethe, has plowed up the human heart and sown upon it his variety of seed, but no ohe has as yet succeeded in penetrating so deeply into it and unraveling its mysteries as did the immortal Shakespeare, < nor «a any one as yet manage to transcribe lUs impressions in such a, limpid*.gushing, and impetuous manner as did Lprd Byron. Therefore, Whether their themes or plots have originated with them 6r' were borrowed or stolen, th'e consummate manner of their treatment of them and the way they have assimilated thorn and wrought them into great masterpieces transforms them into works of surpassing beauty and originally.
