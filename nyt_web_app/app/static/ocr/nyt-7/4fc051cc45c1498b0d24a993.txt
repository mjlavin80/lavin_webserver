JN THE August number of The Popular Magazine Mr. Rider Haggard’s sequel to his once-thrilling' " She ” comes to a truly flamboyant conclusion with a fresh incineration of the ever-beautiful Ayesha, this time in company with Leo Vincy. We are told in formidable phrases that Ayesha will return, but we sincerely hope she will not return in another sequel to “ She “ by Mr. Rider Haggard* That author of many glowing romances has won new honors in late years. His observation and powers of expression have blossomed to some purpose in fresh field?. And while we all would heartily welcome a new Imaginative work from his pen as good of its kind as 44 King Solomon’s Mines/’ we can cheerfully endure what remains of life with no further knov/Iedge of the spectacular incarnations of She. Not that there are no points of merit in this sequel. There is an attempt, at least, to put to use , some of the new knowledge of the mysteries of the i Orient the world has acquired in the last twenty years; while there are an appreciable sense of humor and* the touch of a mature style in the delineation of wise old Kou-en, the Buddhist recluse, who is the most entertaining personage in the new story. Kou-en has almost the last word in " Ayesha," and he I deserves the very last.	‘
