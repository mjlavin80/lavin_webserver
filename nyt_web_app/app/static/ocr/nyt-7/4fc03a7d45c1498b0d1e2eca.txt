English Law and Public Opinion.
The twelve lectures on ** The Relation Between the Law .and Public .Opinion in England During the Nineteenth Century,"1 which were delivered by Prof. A. V. Dicey of the Inner Temple, London, to the Harvard Law School In 1898, have been collected into one volume, which the j Macmillan Company^ is about to issue. The author explains the character of the book* In which the lecture form has t&en retained:	,
Even for the ■ nineteenth century the book is not a history of English law; still less is it a history of English* opinion. It is an attempt to follow out the connection or relation between a century of English legislation $.nd successive currents of opinion. The book is, in fact, an endeavor to .bring the growth of English laws during a hundred years into connection with the course of English thought. * • * It is written with the object not of discovering new facts* but of drawing from some of the best known facts of political, * so- ■ cial, and legal history-'certain conclusions which, though many of them obvious enough, are often overlobked and are not . without Importance.	.	.
, It inay be udded, by the -way, that the lectures tire not in' their original form. Since'Prof.- Dicey delivered them to Harvard students he has sometimes curtailed,, sometimes expanded’ them/ and they have been the basis of the lectures given -at Oxford during the last five years. The ' volume is provided with numerous com- ! prehensive footnotes of reference and ex-planatfon. In appendices are some notes on the “ Right of Association;**’ the fee-clestical commission, university ' tests, , judge-made law, and the proposed coir . lectivist legislation of 1005. t '
