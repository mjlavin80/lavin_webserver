The "justification" of J- B. Bury's ** Life of St. Patrick and His Place in History/' he says, rests " upon a methodical examination of the sources, and that the conclusions, whether right or wrong, were reached without any prepossession. For one whose interest In the subject is purely Intellectual, it was a matter of unmixed indifference what answer might he found to any one of the vexed Questions. He continues:
I will not anticipate my conclusions here, but I may say that they tend to show that the Roman Catholic conception of St. Patrick’s work is, generally, nearer to historical fact than the views , of some anti-Fapal divines.	!
Dr. Bury believes that, in spite of the I fine work in Todd’s M St. Patrick,” that book is not an authoritative one, because the author " wrote with an unmistakable ecclesiastical bias/' and hardly touches on the life history of the saint. The body of the present volume is ** an effort in the art of histiography/* while the appendices, which take up about a third of tho book* represent the work which belongs to the science of history.
The book opens with a chapter on the diffusion of Christianity beyond the Roman Empire, followed by the story of the lite of St. Patrick. The appendices contain the descriptions of the writings of St. Patrick and other documents from which the author drew the material for his biography; notes on the different chapters, and an excursus. The two maps with which the book has been supplier! are intended to help the reader to see the whereabouts of some places not easily found elsewhere. The Macmillan Company is about to Issue the biography.
