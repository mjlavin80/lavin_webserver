He Returns for a Last Word
New York Times Book Rcvfetc:
The caption placed above the letter of R. E. K., published in, your issue of today, seems to be a notice that. In the words of Dundreary to his valet: " The conversation Is closed.*' But before I act | upon his further advice to the same wor- j thy and ** go to the devil,*’ I beg to say that you erred somewhat In your comments upon my communication published in the previous Issue.
I think it Is generally admitted that Mr. Bryant read the manuscript of but two of the* volumes which are known as Bryant's Popular History of the United States. That at which my criticism was plainly leveled was Volume IV. of the series. He had been dead more than two years when it was given to the world. I was not Ignorant of the name, the origin, or the history of the real author. I withdraw the appellation o£ Journalistic hack," with apologies to all of his resentful friends. It was a hasty expression, but if his friends will read again, as I had lust done, the scandalous imputations against the honor of men as high-minded and pure as himself which are found on Pages 505 and 506 of the hook In question they will be apt, I think, to moderate their resentment. I remember hearing Mr.. Proude lay down the excellent rule that a historian may not be ** blind of one eye.” But it was no historian who* fifteen years, after the battle flags were furled, could write such rubbish as is found there and elsewhere In the book. It was rather the old-time editor of The Anti-Slavery Standard, with his circulation kept hot by long years of service as a partisan journalist; and apparently uncooled In his seventh decade by a brief sojourn in the less tropical atmosphere of The Evening Post. He may have been a man of broad culture, as you say. I do not question his honesty or his sincerity any more than I do that of the recently honored servant of the Lord, who put Copernicus to the right about by his proclamation that “ the sun do move," None the less, I am convinced that to search among his pages for impartial contemporaneous history Is to seek for the living among the dead,	H.	E.	D.
