THE COMMON SOLDIER,
A MODERN LEGIONARY. By John Fatrlclc Le Poer. 12mo. Fp- 311- New York. E. P. Dutton & Co. $1.50.
In tho famous French Foreign Legion I at least the common soldier still exists in , ht.<* unexpurgated state—such as he was, say, in the days of Sir John Hawkwood.
1 There's no softening admixture of the 1 «citizen" in him. This is a story of | that Foreign Legion which, by every mark, is written by a man who has lived the life he tells about- It's a barbaric i life, and for the most part sordid—though there are streaks of nobility now and i then in these professional fighting men—
! outcasts of many lands. The narrative relates, with circumstance, the daily life I In recruiting depot,* in camp, upon the march, on the field of battle. It tells of the customs of the corps; how a soldier must be loyal first of all to his squad, (with the men of which he must divide | all windfalls,) second to his section, next to his company. It tells of coarse jests, i orgies, killings, furious fights between whole companies in'camp. It tells of life on the troopship and of battles with ! Arabs in Algeria and Asiatics in Tonquln j —battles where the cry is “ Kill, kill! ”
, and no quarter is given on either side, i Particularly it tells the story of a young Irishman who enlisted In the legion, lived | Its rude life pretty well to the full, drank, helped his comrades, got Into trouble for their sake and his own, fought, and rose to bo Sergeant Major before he was eighteen.
Then came a romance with a girl of the camp—a good girl, mind you—and a tragedy due to the persecutions of a blackguardly adjutant. The narrator will have It that officers are a bad lot, caring, as a rule, only for their own comfort and pleasure, but he admits that French officers are brave. The girl—she is can-tini£re—is a fine, gallant figure of a woman, and the crushing of the young Sergeant Major under, the official heel is told in a manner eloquent of the black and helpless despair which gets hold of the soldier thus caught in the grip of the cruel machine of which he is only a dumb part. The reader will get a vivid notion of how little the individual counts, how blind and unjust the operation of " regulations " when one martinet spoils all the mitigating effects of the unwritten custom of all wise officers to wink at small offenses.
The story (as a story) is one for readers who are not afraid of naked truth and a
