In “ Will Warburton ” Mr. Gissing tells the story of a warm-hearted man, wrecked in fortune through no fault of his own— unless to trust one's friend be a fault—a man of large commercial interests, and of breeding and culture as well, who when he finds the ground cut from under his feet elects to Keep a grocery shop rather than to have his mother and sister suffer loss. Nor is he ever less than pitiful to the weak partner who had dragged both to ruin, or other than tolerant of the vanities and follies of friends he had aidea and saved, who cannot now conceal their contempt for his new business. His is one of the rare natures which are generous alike of sympathy and of purse; and withal he is no prig; 3ust a manly man, wincing under the burden ho has bravely shouldered, but keeping right on in the path of duty; a man without pose or preaching, who lives both '* the simple " and the strenuous ” life, and makes no fuss about it.
The quiet sincerity of the story is bo infinitely refreshing that, upon the first reading, one scarcely considers the skill of the literary touch, the ripe art of the narrator, the subtle ** nuances " that give the charm of contrast and variety. Over j against Warburton is the young artist, all j moods and ** temperament," contemptuous I of Warburton's occupation, blind to the fact that, whereas Warburton has made of his grocer's counter a step to the highest ideals of life, he, Nor-bert JFYanks, has sold his own ideal for a mess of pottage. And there is the dreaming girl, unconsciously steeped in selfishness, who thinks scorn of wot'king for money, who is ready to embrace poverty—in the abstract—and who yet, In order to be lifted above the commonplace, has to have the things which* money buys; the grtrl whose inability to discern comparative values robs her life ot Its wings. And over against her is the girl who, having freed her mind of cant, recognizes that poverty 44 makes some virtues impracticable and others extremely difficult," and yet who lives with uncomplaining beauty a life of stern denials. Each character, however lightly touched, is true, true to a hair, stepping forth from the page a rounded, breathing figure. Of like reality is tho picture of the Haws, in fragrant, dewy contrast with commercial London, It hofds the very feeling of a garden. One can even smell Jane’s potatoes, as she turns them out of the earth. It Is a charming bit let into the city life of the story.	-
While Mr. Glssing has written abler novels than ** Will Warburton,” he has written none more healthful and human. It is excellent in workmanship and large of vision; a book that leaves one the better for having read it, and that one likes better with every rereading. If, as has been said, It is its author's posthumous work, he is happy in leaving his public with a story so simply and sincerely told, one that rings so true, and through which his own personality is so finely revealed.
