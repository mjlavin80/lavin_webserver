| RELIGIOUS REVIVALS
A Study of tHe Sociological Conditions Underlying Them In • All Nations and Ages.^	'
OW sociological students are taking al^ manifestations of human life and activity as their own Is continually being manifested * afresh. Now comes Mr. Davenport to give a sociological interpretation' partly of religious revivals, a task that Hone had attempted before him. It is *' a frue scientific description," an “interpre-. tation in terms of law and personality, •^s^Uming the doctrine of mental and social evolution throughout." There is criticism in it, too; an attempt to show that there are primitive traits which need* elimination or modification in the interest of religious and social progress—an attempt to contribute toward a better ordering of religious method.
Facts and principles of psychology come to the front in their examination, as’they ■ do in most of the investigations of the sociologists. Thus, in the beginning we. must acquaint ourselves with the form • of social action resulting from “sympathetic likcmindedness ” under ‘which suggestibility. Imitativeness; imagination, and emotion are the most potent influences. These influences pass speedily and; •impulsively into action. People who have the least Inhibitory control take initial steps in impulsive social action; it tends’ to spread In geometrical progression.. When the crowd is wrought upon by skill-; ful speakers the power of inhibition of' each individual seems to be weakened and free rein is given to feeling and iml-tation. These facts take us back to some ^ of the primitive traits o< the human mind, . -which Mr. Davenport studies in some de- ; tail; traits which result in hallucination, mental exaltation, and ecstasy.
~ He then takes up the study of religious ‘revivals in primitive people, as for instance the ghost dances of the Indians,: In .which " naked hypnotism,” practiced. by the medicine men, is a prominent feature. The phenomena observed here and . studied by the Bureau of Ethnology are t similar to those that have been 'observed. in the religious revivals of the whites,! not excepting the examples of pretense, such as Charles Wesley, ferreted out in the . cases which resulted, from his brother's preaching. .	.
Another field for the study of primitive traits under strong religious excitement Is found In the American negroes. Among th.eir meetings there .are "scenes of frenzy, of human passion, of collapse, of catalepsy, of foaming at. the mouth, of convulsion, of total loss of inhibition compared with the scorching heat of which the Indian ghost dance seems at times only a pale moon." Mr... .Davenport’s chapter is interesting .and striking, and is a necessary -complement to his study; though it is, of course, not at all new : and he offers no new contribution to this phase of tbe. subject. ..
He gives an interesting consideration in two successive chapters of the great re- , yival of the Scotch-.Irish population in . Kentucky in 1800, and-of the revival in; 1859 in the original home Df this popula- , tion in the North, .of Ireland. - His object ; is to set side by side some points of likeness and some of contrast,. The Kentucky revival shook the people with an .unexampled intensity, ot. emotion, with , scenes of ecstasy and terror in the camp meetings that have left, their remembrance after ,the lapse of a century. These are called as “ dreadful as ever afflicted a population in this world,*' with certain singular and characteristic manifestations; "jerks," whereby the body of the unfortunate sufferer would be thrown to the ground, bounding from one place to another, ’ or hopping like ,a frog; or the " barking ** exercise, in which a group' would gather at the foot of. a. tree, backing. growling, and snapping like dogs at a supposititious devil; or the, “holy..laugh,** which accompanied' much, of the preach-in£.

prevailing type of manifestation. In Kentucky'; trances!, visions, and the sinking of muscular energy that of Ulster. Though he does not. enter into it, Mr. Davenport believes that the difference is attributable to ’the difference In type of mind in the populations.	*
One of the most notable of religious awakenings was. of course, that which Jonathan Edwards set in motion In New England iri 1734, and" which culminated tinder White field. Here theire, was a different type of -'niind. ‘ not prlmitiye, not living in' £ strictly’pioneer .environment. •The Puritans still had their traditions of personal* religious fr6edom, an'cf retained In-all their vlVidriesJj 'and power' the linages^ which their system of theology invoked.

of the devil, of hell, of the infinite wrath-of an infinite God. There had been whatj was considered a great increase of wick-j edness and irreligion. The Government had loosened its restraints on the indi-j vidual; liberalism had set in.
Jonathan Edwards’s work at Northamp-. ton had spread Its results with surprising rapidity to nearby towns; but his methods had nothing of the superficial art of the orator. An extraordinary power of-personal fascination, a prodigious in tel-*, lectual strength, a " wonderfully vivid’ imaging forth of -premises, a masterly; marshaling . of terrible argument" were; the mean^ by which he stirred his hear-' ers. Very different was the character of some of the other fomenters of the “ great awakening.” such as the Rev.' James Davenport, whom ^Vhitefield. laud-; ed as one of the most godly and useful: men he met in America, and who was an : adept in producing agony and distress, ■ failings, faintings, tremblings, and shriek-: ings. He became such a public nuisance, that he was expelled from Connecticut. and was indicted by the Grand Jury of; Boston. Whitefield himself, though of: splendid power and exerting an influence-on the whole sane, was much criticised by thoughtful and earnest men on this; side of the water. The after results of: this fanatical movement were seen in a* profound reaction.	•
The Wesleyan revival next occupies the; chronicler’s attention. In this there was’ also a great abundance of physical mani- ■ festations, though Wesley himself, con-: trary to the ordinary impression of him,, was a man of self-possession, unemo-; tional, well balanced, holding to reason in [ masters of religion. But with all that he. was a man of mysterious influence, an: extraordinary power of suggestion and j impression accompanying his religious]' power. He had more; he had the spirit1 of philanthropy and social reform, and • urged many -measures that have since .
been enacted Into law. For these and 1
_ i
the reasons connected with the manner < of his work, notwithstanding the extraor-j dinary pathological manifestations that i accompanied his religious movement, • he ■ is entitled to be known as the chief social ’ figure among modern revivalists; •	1
The revival fires that sprang up with * the financial panic of 1857 and later re- ; vivals occupy Mr. Davenport’s attention ; more briefly—among them Mormonism,: which had its origin in the unhealthy re- ( vival atmosphere of Western New York . in the early nineteenth century,. The j most notable personality of these years ■ was Charles G. Finney, who reproduced . all the excitement and physical and men- ; tal collapse that marked the earlier re- : vival days. With him the reign of crude, I irrational fear in revival preaching came to an end. Representative of the more modern spirit was Dwight L*. Moody. The peculiar mental and nervous revival phenomena ceased almost wholly., with. him. Yet, as In the case of Wesley and Finney, Mr. Davenport finds the secretr of , Moody’s success in his mastery of .the art of hypnotism, no doubt perfectly un- • known to him.	•
In the power sharply to arrest the attention of an audience by unique remarks at the opening of the sermon, in T the skill with which he could distract their attention from all other concerns and bring • about a condition of total inhibition- of all other ideas except those connected with : Immediate salvation, in the ability to : arouse the higher emotions in the discern- . ment of the psychological moment when he should call for an immediate execution : of his suggestionjpf surrender on the part ; of his hearers, he was probably without:
; a peer among the religious leaders of his :
‘ day and generation.	.	,	.	■
; Moody's sudden abandonment of the . revival method -and his devotion to the Northfield school are suggestive of the causes of the decline of the revival. The method has become ineffective, and the application. of it has degenerated In dras-. tic power; the revivalist personality has, likewise, In many cases, - decayed. Revivals, in the hands.of men intensely desirous for large number of “converts,” have, .become little more than semi-hyp- ; notic stances. They have lost their hold . on people of intelligence. Their decline,
, however, as Mr. Davenport somewhat uni necessarily points out, has not been ac-
■	companied . by. any decline' In National morals, sympathy, integrity, .quick conscience,-or sense of social responsibility.
. '.After a review of the-testimony contained in- his - -earlier • pages aa to the hypnotic phenomena, of revivals, .especially as to the curious. “ psychology. of the- crowd M that Is involved in. them. Mr, Davenport concludes that candid evidence will compel a true bill against the revival of the past on the evidence of Its having vlo-; lated more than one fundamental principle of. right thinking-and right training. Whenever genuine good has been ,dpne; it has been, directly in proportion .to the control which the reflective processes- of individual leaders have exercised over . what is essentially impulsive social action.
