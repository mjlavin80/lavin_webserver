This volume does not profess to do more than roughly sketch Henry VlIL’s more prominent characteristics, outline the chief features of his policy, and suggest some reasons for the measure of success he attained. Episodes such as the divorce of Catherine ot Aragon, the dissolution of the monasteries, and tbe determination of the relations between Church and State would severally demand adequate treatment in works of much greater bulk than the present. On the divorce valuable light has recently been thrown by Dr. Stephen Ehses in his " RSmtsche Doku-Tnente." The dissolution cf the monasteries has been exhaustively treated from ere point of view by Dr. Gasquet; but an adequate and impartial history of what is called the Reformation still remains to be written. Here it is tmssible to deal with these questions only in the briefest outline. and in so tar as they were affected by Henry's personal action.
This, from the new preface to his new edition of *' Henry vm./’ gives an Idea of the scope of Prof. A. F*. Pollard's book, about to be issued by Longmans, Green & Co. The test of xhe previous issue has been revised, errors- have been removed, and there are.new notes on special points, especially those on v.*liich fre^h light has recently teen thrown There is a portrait of Henry VIIL as a frontispiece.
