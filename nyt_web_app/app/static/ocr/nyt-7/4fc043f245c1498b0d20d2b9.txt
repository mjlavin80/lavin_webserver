In '* The Candidate,” which is the latest contribution to the long line of American political novels, Mr. Joseph Altsheler adopts the plan of making the action of the story coincident with the speeehmak-Ing tour with which his successful aspirant for the Presidency fills in the active season of a campaign that bears a more or less close resemblance to a real one buried not very deeply in the annals of our history. The interest is about evenly divided between the prospects of Jimmie Grayson, a brilliant young orator anti lawyer, who came as an unknown delegate out of the West and carried the convention by storm with his eloquence; the journalistic aspects of the campaign, as exemplified by the group of special correspondents who followed the candidate about and subjected him to a constant succession of interviews, and the courtship which one of these reporters succeeded in carrying to a happy termination, with the assistance of the candidate’s niece and the many favorable occasions for importuning his lady afforded by the five months’ tour upon which fate had embarked them in each other's company.
L-neon volitional ity marks all of Mr. Alt-sheler's 'characters, and some of tlie sensational incidents of the candidate’s tour
hardly bear tlie marks of credibility. Would it be possible for a man with four companions, even though he had Jimmie Grayson’s " golden voicc,” to delude a band of desperate outlaws who were Intent on kidnapping him, and for that purpose were hid'ng fn an abandoned hotel, where he and his small party were taking refuge from a blizzard in tlie Rocky Mountains, into thinking that tie was delivering a speech to a large delegation from the nearest town that had braved the blizzard to hear him, and thus persuade them to take to their heels in sheer fright? We read that " the room resounded with the applause, [of four men,] and it thundered down the nails of the great empty building." It is somewhat more probable to be told that on another occasion Jimmie Grayson turned one of his speeches into a clever means of convicting an unsuspected murderer, or, on still another, willfully muddled a speech in order to give a struggling young lawyer, who couldn't get a chance to prove his mettle at the bar, the opportunity to display his talents as an orator by riddling the candidate’s flimsy arguments, but it remains that the stump speakers of reality have not commonly had either the time or the inclination for such kindly deeds. Grayson himself is plainly intended to suggest, if not to picture, the career of Mr. Bryan, though the portrait is far from definite as regards personal qualities, and Mr. Altsheler's hero succeeds in his ambition.
“ The Candidate" Is by no means an unreadable book, but it is not In Mr. Alt-sheler’s previous best style, nor is it up to his usuarievcl of interest. The various elements of plot somehow lack the cohesion necessary to weld them into a convincing whole.
