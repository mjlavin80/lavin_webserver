POLO.
T* F. Dale’s Interesting History of the Game from Earliest Times to the Present Day.*
OLO has- round a true champion in Mr. T. P. Dale, His shorter critical writings have earned for him the rank of an authority on polo, in 'which respect he bears the same relation to his favorite sport as the genial Horace Hutchinson does to golf. Of all games of sklll-polo has had, perhaps, the least written about it. It seems to produce as well a3 attract men of action more than men of letters, whereas golf does both.
Like Horace Hutchinson* Mr, Dale has the happy faculty of writing entertainingly for the general reader as well as for I the scientific student. His book combines both elements, but its strongest i
appeal, nevertheless, is to those who form a vital part of the game.	*
Mr. Dale has succeeded in accomplishing what no previous writer on polo has ever done, that is, to present a concise, even graphic, view of the present status of polo throughout the world. The chapters on polo in England, America, India, Australia, and New Zealand, while technical, as the rules of each country are presented in full with illustrative comments, are of peculiar interest at the present time owing to the growing sentiment for an international code of rules.
JT may surprise some of our club players to learn that there was an International code back in the tenth century. At that early period polo was old. Some of the earliest legends that have come down to us in Persian literature are filled with allusions to polo. The partially mythical-historical heroes were celebrated for their prowess in the game. For over 2,000 years polo continued in high favor as the national sport of Persia, and preference, at Court not infreqv^ntly was based upon a courtier’s horsemanship with mallet and ball. It is not surprising, therefore, to read that the women of the royal household occasionally appeared on the field, nor did they use side saddles. On one notable occasion seventy veiled women played polo before the King and his nobles, hut owing to the number the author rightly infers that this was not so* much polo as an exhibition In horsemanship with the mallet and ball as accessories.
From Persia polo spread into Turlco-and during the period of the Byzantine Emperors it was virtually the royal sport of Constantinople. It then traveled eastward across Asia, entjering Japan, where it has flourished for over 1,000 years.
The name polo is not derived from the country of its birth, but is a Tibetan word, signifying willow root, and from this material practically all of the polo balls used to-day are made. History records but one change in polo balls, and that I was in early Byzantine days, when the ; balls were quite small and covered with leather. The dimensions of the field have varied but little, and the distance be- | tween the goal posts, 24 feet, has never been altered.	,
When polo was introduced into England ■ about thirty years ago, it was styled hockey on horseback, while the Irish populace termed it hurling on horseback. As a matter of fact, the author points out that these sports, with the addition of golf and some other games of ball, are really descendants of polo, so that the term “ royal and ancient" might with more propriety be applied to this equestrian sport than to the delightful pastime which the Scotchmen have made celebrated in all English-speaking quarters of the world.
Wherever polo is played the influence of Hurlingham is felt. As the first club to establish the game in England, which it did early in the seventies, and the first to promulgate a set of rules, it was natural that other clubs should look to Hurllng-f ham in much the same way as new golf clubs twenty years ago or so looked to old St. Andrew’s for knowledge of the game.
1 The influence of neither club is so strong i to-day, and the expansion of polo has led to a general wish among English players for a polo association modeled somewhat after the plan in this country. Mr. Dale also favors our handicap system, which has never been adopted in the United Kingdom- The international match played at Hurlingham three years ago surprised the Englishmen- at the quality of polo that the best American players could show, and Mr. Dale frankly admits that among the best players of the two countries there Is little to choose. One of the notable features of polo abroad is the recognition given to it by the military authorities. This is undoubtedly influenced

by the popularity of polo among tne army In India, but it serves as an excellent aid to cavalry training. In America polo as a cavalry sport is of recent date. Squad: ron A was the first to show the benefits * to be derived from the encouragement of i the game among the troopers, and the United States Army has since given its . sanction to polo, but the efforts thus ffiiv made at West Point have not been of a very serious nature.	*
T is claimed for the polo rules In India that they are the best ln existence, and the waning influence o£ Hurllng-ham is shown in the fact that many English players have agitated the advisability of adopting outright the Indian rules in England. The playing periods in India are only of five minutes’ duration and the £ame lasts forty minutes. In England the game lasts an hour, divided Into six ten-minute periods, while in America there are four periods of fifteen minutes each. In England no change of ponies is allowed during the ten-minute periods, and this is justly regarded as a hardship, as it puts a premium upon the best ponies, thus favoring the rich players. All of these technical differences are ^thoroughly treated^ and those wno are seeking for points of similarity will find much valuable material in this book. A complete list of the clubs in England and Ireland is added, giving the number of playing members in each and the dues.
The chapter on club and general polo expenses is a helpful one, while the author’s reminiscences of players and famous games within the past twenty years are as replete with entertaining incidents as the more technical portions of his elaborate book are with keen critical observations.
