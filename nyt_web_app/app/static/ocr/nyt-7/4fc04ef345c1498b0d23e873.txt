This is a study by Francis Abbot Gns~ quefc, D. E>., of the ecclesiastical policy of I Henry III, of England and of the rela-I tions between his country and Rome. A r£sum6 of the book is given in the introduction. About three years after King John’s submission to Pope Innocent III., at the former’s death, Henry III. was proclaimed King. The young ruler of only nine years had a powerful protector Jn Innoccnt’s successor, Honorarius III., upon whose accession to the chair or Peter the question of the Magna Charta was reopened. But upon Henry’s taking the oath of fealty to the Pope, tlie relations between England and Rome remained intact.
But when Henry declared himself of age to govern England, the demands of the Holy See for money from the English clergy became larger than ever, until the constant opposition led to the Council of Lyons, In 1245, when a letter was sent to Innocent IV., setting forth the bad state of the country caused by these continuous demands. Henry III. had kept out of the struggle between the Papacy and the empire until after the death of Frederick II., and four years after this event, in 1254, he accepted from Innocent IV. the Kingdom of Sicily and Naples for his second son, Edmund. Hia rights were disputed by Frederick’s illegitimate son, Manfred, but Alexander IV., who succeeded Innocent IV., carried on the fight at the expense of the English King.
The author begins his study from the
time when England became a fief of the
Holy See. through the periods of the
Legates Gualo and Pandulph, the Nuncio
Otho, the first years of Pope Innocent
IV., the Crusades, the Emrlish Church in
