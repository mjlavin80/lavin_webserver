Verily, Mr. Arthur Stringer has set the hornets huzzing, or I know not hornets.
Your correspondent of June 13 seems to have but small hope of an appreciative public for poets' He obviously considers the. modems a moat commercial set Cu-, rlously, Mr. Clow has won no unhandsome laurels,as a poet. His verse is not so well known as Mr. Stringer’s to Americans, but his lajrs are very tuneful, hence it is disappointing when he descends to hurl " trolley cars/' *; breakfast foods/' and “ com plasters ” at the public’s un- , accustomed head:^ Quoths .Mr. Clow,
** There is no longer, and never will be, the conations to breed poets," and agmrt,
“ The dear public don't want poets." Now, isn't that a funny thing to. say? Mr. Clow’s spectacles need changing. The public does want poetry as eagerly as it ever did. It has outgrown the habit of superlative. It says less and feels more about everything. In other days poets were so scarce that the " dear public ” stood awesomely by and looked at them as children do at white elephants. Many of these poets were also poseurs. Some of them were nothing to boast of as men. They sang their songs, in a,ny company in order to fill their flagons. To-day our poets are wiser. They write a sonnet between whiles, and the sonnet Is none the wor«;e. Rags and garrets have ceased : appealing to them. The woods are full of i poets. You can’t pick up a magazine of ; high class without being gladdened by the thought that they are still with u§. True, some wear petticoats, but petti-coated or trousered, sing they their individual songs or chant they their soul-stirring requiems thrice tunefully as of yore. The way to make great poets is to buy their wares. Here comes the commercialism that Mr. Clow so bitterly resents. It's true all the same. Poets sing never so joyously as. when they learn through their publishers that the public is eagerly listening at so much per harken. Care kills everything it touches in time, even 'genius. guccess is a tonic, and j there’s nothing so exhilarating to poet or ■ proser as money to n^eet the bills when | they clamor .In. .. Public appreciation is , expressed best in coin of the Republic. WTiat's the difference whether the greater number prefer to invest in trolley car stock, or automobilej. or “ corn plasters/' if the remaining many understand, read between the lines, and find rapture or solace?
Poetry is not dead, nor are poets sleeping. Don’t worry. Mr. Clow, we not only can but are now producing real poets, v,ha are giving us ** real *’ poetry. You’ve been dozlnpr. mayhap.'	•
