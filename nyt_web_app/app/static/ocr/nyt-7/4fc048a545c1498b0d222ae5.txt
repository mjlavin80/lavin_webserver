JOHN HAY
IT strides us, on reflection, that our little appreciation of John. Hay as a writer a fortnight ago may have been received in certain quarters as a mlsappreciation, or even as a depreciation- We are not without evidence to that effect. The fact is that the American reading public has from of old been vitiated as to its literary standards by the too free employment of superlatives. The fact further is that John Hay, in his personal and human capacity, was the last man in the world to desire the loose application of the superlative decree to himself. So that a posthumous reviewer of his literary work who also had the honor of being a friend of his, and who had an appreciation of his literary work to do, would naturally consider what John Hay would like to have said about that work, and would be most chary of employing tlie superlative degree. Such a reviewer would, in his very personal loyalty, try his friend's work as he Imagined that his friend would like to have it tried, by the standard of the best that had been done in English prose or verse, as the case might be. And he would be aware all the while that John Hay would have been the first man to object to an appraisement of his own work which derogated in his favor from that standard. So that his very loyalty might lead the reviewer into an austerity of judgment which might seem to the less informed a lack of loyalty.
As to the verse, Tho London Academy raises a queer question whether the dialect poems of John Hay, the " Little Breeches ” and the " Jim Bludsoe," may not have been intended as a burlesque of Bret Harte. Our London contem-
, porary goes so far, in considering the
L	.
1 startling last two ' lines of V.*4ttle Breeches," as to raise the question whether Mr. Hay’s heroes 4‘ would ex-| pectorate on the jasper floor," a question which might equally be raised, as to certain passages in the works of Mr. Kipling. The writer In The Academy 1 is a gifted and ingenious outsider, but, after all, he is an outsider. No Ameri-. can can miss the point. The point is that after the new feeling of independence which followed the civil war, and which did not formulate itself in a new Declaration of Independence, a considerable number of writers, each according to his fcifts. undertook to give expression to what the new American 1 spirit " wished to say.” Bret Harte was one. John Hay was another- For that matter Walt Whitman was a j third, Voila tout! There is no question of imitation .among these men, even though* Walt Whitman w&s an elderly man, and Bret Harte scarcely a a middle-aged man, and John Hay a young man. Each was irying to convey, not at all to the critics of the London literary papers, but to his own countrymen, his several sense that his country had “ found Itself.” And each may have outdone the extravagance of either of the others without incurring | any reproach of parody or imitation. i
We have a word to add about " Castilian Days,” John Hay’s monumental piece of prose. We took tlie liberty of pointing out, from a distant reading and a hasty rereading, that it was not J primarily a study in English prose, that whatever literary quality it might have was a by-product on the part of a writer whose main objects were unlit-erary. A more careful and leisurely rereading confirms that view. In one of the papers which make up the volume the author refers expressly to *' talking politicsM as “ the most seductive of human occupations.” So it was to him. And all through the “ Castilian Days ” he is primarily talking politics, and only secondarily, incidentally, and journalistically, making literature- But what we failed, perhaps, to do justice to is the extent to which the author, like Moli&re's hero, succeeded in talking prose without knowing It, in making literature which *' escaped.” Here, for instance, is one example out of many such. It is from the account of John Hay’s visit to La Granja, that Summer seat of the Spanish monarchy made out of *' a pleasant farm on the territory of the Segoviari monks, flourishing in a wrinkle of the Guadarrama Mountains	|
It was tho c-nd of Julv and the sky was ! blue oni cloudless. The fine, soft light , of the afternoon wv; falling on the tawny slopc-s and the close-reaped fields. The , harvest was over. Tn the fields on either side thoy were thrashing their grain, not as in the outside world, with the whirring of loud and swift machinery nor even with the active and lively swinging of fiails, but In the open air, under the warm skv, the cattle were lazily treading out the corn on the bare ground, to be winnowed by lhe wandering wind. No change from the time of Solomon. Through an infinity of nges, ever since corn and cattle were, the Iberian farmer on this very spot had driven his "beasts ovor the crop and nt*ver dreamed of a better way of doing the work.
There will be, we should say, not much question of the quality of that prose. And, as we have already said, it is by no means lonesome In the volume In which it is found. If the author did not uniformly make prose as good, it was not because he could not. It was j because he was thinking of something else. But in addition to the political I suggestiveness of the volume, there is quite enough writing of this artistic quality to justify the publishers in including, as they do include, “* Castilian Days ” in their series of Cambridge Classics.
