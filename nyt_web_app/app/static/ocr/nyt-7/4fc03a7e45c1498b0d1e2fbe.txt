There are /our love stories In B*. W. Bain’s volume, “A Digit of the Moon, and Other Love Stories from the Hindoo,” which the Putnams are bringing- out today. They are entitled *' A Digit of the Moon.” "A Heifer of the Dam” ** The Descent of the Sun," and " In the Great God's Hair.’1 The stories are English versions of Hindoo tales, translated and doubtless adapted, too, by the present writer, who says ho got the original manuscripts from a native who was dying1 and did- not want them to he lost.
The story that gives the title to the book relates how a certain very handsome King did not wish to marry, although advised by his Ministers and urged by his subjects, in order that his kingdom should remain hi his fajnily. He was so molested that finally he banished every woman who happened, even accidentally, to como within his sight. One day a painter showed him the portrait of a "beautiful woman. He fell in love with the picture on the spot and demanded tie location of the woman. She was a Princess, and the most beautiful in tho world. She bad numerous suitors. She consented to marry the man who should p-gfr her a <ruestion which she could not answer; ^^><3 she gave him nineteen days, a question for eaetf day.
•A Heifer of the Dawn" is the story of a clever young Princess who teaches a young King to love. Tbe King had a wife who proved to be faithless. So he shut himself up and would not listen to a second marriage. How he changed his mind* is told in this tale, the action of which takes place in thirteen days.
*	The Descent of the Sun ” is a fairy ta3e, a ** solar myth/' Mr. Bain explains. laterally translated, the name is •■The Glory of tie Going Down of the Sun ; but Its inner meaning Is " The DIvine Lustre of the Descent (Incarnation) of Tnm -Who Took Three. Steps," that is, tbe Hindoo Apollo.
The last story of the book, which is dedicated to husbands and wives, deals ' with the return at the waning loye of" a husband for a wife. The proverb preceding eaoh story is printed in the orig-[ Inal Sanskrit, with the English version underneath. There are several sketches
of tbe subject of the stories.
