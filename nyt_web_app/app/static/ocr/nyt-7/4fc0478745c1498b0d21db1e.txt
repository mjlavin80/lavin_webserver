A dear, old-world, typically Breton town Is Vannes. * * * I have never seen suen eccentric broken lines (of streets) wj at Vannes. At one comer the houses leaned forward- across the street, and- literally rested one on the top of the other. These were only tee upper stories; fcelow -were the up-to-date jewelers and “ patisseries/' with newly painted signs In black and gold. Iri the middle* of ' these houses, cramped and crowded and- hustled by them/ stood . the- cathedral. *	* » Seen
from outside the. gates this town is very beautiful—the black water of the moat, the* huddled figures' or the women, with their white caps and snowy piles of linen, and beyond that green grass anti apple ■ trees' and - flowers; and - at the back
*	the old grayish-pink walls, with carved buttresses. There is hardly a- town in-the whole of Brittany so ancient • as Vannes. * * +. The Vanntals^ * *" * are a sturdy, grave, pensive: race,' hiding in-' domitable energy-and'hearts of fire under the calmest demeanor. The women are fine creatures. * *.. * The ^peasants' re-ralnd me very much of Sir, Henry Irving. * Some of the flnesj;,, types are..curiously like him in feature; they have the same magnificent profile and well-shaped head.
