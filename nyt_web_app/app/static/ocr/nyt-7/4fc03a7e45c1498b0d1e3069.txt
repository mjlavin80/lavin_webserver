i	Robert Latta, M. A., D.	Phil., Pro!	fessor of Logic and Rhetoric	In the Unl-
i versity of Glasgow, has compiled and edit-i ed a volume of " Philosophical Studies,"
; by the late Prof. David G. Ritchie, M. A.,
; LL. D., author of “ Natural Rights/* &c.,
[ which the MacmlJlan Company Is about | to issue* Owing to the fact that Prof. j Ritchie’s published works are concerned | mz-inly with his ideas, on ethics and | politics, Prof- Latta has aimed to make this posthumous volume represent as adequately as is now possible the philosophical position which underlies his practical doctrine, and he has also	devoted the
larger part of tbe memoir he	has written
to “ a connected exposition of Prof. Ritchie's views in philosophy, and ! through notebooks, letters, and other i manuscripts the late writer left to express ; his ideas as far as possible in his own , words.
|	Following the memoir is the M Cogitatlo
| Metaphysics,** in which is a general state-nr.ent of Prof. Ritchie’s views on all Che j m&in questions of philosophy and religion, i Prof. Lfatta explains that the writer had several times begun It and stopped, and it remained unfinished at his death; some parts the editor has completed from notes left by Dr. Ritchie. The other studies are “ The Relation of Logic to Psychology,” “ The Relation of -Metaphysics to Epis-temology,” “The One and the Many/* in which he discusses the logical, metaphysical, theological, and ethical problems; ** Confession D1 Fidel," In which he writes on free will, immortality, personality. religion, society and the State, martyrdom, &c.t and “ Moral Philosophy: On the Method and Scope of Ethics,” wherein he deals with moral philosophy and science, moral philosophy and psychology, ethlqs and religion, morality and nature, equality, means ar.d end, morals and politics, &c-
