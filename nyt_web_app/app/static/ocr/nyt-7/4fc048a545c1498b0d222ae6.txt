OR A T-101STE S MEDICI.
V	WILLIAM WILLIAMS KEEN'S "Addresses and Other Papers," (Philadelphia, W. B. Saunders & Co.,) though on medical subjects, are by no means of interest merely to the medical profession. Some ot the * papers have appeared in general magazines, notably one on “ Vivisection and Brain Surgery.” which made 4 sensation ■when it was published ln Harper’s Magazine in June twelve years ago. The sub*
l
; jectg are discussed in excellent English, and with exactness, though without the technical language that, apart from the ! small type used in professional journals,
! makes the proceedings of learned bodies ’repellent to the layman.
Extremely Interesting Is the first article in the volume: The early history of prac-, tical anatomy—of dissection, that Is. Dr. Keen, in his brief history, reminds us that the first human anatomists were in Alexandria, three centuries before Christ, and that they and their successors for 2,000 years, were commonly reported to have indulged In ante-mortem dissection.
Vesallus was shipwrecked and died while fleeing for his life on such a charge. The Edinburgh Act of 1505, giving the sur~ geons the body of one criminal annually “ to make an anatomle of,” was guarded by the proviso "after he be deid.” Even poetry has lent Its aid to perpetuate the legend of th'e ** invisible gfrl,** whose ghost was believed to haunt Sir Charles Bell’s anatomical rooms, where she had been dissected alive on the night preceding that appointed for her marriage.

Alexandria remained the only medical centre of the world, and the physician Galen had to journey from Rome to the African city even to see a skeleton. He sent his students to the German battlefields to dissect the bodies of the national enemies, while he himself used apes as most resembling human beings. Human dissection was revived In Bologna In the fourteenth century, where Madonna Man-zolina later was Professor of Anatomy— undoubtedly one of the first women doctors, If not the very first. Leonardo da YIncl, painter of " The Last Supper,” was a great anatomist; but dissection had fallen into disuse when Vesallus finally revived it about the middle of the sixteenth century.
Even In comparatively modern times, anatomists have been the object of attacks by the populace. In 1765 Dr. John Sbippen of Philadelphia was mobbed as a grave robber, and the doctors* riots ln this city occurred twenty-three years later, and were due to the belief that the medical students robbed graves continually. It was, Indeed, the lack of opportunity to obtain subjects regularly that led to the practice of grave robbing, and originated " a set of the lowest possible villains—the' resurrectionists—a race now happily almost extinct." Dickens’s Jerry Cruncher, in “ A Tale of Two Cities," was a " resurrectionist " by night, and In 1S2S, Dr. Keen notes, there were more than 100 regular professional grave robbers In London, besides occasional volun-tears. They did a large business in a perfectly organized manner. Sometimes, says Dr. Keen, " they picked up cases of apoplexy in the street, carried them as relatives to the hospital, and as relatives claimed and removed them after death to sell to anatomists. " At least one gang sold a body to a hospital, stole it in the same night, and resold it to a rival school. The resurrectionists presently began to create subjects for dissection—in other words, to murder people; and William Burke, who gave his name to the crime of Burking, or throttling, murdered sixteen persons be; fore he was caught. His trial, of " unex-[ ampled length," said the Judgre, ln charging the jury, lasted twenty-four hours! It was the very atrocity of Burke and his fellows that brought about such change of laws that medical colleges no longer have to deal with resurrectionists, and starved the professional grave robbers out of business.

Another interesting article is on the debt of mankind to vivisection. Dr. Keen quotes in a note from a speech in Parliament against the Anti-Vivisection bill, in which , Dr. (now Lord) Playfair told how by testing a new substance on two rabbits he killed them, but saved the life of the great physician, Sir James Simpson, who i had proposed to try the drug on himself.
“ Let me give another instance,” con-tlnued Lord Playfair:	,
A few years ago, two young German chemists were experimenting upon a poison which I will not oven name, for its properties are so terrible. It is postponed in its action, and then produces idiocy or death. An experiment on a mouse or a
£!)<? Jfetar JjjorkSimcs
rabbit would have iau?ht them the dan-~i*-r of thi,^ frigrhtful poison, but in ignorance of ns subtle properties, they became its unhappy victims, for on? died, and the other suffered intellectual death.
Dr. Keen’« address before a Phi Bela Kappa chapter in 1S!^, on medicine as a career for educated men, is a plea, not so necessary now as then, probably, for thorough medical instruction—for a four years’ course, among other things. His address on “ Medical Education," dated 1834, is a further presentation of the subject, Tlie last paper Jn the volume is entitled *' Surgical Reminiscences of the Civil War.” While still a student, and nearly a year before he received liis diploma, Dr. Keen was sent as surgeon to a Massachusetts regiment, and was present at Bull Run. After taking his degree he re-entered the army, serving in the hospitals at Washington, and at the second Bull Run. Of his service he writes:	I
People sometimes Imagine that a practicing physician can be transformed into an army surgeon merely by putting a uniform on him. I was not lucking in ordinary intelligence and was willing to work, but I was utterly without training. To get two churches (in Washington) ready as hospitals, I had to have beds, mattresses, sheets, pillowcases, chairs, tables, kitchen utensils, and the necessities for a dining room, all the drugs, appliances. and instruments of a drug store.
I needed orderlies, cooks, and the endless odds and ends of things which make up a hospital. I did not know how to get a single one of these things. I did not know whether to order six ounces or a gallon of laudanum, an ounce or a pound of opium. However, I inquired, and as I learned, I set to work. For two nights I slept only about three hours each, and naa the satisfaction of reporting at the ^end of three days, instead of five, that I was ready. On the fourth day I had 100 wounded men in each hospital.
The army and the navy medical schools teach the medical officers what Dr. Keen had to learn for himself. The writer ends his article by pointing out the " utter inadequacy of our present system of enlargement of the medical corps of the army when war is upon us," and the necessity of giving to medical men ** substantial control over sanitary matters. Our experience in tbe Spanish-American war, and by contrast the extraordinary results obtained by Japanese methods, reinforce this suggestion in a most striking way."
