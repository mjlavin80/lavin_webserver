Even in the > old days of the British Army, before the relief of Ladysmith, for example, there were some British officers who disregarded the rule that it “ wasn't good form to ~be keen ” in military matters, and actually considered their occupation as their profession. and studied it. Col. Maurice is probably the most shining example of these anomalous Britishers, though he is not the only one. Since Ladysmith, however, times have changed. One may be " keen ” about military matters and yet preserve “ good form.”
The result of this changed attitude toward the profession of arms among British officers is apparent in the output of military books. Col. Henderson's life of Stonewall Jackson and Capt. Battine’s much discussed history of the Gettysburg campaign are examples in point. Now come two other military books from British soldiers:	Major
Crowe’s “ Problems in Manoeuvre Tactics ” and Major Sheraton’s Tactics Applied to Schemes."
The first is translated and adapted from the German of Major Hoppen-stedt of the War College at Potsdam, and Major Crowe’s part, aside from the i translating, was in adapting the prob-Iems to the organization of the British Army. The operations studied are laid near Metz. Major Crowe is to be congratulated for resisting the inclination to transfer the scene to England—an inclination very strong among English translators of all kinds.
When Major Sheraton's book first appeared we do not know; the edition at hand is the fourth, and the second was published in 1897. Very suggestive is the beginning of Major Shadwell's preface to the present edition of 1905:
“ The third edition of this book has had a quicker sale than either of the preceding editions.” The South African war had happened, and the British officer had learned that personal bravery without knowledge was of little value in modern warfare. So he had turned to what text books he could get, found and liked Major Sherston’s, and so gave his collaborator and successor a chance to make, possibly unintentionally, a very weighty remark.
These books are not of general interest, but they should approve themselves to our own officers in some degree. Their publication Is undoubtedly one of the results of the South African war, and by no means one of the least important.
