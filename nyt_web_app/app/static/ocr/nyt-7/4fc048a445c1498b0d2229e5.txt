The enormous growth of public libraries in the United ’states is, of course, a matter of congratulation. It is, at least, a promise of culture. But in his article in the current number of The World’s Work Herbert Putnam, the Librarian of Congress. points out that the public llbrstry cannot demonstrate its own usefulness like the school:
For the most important of its achievements—a general ameliorating’ influence— the libraries can offer no proof. The multiplicity of readers is not in itself a prroat achievement in an age when one must be singular who is not ‘ Jond of books," and when the public library is accessible, attractive, and its purpose widely advertised; nor is tlie vast number of books issued proof of a passion for information, when books are urged upon the reader almost at his very door; nor is the issue to him of a particular book, without record of the use to which ne puts it, in itself a final achievement.
Mr. Putnam’s analysis of the charts and tables exhibited by the National Library at the St. Louis Exhibition is most interesting. There are public libraries In every State in the Union. New York has 718, Massachusetts 571, and Pennsylvania 401. New York and the New England States, with California and Nevada, however, are still (according to the best obtainable statistics) the only ones containing 100 or more volumes for each 300 inhabitants. Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Illinois, Michigan, and Colorado average 50; Virginia and the other Western States, 25 to 50; the remaining Southern States, except Texas,
10	to 25. Texas has sixty-nine libraries, however, five more than Virginia. Mr.
Putnam says:
For a scientific estimate of their use we must look elsewhere than to these tables; for the only indication of service rendered is the number of volumes circulated—an inconclusive test indeed. Nothing is easier in the administration of a free library than to increase the circulation. It may be done by merely multiplying copies or the more popular books. (A novel issued fifty times a year counts fifty units in this total, where a work of science issued once counts but as one.) Every lending library classifies its issues of books for home use; but under a liberal provision for access to the shelves the record cannot extend to the reference use. Comparison of such statistics has never gone beyond the ratio of fiction to the entire circulation. If the Philadelphia Librarians have their way even this-will be deprived of its sting, for they propose a subclassification of fiction itself, which will rescue from disrepute a large percentage of novels as “ history," " sociology, &c.
A.	record of circulation should give us a classification of the books issued—which the report of the bureau does not attempt —and also of the people drawing tnem— by age, by sex, by occupation—which, strange to say, almost no libraries record.
