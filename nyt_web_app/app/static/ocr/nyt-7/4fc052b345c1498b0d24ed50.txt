N E "W YORK! IN SUNSET
-	. The strange beauty and majesty of New York are beginning to be appreciated ^ven by the poets and by th^ New Yorkers- themselves,, who have . always felt humble.' about the looks of their. big town and remained modestly, silent In the sound of foreign praise. To the July Atlantic^. a- New__Kngland poet, (presum-[i-ablyt) William Ellery Leonard, contributes this sonnet, recording an impression of the-city at sunset:	_
The island city of dominion stands Crowned with all turrets, o’er waters* crest, *	.
Throned, like the bright Cybele of the West,
And hailed with cymbals in a million hands
Around, her: yet serenely she commands The inland vision and the ocean quests The new-born mistress of the world’s un; rest.
The beauty and the terror of the lands.
, »
She. sees the fields of harvest sown for her,
She sees the fortress set beside her gate, Her hosts, her ships, she sees thro' storm and fire;
And hers all gifts of gold and spice and myrrh,
And hers all hopes, all hills and. shores of fate,	,
And hers the fame of Babylon and Tyro,
