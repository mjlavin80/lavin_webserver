In fact, all this—the boom, the lady^of the fleet fingers, yellow pompadour, and neat shirtwaist, the town maker seated in •his revolving chair dictating, and the sen- ; timental flow.er-loving ne’er-do-well countryman of forty refuse to hang together. Mr. Gordon, who for the first half of his book writes remarkably little like' ah amateur and seems so far to have a sure hand and an ordered plan, would have done better to wrlt^two stories—perhaps three—instead of one. In the last case he would certainly of his own judgment hav*» thrown into the waste-paper basket the particular tale which dealt with the promoter and his typist—if w© may borrow, for the sake of clearness, the English term. Then his Dunkard idyl might have been a fine thing of its kind, and he might have made besides a haunting short story or wild detective yarn of the " man-thafc* wen t-like-a-beast. ’ ’

Mr, Gordon has made his book of somewhat incongruous material. The components are an idyl of a rural religious backwater and a dime novel plot of a boom town, a promoter, a typewriter lady, and a jealous clerk. The rural idyl—which deals with one of artistic soul born into a sect which follows a religion of ugliness—is unusually well done, in the manner of doing suggesting that of Mr. James Lane Allen. It Is, of course, a leisurely manner, and dwells with loving touch upon nature. The story tells of Benamml Youart, born of a French-descended mother to a family of dull Dutch farmers professing the faith of the Dunkards (or German Baptists) and wearing their preposterous garments. At forty Benamml, who had spent his life cultivating flowers i —to the great scandal of the Dunkard community—fell in love with a pretty ; Dunkard girl, who, because of something j pitiful In the man, reciprocated his affection. This girl has a grandfather heavy with years and crabbed with long exercise of patriarchal authority. In this old man, with his six-foot staff, his senile talk, his fantastic quoting of maledictory Scripture, Mr. Gordon has got hold of a very realistic effect.
He is Gordon’s trump card. He does well enough with the other Dunkards— evidently he has studied their lives and characters; but with none so well as with this. The trouble is that he translates his moody unworldly Benamml out of his drab valley into a boom town, and transforms him suddenly into a man of affairs—one whose very touch breeds gold. Many countrymen of forty may have done such things in real llfer but no man can strain his imagination to the possibility in a book. In this period Benamml, who has taken a notion that he is a 'murderer, comes very near marrying his typewriter, and the author introduces a moonshiner
