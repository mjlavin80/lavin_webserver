In his new volume, " Bygone Tears: Personal Reminiscences," the Hon. Edward Frederick Leveson-Gower, M. P., author of " Letters of Harriet, Countess Granville," speaking of his associates at Oxford University says of Ruskin:
He seemed to keep himself aloof from everybody. * • * I see him now, looking? rather crazy, taking his solitary walks. * •	*	It was no advantage to
Ruskin to be a gentleman-commoner, as they * * * were generally looked upon askance, as rather vulgar parvenus, too proud of their wealth. * * * Ruskin on one occasion gave a large supper, to which he invited some of the leading undergraduates whom he did not know. * * * He said he could hardly express how much he felt honored that so many young men who were superior to him socially should have condescended to accept his invitation. This disinclined us to keep up the acquaintance, although we were the losers thereby. I cannot, however, say that I have ever felt the enthusiasm with which Ruskin inspired so many of his contemporaries. No one can fail to admire the beauty and eloquence of his writings and his exquisite drawing. But I have' felt great misgiving about the soundness of his judgment. I do not pretend to be an authority upon art, but I know something *£out political economy, which causes me to be astounded at the nonsense he wrote on economic subjects.
There are C^er anecdotes about now celebrated men.. The writer was present at the coronation of Alexander EL of Russia, and other functions in England and elsewhere. He met many royttiftea. literary men, painters, &c. Tho volume will bear the imprint here of EV P. Dutton & Co.	-
