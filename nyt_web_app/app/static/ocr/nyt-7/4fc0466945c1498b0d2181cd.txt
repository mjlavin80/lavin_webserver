Sargent’s Alurai Painting:-
iVcto l ork Thiwti Book Rctrtcxc:
I was much interested in a sensible editorial in The New Yohk Times of June 17 about the amusing discussion held in a Sweden bo rgian convention^ concerning John S, Sargent's inurn I painting in the Boston Jjibrary, Our theologians evidently wish also to take the world of art upon their shoulders, in addition to their present burdens ot higher criticism and the emoluments of frenzied finance, if the criticism to which you rercr had resulted from a sincere attempt to understand the purpose ot the artist, it would have been wholly praiseworthy. The appearances, however, seem to indicate that, strangely enough in this rase, the liberal theology of these gontlrnun has stood in the way of any sincere attempt to reach a disinterested judgment of the picture.
Plainly, Sargent has not attempted to paint a genre picture. Me has painted a dogma, "the dogma of the atonement,” as its title frankly proclaims. He has detached himself in a remarkable way from his ordinary portraitist s manner, and has painted figures not of ftesh and blood, but of pure idea. Sargent may be a Unitarian l'or aught 1 know, but that f et should not prevent him from painting such a picture as the " Dogma of the Atonement” any more than the .accident ot Christianity should have prevented Michael Angelo and Raphael and their contemporaries and successors from going to Greek mythology for subject matter. The fact seems to be that Sargent has in this instance withdrawn himself to a wholly disinterested point of view, appropriating his material exactly as he found it, very much as the historian uses tho materials of past ages, without bias and without distortion.
Certainly the Jesus of Sargent's picture is not the Nnzareno of the New Testament, but, let us repeat, Sargent is not painting Jesus; he is painting an idea which mediaeval Christians formed about Jesus, which is distinctly another matter. In order to complete his series we may safely predict that the painter will give these hypercritical gentlemen an interpretation of the real Jesuy ot the lakes and fields. If the work which follows is as well done and as interesting as tlie " Dogma of the Atonement ” and Its companion piece upon the opposite wall we shall have in the complete series a notable addition to mural and sacred art.
