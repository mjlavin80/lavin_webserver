~H~F? growth of colonial natlon-a-HCTra 3?aa dispelled the dre^m of Imperial federation.-*’ This sweeping statement, with Its accompanying warning to Great Britain that the loyalty of her colon!es is a thing of the past is the keynote of this book. The object- of the work is to convince Great Britain that not only are the citizens of her outlying lands not colonists, hut that those lands cannot even be made into a federation; they are, or must soon become, citizens of independent nations.
The United States of the British Empire is a dream. Against it Mr. Jebb sets the fact that the interests of the lands are diverse, and that one of them cannot allow the others to outvote her on a question. He says:
The assumption which underlies such phrases as “ the expansion of England,’* or *' Greater Britain," and suggests the fnmiliiir principle of federation as theological form of closer union, is not justified by the tendency either of instinctive sentiment orof actual developments in Canada and Australia. So far as generalization is possible it may be said that there Is not, in fact, any growing consciousness of a common nationality, but exactly the reverse. In other words, the basis of imperial federation, instead of expanding and solidifying, is melting away.
He.is an ardent advocate of the "Five Nations " creed, and frankly acknowledges himself a pupil of Kipling. " In dull, ephemeral prose," he says ln a fervid apostrophe to that poet. ** I repeat the message, as 1 heard it, of your Immortal song."
Britain’s
Four
What are to be the terms on which Great Britain is to live with her four independent bedfellows— Independent Canada, Australia, New Bedfellows. Zealand, and South Africa?
If not a federation, there must at least be an alliance. To make this proposition a little more palatable in English imperialistic eyes, Mr. Jebb sweetens it by suggesting that the alliance of these independent and co-equal nations will develop into an ** imperial partnership." But even the caution necessary to make his words carry conviction to English readers barely prevents him from predicting that in this partnership the controlling interest will pass from Little England," as he calls it, to the nations of the future. For England's army he does not conceal his contempt, nor his belief in the superiority of the new nations' troops, and on the tariff he makes it plain that the nations' desires should control.
Mr. Jebb*s imperial partnership would carry on jointly the work of administering ** the subject countries," meaning those ! which roust remain mere colonies. Be admits that the new nations have scant sympathy at present with the ** Roman imperialism *’ of England, in which they have no share, and that Roman imperialism is becoming characteristic of English-speaking democracy, Tet he looks for a change in that respect, based on the fact that the United States has now shifted to Roman imperialism, and that the example of the United States has never failed powerfully to influence thought in the new nations. “ The magnetism of America " is his phrase for this influence, and he shows that Australia modeled her commonwealth on American principles, and that Canada has never escaped America's ** intellectual influence."
Australia’s hostility to " Roman Imperialism ” is attributed by Mr. Jebb to the tradition and example of the American Republic, ** which was admired as the classical example of modern democracy untainted by Old World influence.” Hence he expects America’s conversion to imperialism to prepare the way for a reaction in the younger democracies. America, he says, has ventured into Roman imperialism in defiance of its own traditions and of all predictions.” It did SO by instinct, regardless of the weight of argument. The imperialists covered it up by pretending that they were merely carrying on the legitimate expansion " of their country, which had carried it westward from the Atlantic to the Pacific. This Mr. Jebb considers an audacious subterfuge, and he thinks it has already broken down and is no longer held forth as a pretext. He seems to regard Mr. Roosevelt as either the author or the chief proponent of this subterfuge.”
To accomplish the downfall of federalism and the establishment or independence he looks to the Conservative Party. The Liberals are identified by tradition with the. concession of colonial autonomy, but when that party had freed the colonies from the principal restrictions on their domestic autonomy it called a halt.

has since played a-reactionary part, and the hope of the Nationalists lies in its rival. ■	.	.■■	it-	:
-	Mr.	Jebb*s	book Is7
written In" a calmty cocksure spirit, which does not combat con-; trary opinions, but Ignores them as anti-quatcd and exploded doctrines. He writes as if h^ were stating mathematical truth concerning which no dispute was possible. Emerson’s sage t*d-vice to disputants, ** Assume a consent, and it shall presently be granted to you,” has been his guiding star. That there is any possibility whatever of side-tracking or avoiding the aspirations of the Nationalists, or that any other solution than full independence is possible, is to him too idle a	suggestion	to	deserve even the tribute
I of	a	contemptuous wave of the hand. He
passes all such suggestions by. and the calm conviction of his manner seems likely to make a more powerful impression on the British mind than if he argued in an humbler spirit. For the hint that the colonies are offering England her choice of such independence as he suggests or such independence as the American colonies achieved seems to breathe from every page, though never uttered in vords.
Everything he says is stated with a confidence that dreams not of the possi-: bility of contradiction. This makes the book attractive. There Is not a dull line In it; not even to American readers, whose i risibilities are likely to be excited where he applies this same cocksure method to their affairs.
For a large share of the book is devoted to the United States. Indeed, it is in the behavior of this country that he finds some of his strongest reasons—not for arguing the substitution of nationalism for federation, for he disdains to argue that point, but for showing the existence of this unconquerable nationalist sentiment, Canada must not be left much longer at . the mercy of an unscrupulous and conscienceless power which uses Great Britain as a cats paw and hamstrings the Do-I minion's commercial interests at every point. Canada must be made independent, so that she can negotiate with the United States on even terms as a free and equal nation, and can even fight the United States where necessary.
Though he does not anywhere use the word " war,*’ he Intimates plainly his deI sire for such a degree of Independence that each of tbe five nations can support its own navies for its own purposes. The ; Atlantic fleet must bo Canada’s. Austra-! 11a must have a fleet sufficient to protect herself from undesirable new neighbors. There has already been too much colonig-; ing In the South Pacific, and Australia's ! protests have not availed to stop it. Her interests have been made the sport of European politics. Were she independent, had she a navy of her own, undesirable neighbors would hesitate about approach-1 ing. This is the plain and obvious intimation of a book which has to avoid certain unpleasant words for fear of scaring the class of readers it is meant to convince, and yet which hesitates not to convey the meaning of those words.
As to Canada the intimation is made'so plainly that the dullest reader cannot escape it. Canada has been roused to an anger which must not longer b'e disregarded. She has seen her interests sacrificed time and again to England's desire to curry favor with the United States. The straw that broke the camel’s back was the Alaska boundary decision. There England deliberately betrayed Canada for the sake of a mirage—a wild dream of securing the friendship of America. That ; friendship can never be secured, for America cynically uses this hope of England’s only to win her own desires, and in the end acts toward England as she pleases. There never can be any friendship between England and America in which England does not give all and get I nothing. Canada understands the dishon-! est and treacherous character of the Americans, and could meet them with full : knowledge of how to deal with such peo-pie if made free.
I "Alike upon me football field and in the International court,” he says, the Englishman calls a * foul ' where the Ameri-I can applauds ‘ smart ’ play."
There is nothing very new in Mr. Jebb’s ideas of the United States, from.the Ca-j nadian standpoint, but the profound cocksureness with which he discusses American affairs makes them decidedly unusual and interesting. For example, he has devoted many pages, not so much to demonstrating as to accepting as an indisputable fact that Americans generally are of the kind whose acquaintance Martin Chuzzlewlt enjoyed. America stands on an eminence all her own in the reaim of dishonesty and treachery. Yet there are Theodore Roosevelt and John Hay, who are not dishonest and treacherous; how can they be immersed in the filth which constitutes American diplomacy?
The answer is simple. They are figureheads, tossed this way and that by the real rulers of the Republic. This might seem a proposition worth arguing, but to argue would be. to depart from Mr. Jebb’s oracular position. The standards of honesty held by Roosevelt and Hay, he says, do not “differ so widely from
our own/'-The dishonesty which he has.
: deScribed ls as he lias described!!.' Thev i explanation is that " the Chicago dollar-■: fetter,” the real ruler, enforces his-own.
>	foreign - policy, " flouting the feelings of : tbs'figurehead In the White House.” ^Roosevelt and Hay are " the seductive figureheads to cover the intended swindle," to’ be sacrificed ruthlessly When the. purpose Is accomplished. If 'Roosevelt has failed to control '* the American monster,** what will bd the prospect of fair-play : when a less upright figurehead takes .his place? ” None at all; and Canada must be free against tbe arrival ot that other figurehead.

sion consisting or three impartial jurists on each 3ido. Instead of appointing impartial jurists they appointed Secretary Root and Senators Lodge and Turner, who were strong partisans of the American case. By a curious inconsistency Mr. Jebb thinks Canada ought to have had the right to appoint the three British Commissioners, evidently so that she could get three strong partisans of her case on the commission—at least there Is no other reason apparent. Instead she got two, Sir Louis Jette and Mr., Ayles-worth, who stood out as stoutly for the Cansulian case as did Root, Lodge, and Turner for the American case. But the decision was made by the casting vote of Chief Justice Alverstone, the English Commissioner, and it was for the American contention.
Here Mr. Jebb Is under a difficulty. For the first time his fluent pen halts. It is a serious matter to accuse an English Judge of playing politics in a judicial decision. In words, cold and formal words, he therefore exculpatcs Lord Alverstone; but by every possible insinuation he nullifies the effect of this disclaimer. The Chief Justice’s " national environment ” was against him. He knew that the British Government was anxious to have the question settled " and would thankfully sacrifice Canadian rights to placate American jlngyjsm." upon him would be thrown “ the onus of a dead--lock.” ** The dice was loaded " against Canada 4‘ by the appointment of an English Judge.” The Americans had ** a tribunal which they could trust."
" The impossibility of relying upon national or international honor " in dealing with the United States is further illustrated by a review of the Geneva arbitration, in which It appears that the too-confiding and too candid Britons were outplayed by that slick Yankee trickster, Charles Francis Adams. Mr. Jebb charges that Adams studied the character of his opponents so as to find the weak places in their armor, instead of judging the case coldly and judiciously, and that the United States broke faith in its manner of presenting its claims. Adams’s appointment is compared to Root’s to show that American diplomacy Is the same In all decades.
The most humorous thing in the book, however, is the assertion that The London Times’s American correspondent was ** the chosen instrument ” of a plot conceived by Washington to prejudice England against the Canadian case. That gentleman has had to suffer much criticism in his varied career, but It Is probably the first time that such a charge has been lodged against him. As usual, Mr. Jebb does not put It forth as a possibility, but asserts it as a fact of universal notoriety.
While it was Canadian anxiety to cope on even terms with the United States which gave the first impulse to the national movement, in Australia the' hope of improved facilities for commerce prompted the first steps toward unity. The national sentiment, however, was stimulated chiefly by foreign intrusion-first by France In Tahiti and New Guinea and later by the Samoan and other incidents. These things destroyed the tradl-! tion that " foreign complications" were a trouble belonging only to far-off Eu~ rope. This it was which led to the establishment of the commonwealth In 1901.
The sending of the Prince of Wales (then the Duke of York) to open the first Federal Parliament was, in Mr. Jebb’s view, an act of doubtful policy. Attempts to " familiarize' new countries and new democracies with old-world notions of social distinction " do not work out well. A limited class is gratified; a larger class is mortified by exclusion from active participation, ” while the masses of democracy witness the whole spectacle with mixed feelings. Meanwhile, English newspapers supply their readers with expected narratives of loyal demonstrations and give them little opportunity to see behind the scenes."
In fact, Mr. Jebb betrays Loyalty the most open and profound from contempt for “ loyalty." He ftf(- jeers at the word. It is evi-Atar UTff aent that to him, If not to IS other Nationalists, all Idea of Absurd, loyalty to a far-off ruling kingdom Is an anachronism. The influence of the South African war apon the cause of nationalism is shown
to. have been very- great. The old-fash-toned colonialism had assumed that the mother country should take the whole., -burden of protecting every part of tho empire, .'with no reciprocal obligation on the colony. The Boer war developed the difference between the national and the colonial frame of mind. The coloniesen-listed In, the war because they felt that av colony was involved—:that It was a mat- ;v ter of colonial defense. They sent trbopa v with many misgivings about how .these, untrained men'would appear by . thcr side of the British veterans. They found that in every respect except courage, ; where they were on a par, the colonial, troops excelled. the regulars.	i-
In the Boxer affair naval contingents were contributed by the new nations, but the enterprise was not popular. No colo- . nial Interest was at stake there, and public opinion in the new nations condemned the affair as liable to mislead the British into believing in the “ loyalty " of the colonies and into misunderstanding the national sentiment.
The South African war had completely reversed traditional colonialism. Hitherto it had been assumed that the colonies, but for the protection of the British Army, were at the mercy of the first intruder. This theory was gone entirely, and the effect on national pride was^ great. It further led to a condemnation of the Idea that any " partner State " had a right to interfere in the Internal affairs of a sister State.
Mr, Jebb’s fluent statements of things that are not so when he deals with American matters should not prejudice the reader against his work. It is a very strong statement of the claims of the new nations to imperial rank. It is not strong in its reasons for the recognition; as before mentioned, Mr. Jebb does not reason so much as he asserts. But it is strong as a statement of a national aspiration which must be reckoned with.
If the feeling is anything like so strong as he declares, England cannot safely delay for long the placing of the nations in the position they demand.
