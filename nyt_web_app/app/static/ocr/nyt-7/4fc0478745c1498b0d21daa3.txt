KctD Tori: Times Book Review:
I see in your issue o£ July 1 a letter from Mr. Clow on " Poetry in This Bustling Age,” in which he claims that the critics too frequently " confound poetry with verse," but is that not altogether begging the question? \
There may be " exact sciences,” but the arts claim a wider license, and poetry, the freest of them all In essence, depends quite as much on moods as meter.
Who is to decide on what Is “ good poetry ** or wbat is only M bad verse”?
Mr. Teats gets out of the difficulty glibly, by saying that poetry Is M always strange, obscure, and unreal to all who have not understanding.” Hawthorne says: *' A poet has a fragrance about him such as no other human being is gifted withaL" Who does not hold his nose should therefore recognize a true poet by his scent. Of course, the minor poets, that is, the " poor poets,” who- haven’t got a cent, would be ignored, Milton said the three prime elements of poetry were to be simple, sensuous, and passionate, and illustrated either his sincerity or
truthfulness by making "nis own verse ' elaborate, spiritual, and frigid. Walt Whitman evidently thought that poetry consisted in placing a capital letter at the j beginning of every line. This was a stroke of true genius, as it founded a n6w school, and gave him both reputation and popularity. Any one can, of course, write prose, (at least, all think they can,) and by chopping your lines Into such'lengths as suited your fancy, (five words in one,
: perhaps twenty in the next) and always ! carefully stationing a capital letter at the I beginning of each line, see—Presto! you have converted your pages of commonplace prose into certainly very uncommonly placod poetry. We have lately had a book from an infant prodigy, a little girl, whose effusions are said to resemble remarkably these ” capitalized ” » catalogues and categories of the *' Whitman-lacs.” We, who belong to the very large class of “ poor poets" should welcome these innovations, as we do not have to . depend on “ capital ” at all, but o>ity on I ” capitals ” In this ease.
! Mr. Clow, however, very modestly j ignores the very effective methods now frequently adopted by certain publishers, whom I shall classify as '* petty publishers,” in suppressing the superfluous sing-er—that is, in eliminating the ” minor poet,” who, of course, must be a ** poor I poet.’* The " co-operative ” contract is the weapon on which the “P. P.s ” rely;
: under this the “ minor poet,” or unknown author, contributes cash " payments ” in advance; the “ P. P.” gives liberally, too, but only ” promises.” With the sharp competition that now exists in poetic “ aspirations,” if not in ” inspirations,” i the market for meter is overstocked. Any method, therefore, that can decimate the ; ranks of these dealers in decorated diction must benefit the survivors* and as there Is an overruling Providence that arranges always everything for'the best, it is safe to assume that only the unfit become ” decimated ” by tho M P. P.s,” while the '* Laureates M are always preserved and prosper.
Yet, I must frankly confess that I entertain some mild misgivings still as to the efficacy of this sacrifice of the ” minor poet ” in behalf of the '* master singers.” When I come to think of It, and search the record, I discover that even the Lordly Laureates at one time belonged to the class of ” minor-poets.” The very biggest bards were born small, and had to begin as—beginners; and, therefore, had these later ** Laureates,” while still in the " M. P.” stag© of development, fallen into the clutches of the more or j less piratical " P. P.s they would have been sacrificed to the co-operation of the M co-operative contract,” and that, in the long run, would not only have left the world the poorer, but the publishers also.
After all. it might not prove best to intrust the future of poetry to the petty publishers, whosw natural prey seems to be the minor poet.
All of the big bards, the master singers whose ” laureled lines ” now echo through tho agts. must have once beMi merely potty poets, plucked by the petty publisher?, '\nd pilloried by the captious critic. Tennyson for ten years was a standing joke. Browning for twenty years had to defray the coist of his own book3. poor FitzGerald had to s^ll his first and only ediijon of Omar Khayyam at J» cents a copy, and his “ laurels ” graced only a tomb.
On thr othpr hand, Tapper’s “ Prove rbial Philosophy ” was once hrld to be a vrork of original genius, and scon went through thirty editions. "Robert Pollok’s *' Course of Time ” once widely read and largely admired; Drayton’s epitaph claims
his “laurels'" were immortal, yet, though-this * memorial is In "Westminster- Abbey, ■ who cares to read his verse'to-day J
*	Say what -we will* believe as we -may, that the masses are asses, it 1% after all, the great uncritical public that, in the long run. awards to the one *4 stars,” to the other ** stripes,” and to most of us that oblivion, which Is doubtless the flimi doom of all. Until an author, whether he write poetry or prose, has had an opportunity of appealing (through a sufficiently largo edition) to this wider public, even the most captious critic would confess— that the crucial test yet remains' to be made.	.	.
^ Critics may pillory a '* poor poet,” but only the publishers t»an effectually suppress him. Even a '* Milton,” if forever 4t mute,” would remain also forever ” Inglorious.”
Give the minor poet at least as fair a chance as you would grant a murderer. Let him stand trial before his only ju^y— that " grand jury,” the public, and to attain that end, ho must have at least one edition of not less than 1,000 or 2,000 copies, and a really reliable and honest publisher. No one Is morg likely to appreciate and honor one of that sort than the ** M. P.” who has been manipulated and suppressed by the co-operation of the MP- P.” and his co-operative contract.
