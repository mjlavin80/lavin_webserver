BOSTON NOTES.;
A New Story by Laura E. Richards— Bliss Carman's New Book.
RS. TREES WILL./’ Mrs. Laura E. Richards's new story, now almost ready for publication by Messrs. Dana Estes & Co., Is a very good exhibition of human nature tinder the crying experience defined by Mrs. Gummidge as " money left*” To those entirely unacquainted with the series to which the book belongs It will teem like a series of cleverly told anecdotes of New England rustics, but each little story fits neatly into place in the mosaic of Quahaug life and into the history of three generations of New England gentry. The manner of life an J thought which it records is fast disap. pt-anng before the advance of Summer boarders* ways, but no comer of the country ever furnished so good an example of what the American means by equality as could be found in the New England village of an earlier time, and Mrs. Richards perfectly knows many such places and their people.

The " Teddy ” series having come to an end, Miss Anna Chapin Ray begins a new group this year, and In the Autumn Messrs. Little, Brown & Co. will publish ** Sidney; Her Summer on the St. Lawrence." ^ Sidney is a clever girl with plenty of girlish wit and girlish desire for enjoyment, but with no sympathy for hoydens or for general unruliness. Such naughtiness as the book contains Is confided to Ruth ond " Bungay," small but capable children. The scene of the story became familiar to the author while she was writing ** By the Good. Sainte Anne." Her *' On the Firing Line,” which sold very well from the time of publication, has suddenly taken a new start, possibly because of the interest In Lord Kitchener revived by his differences with tho Viceroy of India.
Mr. Bliss Carman’s new volume, the fifth in *' The Pipes of Pan Series,” may almost be counted as fiction in Its claim upon general interest, for at least half Its space is occupied by love stories told in a variety of measures, and the remaining contents are well described by the title “The Book of Valentines," “ Yvan-hoe Ferra/* ** The Ballad of the Young King’s Madness,” and " Across the Courtyard ” are among the ballads. ** A Letter from Lesbos," written to Gorgo, fretting in Egyptian exile and "* sickening for the home wind, for the first white gleam of Metylene,” is the finest thing in the book, having musical quality so intense that one can scarcely read It silently, so strong is the temptation to givclt voice. The book will be bound in green and gold, with the end papers printed In green. The publishers will be Messrs. L. C. Page & Co.
M Mrs. Jim and Mrs. Jimmie ” have published engraved cards for what they are pleased to call a series of subscription entertainments to be given during the season of 1905, the " subscription" being the price of the book. As the cards are inclosed in an envelope of the sort used for ceremonial stationery, the little Joke will undoubtedly be effective, but both of Stephen Conrad's books have been so well received that It was hardly needed.

The August .Atlantic is to be a fiction number, and among its stories will be ** We,” by Mr. C. D. Stewart, the an- i thor of ** The Fugitive Blacksmith M ; | " The Baritone and the Office Boy,” by Miss Katharine M. Roof; *' The Pilgrim Chamber,” by Miss Alice Brown, and & story by Mr. William J. Hopldns, entitled
The Clammer," a word evoking dread Visions of possible " Lobsterers ” and M Oysterers ” to come. Miss Repplier tells j a true convent story, calling it ** Un i Congfi sans Cloche,*’ and Miss Mary H, Vorse writes of “The Breaking-In of a Yachtsman's Wife," describing a process to which only the rich, and not all of them, axe compelled to submit. ** The Romance of the Milky Way/* by the late Lafcadlo S- Hearn; •* In Summing/' by Mr. Arthur Stanley Pier; "Above the Clouds," by Anna Seaton Schmidt, and 44 An Apology for the Country/’ by Mr. Arthur S. Colton, are among the essays, and there also, happiest promise of all, will be ** Balzac,” a criticism by Mr. Henry James.
The new volume of the Cosy Corner Series, Miss Frances Margaret Fox’s ** How Christmas Came to the Mul-vaneys ** has nothing^ to do with Terence of the inextinguishable sorrow, Tmt tells of seven children of his set' who took a new road to the inevitable felicity of the Christmas story ending. Their mother is not the witty angel of the fashionable tale, but as unamlable of speech as most women would be, doomed to daily toil at the washtub, and her good deeds count for as little with her offspring as they will count with small readers, .who decidedly prefer cross mothers in fiction. :iIt.is to be hoped, that by jpr^QUce wlth;
1 her name they will learn not to call Ter-i ence, “ Mulvaney,” as is the way of the i Bostonian when speaking of '* Soldiers Three.’’	_

The author of " The Grapple.” of which notice was given some weeks ago, is Mrs. Grace MacGowan Cooke, one of the coauthors of ” Return.” The new story will be published in August by Messrs. L. C. Page & Co.

Messrs. Little, ferown & Co. will complete the illustrated Little Women St-ries in the Autumn with Under the Lilacs ” and " Jack and Jill,” the former to be illustrated by Miss Alice Barber Stephens, the latter by Miss Harriet Roosevelt
Richards. The series includes eight volumes, which are sold separately if desired. Its pictures make it attractive even to children who have read, the stories in the simpler earlier editions, and the plan of issuing them from season to season has been found very effective in awakening young buyers to the conception of various editions, a matter as to which voracious little readers were once left in profound indifference.
