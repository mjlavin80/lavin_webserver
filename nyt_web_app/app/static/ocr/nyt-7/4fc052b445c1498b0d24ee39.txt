Certain mystical writings of the. late^ 1
Lady Dilke are included with a memoir of 1
the author in a volume entitled <rThe
Book of the Spiritual Life," (E. PC Dutton*
Sc Co., $3.) The memoir, which occupies*.
about half of the volume is the work o£
Lady Dilke's second husband, the Right1
Hon. Sir Charles W. Dilke. Bart., M. P., ‘
and is embellished with portraits of the.
lady. One as Miss E. Francis Strong,, one
as Mrs. Mark Pattison, one as Lady Dilke.-" The memoir dwells (naturally) much upon;> spiritual and literary aspects, and will be'-found dull by readers who are not al- • ready immensely Interested in the wo-;* man which it commemorates. It appears-* that Emilia Francis Strong was sprung from a family of Georgia Tories who made themselves conspicuous in tho: American War of the Revolution, and that, both she and her husband and biographer had no little pride in that circumstance.
Sir Charles has much to say of the early
•	religious disposition of his wife, of- ■ her proneness to ** Popish practices/' like con-
•	fession and penance, and dwells upon" the Influence of Ruskln during her youth and later. He relates also an incident of her student days at South Kensington, when,; for writing upon the Government bulletin’1 board “Lost, Strayed or'Stolen—A sAndyhaired puppy answering to the name of1
Lieut. -----/* she was solemnly haled " bo-1'
fore the Lord President." Lieut. ---------was
an army engineer detailed for duty at tho schools, and ho had' previously placed • upon the bulletin a notico that ^ tho ‘ young lady who had taken his dog1 'was Instantly to return it to the owner.” Miss ■ Strong married Mark Pattison In 1861, and Sir Charles tells what reason there is for considering, the resulting coupje the model of George Eliot's Casaubon and Dorothea In " Mlddlemarch.” It seems George Eliot got data from the Pattlsons at least. . The memoir considers the influence of the Rector of Lincoln upon, the lady, her txixv-els, her art studies, her contributions to, the British press, and, finally, after her* second marriage .her work as an*apostle of labor and female emancipation, touching of course, also, upon the many: Car mous men And women whose lives wer®. more.or Jess intimately linked with that of this remarkably busy lady.
; Lady Pilke’s own work included In tho ;volume consists of six contemplative essays entitled as follows: "Of the Spiritual Life,*' “ O^ Love, and Sorrow,” J- Of. •Prayer, and Praise,’* V Of Labors and ’ Learning/' "Of the Hills and Plains,"**
“ Of the Woods and Fields," all rhapsodic to a degree apa full of' citations from St. Augustine, Dante, Comte, Rus-, kin, after the manner of the learned in. tongues and the aesthetically devout . Sir Charles has added to complete tho vol.-. ume two stories from his wife's pen, both •of, mystic character, but of no particular, value. .-They are named -*■ The Mirror of the Soul1 ” ana V Tho Last Hour/’	.	.
