New York Times Boon Review:
The Atlantic Monthly is out with a card which says: " The plans of The Atlantic for 1903 and 1906 allow but a limited space for verse. As the needs of the magazine are already largely supplied, Its editors are compelled to request that further contributions of verse be withheld for the present.” Hurrah and Ichabod!
Hurrah for the magazine that tacitly acknowledges the necessity for calling: a halt on Its rhymed contributions, a halt that should be changed to a halter wherewith to hang until dead the verse writers
who have so lowered the standard of rhymed contributions that the standard of the magazine has become imperiled Ichabod! The magazine whose very first numbers gave us “ Santa Filomena,” “ The Relief of Lucknow/’ " Sandalphon,” “ The Gift of Tritemius,” all beautiful poems, exquisite expression of exquisite impression, earthly interpretation of the language of the gods—now gives us the vapid vaporlngs of a few shameless word-weavers—verse that gives God and the readers nausea,
When did the sacrilege begin, this christening of lukewarm verse with the beautiful name of poem7 It began when two so-called clever men discovered that they could hoodwink editors with a tins-a-llng set of words framed in lines of equal length beginning with capital letters. Two men whose names are to-day still blazoned on book covers and in tables of contents—two men who have “ appeared " more times than all the rest of American verse writers put together, and neither of whom has ever written a quotable stanza!
Again hurrah for the magazine that sous the error of It3 way, and asks a truce Ln order that It may think it over and endeavor to find a way back to the lost paradise of poetry.
Ichabod! From those great eyes The sonl has fled:
When thought Is lest, when fancy dies, The verse is deadl
Then pay the reverence of old days ToJPoetry’3 fame;
Warn backward with averted gaze.
And hide the shame 1	_
