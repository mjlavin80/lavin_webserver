earthIy paradise
T was in ** The Time Machine,” if memory serves, that H. G, Wells imagined a race of men existing many ages hence, fair-skinned, small of stature, handsome, helpless, and nonproductive, whiling away ^heir lives in the sunshine of an effete world. A similar type is imagined by "Merejkoffsky, a Russian writer, who has written a *' Utopian ” book called in German ** Das t Irdische Paradies,” and published in Berlin by Gotthelner. But there are two other distinct types of humanity in Merejkoffsky*s ISarthly Paradise, the toilers and the protectors.
The time Is A. D. 2700, the scene the tropical regions. The lands of the north are desolate, and the human race is reduced to a few millions. The flowejr of the race, the nobility, the small, fair, handsome ’ folks, product of the wisest scientific selection, enjoy living for thirty years and then gently pass away. They are strangers alike to civilization and to labor.
The toilers, on the other band, keep the new system In running order. They are the dusky descendants of the lowest classes. The protectors, the custodians of science and the technical arts, hold the reins of government. They are the successors of contemporaneous mankind.
So much for the fantasy in Merejkoff- . sky’s book. His imaginary picture will not make any healthy human being tdgh for the joys of his Utopia, But the essence of his work, of course, lies in its sharp criticism of life as we are living It. In the transition which leads to the establishment of his paradise applied science and industries are marvelously developed. Overeducation causes satiety and a spread*of suicidal mania The harmony of life seems destroyed. The dominion of the Anglo-Saxon Is followed by a socialistic upheaval, which is succeeded by a world war involving the Aryan and Mongolian races. Excesses of every description disgrace the large cities. Some of the foremost thinkers conceive the idea of annihilating the human race, from which'-gradually evolves the idea of a scientific ennoblement of mankind. A secret society of philosophers and legislators (foreshadowed by Nietzsche) whfijft is organized somewhat after the pattern of the Jesuit order, is at work destroying by scientific means tbe Mongolian, Semitic, and African races. The earth is largely depopulated and freed from the unfit. In the course of centuries, following a carefully planned and Ingeniously executed policy of wise selection, a new. white race of Slavo-Romanic extraction is evolved, as well as a darker race for the toil Incident to the new system.

These races are settled in the most fruitful parts of the earth, 'which are the only regions fit to be Inhabited.
Merejkoff sky considers progress detestable. The - higher the plane on which a creature stands the more capable It is of
*	suffering and pain. Progress is merely a matter of appearance; the spirit of the human race to-day, he thinks, Is much inferior *o that displayed by the ancient Greek and Roman peoples. Hard labor is an evil. The savage throws the burden of it on his wife, the ancients relegated it to their slaves, we shift its burden on the working class. Healthy, natural man does not need to acquire knowledge. He needs, however, to be close to nature, to sing, to dance, to swim, to be happy, to play. He requires no knowledge of read’ tng or writing, no houses or clocks, no culture or luxuries to be happy. All he requires is freedom from care for his daily bread and an enjoyment of his beautiful environment.
