Liongxnans, Green & Co. will send out Immediately “ A Systematic Course of Practical Organic Chemistry," by Lionel G. Radcliffe and Frank S. Sinnatt, both of the Municipal School of Technology, Manchester, England. In preparing the course, it is pointed out in the brief preface that the authors " have taken care to select, as far as possible, only such experiments in illustration ot typical reactions as can be performed by a student working two consecutive periods, or in all about five hours a week.” All illustrations of apparatus to be used have been omitted. The objects of the' " course," the authors write, have been to induce the student to think, to read his theoretical textbooks, to work intelligently and? exactly, and to recognize the connected character of the study of practical and theoretical organic chemistry." It is not intended to give the student an " elaborate H knowledge of organic’ preparation work and quantitative methods.
The volume is printed on one side of the page, the^ opposite one having been • left blank, presumably for additional notes by the student- It has been divided into “ exercises/* beginning with a consider— , at J on of the detection of carbon, nitrogen, bromine,, sulphur, iodine, &c.; on the preparation of certain organic acids, the preparation and .properties of nltrlle. and of esters! the preparation of ethereal salts of the alcoholds; &c.; the compounds of ... benzine, ori ultimate analysis,-and a spe~ ; clal'part for students advanced in "the sub- "* ject closes the book.	.	..
