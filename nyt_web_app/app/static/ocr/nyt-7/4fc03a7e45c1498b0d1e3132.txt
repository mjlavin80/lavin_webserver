Not Ed3tor of the ** Cameo- F*oe.”
New York Times Book Review:
I see In your columns a not© from Father Tabb protesting against two or threo alleged errors in the text of the poems found in the Cameo edition of Poe's works. He says that I was the editor of this work. This is error No. 1 for Father Tabb- For I was not the editor, nor n.m I named as editor in any of the volumes. At the request of the publishing house I wrote a paper on " Tlie Art and Genius of Poe,” and it was used as an introduction to the volume containing the Poe poems. This Is all the hand that I had in the en-terprisc. So Father Tabb—long life to him and his poetic fame!—will have to look elsewhere for the cause of his grievances, I may say that I happen to know the editor of the Cameo Foe; and he is considered one of the most careful and scholarly men in New York City. So if there be errors in the work It is hard to account for them. We may find that the alleged errors are hot errora, but only variant readings. It Js weU lenown that Poe made many alterations In his poems, even after they had appeared In print.
