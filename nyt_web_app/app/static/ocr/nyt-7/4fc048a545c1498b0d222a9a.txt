The Spelling of ** Pergami,
TQete York Times Book RetHew:	.
It will probably Interest others as ■well as your correspondent G. H. Sass, Charleston, S. C., to know that Cleric! la undoubtedly correct in spelling the name of Queen Caroline’s alleged lover " Pergami." I have not yet seen Clericl’s book, and do not know, therefore, Just how much research It shows, nor whether i the name and character of Pergami are discussed therein. I have before me a$ I write several contemporary reports and other documents dealing with the affair, including a copy of the Report of the Lords* Committee, July 4, 1S20, recommending *' a legislative proceeding M of divorce, and a copy of the bill for the divorce of their Majesties introduced in the House of Lords on the day following. Throughout the latter the phrase, *' tho said Bartolomo Pergami, otherwise Bar-tolomo Bergaml,” Is used. In view of the fact that the King’s advisers had the most expert detective agencies in Europe at work for many long months, who left no stone unturned and ruthlessly ferreted out all Pergami’s movements for years, it is safe to say that the name used in the Lords* ’bill Is the correct one.
Heading the contemporary accounts at this late day in the magazines and parliamentary records, one is impressed by the infamous amount of suborned and perjured testimony given against the Queen, and the fact that tho British Government sank so low as to procure the testimony of convicts of the lowest and basest type against the Queen. Even more remarkable is the mass of evidence showing that the sympathies of the people were with the' Queen almost without exception.
