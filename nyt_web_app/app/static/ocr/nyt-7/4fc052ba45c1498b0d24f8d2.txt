AN EVIL SPIRIT.
The Occult Gravely nnd Ably Treated in Mr* E. P. Benson's New Novel.5*
O	the uninitiated or constitutionally skepticar in matters occult, Mr. Benson's “ Image in the Sand " must seem', spite of its literary power and adroitness, somewhat disingenuous. For, if these things are so profoundly real, they must be real to all, must, therefore, be communicable, and if communicable, ■why not to many, why not to us? Is it not strange that one never by any chance meets upon one's way men and women who unite with their experience of the supermundane and extranatural such sound intelligence, such essential sanity as the people in Mr. Benson’s novel? And why do not the scientific experts in real life who are present at “ manifestations,*' although they came to scoff, remain to pray? These questions are commonplace but inevitable. Until they are satisfactorily answered Mr. Benson’s “ Image in the Sand," like Mr. Hamlin Garland’s recent ,l The Tyranny of the Dark," can hardly be taken with all the seriousness that its author evidently demands. For all that, the quiet, intense conviction of Mr. Benson’s pages cannot fail entirely of a certain impressiveness.	I
The obvious setting of “ The Image in the Sand " is just a Uttle tawdry and worn. It is at Luxor that Miss Corelli might have placed the scene of a similar story; it is in her strident pages that the evil spirit of an ancient Egyptian might have gained power over the soul of an English girL But here any comparison must end, and it is Mr. Benson’s praise to have infused into these melodramatic circumstances a genuine dignity.
The starting point of the story that Mr. Benson has to tell Is the quench-
#	less desire of Sir Henry Jervis not only to feel near him the spiritual presence of his dead wife, but to " materialize M ' her spirit, and to know once more her beloved sight and touch* But to such an attempt his Egyptian servant and medium, Abdul, (a character of engaging but incredible beauty,) refuses to lend himself, and thus Sir Henry trusts himself to an English spiritualist, Henderson, who, through the possession of an amulet, hopes to “ materialize ” the spirit of an ancient Egyptian, to make that spirit and all its evil force subservient to his power, and thus to gain deeper insight into the impalpable realms beyond. The attempt succeeds —with fatal consequences. The evil spirit assumes for a moment the form of Sir Henry’s wife, changes, and enters, though not with all the fullness of its power, the body of Ida, Sir Henry’s daughter, who comes upon the scene. Sir Henry dies, and Ida, from that dread moment on, is at intervals possessed by the evil spirit of Set-nekht. This spirit Henderson alone can loose and bind, and, since he loves Ida, he exerts over her the power thus gained,
■	until, to free his beloved mistress, Abdul slays him.
So brief a statement of the book's central action leaves untouched its various though somewhat thin human interest. and does not discuss Its subsidiary characters, who seem to become more real and vital the more earthy and earthly and the further removed from spiritual influences Mr. Benson represents them to be. It leaves untouched, too, the quite brilliant London chapters toward the middle of the book, in
*
which Mr. Benson assumes for a time the sparkling airs and weary graces of Robert Hichens of “ Green Carnation ** days.
But it is, after all* this central action and the phenomena that it involves for the sake of which Mr. Benson has writ-
•	ten *' The Image in the Sand*" and it is but scant justice to an author to slight his most earnest appeal and concentrate attention on non-essentials.'
It is fair to say, then, that Mr. Benson has stated his case with true imaginative power. To deal through many
pages with such things as “ possession *’ and “ materialization ” and not to seem for a moment either hysterical or vulgar—this is no despicable literary achievement. For, as a matter of fact, one does, rightly or wrongly, suspect such discussions and such stories both of hysteria and vulgarity. But, though

the imagination is momentarily convinced and the taste satisfied, one is still haunted by a senae of the complete vanity of it all. For there are few men and women who would not wish, nay, who do not crave, some vision of the world invisible could they but come to believe, upon some sane and worthy ground, that that invisible world does indeed surround us, and that we may come into contact with that essence of things which, according to Kant, underlies all phenomenal appearances. But where are those worthy and appealing reasons? Surely, as Mr. Benson himself confesses, not in the ordinary mediumistic performances. Neither are they to be found, one may add, in the trances of a Mrs. Piper, on whom the late Mr. F. W. H. Meyers seems to have staked his facile faith. And, on the other hand, we are confronted with the* attitude of modern psychology, which shirks any statement as to the soul’s entity, tells us of faculties and capacities that have their definite lodgment in brain centres, tells us of the interdependence of brain and mind, and, alas! proves its case. To trust science too fanatically is undoubtedly a mistake. But the other side has yet to make out a case for itself. Until then, it may be repeated, such books as Mr. Benson’s will remain totally negligible as philosophy, whatever their fascination as fiction. ~
