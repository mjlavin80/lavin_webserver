Ei SEEM to be publishing, as it were, a ** f euilleton ** about the writings of John Hay. In previous articles we have deliberately ignored The Breadwinners,” which was the literary sensation of the year now . twenty-two years ago, which “boomed” tor that year the magazine in which it appeared as a serial, and afterward, one supposes, showed at least fairly satisfactory pecuniary results for the publishers who brought it out in book form. But now that M The Breadwinners” is so conclusively established, by evidence positive and negative, internal and external, to have been written by John Hay, the situation is changed. One is at liberty to treat it as one of his works. And the first thing one has to say about it ia that it is by far the most important of his work in prose, so much the most important that there is no longer any use In talking about the ” Castilian Bays *’ or any other of his amateur excursions into literature.
The second title of “ The Breadwinners ” is “ A Social Study.** But that Was distinctly the first title in the mind of the author. As we have said about the '* Castilian Days n we may say of this later and riper work: what there is in it of literature is a by-product- It escaped. The author was all the time
*
primarily a politician, in the good sense, a publicist. What mainly interested him was the social and political problem with which he dealt. Truly, nothing human was foreign to him. It would be most unfair to call his love story ” padding/* But in rereading the book in 1905, as in reading it in 1883, one feels that what he had in mind was the notion, so grandiosely expressed by Forceythe Wilson in the crisis of the civil war twenty years before:
Oh, Keeper of the Sacred Key And the Or eat Seal of Destiny,
Whose eye is the blue canopy,
Look down upon the warring world And tell us what the end will be.
What may be called the political and the social aspects of *' The Breadwinners ” have already been sufficiently discussed, perhaps, in the regular editorial columns of The New York Times. What we are concerned about,
" now and here,” is only the literary art of the book, the power and skill of the presentation. These qualities are very marked, very high, very distinctive, exhibited, as we have already said, to far more advantage than in any acknowledged work of the author’s. It was eminently characteristic of John Hay that, in the presence of such a success as his only work of fiction made, at least the only one that counted, he should have been able and willing to forbear taking the credit of the work, lest at some time in the future it might somehow embarrass him in the rendering in still larger measure of the public service which, like one of the best of good Americans, he lived to render. Rereading the story, one is continually struck with the combination of old-fashionedness and up-to-dateness. In the early eighties, one is perpetually reminded, things were superficially different. Girls wore “ eel skin ” clothes, and Goldsmith Maid was queen of the trotting turf. It was in
the. legen dary times before Maud S. had: held the mile record. But much more is one impressed with the modernity of, the theme than with the antiquatidn of th'6 details. The " Labor Question,” which Is so big. now, and . which we all feel 'must be solved, -under penalties, was looming and ^ Impending then, and^ even more. And this book remains to-; day one of the most valuable adjuncts, we will not say to a solution of that problem, but to a (dear statement of it.
And then how sound and true is the evolution of the story, what a wealth of disinterested observation has gone to the building up of .the “ types.” How sharply are the various characters defined which were to be encountered in the Cleveland of the early eighties, and | no doubt may be found there stilL How j might Mr* Temple, his picturesque profanity apart, have been the Mark Hanna of the succeeding years. How permanent is Andrew Jackson Offitt. What a good American, of the sort we trust we shall never run short of, is Famham, in his kind, and Saul Match In in his. It is not a world of illusion to which the writer introduces us. It is the world of fact we know.
The incidental literary felicities are almost countless and all the more welcome for being Incidental. Certain novelists, Disraeli, for example, and Frank Frankfort Moore, have made I these felicities the staple of their work, | insomuch that there is nothing else, and that, as the excellent Samuel John- ! son observed of the equally excellent 1 Samuel Richardson: "Why, Sir, if you j were to read it for the story, your impatience would make you hang yourself.’* That is by no means the case . with this novel. The felicities^ are in. this case all the more welcome^for being incidental. And they abound. Here are some specimens, culled almost at ; random:
Budsey (the British butler) spoke in the tone of solemn and respectful tyranny which he always assumed in reminding his employer of his social duties.
•	So he set himself seriously to work to learn to swear, and though at first it made his heart shiver a little with horror and his cheek burn with shame, he persevered, as a matter of business, until his execrations amazed the roustabouts.
And this about the clergyman who had failed, as such:
He now occupied himself in writing poems and sketches of an amorous and pietistic nature, which in his opinion embodied the best qualities of Swinburne and Chalmers combined, but which the magazines had thus far steadily refused to print.*
Spiritualism is the most convenient religion in the world. You may disbelieve two-thirds of it and yet be perfectly orthodox.
It is a great contribution, is this
%
novel, to our present quest in search of ourselves, the greatest and most urgent quest we have. We all believe that when the American people has once “ found itself,” it will be capable of anything. If the judicious were pulled up at the street corner and asked who was the most veracious social historiographer of the American people during The last quarter of the nineteenth century, who had produced the most valuable human documents about them, for that period, we really do not see how he could fail to answer by mentioning the name of Mr. Howells, however many subsequent abatements and qualifications he might have to make. But we are much mistaken about Mr. Howells If he, when appealed to in that behalf, would not, for the moment, even forget his own labors to the extent of mentioning “ The Breadwinners ” as a quite indispensable document for the study of the period in question.
