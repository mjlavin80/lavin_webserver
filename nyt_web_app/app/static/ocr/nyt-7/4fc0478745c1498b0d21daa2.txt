R A.R.E BOOKS
ttk book-auctlon season ol 1904-5 was noteworthy for its duration and for the class of books sold. The best sales, as a whole, were near the end, and the season did not, as usual, tail away as Summer came. The season began on Sept. 29, 1904, when the Anderson Auction •Company held its first sale, and lasted until. June 29, when the Merwin-Clay-ton Sales Company closed its own first season. During this period of nine months 136 sales were held in this city.
Two parts of Bishop Hurst’s very miscellaneous library, the second and the third, were sold; the first part was disposed of during the season of 1903-4. At the sale in this city of the second part one of the features of the season was made manifest: the increased interest in manuscripts and autograpbical matter in general. This of course resulted in higher prices than have been recorded for some years. Purchasers became interested in Oscar Wilde’s manuscripts, and in consequence they are now having a decided ** boom.” A two-volume translation of Herodotus, interleaved and fully annotated by Wilde, brought the astonishing price of $1,320 at the sale of Richard le Gal-lienne’s books. Other manuscripts bringing unusual prices were: The manuscript of alterations and corrections made by Mrs. Browning in her " Aurora Leigh,” which was sold at the “Wendell" sale for $250; the manuscript of one of the same writer’s " Sonnets from the Portuguese,*' and of two other poems by her, which at the same sale brought $180; the original manuscript of Browning’s “ Dramatis Personae,” which commanded $3,050 at this sale, and the original manuscript of Dickens's M Sketches of Young Gentlemen," also at the '* Wendell’’ sale, which was knocked down for $5,305.
This sale brought out sharp bidding for other manuscripts. For instance, Washington Irving’s " Communipaw " brought $145; the manuscript of Abraham Lincoln’s speech in 1859 on the formation of the Republican Party was sold for $290. Robert Louis Stevenson’s “ The Body Snatcher,” in the original manuscript, was sold for $375; and various manuscripts of Thoreau brought good prices—that of his " Nature Diary," 1850 to 1861, reaching $125.
Washington letters, which always command a fair market, appreciated with other manuscripts. A three-page letter signed by Washington wap bought for $130, the record for such autographic matter. This was at the James Grant Wilson sale, wherein a letter from Edwin Booth brought $110. At the same sale a document signed by the notorious William Cunningham, Provost Marshal of this city during the Revolution, brought $75, and a complaint against Capt. William K3dd ol this city, dated 1695, six years before his execution in London for piracy, brought $70.
Connected with the advertised sale of some Washington letters is an interesting story. A woman who had read of the sale came to the auctioneers with two letters ot Washington, which she wished to sell to raise money to visit
an lnvalid son In a' Western's State'. The auctioneers declined-to buy them, but offered to sell them .for her account, and meantime to advance half what they thought the letters would bring. The letters were sold with the- other Washingtonian a, and brought $280.
The record prices for books, as distinguished from manuscripts, were reached in the Wendell ” sale, when duplicates and other volumes not wanted for his dramatic library by Evert Jansen Wendell were sold with much other material. The ” Life and Letters of David Garrick/’ London, 1831, from the Augustin Daly library, extended from two to six volumes, brought $1,200—$200 a volume. Percy Fitzgerald’s life of Garrick, (1868,) extended by Mr. Daly from two to seven volumes, brought $175. Ireland’s “ Records of the New York Stage,” from 1750 to 1860, continued by Hogan to 1870, which Mr. Daly had had enlarged from an octavo to a large folio, and extended to forty-nine volumes, brought $6,664—$136 a volume.	.
A wholesome feature of the season was the decline in the auction prices of what without disrespect may be called
freak ” books. The Roy croft books have for the present at all events ceased to figure in the auction catalogues as desiderata; Mr. Andrews’s books have tairpn a far fall likewise. His " New Amsterdam, New Orange, and New York,” which brought $100 a year or so ago, brought only $52 this last season, and a copy on Japan paper, one of thirty-five so printed, brought but $84; the Grolier Club’s “ Knickerbocker ** reached $132, however; but the Kelmscott Chaucer, which a few years ago was sought for at from $600 to $800, was sold for only $220.
The only important private sale of the season was that of Frederick Locker Lamp son's Rowfant library. This was bought last December by an American, said to be Mr. EL D. Church of Brooklyn, who took from it such volumes as he wished to complete his own library, replacing them so far as he was able with the books formerly on his shelves. He then sold the collection to a firm of dealers in this city, who tried at first to sell it as a whole. Unable to do this, they broke tt up, and many dealers have bought portions of it.
The season may be summed up briefly thus: There were more book sales than usual, there were more books sold; the books were of higher class than usual, and the good books brought better prices. Thus altogether it was a satisfactory and busy season.
