Jack London's New Book.
W. L>. Courtney In London Telegraph
And now, if the gentle or squeamish reader turns away from a subject like this, if Eariy Christians think that ail fighting- Is wrong, or modem decadents i try to persuade us that life can he lived : by the aesthetic sense alone, I cannot do I better than quote the manly words of Tom Hughes:	'* It Is no good for Quak-
I ers or any other body of men to uplift their voices against fighting. Human nature Is too strong for them, and they do not follow their own precepts. Every soul of them is doing his own piece of fighting, somehow or somewhere. The world might be a better world without fighting, for anything I know, but it wouldn’t be our world:	and therefore I
am dead against crying peace when there is no peace, pnd Isn't meant to be. X am as sorry as any man to see folk fighting ' the wrong people and the wrong things, | but Td a deal sooner see them doing that j than that they should have no fight in 1 them/’ And so I say that "The Game," by Jack London, is a good book and well worth reading, even though its hero be a prize-fighter and its theme often consid- i ered below the dignity of literature.	,
