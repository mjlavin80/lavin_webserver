Sir Henry Tfiomf>sort.
Ncto York Times Book Jtevitioi
Referring in last Saturday's number to a revised and enlarged edition of Sir Henry Thompson’s “ Diet " in relation to age and activity, your reviewer says that tho new portion of the book is written for those in the seventies and eighties. ** The directions given,” he adds, seem to the lay mind admirably adapted to the purpose in hand," and. In seeming support of that opinion, he alleges the author “ is himself an octogenarian." The point of the inference, however, is blunted when tho lay mind reflects that Sir Henry Thompson's death at “ the incurable age of eighty-four" was announced In Thh Times more than a year ago.
