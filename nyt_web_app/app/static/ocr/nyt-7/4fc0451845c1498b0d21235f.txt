tagonist of a “ detective story M called ;
“ A Mysterious. Disappearance,” ■ written by "Gordon Holmes,11 and published by Edward J. Clode, who seems tp have the faculty of selecting only •successful novels for publication. Mr. Bruce is a tall gentleman and handsome, of BOmewhat theatrical appear- “ ance, gifted with extraordinary powers of observation and deduction.
He is associated, in the unraveling of a well-wrought mystery, with a Scotland Yard detective of the Inspector; Bucket type. That type did well enough in its day. The practical, serio-comic' detective, however, is now chiefly used as a foil. The psychologist/* with, a strong infusion of sentiment, and a university education, has supplanted him.
The story-teller’s gift, well developed/ is possessed by the writer who signs " A Mysterious Disappearance ” 4' Gor- | don Holmes,” and, if we are not mistaken, has signed other books “ Louis Tracy.” He exhibits In this story, a pleasing manner of writing, (which may not quite deserve to be designated as “ style,” but makes easy reading,) a strong sense of humor, an ability to denote traits of character with a few words. His personages talk naturally—and seem to be living human beings, not the puppets characters in “ detective stories M frequently are.
Moreover, Gordon Holmes has a good story to tell. There is always a de-1 mand for stories with plots and inci-! dents grounded-upon mystery well sustained. They fit some moods of nearly all readers. There are, to speak the plain truth, countless readers who have no moods for stories of any other kind, i M A Mysterious Disappearance ** is quite the best story of its kind we have read in a long while—and we say this without reserve.
