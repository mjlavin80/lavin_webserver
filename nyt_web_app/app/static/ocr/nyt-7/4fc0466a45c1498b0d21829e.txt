** Cameron of Lochiel ’* (Boston: 1*. C. Page & Co. $1.50) is tbe translator’s name for that agreeable French Canadian romance of the early sixties which the author, Philippe Aubert de Gasp€, called '* Les Anciens Canadiens.” Mr. Charles G. D. Roberts, who Is responsible for the present English version, declares that
de GaspG’s book Js “ markedly the best historical romance so far produced In French Canada," and adds that "it gathers up and preserves in lasting form the songs and legends, the characteristic customs, the phases of thought and feeling, the very local and personal aroma of a rapidly changing civilization." We may suppose it does these last pretty faithfully, for M. de Gasp6 was born of a noble French Canadian family only twenty-eight years after Quebec passed into English hands, and much of the | Canada of his boyhood was old French Canada still.
Therefore, at a time when so many modern story jacks are trying to imagine this French Canada as It never was and are painting it In all the possible ajid impossible colors of the imitation romance of the whole cloth it is almost indescribably refreshing to read de Gaspfe as interpreted by Mr. Roberts into an English story. The old Canadian’s narrative, though it centres* like so many of the rest, about the last struggle between the English and French, flows leisurely along and bears the marks of the age of dignity and high sentiment which produced it. It tells the life history of two young men, a tall Scot and a gay Frenchman, both educated at the famous Jesuits' College in Quebec, but afterward fighting on opposing sides on the Plains of Abraham. It relates the habitans’ quaint stories of witches and hobgoblins, it tells of the ceremonial setting up of the selgnoral maypole before the manor house, with much burning of powder and much feasting afterward. It even quotes the songs the revelers sfng—songs which Mr. Roberts, as a rule, has rendered Into English very well. It relates jests, brave deeds, pranks, prayers, conversations after the noble style, and, above allt has a young woman in It who refuses to marry her choice on account of an infinitesimal point of honor too high flown and old-fashioned for modern comprehension.
Mr. Roberts’s translation was first published in 1890, and the present new edition seems to be the result of the steady growth of that Canadian sentiment which takes equal glory in the French and English elements, so happily married in our northern neighbor in spite of some wholesome domestic spats and differences. One couldn't well find a story (with so much of truth In It) which would seem better fitted to encourage sentiments of mutual admiration and mutual charity (where charity is needed) among French and English descended Canadians.
For our purposes (who are not Canadians) the value of the book lies in a certain clearness, sincerity, unnamable charm of spontaneous romance, very different from the common commercial product which is called by that magic name. And though Mr. Roberts sometimes ventures upon locutions too glaringly modern—such as the conversational ° awfully "—he makes on the whole a ^ very satisfactory translator.
