Mr. Bernhard Berenson continues to insist on the importance or Lorenzo Lotto, a so-oallod Venetian, who painted during the first half of the sixteenth : century, Just about 350 years before his time. This insistence is once more emphasized through a third edition of his M Lorenzo Lotto: An Essay in Constructive Art Criticism,” revised and partly rewritten. To the average student of Italian art Lotto, we fear, must ever remain, in spite of Mr. Berenson’s dictum, an imitator among the greatest and most exalted group of painters of a most eager and original period of expression. He was a popular painter, with a keen eye to business, and he painted much, and doubtless very often placed his signature to pictures done by other, but by nt> means inferior, brushes. To-day his canvases are to be found in collections from St. Petersburg to Madrid, while his
frescoes adorn the walls of churches and public buildings in Venice, Treviso, Re-canati, Bergamo, Trescorre, Ancona, and In Loretto, where he imitated Titian, became very religious, and died spurnfng the commercialism of art.„
Now, what attraction has such a painter tor the gifted author of that monumental work, "The Drawings of Florentine Painters? ’* The answer Is twofold. In the first
place, the work of Lbtto, second class and imitative though it be, presents the best characteristics of his contemporaries with a technique that was almost unsurpassed by even the greatest among them; secondly, Mr. Berenson, while at work on his " Venetian Painters of tlie Renaissance *’ some twelve or thirteen years ago, found in Lotto—man, painter, and work—most Inviting and popular material through which to exploit his scheme of biograph-Ico-critico-connolsseurship for constructive art history. ° Here is a man,’* we may imagine the author saying, '* whose work Is an excellent pictorial synopsis of contemporary painting. No adequate biography of him exists. No attempt has been made to show from original sources what manner of man he.was, I will 'write him up * from these original sources." The result was “ Lorenzo Lotto:	An
Essay on Constructive Art Criticism,” which first saw light Just ten years ago.
In the book before us Mr. Berenson has shown how genuine biographical and critical art work should be written and compiled. It is natural that the biographer should, ln this third version of his book, give renewed emphasis to the importance of his subject—an importance which is made important because the author of “ The JDrawings of Florentine Painters ’* raises It far above the limits set by conservative critics and connoisseurs and popularizes it.
Even if modem art were not educating us, as it is, to appreciate the technical merit of work such as his, nevertheless, in any age, personality molding a work of art into a veritable semblance of itself is so rare a phenomenon that we cannot afford to neglect it. Least of all should we pass it by when that personality happens to be, as Lotto's was, of a type toward which Europe was moved, during the last three centuries, with such rapidity that nowadays there probably are a hundred people like Lotto for one who resembled him in* his own lifetime. His spirit is more like our own than is, perhaps, that of any other Italian painter, and it has all the appeal and fascination of a kindred soul in another age.	,
The new edition of '* Lorenzo Lotto ” Is embellished with sixty-four half-tone reproductions of his best-known scenes and portraits. The present location of each picture as well as descriptive and biblio-^ graphical material is to be found incorporated in the text.
