HE public has grown accustomed to seeing histories of the United States beginning ’With the year 1392. Prof. Channing takps us five centuries further back and follows Lief Ericsson’s knorr across the Northern seas to Vinland, a vague destination. »*nce no one knows where Vinland was, though ft was certainly part of the mainland of North America. The exploit of Lief was not a discovery in the historical sense, far.* It
was not followed up. nor did it have any effect on subsequent explorations.
The Columbian discovery Is briefly discussed. and the author wisely steers clear of the numerous controversies, or dismisses them with a word. He agrees with the majority of scholars in rejecting Varnhagen's extreme statement of the claims of Vespucci to be considered the first explorer of the shores of the United States. In fact, Charming- follows the safe plan of always agreeing with the majority and Is wise In doing so, for he has -none of that special ability, of making the worse appear the better cause, which charms while it warns us to caution, In such a writer as John Fiske.
The little that is known about John Cabot's voyage in 1497, on the merits of which England was to found her claims to a share of the territory of North America, is told. It is with this voyage, it appears to us, that the historian of the United States might very properly begin his researches; yet the fascination whjlch the Columbian voyages have seems to cause us to neglect the exploit with which the history of British America really begins. Prof. Channing justly remarks that compared with it Columbus’s comparatively easy sail from the Canaries to the Antilles was child’s play.
The first four chapters of this volume are by way of an introduction. It was the Impulse given to maritime adventure under Elizabeth that resulted in the actual settling of North America by the English; and this subject Is taken up under caption ** The English Seamen.”
the
American and English writers have generally felt it Incumbent upon them to hold up to the admiration of mankind the piratical voyages of Drake and hla fel-low-seamen. Channing hits the matter off pretty well by remarking that " a deed which would have met with condign punishment if perpetrated in European waters was looked upon as meritorious if it took place on the Spanish Main and did not bring on war with Spain.’* The exploits of Gilbert and Raleigh, in which Osgood has recently taught us to see the germ of the proprietary province in America, are related, though their bearing on the institutional history of the laUr colonies is hot brought out. The true significance of the Virginia Charter of 1GOO, on the other hand, is clearly staled. The author says that though the elaborate provisions for the government of the wretched little plantation on the shores of the James River strike us as being rather absurd, the King’ " merely anticipated by some one hundred and seventy years the principles of the act for regulating the East India Company." The government of every chartered colonizing company has had to be assumed directly by the English Government. Channlng’s treatment of Virginia history is based mainlj’ upon the materials to be found in the Virginia Magazine of History, in the work of the Royal Histotteal Manuscripts Commission, and the works of Alexander Brown and Bruce. The Assembly of 1610, on which historians are fond of dilating, he calls the ** mother of the American representative Legislature.”
Chapter IX. contains a brief but good account of the early history of Maryland, the first successful prbprietorshlp In America. Special attention is paid to the Charter of	and	the actual working
of Government under it, and it is shown that the comparison between Maryland and the English County Palatine must not be carried too far.
Regarding the settlement of the Pilgrims at Plymouth, he makes an assertion which seems open to criticism. He says that the Mayflower compact “ was not in any way the constitution of an independent State, as nas sometimes been said. It was, indeed, precisely the opposite—an agreement made by Englishmen who, finding themselves on English soil without any specified powers of government, agreed to govern themselves until the King’s pleasure should be signified." It is a little difficult to see why the compact was not just what Prof, Channing says it was not—the constitution of a virtually Independent State. A review of
Plymouth history does not bear out his offhand remark that M there was not the i slightest thought of independence/* if by independence he moans the permanent management of their own affairs by the Colonists. Plymouth Is as good an example as can be found in Colonial history of a de facto commonwealth. It Is with more justice that he takes exception to Doyle’s reference to the Plymouth system as communistic. It was not really so, for the leveling features of communism were not a part of the Pilgrims’ programme.
NEW ENGLAND CONSCIENCE.
*<*
IN Chapter XII, we find a scholarly account of the founding of Massachusetts
and the system of government estab- i lished there. The theocratic nature of the system Is described, and it explains most of the phenomena In the history of the Bible commonwealtn. The intolerance of the seventeenth century explains the famous contests with Roger Williams and the Antinomlans and Quakers. " In each case the ultimate question at issue was whether the ideas of the dissentient minority or those of the representatives of the majority should prevail/' Channing goes on to say that the " consciences of the New England rulers have been too little regarded, and the consciences of their victims too much respected."
Speaking of the celebrated Anne Hutchinson, he says: " Living nowadays, she would easily find a niche axaorur the women radicals of the day; sno would found another Brook Farm on original lines, or she would start a woman's club to discuss the religion of the Hindus.”
Chapters XVI. and XVII. describe the historical development of the Dutch colony of New Netherlands It Is, of course, impossible to say just what effect Dutch Influence had In forming the United States; but Prof. Channing safely remarks that the Dutch and their posterity havo “ powerfully affected the development of the thirteen colonies." He comes to the conclusion that neither Van Twiller nor Kief t were such bad kind of persons as is commonly believed. The history of New Nether land remains unwritten because ** there Is hardly a scrap of evidence that is not highly controversial.”
The volume comes down to the year of the English Restoration, from which tim» a new era in colonial history dates. The rise and development of England's navigation policy, the keystone of the system of stricter imperial control which was to mark colonial history in the eighteenth century. Is briefly sketched. Finally there Is a revie'w of internal conditions In the colonies about 1660.
Prof. Cha.nning'6 point of view is that thg colonies, taken together, formed a part of the Empire of England. He consequently avoids the antiquarian method of tracing the political development of each colony as a unit in isolation. “ Colonial institutions reproduced popular forms which were dying out In the home land, and from this beginning developed on lines radically unlike those which prevailed In England. * * * Fifty years of freedom gave the English-American colonists their opportunities,” Page 421. His work is a re-examination of the whole field under treatment. It is thoughtful and well written, and deserves the attention which should be accorded to the work of any scholarly man whose writing is the result of careful study and mature reflection.

iVEST. By Josejrh Schafer, Af. j_, With ^ illustrations. pp. 321.' wew ^ork. The Macmillan Company.	"
THIS attractive volume concerning the history of the region west of the Rockies and north of California—the Oregon country—appears at a most fortunate time, just as the World’s Fair at Portland Is opening-; and in this little
book we read much of Lewis and Clark, whose exploit the Portland Exposition was planned to commemorate. Mr. Schafer’s work, However, is not by way of a handbook for visitors to Portland, for he is careful to tell us that the coincidence in point of time between the opening of the exposition and the appearance of his book Is a ** fortunate chance.” As head of the Department of History in the University of Oregon, he is well qualified to write the history of the Northwest, and his must have been a labor of love.
The western coast of what is now the United States was first explored in 1542 by two navigators, Cabrillo and Ferelo, under commission from the Viceroy of New Spain, Mendoza. They explored as far north possibly as 42 degrees north latitude. Until the buccaneering voyage of Sir Francis'Drako about 1580 the Span-
-lards^feit-as eecure on the Pacific ai*in;
Interior ofthelr own peninsula, Drake; ran up the Pacific Coast to about 42 de~; grees north latitude* and took, possession -of the country, though it had been previously visited by Spaniards, in the name of Queen Elizabeth, calling it " New .Albion,” During the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries the California region* was "not further explored.
About 1770 the California missions were begun, -and the exploration of the northwest coast was effected by Juan Perez in 1774. He visited the region from 42 degrees north latitude to 04 degrees 40 minutes. Capt. Cook's voyage of 1770-8 at-| tracted much attention to this region, i,. and the otter fur trade developed rapidly.
In 1790 Spain, which took no active inter-1 est in this trade, virtually withdrew from : the region north of California. ', One of I the most important events in the history of the Northwest is the discovery of the Columbia River in 1792 by Robert Gray,
| an American.
The first suggestion of the famous transcontinental journey is to be foun<3T In a letter from Jefferson to George Rogers Clark in 1783. Jefferson's message to Congress of Jan. 18, 1803, shows that he desired to send out an exploring expedition overland as far as the Pacific. At this time we were negotiating with Napoleon for the purchase of New Orleans, and no one had any idea we were on the point of acquiring all Louisiana. The expedition was in no sense the result of the purchase, as has often been asserted. The President appointed as leader of the exploring party Capt Meriwether Lewis, who In turn selected, as second in command, William Clark, younger brother of the celebrated George Rogers. An interesting account of their adventures is given In Chapter VI.
The story of how Oregon was colonized Is told In Chapter XI. The process of State building on the shores of the Pacific really begins with the great emigration of 1843. '‘It closes the period of experiment and gives us a true self-supporting American colony,” Page IDG. In 1843 the settlers by the ** First Organic Law ” adopted a provisional de facto government “ until such time as the United States of America extend their jurisdiction over us." The region between 42 degrees and 54 degrees 40 minutes had been for several years held by Great Britain and the United States by joint occupation. The Oregon convention, which met at Cincinnati In 1843, put forward the contention that the United States had an undoubted right to all of this country. Mr. Schafer says this was ** claiming too | much for the United States," Page 214.
I •* But,” he says, ** there was some slight ground for it, and, besides, many Americans were out of patience with Great Britain for refusing to accept the compromise line of 49 degrees so often offered.” The result was that " Fifty-four forty or fight ” became a plank in the Democratic platform of 1844. In spite of this warlike bluster, the parallel of 49 degrees was : agreed to as the boundary between the United States and Great Britain on the Pacific, and a treaty to this effect was signed on June 15, 1840. "The Oregon question was now settled, and that in a way which was perfectly fair to all parties concerned,” Page 216. The first Territorial Government of Oregon was inaugurated in March, 1849, and Joseph Lane of Indiana was appointed by President Polk as the first Territorial Gov-1 ernor.
Mr. Schafer closes with a brief chapter on “The Pacific Northwest of To-day," and shows how the naturally great resources of the country are coming to .be developed.	/
OCR DEPENDENCIES.
TER KIT OKIES AND DEPENDENCIES OF THE UNITED STATES. Their Government and Administration. By William Franklin Willoughby, Treasurer of Porto Rico. New York:	Tbe Century Com-
pany. fl.25.
THE purpose of the American State Series Is to describe the administration and organization of American government. This volume of the series concerns itself with the Territories and dependencies of the United States, particularly the insular dependencies, the Philippines and Porto Rico. It is only incidentally historical, and seeks rather to explain the policy now pursued by the United States toward them.
Mr. Willoughby distinguishes three periods In American expansion. The first terminates in 1853 with the end of the territorial adjustments growing out of the war with Mexico and the natural rounding off of the boundaries of the United States. The second period, of comparative inactivity, covers the years 1S53-9S. The third begins with the annexation of Hawaii in 1898, and ends, if it has yet ended, with the acquisition of the Panama Canal strip in 1904. It Is with this last period that we are here principally concerned. While the government of the territory acquired as a result of the war with Spain presents many new problems, chief among which Is that the United States now possesses territory which for an indefinite period cannot be Incorporated into the Union, the territorial policy of the United States has undergone no radical changes. The problem of dependent territory has always been with us.
and^ wo have .continuously acted in accordance with certain theories which constitute what may be called the.Territo-? rial Policy of the United States, The advent of the United Statesj^mong the nations as a colonial power has not, therefore, meant a break In American policy.
The United States * * * has not been compelled to abandon Its historical policy as a. general principle. All that nas been necessary is the modification of this principle In the single respect that it is not feasible at the present time, as In the past, definitely to determine: In advance what shall be the ultimate political status of this territory.—Page 19.
It Is, therefore, • as Introductory to the description of government In the insular possessions that Mr. Willoughby, in Chapters H. and HI,, discusses the Territories on the mainland.
It is about Porto Rico that he speaks with perhaps the greatest authority. The American citizen.who desires to acquaint himself with present governmental conditions In that Island, both insular and local, cannot do better than read what Mr. Willoughby has to say about them. The frame of government for Porto Rlco is the Foraker Act, passed by Congress in 1900. Congress has, however. left matters f local government to be worked out by the Insular Government. A peculiar feature of the execution is that the heads of departments, appointed directly by the President of the United States, are almost
■	entirely Independent of the Governor. In practice, however, harmony is secured by frequent conferences. The lower house of the Insular Legislature Is chosen on the basis of what Is virtually manhood suffrage, and is composed of native Porto Ricans. The upper house is composed of the Executive Council, consisting of the six heads of departments and five other persons appointed by tbe President of the United States, making eleven in all, five of whom must be natives. It Is thus In the President's power to keep the majority of the uppec- house American as long as he sees fit. This house is remarkable in American Institutional history as an example of the combination of legislative and executive functions in the same body. The financial system is clearly outlined and the process described by which free trade between the United Suites and Porto Rico was established.
In Chapter V. an account is given of Ujo reorganization of the old Spanish system of municipal government, and of the establishment of the present system. A very careful exposition of municipal finance is also to be found here. In spite of the fact that Porto Ricans are not satisfied with pjesent conditions, the author who, by liis position as Treasurer of Porto Rico, is peculiarly fitted to understand those conditions, believes that if Congress “ has erred, it has been In immediately granting too much rather thnn too little."
When we come to the government of the Philippines, the subject matter of Chapters VI., VII., and VIII., the principal circumstance borne in mind is the complexity and multifarious nature of the questions demanding solution; and the leading fact with which our legislators have had to reckon is that the islands are inhabited by people representing stages of development ranging all the way from , savagery up to comparative civilization. Iri ! the study of government in the Philippines the student is concerned with a work not yet completed and with Institutions of a more or less tentative character.
As an event leading up to the establishment of civil government In the Phillp-pines, the author lays great stress upon the Instructions given by the President to the Second Philippine Commission which were incorporated into his annual message of Dec. 3, 1900.
“ In it is solemnly enunciated the policy of the United States that in framing a scheme of government for the Islands, and In legislating in regard to them, the United States will have solely In mind the welfare of the islands themselves, and, furthermore, that it is the deliberate policy of the United States to give to the people of the islands the largest measure of participation In their own Government which they are fitted to exercise.”
A striking r-xample of the continuity of our territorial policy is to be seen In the opinion arrived at by the Philippine Commission and indorsed by Congress, that in the Northwest Ordinance of 17S7 are to be found the essential principles that should control legislation for thi? Philippines. The Philippine Act of 1902. unlike the B’oraker Act for Porto Rico, does not contain a complete sjrstem of government. The actual work of organizing government is in the hands of the commission. What Mr. Willoughby calls the vital feature of the act is that which provides for the calling of a " Philippine Assembly upon the general pacification of the country." This means that the Philippines will soon enjoy a form of government in general similar to that now in operation in Porto Rlco. Chapters VII. and VIII. contain admirable summaries of the systems of subordinate governments, provincial and municipal, established by the Philippine Commission.
At the close of the volume Is a valuable bibliographical note, giving the sources of Information regarding the territorial dependencies of the United States.
