But in each case the de-scription was as good as were tho illustrations.
It Is not so with '* Wales," the book now before us. The illustrations are excellent; some of great beauty and admirably reproduced in color. A gloriously beautiful country must be much of Wales, if Mr. Fowler’s pencil and brush have caught it correctly; and they seem to have done so.

He says that Mr. Fowler “ seemed to have cut himself off so completely from the art of the past, to have de-h iiman i zed himself, so to speak, that it was perhaps natural for me to compare his methods of work with the cold Impassivity of a machine.'* Whereupon he compares Mr. Fowler to Rudyard Kipling because of his unconventionality.
After this, however, Mr. Finberg leaves the stock phrases of the amateur critic and writes more or less sensibly about Mr. Fowler’s pictures. As a whole, his " appreciation ” is good, though we do not discover, from their colored reproductions, that the paintings are so wholly unusual as Mr. Finberg would have us believe.
