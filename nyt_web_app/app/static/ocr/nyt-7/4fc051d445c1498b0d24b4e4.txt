JOHN KNOX,
Andrew Lang’s Life of tlie Scottish Reformer and Another Life by Dr. Henry Cowan.5
R. ANDREW LANG is noto- j riously no lover of Calvin and his dour system of doctrine. Notoriously also he has a humorous mind. Therefore the great John Knox (whose quarter centenary is in act of celebration) does not appear to him full inspired prophet size. However, Mr. Lang has studied his subject as few of the more solemn of the biographers have, and exhibits in his entertaining: book a very human, powerful, and not unlikable Knox—no hero, but a man " built (to resort to misquotation) on a certain Scottish plan." In this fashion Mr. Lang speaks in his preface:
That Knox ran so far ahead of Lhe Genevan Pontiffs of his age in violence, and that in his “ History '* he needs such careful watching was to be an unexpected discovery. He may have been “ an old Hebrew prophet." as Mr. Carlyle says, but he had also been a young Scottish notary. A Hebrew prophet is at best a dangerous anachronism in a delicate crisis of the Church Christian, and the notarial element is too conspicuous in some passages of Knox’s ** History."
, That Knox was a great man: a disinterested man; in his regard for the poor a truly Christian man; as a shepherd of Calvinistic souls a man fervent and considerate; of pure life, in friendship loyal, by jealousy untainted; in private character genial and amiable, I am entirely convinced. In public and political life he was much less admirable, and his " History.” vivacious as it is, must be studied as the work of an old-fashioned advocate rather than as the summing up of a Judge. His favorite adjectives are " bloody," “ beastly," and “ stinking.*’
Having said so much, Mr. Lang devotes himself cheerfully to developing the Knoxian idiosyncrasies as he sees them, especially elucidating the fashion in which the Reformer (having agreed in his own mind to call the Catholic mass “ idolatry **) proceeds to apply to Catholics (as “ idolaters ") the extremest penalties denounced by the old Hebrew Scriptures upon worshippers of Moloch and Baal. The argument is simple and direct —the conclusion unavoidable if you admit the premises. Frankly, therefore, it was Knox's theory that all Catholics should be put to death. But the blog. rapher admits that this bloody theory was a theory only. " a counsel of perfection '*; the old Hebrew prophet shrank 1 from actual slaughter of more or less Innocent idolaters. All of which is brought out ingeniously enough by analysis of Knoxian fulminations and Knoxian deeds.
Again Mr. Lang rolls as a sweet morsel un«l r his tongtie tl'fc r-agnificent inconsistencies of the prophet. How at one time (occasion suiting) he preached passive obedience to " Authority **—to earthy rulers as God's anointed, how at another time he ** prayed for a Jehu ” and proclaimed the fearful doctrine of the right nay. the duty—(on the part of the godly '*) to remove idolatrous rulers by private vengeance—nothing more nor less, says the biographer, than propaganda of anarchy and commendation of the practice of assassination.	'
Mr. Lang dwells upon the evil which was wrought by the attempt to apply to the turbulent Scots a sort of theocratic government such as might serve in a city like Geneva—and serve there only during a period of a popular spiritual exaltation. According to him most of the woes of Scotland and the troubles with England for the next century and a haif arose from the extreme violence of the doctrines Inculcated by John Knox in the matter of “ papists ** and M Romish rags " —in other words, from hi3 " anachronistic position '* as ** an old Hebrew prophet ** in a modern kingdom. For thus was a great gulf fixed between Reformers in the South and North—Anglicans and Presbyterians*
As to Knox's dealings with the Regent. Mary of Guise. Mr, Lang is .at pains to
Ishow that all the trickiness was not on the side of the Queen Mother. And he is convinced that Knox In his history does vast injustice to a lady whose disposition and policy agreed in making her deal as gently as might be with the heretics in her realm. The Reformer (according to Mr, Long) attributed to Mary a burning and destroying zeal for her faith such as he felt for his. And therein erred, for Mary was regnant politician first nnfl Catholic afterward, as became one of her house.
As hinted in the preface already quoted, Mr. Lang finds that Knox far out Calvin ed Calvin in the rigor and violence of his application of detached Biblical texts to modem instances. Also he finds the father of Presbyter! anism very ready to juggle with such texts and quite willing to use for authority at one moment a tag of Scripture which at an other moment
*	he utterly rejects. And the- cases are duly cited and proved. Admittedly, all springs

from the fervor of the prophet’s belief In his own absolute rightness at all times. He distorts texts and facts to fit his preconceptions, all by virtue of the magnetism of that fervor.
Altogether John Knox, as Mr. Lan^ sees him, is a most interesting character, a wonderful complex of honest human qualities twisted into strange shape by :t barbaric idea of religion—a God taken crude like Tomlinson’s " from a printed book."
Most interesting of all (where we treai of Knox thus as a man, not as a prophet) are his relations with Mary of Scotland. Here Mr. Lang is upon ground which is his very own, but we need not dwell In this place upon a matter which he has already treated in his delightful '* History ( of Scotland."
However, as to the conversations between these two, “ Knox gives Mary’s observations in the briefest summary: his own at great length, so that it is not easy to know how their reasoning sped," and Mr. Lang makes inerry over the tactfulness of Knox in telling the young Queen he ** was as well content to live under her as Paul under Nero."
The same speech is quoted also in the work of the Rev. Prof. Henry Cowan, the second of the biographies whose titles are given in full below. Dr. Cowan’s way of looking at Knox is, of course, not Mr. Lang’s way. He is fax less interested in the curiosities of the prophetic temperament. He is far from thinking, as Mr. Lang does, that Knox’s work had better have been left undone, and he sees nothlnghumorous about the reformer’s zeal against idolators. even if he no longer quite includes good Catholics under that designation. In short, Dr, Cowan's is a routine biography, written from the eon-, ventional standpoint—sufficiently fair ana complete, but taking less account of me great man’s shortcomings than might perhaps be desired by those who are loyal to other creeds than his. Naturally Dr. Cowan’s biography is less interesting.
Both biographers are agreed that tho traditional birth date of Knox—the one whose four hundredth anniversary comes during the present year—is in all likelihood a mistaken date. He was born at Haddington (or thereabout) they say, not in 1505, but somewhere between 1513 and 1515. Not unexpectedly Mr. Lang dwells more lovingly tl'an Dr. Cowan upon the days when the father of Pres-byterianism was a priest of Romo and styled (as one of the Pope’s Knights) Sir John Knox;. Neither of the biographers now under consideration, however, makes so much of the part played by Knox in adding anti-papistical virtue to the Anglican Book of Common Prayer as was made in the recent life by Dr. Stalker.
It seems that Knox is responsible for the so-called ** black rubric," which explains away the meaning of the practice of kneeling at the Lord's Supper. For Knox | spent several years in England and was I even one of the King's chaplains in the reign of Edward VI. That was after the episode of the murder of Cardinal Beaton and the siege of the castle of St. Andrews, where Knox ministered to the conspirators. The castle surrendered in 1547, and Knox, with others, was sent to tlie French galleys, where, whatever he may have suffered, he found time to edit a theological work. After the English period came Geneva and the troubles at Frankfort, where Knox was preacher to British exiles, some of whom wanted tholr ; own Prayer Boot and some a new one composed by Knox on the Genevan model. Calvin himself called it “a very absurd quarrel." It was at Geneva that was ; printed “ The First Blast against the Monstrous Regiment of Women,” which spoke despitefuliy of Queens and made an enemy of Elizabeth, though it was origl-: nally aimed at Mary Tudor, at whose accession Knox had fled to the Continent. Later the preacher used it against anI other Mary.
; The intrigues and counter-intrigues : which followed Knox's return to Scotland ; are too tangled a thing to do more than ! refer to here. As to Knox's part in those intrigues, you will find different opinions expressed by Mr. Lang and Dr. Cowan. Between the two you are not unlikely to get some gleaning of the truth. At all . events be was the greatest power In Scot- ; land for good or 111. Randolph, the English envoy, writes of him:
John Knox thundereth out of the pulpit ; so that I fear nothing so much as that one day he will mar all. He ruleth the roost, and of him all men stand in fear,
Mr. Tang points out that when Mary's follies had brought about her downfall Knox ceased to be so great a figure. Tho lady who played the opposite part to his was out of the cast and the effectiveness of the Knoxian rOle (as theocrat and re-buker of royal vanities and crimes) was somewhat spoiled. The later part of his life is, therefore* less interesting. Ho died ln November, 1572, but his spirit ** ruled the roost" for ,a hundred years and more—nay. It abides still (as many know only too well) . In odd places In Scotland and out of it. .	•	-■
