A biography of " Marla Sophia, Queen of Naples," and sister of the Empress Elizabeth of Austria who was assassinated, has been written by Clara Tschiidi, author of books on Maxi© Antoinette, Empress Elizabeth, and others, ' and translated from the Norwegian fey Ethel Harriet Hearn. It opens with several chapters on the House of Wittels-bach and the parents and brothers and sisters of Maria Sophia. The marriage of the Princess to Francis of Calabria Is then related, followed shortly after by the death of Ferdinand II. and the ascension to the throne of the newly wedded couple; then* comes the unity of Italy, the arrival of Garibaldi, and the last days of the royal couple in Naples; their life at Gaeta, the relations between Francis and Napoleon; their trips to Rome and Bavaria; the death of Francis II., and his posthumous fame, closing with chapters on Maria Sophia as a widow and the deaths of her sisters and mother. The author writes in conclusion:
Maria Sophia’s is no pining nature. She looks on her life without bitterness, but also entirely without pride. * * * The memory of the struggle for the unity of Italy has been thrust back by newer events on the world’s stage. The heroic defender of Gaeta has hidden the remembrance of her queenly dignity under the more modest title of' “* Duchessa di Castro." When the time comes for her to go, the newspapers will waken to life for a moment the memory of a. historical episode which is almost forgotten, and in obituaries once again will call her ** The Heroine of Gaeta,”
Marla Sophia still looks young, in spite of her troubles and her sixty-three years. A picture of her, in colors, forms the frontispiece of the book, of which E. P. Dutton & Co. are the publishers. ___________________	-
