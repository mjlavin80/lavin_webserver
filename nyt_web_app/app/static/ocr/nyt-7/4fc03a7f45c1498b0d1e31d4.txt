[ICKERING, in the North Riding1 of Yorkshire, has been a royal possession, it seems, almost continuously since the day of William the Nor-'man. The Plantagenet Kings hunted in the forest there, and John Lackland harbored in the town at least one night. Henry TIL gave the castle and forest to his son, Edmund Crouch back, and since that time it has been Hn appanage of the Duchy ot Lancaster. In this book Gordon Home gathered a mass of very entertaining material about the old town and castle and the country of Pickering Vale. He pushes his investigations back into the glacial period and the Stone Age, to the times when the vale was sheeted over with ice, to the days when the hyena and elephant ranged the Yorkshire forests. He makes even that part of his story interesting, but when he comes
down to comparatively modern days and r^-n quote the records of the Crown Duchy of Lancaster, the reading becomes at times positively racy.
In Edward L's reign Pickering for the first and only occasion sent representatives to Parliament. That was in 1295. These representatives are recorded as Robertu3 Turcock and Robertus Turcock —who may or may not have been twins.
It appears also that many persons were called before the Forest Eyre, (or assizes,) held at Pickering in 1334, for ** annoying the King’s deer." Sir John de Melsa, for instance, employs “ men to make and burn charcoal, injuring the food and annoying the deer, by what right , they knpw not." Likewise “ the Jury present that the bridge called Friar Bridge, across which people are wont to pass on horseback. is in such bad repair that people cannot pass over, but have to make a divergence of about a mile and a half In the forest, treading down and injuring the pasturage of the deer/' The Abbot of Rievaulx (who is responsible for the bridge) *' is to be amerced because he did not repair it." The clergy are frequent offenders- The Prior of Bridlington is also *' amerced,” but the Prioress of Yedding-hnm is let off. Also the Abbot of Whitby took a green oak, and “ does not appear to judgment with his baiL Afterward it appears that hi3 ball are dead, so proceedings against them are stayed/'
There were certain rascals at the same time who " violently seized ” various per-
*	sons of consideration and " led them with them till they compoundedM for large sums of money. These kidnappers got off usually with fines.
In Tu.ior times there lived near Pickering a turbulent Sir Roger Hastings.
“ The said Sir Roger Hastynges with hys household servants, dally goyng and ryding trough the country more like men of warr than of peas. In ill example to other, though the Kinges markettz and townez of his liberte of Pykeryng hi the with bowes bent and arrowes in their handes ferying the Kinges people," while the “ wyeff of the said Sir Roger Hastynges with here own company of house' hold servants come into Blandlsby Park and there found a fat stott (a young ox) of Rauff Bukton and with dooges toko the said Stott and slowo hym and ete hym, and no mende will make.’* Sir Roger also " with force and armz of the nyghlertall (night time) brake the Kinges Prison at the K3ngg Castell of Pykejv yng.”
In Stuart times' it Is said tbe Parliamentarians camped. In the church. r*er-talnly George VIIHers, second Duke of Buckingham, died at Kirby Moorsldo (hard by) when after the death of Charles H. that scapegrace retired from Court to devoto his last days to M hunting the fox."	'
Under the Georges there are stories of witches and apparitions, especially of one ** Sarkless Kitty/' tho ghost of a beautiful girl who had lited evilly. Those to whom Kitty appeared—** sarkless," as hex nickname would indicate—straightway dtod. So likewise did the man who rode after a fox with a black brush. Early in the 1800’s we read of a certain Mr. Carter, curate in charge at Losttngham, a neigh-" boring village, 'whose name occurs in Bede. This curate, It is said* “ allowed his wife to keep a publle boose in tha crypt ** of his church. Whether .tho csypt was actually used for the public Is not clear. At all events^ yotfH find here Hr. Carter's own official statement of the reason why his dame pursued tho calling of publican. "I have,** said he, “a wife and thirteen' children, with a stipend of £20 per aa-nnm." So he ekes out his pay by catching fish, and after a sermon piays upon his 1 ' • * 1 • ‘ ** t '

These notes will give some idea of tiie^
store of quaint records Mr. Horae has collected. He has excellent pictures (drawn by himself) and a great deal about the churches and other monuments of Pickering and the other villages of the Vale. He reminds you that William Wordsworth and Mary Hutchinson were married in Broropton Church near by, and he has their fac simile signatures from the parish register. He has plans, anecdotes, data genealogical, historical, geological, and architectural. anH mnkw altogether a charming book for the lovers of things old, picturesque, and curious.
