By a singular typographical error In an article by Mr, Frederick: Law Olmsted, published in the June number of The Atlantic Monthly, a certain Boston architect who designed a certain inappropriate
drinking fountain is identified In a foot note as Mr. Montgomery Schuyler. Mr. Schuyler is not a Boston architect but a New York writer, and the foot note in the manuscript referred to a passage In one of his essays on architecture, quoted approvingly by Mr. Olmsted.
