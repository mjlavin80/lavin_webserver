UNCOOKED FOODS AND HOW TO USE THEM, A Treatise on How to Get the Highest Form of Animal Energy from Food. By Mr. and Mrs. Eugene Christian. Now York:	The Health Culture
Company.
Here are two books upon the art and science of proper feeding which are as different as possible. In the first Sir Henry Thompson discusses from the point of view of an old man and experienced physician the diet of elderly British persona in easy circumstances. Sir Henry (naturally) advises nothing startling or revolutionary, and insists chiefly upon care and common sense. Especially he shows that men and women no longer young must eat sparingly. His aim is to keep you (after you pass your mid-century) still active and able to enjoy life in a rational manner. The directions given are simple and seem to the lay mind admirably adapted to the purpose in han£.
In the first part of the book (originally published in 1SSG) Sir Henry considers the case of a man in the fifties and sixties; in the second* part (which is new) he writes for those in the seventies and eighties. He is himself an octogenarian.
If Sir Henry Thompson is wisely thus old-fashioned the writers of the second book are radicals of the utmost. Mr. and Mrs. Christian are the apostles of the “return to nature" and the eating of foods raw. “ Civilized man can live without cooks,” they say, (willfully misquoting Owen Meredith;) they will even have it that the ills of the flesh are pretty much ail due to two things—cooking and the eating of meat- Confine yourself to canning preparations of nuts, fruits, cereals, greens, or these things, even as they are, they say. and you will be a new man. However, eggs and milk are also allowed, and even advised. A further advantage of the new diet (the authors add) will be the emancipation of woman from the drudgery of the kitchen—aa if that emancipation hadn't proceeded pretty far already, with man still a cooking animal. ThQ. book contains a great many recipes for uncooked delicacies, including a concoction called " unfired bread ’’—and exhibits the zeal which is the most conspicuous virtue of* reformers—along with a oertain rashness of assertion which seems always to go with the zeal in question.
