It does not seem to occur to your contributors that the passing away of the poet was caused by tbe Introduction of the sewing: machine, which smothered " airy' nothings ** by a flood of miscellaneous literature.
Those of your readers whose memories are still “ green ’* with" regard to th® " thirties " and " forties ” will, I think, confirm me that, when every article of clothing, and every fabric about the house, had to be sewn by hand, there
was no time for the idler, no room for the gadabout; one only might read while the others worked with the needle. Hence th® '* home circle '* and a more choice literature.
The word ** home" seems to be dying out. and I think it Is a pity. It Is the “ homing instinct ” of the carrier pigeon that mates It the most favored of Its kind.	HENRY	D. PLIMSOLL.
