Xo Silent « N ” in “ An « in These Enlightened Day*.
,OMEO AND JULIET " stands alone in the whole Shakespeare por {folio for the portrayal of fomantic 7011115 love. The more closely we examine, the more we are astonished at the remarkably cttaTT number of such examples in all literature; here and there an " An cassia and Nicole tte,” a " Paul and Virginia,’' or a '* Hermann and Dorothea.”	'
The idyllic charm of the old, old-story is perennial. But it is a simple strain, so that, even in romances, it has usually been blended with others in accord with
it—of knightly ad-Yonth and	venture, of mystical
ln	quests, and of
Old and	,	,
Modern Fiction, worldly aspirations,
martial, political, and social—or, to make the effect more brilliant and complex, with sharply discordant strains—of jealousy, hatred, and every evil passion in the infernal index. The story of Isabella, as told in the Decameron and afterward in Keats’s poem, \ “ The Pot of Basil," is a striking example of this elemental mixture, in " Tho
Eve of St. Agnes " the element of mystery is predominant, as in nearly every production, good or bad, which marked the revival of romanticism in England and Germany.
Probably a careful survey of modern fiction, from George Eliot’s “ Adam Bede” to Howells’s latest novel, would show that youth has had more prominence in it and has been* more truthfully portrayed than in any earlier period of the art.
We Americans are probably deceived,in our estimate of the proportion allotted* to stories of young romantic love in present as compared with past fiction, because we are thinking not so much of novels as of short magazine stories. For, whatever change may have come over the good novel of our day, from a fiasr art and more realistic aim, it is slight as- compared with that which distinguishes the magazine short stories set before us now from month to month from those of fifty years ago. We do not forget that the popular novel of that time was likely to be something extremely sentimental, like “The Wide, Wide World” and “The Lamplighter," but there were then also, and running serially in this magazine, novels of a very different character, the best examples of Victorian fiction. On the other hand, the short story most in demand for American readers was the downright love story, appealing to a crude and half-awakened sensibility.
Against this retrospect ft Ts not strange that we should note a wide departure. It is especially noteworthy that where love happens still to be the story writer’s theme, it is in most cases the concern of people already married rather than of young lovers. The vast disproportion of marriage stories at the present time is maintained even if we exclude unhappy divorce stories, to wh^ch writers are strongly tempted, because the violation of solemn vows is more strikingly dramatic than the shifting of a fickle fancy in a free field. These stories, where marriage is pointedly the theme, are mostly written by married women. It is the world they live in. As one of these writers, who has been producing this kind of stories for a generation, and who began it before it was the fashion, writes us,
“ Marriage, like conduct, is three-fourths of life.” There it is, the real reason.—H. M. Alden in The Editor’s Study, August Harper’s.
The antiquated form that Mr. Kipling chose for the title of his new story, “ An Habitation Enforced.” has provoked much discussion. Most of those who have taken part in the discussion, so far as its echoes are heard in the press, seem, however, to overlook the fact that Mr. Kipling is an Englishman with all the faults of that honorable station. But a writer in The Saturday Review of The New York Times keeps the first of these facts in mind, though he neglects, If he understands, the second. He writes in this condescending and supposedly learned vein:
“ The ancient Greeks represented the aspirate by a comma inverted, or reversed, over tho aspirated letter, which seems to indicate that in very early days, as now, the aspirate was no consonant.
“ Mr. Kipling is perfectly correct in entitling his book 'An Habitation En-forced/ though we are equally correct, following the law of ‘ usage * in such matters, in pronouncing the title * A Habitation Enforced,’ it being so much easier to say * A Habitation' than to say ‘ An Habitation.'
*■-Surely the language is as much entitled to the * n * mute fn ‘ an,’ when convenience or usage demands it, as to ’ the 1 h ’ mute in * honor.’ ”
As if the usage of the Hellenes had anything whatever to do with the case! j It is hopeless to blaze away at such blank wa&s of ignorance, but it msy be worth while to suggest that the writers who use ** an ’* before a word beginning with an " h ** that is, properly sounded, and
not sQent. a»e Invariably careless about
sounding tho - “ h.** It is very probable that Mr. Kipling reads his title as M A habitation Hen forced.M He may not add
the ** h " to ** enforced,” but in all reason he should consistently~dx> so; He probably -prefers also " an- hundred," ** an union,” “an unit," *‘an one.”	"	■
As to the silent “ n ” in ** an/* this is an utter absurdity at this day. ■Some sleeping centuries ago It was a familiar thing- in our language, and we can see the effect of it in some words—of-dropping- , the final **n" in “an” or of carrying 1 it on to the following word, as Mr. Kipling''apparently does in his title. The word *■ newtIs properly “ ewt," the Initial “ n ” having been borrowed by careless usage from the article '‘an.” The same is true of “ orange,** which should have an initial **n/’ as the word comes from " narangi,” “naranj,M or ** naran-ja,*' according as one wishes to derive It through the Hindi, Arabic, or Spanish. Headers of Elizabethan literature will recall that'the “n” in “an” was carried over frequently In the word ** unde,” which Shakespeare and other writers often use as “ nuncio.’' But as Shakespeare failed to perpetuate this form, so we may rest easy as to the effect of Mr. Kipling's ** N a bitation/'—Columbia (S. C.) State,	.

Opinion of the Plots of Dickens.
For it was in plot One	that Dickens, as ev-
English Critic’s erybody knows, was
weakest. He observed with a freshness and keenness which scarcely any, perhaps no other, writer has ever equaled. He did not correlate or synthesize. Time after time ho was content to string his Wonderful characters, with an their oddities—their '< humors," as Ben Jonson would have called them—together in the thread of some impossible intrigue or Imbroglio, borrowed from that shadowy land where all the old nlots go to when they are dead and done Jrith. He went to life for his men and women; he opened up a vast kingdom of which few before him had ever guessed the existence; life itself he passed by. Actuality is the most striking feature of his detail; his synthesis lacks it altogether. His plot is not dependent on character. It Is rarely that the fortunes of his people are the result of their nature and environment* He loved them and their little ways, and seemed to Care about nothing further. So long as he could show their oddities, their “ humors," he had no thought to show the interaction of character and circumstance, but was content to spin any kind of plot, of which he pulled the strings as he would. The result was that absence of unity, that arbitrariness that is the secret of the difficulty of making plays out of his works. The characters live; the story is nothing like life.—London Academy.

Once More That Sleeping Sword.
The Nashville Banner is correct in pronouncing McLand-burgh Wilson's four lines better than any of those offered as improvements. The chief reason is that Wilson’s clever drift is not accurately caught by the other rhymesters. It Is necessary not merely that the first two lines be engaging in their nature, but that they present an introductory antithesis
which has a logical connection with the closing couplet and forms a natural approach to it. The Landmark ventures the following and calls for judgment on It:
A man of peace he is, but weeps For men-of-war by scores;
His sword within its scabbard sleeps, But, mercy, how it snores!

But so didactic a poet, a poet I who compels one to use all those long I words in 'ism, compels one also to exanx-

TIw poet who sent the sluggard to tho ant stopped short of claiming, for bis model a conscious virtue; Mr. Carman: makes moral agents of fir trees—his "Initiate gospeller firs’’—

Each day enough far them TO rise; cone?- branch, and stem,

Is that argument, or misused illustration? When Mr. Carman writes of his garden flowers—

I always half expect to hear -Some hint of what they mean to do; But never is their fine reserve Betrayed beyond a smile or two,

there assembled such literary banqueters as George Sand, Flaubert, Sainte-Beuve, Dumas fils, the Goneourts—is given in the new Volume of Mme. Adam's " Reminiscences/* What strikes the English reader is not so much the brilliancy as the audacity of the conversation. The
question debated was: Ought a woman novelist to be a grande amoureuse;
** So far," said George Sand. " the only reproach that one can bring against women writers is that they have loved too much. The proof of that? I find it in my own heart.”
“ You? ” exclaimed Dumas. •* Why, you have only loved the dummies who were to serve as the future heroes of your books—marionettes that you dressed up and made rehearse their parts. Is that to love? "
“ Look at us/’ Interposed Flaubert. “ We are four male writers of some account Are we great lovers? *'
“ I don't know, and I don’t care,'* George Sand retorted. "But it Is foolish to say that—to quote only the four last— Mme. de Stael, Mme. d'Agoult, Mme. de Girardin, and I have not been four ‘ grandes amoureuses/ It still remains, I think, to be proved that it is possible for a pretty woman who writes and has great talent to be content to be a mere wife, simple and affectionate.”
The reminiscence ts very piQuant if we try to find an English analogy to it* and to picture whichever of our own women novelists we consider the greatest thus frankly boasting of her emotional experiences across the dinner table to four eminent male rivals—say*, to Mr. Meredith, Mr, Hardy, Mr. Anthony Hope, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It has an added pfquancywhen we remember how long and. distinguished, fn this case, was thft list of lovers, including. Jules Sandeau, Prosper Merim£e, Alfred de Musset, and Chopin. It was not without reason that this grande amoureuse said at the close of her life: ** My heart £s a cemetery.** Still less without reason was It tfrg* Jules Sandeau, her first lover, who forsook her for a washerwoman, retorted? “ Her heart a cemetery? It is- a necropolis."—London Academy.

Calamities of a Fob Usher.
We shall all look forward with lively interest to the book which Mr. John Murray promises to write under the title, " The Calamities of a Publisher; or. Some Authors Diagnosed.” It is a fine, spacious title, and on that Mr. Murray is to be congratulated meanwhile. As everybody knows, a good title Is as a treasure, and then there Is so tnuch that might be said within the scope of this one. Authors diagnosed—and by a publisher! That would be a turning of the tables, for usually the process goe3 on the other way about. But how necessary the publisher still is we see In the circumstance that while Mr. Murray has not yet written any
oook he nas edited, or assisted with, some two hundred works. “ What’s her royalty? ” one lady author asked about another. If Mr. Murray had difficulty in replying, the answer, in his own case, would, perhaps, have been very simple.— The Book Monthly, London.

with it Doubtless Brandes exalte Byron too much, sets aside too lightly his serious faults in character and conduct, and mistakes at times his affectation for sincerity; but he comes far closer to critical sanity than his reviewer, who writes with an intense hatred, altogether apart from the purpose of criticism. The contrast between author and reviewer is best illustrated in their estimates of " Don Juan,” as given by Prof. Boynton. • * •	’
It might be said that In denouncing “ Don Juan ” Prof. Boynton has suggested. ln sharp outline, his own character; hut it would be unfair and even cruel to hold him to full responsibility for his uncritical condemnation. His attitude Is that of a professor of English literature in a great school for boys; and no doubt he has fallen into the habit of consider -ing the poem in relation to boys, to whom Its love scenes are a temptation, and often a source of injury. But it is one of those peculiar works of literature which men enjoy In middle life as much as they did in youth 1 though for different reasons.— Joseph O’Connor In The Rochester PostExpress.
