‘ A NEW NOVELIST.
' Mr. Eugene P. L^Ie, Jr/s, Brilliant Story of the	of	the
Mexican Empire.*
HE romance of Latin America is, to the majority of readers, a phantom which grows dimmer as their probably early reading of Prescott recedes into the distance. We know, tn a vague way, that beyond the Rio Grande there have been wars and rumors of wars for centuries of years, conquest and reconquest, and a strange, wfld, passional^ life, infinitely remote from Anglo-Saxon experience and temperament. We know that once an Archduke of the House of Austria grasped for a brief period, and in wavering hands, the sceptre of an empire of Mexico, and some of us may even have seen that Old World castle in which Carlotta, once Empress of Mexico, expiated through madness and sorrow the folly of her imperial husband and the treachery of the third Napoleon. And all this is, to the average imagination, a gilded pantomime, unreal and afar. To render vivid and actual these gorgeous scenes and events that collapsed finally in a tragedy so brutally mean and sordid bajg been the aim of Mr. Eugene P. Lyle in his first novel, “The Missour-faa.M
** The Missourian ** is a remarkable first book. It is crude enough in certain details, but its reading leaves no doubt as to the fact that Mr. Lyle possesses extrr*ordinary vision and power to communicate what his imagination sees. His narrative, too, is of epic breadth, carried through unswervingly. The result, were it less successful, would still be a splendid venture. An episode in the fate of nations, involving so much romance and tragedy, needing a background so varied and many colore^—here was a great subject to choose for a firsf book. To have succeeded so well in its execution places Mr. Lyle among those writers from whom much that is admirable may be expected.
The title of the book points to an intimate connection of its story with America. The Missourian, a hero half splendid and half grotesque, is one of that band of Confederates who, under Joe Shelby, refused, even at the elev-
i
enth hour, to surrender to the Federal forces and conceived the idea of com- ] plete expatriation by offering their 1 services to the tottering throne of Mex- \ ico. With this offer of military aid, X>in ^Driscoll, Missourian, Confederate Lieutenant Colonel, and storm centre in every fight* is sent to Mexico, where he sees the vision of a dissolving em*
. pire, and, of course, finds love. And , he finds love, rather absurdly and incredibly, tn the person of the Marquise j d'Au merle, exquisite, maddening, and sophisticated, first Lady of Honor to ! the Empress of Mexico and secret emissary from Napoleon. The crudity of j the book consists in the fact that this j strangely assorted ^pair of lovers save each other continually from hairbreadth | escapes, and that the spoilt child of two imperial Courts contemplates finding happiness on a Missouri farmstead. Yet from the point of view of sheer ro- 1 roance Din Driscoll and Jacqueline , d’Amnerle serve admirably for that thread of individual adventure and personal interest which had to run through the larger and more important action of the book.
But Mr. Lyle’s originality (which is, j after all, the one thing necessary to , make a new writer worth while) lies neither in his choice of subject nor in his brave story of bold adventure. It lies in his peculiar narrative manner— 1 a manner that will attract or repel the I reader, but hardly leave him indifferent. Mr. Lyle is bitten by a keen sense of the Ironies of Hfe, of its tragic ab-

surdity, of the grotesqiieness or the splendor and assumption of man. Hence his style is anything but impersonal or detached; his narrative anything but impartial. This may not be, probably is not, the best manner for the novelist, but with Mr. Lyle it is original and telling, and renders the reading of < his book a continual intellectual stimulus. At times, of course, every reader j
will rebel at Mr. Lyle's somewhat crude i
* i Americanism, for Instance, which seems
to have made It impossible for him to see that monarchy is symbolistic of a 1 nation's character and trkditlons, and that the ceremonial of a Court, though it may be exaggerated, is not necessarily sheer absurdity. But every well-defined individuality has the defects of its qualities. It is enough to say that with Mr. Lyle such an individuality !
I
makes its unmistakable appearance. i Next to this originality of narrative manner, Mr. Lyle’s most notable sue-cesses are the background of scenery and national life before which his fig-
j
ures move, and his delineation of the.j character of the Emperor Maximilian. j As one reads page after page of “ The Missourian ” one is transported by degrees (through the subtle art of a faun-dred details) into that sultry land of Mexico, whose vlarge, indolent weeds, shimmering swamps, and heavy fruited trees seem to accord with so complete a fitness with the character of its inhabitants—their alternate abjectness and ferocity, their physical and mental sloth. By making the peon and his land so vivid Mr. Lyle achieves his purpose of showing the madness of Maximilian's attempt.	•
And he, Prince Max, as he was called, half contemptuously? It matters Uttle whether he was indeed the man whom Mr. Lyle shows us. In “ The Missourian ” he is thoroughly human and convincing. A dreamer of Old World dreams he was, then, half saintly in his impulses, completely deta>ched from life’s realities, dazed when those sharp realities shattered the dream-world of his imperial imaginings, yet knowing how to die at last.
In the future work of Mr. Lyle one would wish to see with further increase of power and intelligence,, one radical change—a tendency, namely, toward greater restraint, away from linguistic grotesqueness—care, in a word, for that comeliness of form which inevitably increases the lasting appeal of any piece of literature.
