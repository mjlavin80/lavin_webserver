EVERYDAY VERSE.
Some Samples of the Plain Domestic Atuse of Byron Williams.
wjnCgSPHE felicity of rural life In‘the Middle West, its tranquil joys and homely sorrows, its all pervasive humor, make up the content of the book of versts of Byron Williams,
'* Down Country llanos,1" (Chicago: The .International Press.) Mr. Williams, we take it, is a country newspaper editor, or has been. The humors of the	rural	printing office abound in his
book.	The	" devil M and *' the office
towel ” are among his themes in his lighter moods. He also strikes a vein of sentiment right there, among the cases and composing stones and galley presses. For there are fair girl compositors in the land.
She clicks the type in her metal stick,
At the case against the wall;
And her eyes are brown as the sun-kissed leaf
In the glorious tinted Fall!
She clicks the type in a rhythmic drone, And her hands are lithe and fleet — Though the foreman fume and the devil swear.
She but smiles, and her smile is sweet!
Mr. Williams hits his sad and sombre moods, but they do not last long. He is generally cheerful:
I loves th’ man with jocund laf,	.
Th* man with heart o’ glee,
Tnat rocks hisself and *' haw-haw-haws ” Right out, and ships his knee!	!
1 Of course one may not always laugh.
The weather and the love of woman must
sometimes affect every man. In one of
his sentimental moods our domestic poet
i sings: i • i	Oh, lilies floating in bayous,
Oh, islands of. rustling reed, j	Oh, wiljows bending a,bove them,
Oh. daisies of fragrant mead—
I'm coming home!
He is quite at home in the vein of droll reminiscence so long favored by writers of American comic verse:
T wonder where Charles Gallop is—*twas him that druv the 'bus Back yonder where I uster live, a little country cuss!	•
Charles Gallop he was big an* tall. His ’bus was long an’ stout,
Th’ winders rattled scand’lous like, but never onct fell out!
Mr. Williams is also apt in the poetry of childhood, the expression in verse of the droll, impish kind of childhood so ably sung by Mr. Riley. Here is one of the little poems of this quality to lend variety to the book:
My ma she reckons time by almanacs,
An’ two years fr’m th* v-e-r-y day I cum!
Or else th’ next Spring after sister died— She figgers it all out by cry in' some!
My pa he estermates th' facts by books.
He’s Tcep’ a ** diary " now fer thirty years.
An’ knows when things was so, an’ sich, an’ thus,
’Ithout dependin' on *' I guess ** er " It appears! "
Aunt Sue she ’members fr’m th* awful snow
Of '88, er theretibouts somewhere!
The day afore this mos’ terrific storm
The big, warm sun was shinin’ Jest as fair!
Grandma she kalkerlates 'at she can tell Fr’m when she married my own Grandpa Pine!
She sez th' birds was singln’ jest as sweet As now—away back there In ’•!!):
But my grandpap he figgers best of all!
.He counts fr'm when the pie-plant up an* froze!
" There wa'n't n gol darn pie-plant pie that Spring!
That*s what my grandpap sez^-an* grandpap knows!
