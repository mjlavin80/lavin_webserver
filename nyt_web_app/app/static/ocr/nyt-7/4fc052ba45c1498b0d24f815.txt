RINC'E PETER AI-EXEI-vit:h Kropotkin 1= *me of the greatest living Russian geographers. Few people, however. consider th-.it fact in perusing h»P works on Socialistic subjects. To tho world at large his notoriety is due to the [act that he is a theoretical Anarchist, feared by the Russian oligarchy and at time? incomprehensible to even intelligent foreigners. 1 His genuine tame is thus lessened and i marred either through ignorance of his actual knowledge and ability or of pnvju- , dice against the cause he advocates. To , say that he thoroughly knows the Iitora- | ture of his country Is a simple truth- But ! naturally, what he thinks ;uid writes of j (hat literature is colored in accordance with his attitude toward society. It could not be otherwise. In the quietude of his Bromley cottage in Kent he has recently thrown into coherent form a number ot essays and lectures on Russian writers.
past and present, intermingled with biographical notes and observations concerning others of less Importance.
Both Kropotkin's material and his point of view are particularly significant at this time, for it may be that the next historian of Russian literature will find an- i other temper with which to deal. It is just possible that Kropotkin has the last word to say of that literature that has been bom in repression and suppression, nurtured by persecution, and whose rhetorical tropes are fashioned rather to deceive the censor than to add literary ornaments- Kropotkin, therefore. writes of a literature that has had seed, and has grown up and blossomed, or was cut down under tbe shadow of calamity. 13ven with full appreciation of the author's political bias the facts are too eloquent for deception. We know that such and such authors were deprived of their civic rights; that others were Imprisoned; that others w^re sent into that Eastern land across the t/rals. there to suffer a living: death In the Siberian mines. Such have been, the formative Influences and the inspirations ot Russian yterature-rclements which the whole world hopes will pass away with the overthrow of the oligarchy or with a loosening of Its reins on individual liberty*
Although WaJis-Tbe Pathological	zensky's	book on

Helles-Lettres.	-portant	informa.	.	tion, one . had to
turn, to the works of Melchior de Vogiifi and Osslp-Louri6 to appreciate the true pathological phase of Muscovite belles-lettres, It may be said with no spirit of exaggeration that Prince Kropotkin's volume, expanded, as It Is, from published essays, and particularly from his course of - lectures delivered at Lowell. Institute. Boston, four years ago, presents, this phase ln a manner which is to .be found in no other work printed in the English language. Even more may be said: Kropotkin being himself a revolutionist, it is most natural that- he should emphasise that aspect of Russian literature beyoud the point reached by the French critics. The spirit that only occasionally Inspires them he evokes on every page. The natural accusation that Kropotkin is not sufficiently detached to make a reliable critic Is rendered unimportant through the fact that his very prejudices give force to fundamental truths. An authoritative historian and critic of the literature of Russia cannot detach himself from the political .aspect of the country. It may be parenthetically remarked, however, that. certain Russian writers who have so detached themselves receive slight attention from Kropotkin;, .very probabiy they possess a certain, amount of literary value. By the same token, certain characters In Russian novels, notably the “Anna Rareinna” of Tolstoy,,are not analyzed, in accordance with the principles of the foreigner—whether, literary . or moral Anna’s fate, for example, is not regarded as the inevitable consequence of transgressing the moral law. but as a result of the opinion of hypercritical, narrowminded females.
But neither the moral nor th& literary attitude of foreigners is likely to receive a shock from Kropotkin*3 eloquent and striking pictures of such -dominant literary personalities as Fomyalovsky, Ryeshetnikov; Levi tor, Gorky, and- their' fellows ' who have ; written and . still write under: the shadow of that calamity which is about to be dispersed.

Ryeshetnikov. the jester of jovial monks, and Ryeshftmkov, the founder of the ultra-realistic* school of Russian folk-novel ist s. is a personality of great and enduring and human attributes in the hands of his biographer, and what Kropotkin, as a critic, says of his characters is no less striking. " For Ryeshetnikov’s heroes, who live all llieir lives without being sure of bread for the morrow, death is not a. catastrophe; it sic.:ply means less and less force to one's food, less and less energy to chew one’s dry piece of bread, le-ss and (ess bread. less oil fn the lamp— and the lamp is blown out.'*
Or. take the case of Levitor. *' that sweet, pure Mower of the steppes." What wus tbe nature of the spiritual blight he received amid the Intellectual proletariat in the great, cold, and stupendous, yet hidden eguLism of lhe capital on the Iseva?
Whenever he stayed at St. Petersburg or ai Moscow he always lived in the poorest quarters, somewhere on the outskirts of the town; they reminded him of his native village. And when he thus settled among the’ lowest strata of the population he did so, as he wrote himself, " to run away from the moral contradictions, the artificiality of life, the would-be humanitarian ism, and the cut-and-dried imaginary superiority of the educated classes." He could not live, even for a couple of months in Summer, in relative weil-being; he began to feel the gnawings of conscience, and it ended in his leaving behind his extremely poor belongings and going somewhere—anywhere—where he could be poorer still.
Many of the authors in this book are merely names to tlie foreigner, some of them not even that; but all have Lhelr tragic fate very often summed up in a few lines—the brilliant student of some university, a youthful poem In which were mere allusions to the evils of autocracy, and then—Siberia and a life of dark, glacial advance upon the powers of Intellectual and spiritual uight.
The student of the drama may find noLfciug new In the origin of tbe Russian stage as described by Kropotkin* In Russia, as else when*-, tho drama developed, on one hand, out of tlie religious mysteries, and on the other out of popular comedy, until university students gave it Graeco-Latin form and character. Pathologically. Its evolution Is similar to that of Lhe Russian novel. Russian tragedy and comedy is a sealed book for most of us, but it will amply repay examination and e;rploi tation.	.
Finally, Prince Kropptkin ts to be congratulated on the fine command that he has obtained over the Intricac'.cs of his adopted tongue. But his English, in its short, feverish sentences or in its similitudes strong with the figure cif suspense, reveals Slavonic thought as the ipminant and Inspiring note.
