yew York Timrs Book Review:
I THINK we are now pretty well satisfied on two points; First, that the only true -poetry, i. e.. Imaginative poetry, flourishes almost exclusively in a rude condition of society, and. secondly, that this law of environment, supported by historical and physiological *act explains —and nothing else does—the decline of poetry in modern times. I want to use an accent of slight reserve because I remember Milton; but macauiay does not hesitate to claim that we can thank Milton's blindness for Paradise l-*ost.” It was undoubtedly a great contributing element in, producing that solitary, that splendid, that wonderful poem.
As a natural sequel to our most interesting discussion on poetry in your book Review I would ask indulgence for just a few words of more particular criticism on present-day verse. My text, as it hap- | pens, comes sudden and straight without seeking it from your correspondent of last week, who refers to a recent poem of Mr, Edwin Markham’s, calling it “ perhaps the noblest love-poem of any length yet produced in America.** If so, I say, then alas for the cooing lovers of America— their destitution is indeed pitiful I But your correspondent does not stop. He goes madly on. He compares this poem, entitled ** VirgiUa," with Tennyson’s ** Maud "—and of suqh an action Mr, Markham himself would, I think, be candid enough to say: " Truly an enemy hath done this thing!"
Matthew Arnold claims that the best -way to judge doubtful verse is to use the greatest poetry as a touchstone, an acid, by •which to try it, but in this case I think neither that feat of literary metallurgy nor the classic habit of contrast would be necessary. In my opinion the poem is so full of faults and crudities that to compare it with Tennyson's 4* Maud " is nothing less than a capital offense, for which I can suggest no adequate punishment except the reading of
Mr. Murkham*^ othex poeros.
Is it not good that some voice should be raised in protest against this maudlin eulogy of bad poetry? Are we to suffer plagues of Robert Montgomerys and to see literary charlatanism prosper unrebuked while real merit is ignored—without a single plea for the true, the genuine in | present-day verse?	1
Take this so-landed poem '* Vlrgilia.*' It | appears in the current Cosmopolitan. Its form is lyric. Can any acute lover of poetry read four verses without feeling Its utter artificiality? Of all the poetic j forms there is none in which we look for ! sweet, easy cadence, for naturalness, as ■we d(> in the lyric ■ form. It should be liquid, dainty, rhythmic, artlessly perfect. Try Burns’s lyrics by this standard and see how well they stand it. There is hardly one of these requirements In “VIr-gilia." Ail there seems to be is alliteration, and not good alliteration either.
In thi3 production no weakness stands so confessed, no proof of our modem sterility stands forth so naked and ashamed, as its barrenness bolstered with phrases. Alliteration should be the gargoyle—not the column. Here it is the column, gargoyle, and alL Than this alliteration-rampant In all present-day verse—could anything be surer' proof of lack of fine thoughts, of reaV poetic power? ~
And when it comes to images, do not ^forget what Macaulay says about our mod* em Imagery being but symbols. In this
*	poem I can find hardly one image, one metaphor, which is not strained, trivial, or; absolutely false. Take the second verse:
That lone last peak of my soul had spoken That last peak lost in light. - / :
Who ever heard, of a peak speaking? And supposing a peak could speak, imagine honeyed love accents from its craggy 'Ups*... And An the omitted first -two .lines of the stanza, what is meant by the statements** With you-the cloud of my, Ufa had biSkenr' Worse follows. In the next
stanza the poet speaks of “a precious pain In my pulsing side." What inanity, what vulgarity!
In verse six note the line, '* After the dust of the grave is tasted "—what an unhappy and ridiculous'figure tor the closing scene, the last bourne, of the lives of all of us!
Then note the careless tautology of line three In the third last stanza of the poem —“ I will taste the dust of the road." The conception in either case has not a shred of the probability and aptness demanded of every figure, whether in poetry or ! prose.
In the final stanza of this truly striking poem, ** The wild white foam of a river crumbles "—picture foam crumbling! And then we are done—and well-done.
These are just a -few criticisms here an& ! there from countless others to which this " poem " exposes itself. I would like in closing to quote two stanzas from Tennyson's " Maud,” the poem which has been recklessly mentioned in comparison, and : to ask whether the last true lyric singing did not depart with the author of these stanzas, so sweet, so tender, so lofty:	,
From the meadow your walks have left ! so sweet
That whenever a March wind sighs,
He sets the jewel-print of your feet
In violets blue as your eyes.
To the woody hollows in which we meet,
And the valleys of Paradise.
The slender acacia would not shake
One long milk-bloom on the true The white lake-blossom fell into the lak<3.
As the pimpernel dozed on the lea:
But the rose was awake all night for your sake,
Knowing your promise to me;
The lilies and roses were all awake,
They sighed for the dawn and thee.
Mr. Markham may feel one satisfaction, and that is that such criticisms as I express are in general true of all contemporary verse, with the possible exception-of Mr. Kipling's, and that of two or three other English poets, who are doing such work as their age allows them in the only way in which it can be greatly done— with all their heart and all their soul and strength and all that in them is.
