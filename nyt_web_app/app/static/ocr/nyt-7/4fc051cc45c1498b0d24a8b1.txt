iPSTON consistently follows the advice of Dr. Holmes. " Don’t be consistent," and nobody was much surprised when the late Miss Abby L. Alger, daughter of a Unitarian minister, translated the " Little Flowers ” Of St. Francis, but that the leading Baptist newspaper should recently publish a poem addressed to him did somewhat amaze its readers. Both translation and poem were evidence that there will be a warm welcomc for " II Libro d’Oro,” a remarkable book now in preparation by Messrs. Little, Brown & Co. It is not, as a lover of Rogers might infer, a list of the Venetian aristocracy, but a collection of some sixscore Italian legends gathered from four untranslated books, ** The Lives of the Holy Fathers, Together with the Spiritual Field,” Venice.	" The Lives of the Saints, and
Beati of Tuscany,” Florence, ]<J27; " The Wonders of God and His Saints,” Bologna, 1503, and " Flowers of Sanctity," Venice,
171*.
The translator is Mrs. Francis Alexander, the mother of the artist, Miss Francesca Alexander, whose work Ruskin commended so highly. The^Jaughter wrote “ The Story of Ida ” and the versified legends published under the title *' The Hidden Servants,” and the mother is mistress of the same excellent English style-direct, simple, flowing into beautiful forms without the smallest trace of affectation. As a piece of English the book should commend itself to those who select residing for the young. Its substance bespeaks the favor of the devout, whether Catholic, like the original authors, or Protestant, like the translator.

Mr. Harry Leon Wilson’s " The Boss of Little Arcady ” will be published in August, in time for the Summer reader, who will find it illustrated by the author’s wife, “ O’Neill,’' of Puck. Its publishers, the Lothrop, Lee & Shepard Company, have received from Dr. Hale a twelve-page introduction for '* The Only True Mother Goose," an edition which will reproduce the Munrot & Francis issue, Boston, 1S33. They have sold a large edition of Mrs. Edith N. Nicholl Bowyer's *' The Human Touch ” to Messrs. Keegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co., and have received a new novel from Mr. Charles Clark Munn, the author of ’* Uncle Terry.” The title of the book is ** Clip, a Waif in the Wilderness,” and it is a story of the Maine woods and two coast villages. Some of its characters have already figured in ” The Hermit,” but the book is not a continuation of the earlier noveL

Messrs. Herbert B. Turner & Co. are bringing out Mr. F. Dickberry's " The Storm of London,’* which, in spite of a farcical plot, is really a criticism of English society manners and national policy, and blends the most modem ideas with solemn moralizing of the eighteenth century variety put into tbe mouths of servants. Mr. Albert R. Carman’s “ The Ethics of Imperialism,” which comes with it, •so frankly attacks the men calling themselves by the unblessed name of "altruist ” that it will scandalize those good folk who fancy the term to be Christian, and yet the author’s teachings do not go beyond Washington’s injunction of constant jealousy of foreign influence and his warning that ** there can be no greater error than to expect or calculate upon real favors from nation to nation.1* Presented in terms of twentieth century science, both injunction and warning will astonish many who would call the M Farewell Address ” old-fashioned.
** The Poems of Emily Dickinson," now on Messrs. Little, Brown & Co.’s list, have just been published in London, and Mr. Douglas Sladen, writing in The Queen, says that they have " quite a Blakiah originality," although at her worst Miss Dickinson " would have made even Wordsworth laugh." Further, he finds that the taste of . her editor, Col. Higgin-son, has “ much distinction/’ and also that he *’ has long been the literary dictator of Boston.’’ -When one considers the principles of criticism laid down in many of his early essays and reviews in The Atlantic Monthly one devoutly wishes that this were true. Mr. Dwight Tilton’s ** My Lady Laughter** has also been reprinted ln London, and this Mr. Sladen finds an Interesting-and pretty story, it is pub* lished by Messrs. Dean & Son, who issue **Foollsfi Jlnance."

** The Little People of the Sycamorc ” and “ The Return to the Trails ” have been chosen by Prof. Roberts for the small gift book volumes for 1905, and have been revised and slightly enlarged. Two more new volumes of the Little Cousin series will be " Our Little Cousin,” by H. Lee M. Pike, and "Our Little Mexican Cousin,” by Mr. F. R. Guernsey, an American whom long residence has taught to love Mexico and her people. If the Mexican be not the most fascinating of all the " cousins ’* it will not be for lack of the author's good will.
