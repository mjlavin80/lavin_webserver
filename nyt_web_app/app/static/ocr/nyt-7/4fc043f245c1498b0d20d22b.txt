John^Henry Smith above all things was a goiter. Having been left a neat little fortune by his father, he proceeded
to turn over to tbe use of the Wood-
t
vale Golf Club the rolling acres of the old farm where he wafe born. The first tee ‘Was under an elm which was planted by the Smith who was born in 1754. Beyond it was a church, where Washington attended services, and where the present Smith's parents were married.
A straight ball was likely to carry the lane and insure a good lie, but a sliced ball always went through the church windows. However, as Mr. Smith says,
** the church was no longer used, and besides there is no excuse for slicing a ball." On the second hole it is necessary to carry the old graveyard where lie all the buri&d Smiths. The grass about here being thick and rank makes it " an ideal hazard."
Smith being no duffer, objected to women in the game. They were well enough on the veranda, but out of place on the links. Besides a woman never looks well while driving a ball. All this, together with a lot of other genial information, Smith imparts confidentially to himself in his diary. But things showed a change with the arrival of the Hardings* Robert L. Harding was a great railroad magnate who had been so busy all his life driving railroads that he hadn’t time to drive balls. When lie first watched the game he frankly expressed bis preference for shinny. Anybody, he said, ought to be able to send a ball a few hundred yards without the least trouble. Shinny was much more scientific. In proving his point he drove a ball with such vigor that it raised a large bump on the side of Farmer Bishop’s head as that gentleman was passing along on the way to market.
Harding has a daughter, and it is she
who makes Mr. Smith take back all he
said about women and golf. It is she,
too, who, later, makes him foresake the
links long enbugh to travel over the face
of Europe in search of her. Also, there
is recorded here the startling career of
Bishop's hired man—a most unusual hired -
man, who first brought the attentive gaze
of his employer upon him by firmly demanding a cake of soap, a bath tub, and comb and brush. Afterward, being prepared for anything in the way of a ‘surprise, it was not at all remarkable to Bishop that he was able to give even Kirkaldy, the professional, a few poimers on the playing of golf, and.that the running of an automobile was mere child’s play for him.
The story, told in Mr. John Henry Smith’s delightful and hearty style, is particularly suitable for Summer reading, setting forth the fresh youthfulness of the railroad magnate in spite of his fifty odd . years; t,he wholesome womanliness of Mrs. Harding, who might have enjoyed her Summer at the Woodvale links very much better had she only been sure that the fruit at' home was: not suffering in the canning process by her absence, and who longed for a few homely socks to dam in her leisure moments; the joyousness of the light-hearted Miss Harding— ■ a goddess to most of the men, plain " Kid ” to her father, and all the other members of the happy golf family—a wholesouled, joyful company curiously free from the species of snob (I>a Hume excepted) which one meets in such gath-. crings in books as well as real life.
