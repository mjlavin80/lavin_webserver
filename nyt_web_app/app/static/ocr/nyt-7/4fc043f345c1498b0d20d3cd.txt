I trust you will be good enough to per: mit me to express my amazement at learning from reading the criticism of Dr. Brandes's " Main Currents or Nineteenth CenturJ? Literature," by Ii- W. Boynton July 15, that Dr. Braudes overvalues Gie poetry of Campbell, Moore, and Scott, and that the doctor “ seriously regards the ' Irish Melodies ' as wonderful poems ” and that ** She is far from the land where her young hero sleeps " is a doggerel ditty, and ** the fact that * she * is Ireland and ' ho' is Robert Emmet, can now,” according to Mr. Boynton,
*' hardly alter our sense of the paltriness of this stuff, considered as poetry."
I am sure the admirers of Campbell, Moore, and Scott will not permit themselves to have their opinions of the genius possessed by the trio which I have named affected by the criticism of the gentleman who hails from a small town in Massachusetts, but will bravely continue their favorable judgments and look with nonchalance at his—Mr. Boynton’s— vagaries.
Mr. Boynton, however, errs when in criticising the worth of Moore’s poem, one stanza of which appears In this communication, he says ** that * she ' is Ireland and * he * Robert EmmeL" “ She is far from the land ’’ refers to the betrothal of Robert Emmet to the daughter of John Philpot Curran. She afterward became the wife of a British officer, who took her to Sicily in the hope that travel would restore her spirits, but her grief for Emmet was so great that she died of a broken heart.
