NEW FRENCH BOOKS
“Le Passe Vivant” by Henri de Reg-nier and “L'Esciave" by His Wife.*
By Arrangement With The London Times.
TERATURE in France has reached at last a parting of the ways. showing, no doubt, the influence of two widely different Ideals of conduct and education—two streams of tendency. Novels now, like public schools, have their classical and their modem side. "We have glanced recently at one or two of the younger French novelists, democrats who bear witness to the scientific spirit. Such are M. L6on Frapi6 and M. Charles Louis philippe. With them we might class M- Edouard Estuunife, and even, to a certain extent, M. Marcel Provost. Problems of social development occupy these younger men; they have plenty of ideas, generous feelings, a keen sense of modern life, but, as a rulet a pretentious and difficult style, little love of beauty, and no artistic instinct. When we turn from them to the other school—to the classical side—it Is at first with a sigh of relief: " Here at last is a man who can write!”—only too swiftly followed by a sense of a quite extraordinary mental and moral vacuum. These romancers have indeed tho gifts of beauty and suggestion; they know magical words that weave a spell and show us what they say; but that is all; theirs Is a voice and nothing else. The ancient Gauls in their Druidical ceremonies were wont to invoke three gifts—the eye that sees, the heart that feels, the brain that reflects and combines; but tho Druids in modern France, following a modern f&«hion, have refused to make an elder son of any novelist; no man has the full Inheritance. Some, like Pierre Loti and Gerard d'Houville, have the eye that net only sees but makes others to see. and creates, as it were, a new shade In the spectrum; others, like M. Charles Louts Philippe, whom we reviewed the other day, and M. Romain Holland (a writer to whom we must return on a future occasion) have the heart to feel; M. Provost and M. EstaunI5 (with, indeed, most of the novelists who belong to what we have called the modem side) possess the brain that reflects and combines. But where shall we find artist and thinker united? Perhaps, five years hence, that more complete creator will bear the name of Romain Rolland or Mme. Marcelle Ti-nayre, or (if she master a too tumultuous temperament) the Countess Matthieu de'Noailies—which lady Is a sort of little Fairy Queen, who deserves more than a mere salute en passant.
We do not expect this sentient and
thinking genius from either of the do
R&gnlers; but they write uncomonly well
—Jt is difficult to write better prose than
that so easily, so lucidly, so charmingly.
and yet so elaborately produced by these
two poets. Their books appear with
something of the same spontaneous perfect skill and definite rightness that we find in tbe flowering of a rose, M. de R£gnler writes, we think, the finer poetry, but Mme. de R6gnler (Gerard d’Hou-ville) gives us more beautiful prose. It Is surprising how much talent, of a singularly rare and cultivated sort, is concentrated tn ono library of old Paris—the library of the Arsenal. The librarian of that enclent building Is, as every one knows, the Academician Jos£ do H£r£dia, whose poems, perfect and hard and soulless as caskets of Limoges enamel, are no less impeccable and no more interesting than those of Thfiophlle Gautier. In their small way—their bric-a-brac way— they are very fine art indeed; and they have no sort of relation to Nature. How M. de H£r£dia and his sons-In-Iaw would roar with delight at Matthew Arnold’s reference to poetry as a criticism of Life! Art is to them, as It was (to our English playwrights of the Restoration, a world tho more charming1 and recreative that, like some bright star in space. It is wholr ly cutside cf our moral and social pre-, occupations—a world of delight, beauty, an3, above all, amusement. And there is certainly something to be said for their point of view. We all need toys.
Of the three beaut tful daughters of M. de‘ Hfircdia, one married M. Pierre Louys, whose reconstructions of antique society have certainly nothing to say to Matthew Arnold, or to any moralist Yet It is impossible to deny great talent to the au-

thor of " Aphrodite.” A second daughter became Mme. Maindron. Readers o£ the Revue de Paris and, in fact, most amateurs of French literature, have present in tbeir minrts the precise, vivid, indeed gorgeous, prose-epics of M. Maurice Maindron; they are generally composed of scenes from the Wars of Religion in France, and are full of lust, color, blood, murder, battle, and sudden death. Thare is a ccrtain sad Is me, an undeniable perversity, something indecent and almost satanic ln the art of these considerable writers, each in his own way a stylist of the rarest quality. It Is impossible not to sdmire, and difficult not to condemn.
In reading them we think of a certain old Florentine coachman who gave vent to his irritation against the inventor of tramways. " Were I the King of Italy," ss-id he, “ I would call that man. I would take him to the top of the Palazzo Vec-chio, I would decorate him with the Order of St. Maurice and St. Lazarus—and then I would pitch him bodily into space." Were we, in Plato’s sense, the guardians of the Republic, even so would we serve M. Pierre Louys and M. Maurice Maindron. But we would confine ourselves to decorating M. and Mme. de R6gnier. For the third daughter of M. de H6r£dia married M. Henri de R6gnler, chiefly known at that time for his austere, noble, and classic verse, In which an echo of Ronsard rings unmistakably. Since then he has produced a good many novels, less classic, less noble, and decidedly less austere. Mme. de Rfignier was known as the author of some delightful verses published ln the Ravue des Deux Mondes, when last year she produced her first novel, L’lnconstante.” We reviewed at the time that very pretty book, as irresponsible as any exquisite but improper comedy by Beaumont and Fletcher. And “ L' Esc lave,” her new book, has fhe same supple, pliant grace, turn by turn languid and alert, the same haunting nweetness; the same simplicity which is so admirable an art, and therewithal the same dainty, disdainful independence. No, Mme. de R&gnfer is not serious, and Aris-I totle himself would have to take her as 1 she is; but she is perfectly natural, and i while perfectly amoral, no more immoral than a bird or a kitten. We would not pitch her from the tower of the Palazzo.
Like Pierre Loti—whose talent hers In i some degree resembles—Mme. de Rfegnler has a magical way of making you evoke strange places where you have never been with half a dozen quite ordinary words ' of simple description. It Is New Orleans that she calls up before us in her new book, " L’Esclave.*’ There are plenty of 1 slaves in the book (released, of course,) prospeious, familiar old blacks; but the s’ave of the title Is their mistress, and she Is Passion's slave—or, rather, since passion Is too fiery a word for the nonce, the slave pf her own senses. The interest i. of the book lies, not in her love affair, but rather in the scenery in which that love affair takes place. We visit New Orleans in Summer, with its perfumed gardens, full of roses and lemons, pinks and magnblias; its great yellow flood of a Mississippi, which the gaslight and the
■	shadow paint in stripes at night, like a j tiger; Its quaint old French quarter with white painted walls, and pretty Ironwork ; balconies on which the Creole ladies j stand and spread their snowy muslins; and the streets are full of chattering:, cheerful, Irresponsible darkles. ’ Something voluptuous, superannuated, sensual, t>nd delicate In the very atmosphere reminds us of the author of " Manon Lcs-caut" and the author of *' Les Natchez," ond we remark that Louisiana has ever been singularly fortunate in inspiring the I authors of France. After the Abbfi Pr6-vest, after Chateaubriand, Mme. de Rig-nter lv*s still found a hahdful of laurels to glean.
M. de Rfegnier does not take us so far afield; he has not the magic gift of his ‘ wife. On the other hand, there Is a sort of an idea in ** Le Passe Vlvant," a faint tcho, a thin and watery dilution of M. Maurice B^rr&s’s theory of ancestor-worshlp: ** We have no individual exist-, ence; we are merely links in a chain; our ancestors live again in us, and the very : deeds we do are inspired by the dead.'* As a rule, the classic side, grouped be* neath the banner of M. Barrds, stand, like those persons in " Dante," with their heads twisted round upon their shoulders, looking backward:

The attitude- appears uncomfortable to lookers-on, but it .affords them a singular satisfaction,. and to none znore: than to M. de R£gnier. Something* distin-gulshed, elegantly contorted,- or at least artificial, pervades his work^ His psychology is summary, but the ^heer incisiveness of trait and silhouette gives an undeniable vividness to the personages of “Le Pass6 Vlvant” In Jean de Franols and Maurice do Jonceuse he draws uS two characteristic types., of the contemporary French young man;, the one reserved, exalt£, nervous, and- melancholy; the other practical, positive, energetic, and .even restless to the verge of .neuras-tfef^tia. • In .his own way,, which is differ-.eai t»-.G£rard d* Ho uvi lie's, M. de Rggnler j the eye that>eep. .
