The career of William Hogarth, though to Itself uneventful, touched the life of his times at many points, and offers an almost inexhaustible field for investigation and comment. Furthermore, his activity as graphic artist is by no means confined to the production of the moral and satirical designs by which he is chiefly known. Any catalogue of his paintings will reveal a surprising productiveness on his part in work which is not naturally connected with him in our minds.
For the reason just stated Prof. G. Baldwin Brown of the University of Edinburgh has attempted the new work on the artist which Charles Scribner's SonB are about to send out in this country. It is included in the series on “ The Makers of British Art,’* which already Includes Gainsborough, Raeburn, Wilkie, Romney, Turner, Landseer, and Constable.
Hogarth is not treated of here solely as the “ original genius striking out for himself In a new artistic line.” He was a " maker of British art," writes Prof. Brown, because " he was the first outstanding personality of the British school of painting, and the first English painter whose name became a household word on the Continent." The book notices the Tnii-fn facts about Hogarth's life and art, and indications are given which may be of use to those who wish to study the subject further. The introduction discusses Barry’s glimpse of the artist Hogarth, under diverse aspects, as the patriot* moralist, and the painter, and the modern estimate of his handling in oils. A list of his works is given as well as a bibliography and a list of the literary remains of “ Ala Hoggart," the literary uncle of Hogarth. There are twenty halftone reproductions of some of the best known of Hogarth’s works, and a photogravure of the portrait of himself painting the “ Comic Muse.”
