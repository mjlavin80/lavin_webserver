Another volume of memoirs of the Whig Party in England by I^ord Vassal Holland will be published* by E. P. Dutton
&	Co. with the title, ** Further Memoirs of the wHig Party.” Tho volume begins in 1807 and closes in 1821. with the death of Queen Caroline, the ** luckless " consort of George IV. In a supplementary chapter of miscellaneous recollections, begun ln 1S26. Lord Holland gives such Joreign anecdotes and recollections of fer-( eign personages as “ accident, credible report, or personal observation ’* brought within his knowledge. He writes:
In this T propose to set down whatever I have learned worth commemorating, concerning those persons who, whether Englishmen or foreigners, have during my time, without immediate connection with politics, acquired or deserved celebrity for genius or talent, learning or wit,
In science, in art, in poetry, in literature, or in conversation. *	*	*	I	do not,
however, preteDd to much accuracy of research, nor do I aspire to tbo office of biographer of my contemporaries; still less p)Tn I qualified to become the historian of* Ii terature, arts, or sciences. Mine are notes and reminiscences of an Idle, and, in some senses ignorant, spectator. They are rambling, desultory, and Imperfect, and' often more calculated to raise than to satisfy curiosity. But they are true; they relate also to subjects* which, havihg afforded amusement and instruction to the writer in the course of his life, may possibly prove neltl\pr unpl easing nor un instructive to some reader of similar habits and taste after its close.
Among tbose he writes about are Horace Walpole, Gibbon, Sheridan, Tlckell, George Selwyn, Lady* Ossory, Dr. Good- ' all. Fox, Mrs. Hewitt, Sydney, Robert Percy Smith, Canning, Goya, John Flas-
man, I^broot, p-nH many others. The i
Appendix contains some letters.	1
