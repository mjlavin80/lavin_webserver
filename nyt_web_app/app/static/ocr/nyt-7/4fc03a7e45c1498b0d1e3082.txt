The parts of speech are considered in their natural order, ending, of course, with conjunctions and interjections. The thirty pages devoted to the pronoun and the sixty-one pages devoted to the verb are most thorough and instructive, treating quite fully of essentials, with a few of the non-essentials which occasionally confront the reader of French classics prepared for the schoolroom. The scarce five pages devoted to the prepositions, however, seem hardly in keeping with the -rest of the volume. An exasperating omission is the use ot " avec " as a conjunction—a subject which forms an important item in tho last report of the French Minister of Public Instruction. Which verbs are to take “fi." and which “ de *' are also somewhat carelessly defined, But the-significance of these prepositions in regard to nouns is simply and judiciously put. Too much praise, how-1 ever, cannot be given MM. Bercy and i Castegnier for their good intentions. In the hands of an intelligent native teacher in sympathy with the natural method
of imparting a language this " Simple Grammaire Frangaise" should win success, and by success tbe popularity it really deserves.

The. system followed by this grammar might be called one of interpolation; also it presupposes that the teacher handling it will be able to speak idiomatic French to the pupils instructed. In the first place, the directions, rules, &c., are all in French, with English equivalents for some of tbe more difficult words placed In parentheses. The same method is Ob- j served In -exercises concerning the agreement of adjectives with nouns, verbs with^1 i subjects,- and pronouns with antecedents^—
^ the crucial word is left to be interpolated.
