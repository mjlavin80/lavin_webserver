. The poets of the century are taken to 1 be not only those who may be gazetted 8 ^ultimately as poets of all time, but also I those Vho during a remarkable period of | energy and development have represented I in poetic form the faiths and doubts, I the hopes and fears, of the great heart 9 of humanity which has throbbed through the generations, the time beat of the song ot liberty and the march of progress.	v
Beginning with Crabbe. whoSe work divides the eighteenth from the nineteenth century, combining the old with the new spirit, the work goes down, in chronological order, according to the birth of the poet, to Samuel Taylor Coleridge; the times of Southey, Landor, Campbell, Moore, Byron, Shelley; from John Keats to Lord Lytton, which " marks the limits of a period remarkable rather for the number and variety of its lesser luminaries than for the all-ecllpsing brilliance of any particular star"; the singers bom between 181S and 183C, " a period of great unrest in public life and of great variety in poetic output,” and from the Tennyson brothers to the time of Arthur H. Clough, " a period distinguished by the poetry of Alfred Tennyson and Robert Browning/’
