The titl~ oT this book suggests a comparison wilh tht* well-known work cf Judge Cooley on constitutional law it'. t!-* Cf^ted States, whirh has been extensively ;:s*d ! as a textbook. Judge Cooleys work, though written a quarter of a c*c r; i;.ry : ago. has been brought nearly up u> due its third edition. It covers the entire fieM uf constitutional law. but Its arrangement is inferior, in our judgment, to that of McClain's hook. For example, in Cooley the discussion of Congress's power to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas Is sandwiched in between the power of Congress over copy-
rights ami Datents ami its po%vr to declare war. Sonit- such urilor is found. Ft *is true, in the ('numeralion in the Pedoral t’onstilution- of tho imwrr.-i of t'ongrL’ss, hut it K net a logical one to follow in a treatise, In McClain,* the ijuestion of piracy is Jogically taken up in the chapter on th*' punishment of crinn*. McClain is generally fuller than Coolly, and writes In a more interesting way. though Cooley's* more frequent citation >>f cases makes his hook more valuable, perhaps. Tor tlie lawyer. In his reliance upon footnotes, trow-s ever, to furnish references for outshln reading he assumes that tht* ordinary stu-cUut is likely tu look them up. aii assumption which Is scarcely warranted. McClain's carefully prepared bibliography i? superior to O*oley*s system of footnotes, and is a conspicuous feature of lh« Work* Cm the whi-!o. we should rxt>''ct lo see McClain supplant Cooley to a considerable extent in the schools and coliwu-'S.

This textbook on American Constitutional law ia published in *ha American Citizen Series, edited by Prof. Hart, and Is constructed on tho same excellent plan | ■which has been followed In the previous volumei* of the series. '	*
The classified bibliography and the references ftt the beginning of each chapter together furnish opportunity for a more, extended study ot the subjects dea.lt with in tho text. The hook, while designed primarily for purposes of formal instruction, is admirably adapted to Answer questions which constantly arise in studying or reading American history. The discussion of knotty legal points Is In tho main avoided, so that the work, though 'written by a lawyer, will be quite intelligible to laymen* justice. McClain -warns his readers that ho attempt has been made to make his book either easy or popular. While this' Is true, we are impelled to add that the clear arrangement and conciso style, the subordination ot Retail, and the avoidance of a mere mechanical erdcr In the presentation of topics save It from stereotyped formality er dull abstruseness. While reference is constantly made to the decisions of the courts,t it la made for the sake.Jf explaining principles rather'th&n of staling tho specific points decided; or,' as the lawyer would say, the precedents. ‘ As to the* arrangement, the volume la divided into eight parts. In the first, pn‘ the “ System ofGovemment/V the peculiar nature-of our*.dual' systen/ Is carefully explained, and the apparent paradox, of. divided sovereignty accounted . for, The_ authors. words are these: ".Ths general powers. °f government are vested In the de-•partpients.of theState.
