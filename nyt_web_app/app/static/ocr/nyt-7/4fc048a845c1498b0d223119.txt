ECONOMIC ESSAYS
FACTS AND FIGURES, tti* Basis of Economic Science. By Edward Atkinson. One volume. Pp. 202. New York and Boston: Houghton. Mifflin & Co. 12mo. Cloth.
:	** Facts and Figures ” Is a collection of
essays on economic subjects, in which the wisdom of the sage finds expression in a ! style so agreeably narrative and bright, and at times even playful, in dealing with great concerns, that the reader reads page after page to the end—more readily, indeed, if it be his first Introduction to the domain of economic science.
Dr. Atkinson’s first essay, “ A True Policy of Protection,*' is a wise treatise enlivened by much humor. Better than any essay of equal length—or, to be more exact, of equal brevity—of which we have knowledge, it gives the reader a clear understanding of the fallacies of protection by tariffs which do not protect* and which only obstruct the natural movements of trade to the disadvantage of all In interest. The professed protectionist would not be likely to enjoy it, but if he will read It thoughtfully he will learn a great deal which it will profit him to know. For example, such a paragraph as this is worth more than many volumes written to establish theses In economic science.
The population of th® United States, of about 82,000,000, constituting less than fl per cent, of the population of the globe, produces and consumes more than one-third of all the great staple articles which constitute the necessaries and comforts of life; consequently possessing the paramount power of supplying the world with the abundance of its products, at the 1 same time adding to our own capital in greater and greater measure. Nothing Btands In the way but the obstructive taxes on the import of the goods which are the only means of payment of many foreign countries, and the restrictions of our own navigation laws, which keep our own merchant vessels off the seas.
The author's general conclusion is as follows:
True protection may therefore be attained by removing all possible obstructions to the exchange of products. This fre? exchange now exists among the citizens of the United States, but the potential in ail our arts Is toward an overproduction of the necessaries of life re-qulred by our own people, leading shortly to the present conditions in which under consumption prevails in the midst of abundance. When the obstructions t© foreign commerce are removed the excess will be exported, and there will he a much more constant condition of equilibrium between supply and demand.
In ” The Tendency to Individualism Dr. Atkinson appears at his best. Its text and keynote are the epigrammatic utterance of Frederic Bastiat:	44 In pro-
portion to the increased quantity and effectiveness of capital, the aggregate share of the annual joint product of labor and capital falling to capital, Is increased absolutely, but diminished relatively. On the other hand, the share falling to labor !b augmented both relatively and abso-Iutely.” The thoughtful reader will see at a glance what potentialities of Interest reside in this thesis. The author’s argument leads to the conclusion that " the few restrictions on the right of every one to enjoy 'the free use of his time and capacity will soon be abated." This Is optimistic, especially in view of the apparent success of the trades union movement in subordinating individual ambition to a mistaken view of the collective benefits, but optimism is the best of assets fcr the philosopher and the prophet.
In the last of the papers In this collec- j tlon. “ The Cost of War and Warfn.ro from 1898 to 1W*, Inclusive,” Dr. Atkinson’s great powers as a statistician appear to best advantage. By figures compiled, computed, and proved from official records, he shows that the Spanish-Amerlcan and Its corollary, the conquest •f the Philippine Islands, cost thfs country between the dates named $1,200,000,-OOd. In this the author, while admittedly an anti-imperialist of the most pronounced type, has been entirely fair. He has not juggled figures to prove his thesis, but has been at pains to eliminate i many paragraphs from the first draught | of his manuscript/, which’seemed to show a:stronger prejudice than.was consistent , Viwith the openmindedness which the .con-
