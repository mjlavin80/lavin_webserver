Referring to comments July 15 on my letter published July 8, ** A. S. B.,*’ after accusing- me of “ araufr assertiveness *' and calling- for my authority, very smug’-' . ly furnishes me with one from Brown’d Grammar, and with a kind of repentant smugness concludes his letter with the words “Who is right?'*' Tho letter of Mr.-A. M. Campbell following his may he deserving of ** A. S. B.'s ” attention.
** Velox " writes somewhat facetiously, commenting on my'pseudonym of " Cunc-tator" with a reference to the timorous angelic tread of those who forbore to take up the cudgels, which suggests the old adage about fools stepping in, &c.r for which I will tender him thanks when he furnishes a diagram showing what particular bearing, his watery Joke about the educated tramp has upon the subject of the use of the letter “ h *• pa an aspirate or as a consonant.	'
We may safely assume that the men who furnished us with the translation of i the Bible were men who understood their i own: language and wrote in accordance with tho rules of that language- * In their I translation, which is conceded to be the I finest exposition of pum English, they used " an ” instead of “a" before the i " h " sounded, or before words beginning with an “ h " now sounded.
Consequently '* Topics Uppermost ” in insinuating that Mr. Kipling wrote ** An Habitation *' because he (Mr. Kipling) pronounced it ** An ’Abltation," would seem to have started the very interesting theory that our English ancestors murdered their ** h*s ** to an even greater ex; tent than our contemporary lower grade English, who do have the decency to insert them where not necessary, as If to make up as far as possible for omitting them where they belong.
In selecting a title for his book, no i i doubt Mr. Kipling thought that " An Habitation Enforced" would look better, if not sound better* and be less liable to criticism than “ A Habitation Enforced.'*
** Three Soldiers" would have been as correct as ** Soldiery Three/' but would I not have sounded so well as a title.
The pseudonym. “ Cunctator,** despised and rejected by " Velox,” waa selected more as a reproof to the critic than azvy-thing else, as a hint to him not to be so quick in insinuating that a gentleman writes or thinks the grammar of the ** cad *' class. His velocity has led him into floating a theory which he cannot establish until he arrives in the next world, just as *' Velox's " velocity has led him Into inviting a. discussion on the cleft infinitive before he has given any assistance toward settlement of the question he thought he was going to write about.
The question remains the same. Is the letter “ h ” a consonant or only an aspirate?	CUNCTATOR.
