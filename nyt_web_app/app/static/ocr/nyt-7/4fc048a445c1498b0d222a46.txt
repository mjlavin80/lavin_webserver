A new boob on *' Mary Queen of Scots: Her Life Story," Is shortly to appear with the itnprlnt of Charles Scribner’s Sons.
It Is by A. R Millar, F. S. AL. Scotland, author of " The Castles and Mansions of Ayrshire," " The History of Rob Hoy,” &c. It Is a small book, suitable for the pocket, and the author has given the principal events of the career of that ill-fated Scottish Princess; the last on the throne of that country. Mr7 Millar says In his preface concerning the state of Scotland during Mary’s time:
There !s no character ln modem history whose romantic adventures have awak- , ened more Interest than those of Mary Queen of Scots, and there Is a perennial , fascination in the story of her life which even at the present day shows no sign of abatement. The peculiar time in which she lived, marking, as it did, an epoch of transition In religious affairs, and the rapid development of the resources of England, the inveterate enemy of her kingdom, made it desir&ble that the mler of the country should be firm* and bold to withstand Southern encroachment, and liberal and politic to soothe theological differences. But any natural determine tlon toward tolerance which Mary's character may have originally possessed whs warped an<? distorted by her early education-; and her disposition, once gentle and confiding, may have been changed by her experience of the faithlessness of mankind Into that form of stolid distrust which suspects, the truest friend and Questions the least interested motives.
The book contains two or three por-. traits of Queen Mary, pictures of Darn-ley, RIzzlo, and Bothwell, an& her son, and views of Linlithgow and Holy rood Palaces, and a fac simile of the autograph of ~ Marie R.”
