ANIEL DEFOE grips his reader with such deceptive realism that It Is difficult to believe he did not pass several years in Brazil as a planter, did not know intimately that Island ln the Caribbean which is the joy of every child, and was not really j horrified at the sight of the cannibals to the point I of sacrificing his own life in order to punish them for their loathsome diet.
Roblneon Crusoe Is attractive as a character because he represents the men of British race In De-foe‘3 time with all their shrewdness and piety, their self-deception and absurd prejudices: he remains a i favorite of old and young becauso the world still shows similar mixtures of humbug and godliness, right impulse and wrong judgment, cant and energy, sentiment and ill-concealed enjoyment of bloodshed.
“ Robinson Crusoe ” is not a romance meant to teach Englishmen lessons, only a story to interest and amuse; yet again and again we note the touch of Bunyan and his “ Pilgrim's Progress ** and realize that, even so, Daniel Defoe could not altogether refrain from playing the morallzer and teacher, could not abstain from a lesson of greater liberality for his fellow-countrymen, hide-bound, notwithstanding ■ their sea voyages and knowledge of other lands; by their preposterous insularity.
Crusoe's warm commendation of the shipwrecked Spaniards and the contrast he draws between them and the brutal English sailors represent a bold stand for an author of Defoe's time to take, since It might have been expected to alienate a public born and bred to detest a Catholic and a Spaniard*
N
OT the least interesting part of ** Robinson Crusoe ” ts that which children do not care for, the second part, containing Crusoe’s voyage to the Par East and return by land through ** Muscovy.®* Just at present Defoe’s ideas of Japan and Rnrefla may be recalled, not without a certain admiration of the man who could sit in London and give a description of travels by land and sea which a special correspondent might envy. When one considers tho meagreness of the book-lore available and the very narrow scope of his own journeys, one readily fancies
Defoe learning more about such matters from conversations among merchants and mariners in the taverns of London where they congregated than from the books and pamphlets at his disposal.
It Is true that before the appearance of ” Robinson Crusoe ” he seems to have published tho ** TJfp> Death of Count Patlcule," and perhaps was already engaged on notes for the " History of Peter the i Great,” which appeared four years later. To 1 same year as “ Robinson Crusoe ” belongs H King of Pirates," also founded on the exploits of & mariner, Crusoe being Alexander Selkirk and Pirate King the notorious Capt. Avery. But pjncfr he knew Dutch and French he could dip pages of Exquemelfn's " American Sea Hovers** ftor suggestions as to the conduct of English, Dutch, nnrf French buccaneers.
HOW “Robinson Crusoe” tn its second part touches the modern situation in China and Japan may be seen in Crusoe's remarks on hi3 arrival ln China:
I must confess the conversion, as-they call It, of the Chinese to Christianity is so far from the trob conversion required to bring heathen people to the faith of Christ that it seems to amount to little more than letting them know the name of Christ and say some prayers to the Virgin Mary and her Son In ^ tongue they understood, not, and to cross themselves and the like.	'

D EFOE reflected the opinion of Eu» rope regarding the Japanese, who were determined then, as they . continued for a century and a half* to keep foreigners out of Nippon, Perhaps he had read in ** Purchas his Pil-grimes ’* the adventure which befell John Davis and Sir Edward Michel-bourne, who, little better than pirates themselves, met in 1605 with a Chinese junk full of piratical ** Japonians,^ whose own vessel had been cast away on Borneo. There were ninety men aboard this junk, ** most of them in too gallant a habit for Saylers, and such an equalitie of behaviour among them that -they seemed all fell owes: yet among them there was one that they called Capi taine, but gave him little respect.** A number of them having been transferred to the ship while the junk*s cargb was being searched, they suddenly sallied out of the cabin at a given signal, and while those in the junk killed or drove overboard the Englishmen in charge, those on the ship tried to take possession of it. At the first onset they killed Capt. Davis.
! They pressed so fiercely to come to-us we receiving them on our Pikes,
' they would gather on our-Pikes with I their hands to reach us with their i Swords. It was neere half an hour be-i fore we could stone them back into the Cabbin; in which time we had killed three or four of their Leaders. After they were in the Cabbin they fought , | with us at the least foure houres before ' we could suppresse them, often fyring I the Cabbin. burning the bedding and much other stuffe that was there. And ! had we not with two Deray-culverings,
| from under the halfe-decke, beaten i downe the bulke head and the pumpe or the ship, we could not have suppressed ; them from burning the ship. This Ord-! nance being charged with Crosse-i barres, Bullets and Case-ehot, and bent close to the bulke head, so violently marred therewith boords and splinters that it left but one of them standing of I two and twentie. Their legs, arms and bodies were so tome, ps it was strange to see how the shot had massacred them. In all this conflict they never would desire their lives though they were hopelesse to escape; such was the
•	desperatenesse of these Japonians.
That is a battle which recalls the valor of Japanese seamen during the present war and shows that in all ages these islanders have fought with an utter disregard of results, like so many ants or bulldogs, heeding hardly at all the odds against them. But to Britons who regarded as their perquisite the privilege of capturing for ransom anything afloat, the conduct of these Japonians was treachery most fell.
**•
AS HE approaches Nankin our ol6 friend Crusoe indulges in a fine passion of scorn of the Chinese:
When I come to compare the miserable people of these countries with ours, their fabrics, their manner of living. ■ their government, their religion, their wealth, and their glory, as some call it,
I must confess that I scarcely think it worth my while to mention them here.
And he goes on to boast of the trade of England, Holland. Prance, and Spain; their palaces and royal buildings, their luxuries. Here speaks the noble Briton, forgetting that we want to be told about these exotic things, but haply remembering that we like to hear what rich and powerful nations we belong to:
Our City of London has more trade than half their mighty empire. One English, Dutch, or French man-of-war of eighty guns would be able to fight almost all the shipping belonging to China; but the greatness of their wealth* their trade, the power of their Government, and the strength of their armies may be a little surprising to ui> because considering them as a barbarous nation of pagans little better than savages, we did not expect such things among them.

DESPITE his moral observations while a hermit on his island; despite the superiority to his fellows in his freedom from prejudice against Spaniard and Catholic our good Cm*, soe remains a typical Englishman in many respects. He sees the bad side only too well, but he misses the point. It was too early for jealousy of Russia; thus:
As far as I saw they appeared to be a contemptible herd or crowd of ignorant, sordid slaves, subjected to a government qualified to rule only such people, and were not its distance inconceivably great from Muscovy, and that empire in a manner as rude, impotent, and ill-governed as they, the Czar of Muscovy might With ease drive them all out of their country and conquer them in one campaign. And had the Czar (who is now a growing Prince) fallen this way instead of attacking tho war-
likeSwedesand\equally improved him-sel^-in, the art of ,war as they say he has done; and if none of tho powers of Europe'had envied -or Interrupted him, he might by this time have been' Emperor of China ~ instead of being beaten by the King of Sweden at Narva, when the latter was not one to six in number.	■
Whatever we may think of .Crusoe's ■
morality, this bit of Welt-Politik nearly
two centuries ago is not without inter-
*	i*
est in view of late events. Poor Russia is equally unfortunate, now that she has taken Robinson Crusoe's hint. Crusoe was no fool to have slipped in
that sentence, “ and if none of the
■ * . m t *. . . _
, powers of Europe had envied or inter- I rupted him."	.
After passing the Great .Wall of China with his caravan—M this mighty nothing called a wall "—the aged but i still passionate Crusoe gets himself and the merchants with him in^a fine pickle by seizing certain shamans in their rude temple and destroying their wooden idol before their eyes. A slight inconsistency, perhaps; for we had understood that his privations on his island, while never subduing his sinful yearning to roam the seas, had made Robinson Crusoe charitable toward vagaries in the human soul. TTia talks ■with political prisoners ln Siberia, the escape he arranges for the young exiled Prince, the nocturne which he paints of the mysterious camp of robber Kalmucks, these are episodes that gain in flavor by contrast with the Siberia of to-day. It might be worth while to hunt up the sources whence Defoe drew his mental pictures of that famous journey from Peking to Archangel, arriving in London “the 10th of January, 1705, having been absent from England ten years and nine months."
Whenever we leave Robinson Crusoe we are sorry to part from him because we feel that if it were not for fear of tiring us he might tell us all sorts of interesting things about Japonians, Chinese, and Muscovites, not to speak oi cannibal Caribs and mutineers. He is the lineal ancestor of Edgar Allan Poe and Robert Louis Stevenson.
