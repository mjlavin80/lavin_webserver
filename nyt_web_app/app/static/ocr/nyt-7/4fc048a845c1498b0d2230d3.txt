REAL PEOPLE.
Such Are the Characters in Horace G. Hutchinson’s First Novel, ** Two Moods of a Man.” *
N “ Two Moods of a Man " Mr. Hutchinson has written a book of almost startling originality and of very unusual interest. Whatever may be thought of his characters, they live and breathe. We criticise their faults, weaknesses, inconsistencies, as we do those of real people; and, when the book is laid aside, and we turn to other novels, we are likely to find these dim and colorless by comparison*
Pespite the author's apologia for his title, we do not find it a fitting one. for the story embraces more than two moods of a man.” It is a study of a highly complex character through many divagations, a character whose theory of Ute was:
That a man shall follow the voice within him, the voice that the Greeks called the “ daemon/* and that the Christian calls the conscience. Even as you listen to it and obey it, its voice grows clearer, but if a man will not obey or listen, the voice ceases to instruct. And this is the deadly sin that a man sins against and disobeys the guidance that is given him, for by doing so he stifles the voice or blunts his faculties for its perception.
It is difficult to discuss this novel without robbing the author of an author's inherent right—that of telling his story in his own way. Suffice it to say that he leaves us with the question whether the irony of the life he has so wonderfully unfolded Is due to its '* ineffective following of the guidance " of Its “ daemon,'' or whether the 14 dae- ' mon ” is, after all, but another name for selfish impulse.
The qualities of the hero—though the author rightly deprecates that title for his " man of flesh and blood *’—catalogue badly enough. In an inferior hand he would soon have slipped irretrievably into the ranks of the unmitigated villains. It is a proof of his creator's art that poor George Hood retains to the last a certain hold upon the reader’s sympathy. There is so much of the universal human about him that ‘ even a stern moralist can scarcely help condemnation melting into pity. The American wife fs the least successful character; her attitude toward her husband's past is quite inconceivable—‘inexorable sternness at the suspicion of a dead -first wife concealed from her; nothing but tenderness at the discovery of a betrayed and deserted living woman who should have been the wife. The very virtues of the brilliant American have an unlovely hard edge; and as for her brilliancy—for that we take the author's word, very much, by the bye, as we take his word for the surpassing beauty of Gracia, scarcely manifest from the description.
The reader does not, however, become aware of flaws until the story lias loosed its grip upon him. Whether he cares most for plot, for analysis of character, for philosophic speculation,
L or for literary quality, “ Two Moods of a Man " makes a strong appeal. Its clever asides are scarcely less interesting than its general trend; as, for example, the " whimsical paradox ” that Hood was capable of " understanding what you meant even after you hud , said it." or the following suggestive contrast:
What we in Engiaad understand by conversation is very different from the notion conveyed by the same word in America, where, by the bye, they would say that conversation is dead in England—a lost art. With tis it Is a quick exchange of thought suggested by thought. * * * The ancient analogy of the flint and the steel comes in not amiss to give the hint of the meaning of good conversation according to our view. According to the American view, conversation has more of the character of monologue or oratory, and even includes anecdote. America says of our conversation that it is not talk, but ' barking. We are sometimes apt to find the American disposition to oratory a bare. The facts are the more curious because respective national characterIstics might have led us to expect the case reversed.
In more ways than one the book is painful. To become the intimate of. such a man as Hood, to find ourselves taking his own point of view and understanding his temptations too well to condemn greatly his falls, does not “ make for righteousness.” But Mr.
