Missing Link in American History.
i Neto York Times Book Review:	'
1 In The Times Review of the 22d Inst.
I is an advertisement for a copy of “ Guern-! s&y’s History of the Negro tiatfons for the Treaty of Peace at Ghent In 1814.” That i •work, which was. announced by me as ready for publication some months ago, has not yet been Issued because a publisher could not be found to take it and print It on any terms, because, presumably, " it will not be popular." It contains the suppressed official discussions at Ghent, now first, collected and published. The American State' papers contain only a portion of the correspondence on the part of the United States Commissioners and contain none of the correspondence on the part of the British Commissioners, which can all be found In the State Department at Washington. To these I have appended elaborate notes.
historical writers seem to have overlooked these records, and, evidently, publishers do not now wish to have them brought to the public view.
