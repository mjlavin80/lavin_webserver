Sahara empire story written by M&r. Tracy—or was it Mr. Vance himself?—	1
some years ago. However, to those who	;

An Irish Adventurer.
TEBENCB O’ROURKE, GENTLEMAN AD-VENTUlUEB. By—J.ouis J o.ioph Vance. Wittv frontispiece. 12mo, Pp. 393. New York: XTio A. WesseIs Company, >1.60.
Here are two short novels made Into ohe bookful. It might be more correct to say, In fact, that liere are a number of short stories connected at the ends and filed with a coarse rasp to make them string- along. Nevertheless, when Mr. Vance wrote the adventures of Terence O’Rourke for The Popular Magazine,
I where they were first published, lie prob-j ably had no desire to write more than was entertaining, and lively at that- Certainly the book is not too heavy for Summer weather, even if the adventures re-| corded in it are a bit strenuous.
, The first of the two novels which have ^ been welded together is called '* The Bm-I plre of Illusion,” and is apparently a col-| ored photograph of the doings of a young Frenchman who a short time ago tried to | found an empire in the Sahara Desert.
I Lemercier, who has more money than I sense, ana later more sense than money, j is easily identified. Colonel O’Rourke,
! who, like all good heroes, gets into ! trouble ln order to entertain the reader by i getting out of it, has a fine vehicle for his talents in the fiasco of the Sahara Empire- .
In the second series of stories that go to , the making of the second novel, which is I tho second half of the book, tbe Colonel | passes through an extraordinary series of i wild adventures in one of‘ those mythical , kingdoms which are generally recognized ! as the property of one Anthony Hope. Ruperts of Henteau and Princesses who aro looking for commoners to love are plentiful, and as for duels with sword, rapier, and pistol—in all of which M. le i Colonel triumphs—they come with a ra-| pldlty that is positively shocking in this twentieth century. And in this enllght-I ened age It Is remarkable that Colonel i O'Rourke, In' spite of his Irish brogue, i should never enter a house that did not have underground passages and trap* doors under respectable Morris chairs. We j mention the Morris chairs and the Irish ; brogue as remarkable, f However, Mr. Vance knew what he | wanted to write, and he wrote it. The I second half of his hook reminds one very forcibly of " The Prisoner of Zenda.” and
