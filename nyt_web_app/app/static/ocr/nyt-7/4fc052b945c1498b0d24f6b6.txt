HOOK of much interest as showing- in outline the manners and customs of tlie clergy of the Church of England 150 years ago is this rather pretentiously styled volume, " Memoirs of a Royal Chaplain." It is composed of 10!J letters frnm the Rev. Edmund Pyle, chaplain in ordinary to George II.. to the I lev. Samuel Kerrich. sent at intervals during thirty-four years. These are merely selections fiom a greater number, and tlie selection and editing have been done by Albert Hartshorne, a descendant of one or the other of the two clergymen. No letters from Mr. Kei-rich are given; and those of Mr. Pyle are not arranged in the order of their dates. Still they make on the whole a connected story, though the layxnan and American who reads Mr. Haitshorne’s annotations wilt quite probably find his head in a maze among the countless “ Bishops, priests, and Deacons *’— mostly Bishops—who appear in and disappear from the pages of the volume.
Edmund Pyle was born in 1702. He seems to have been rusticated from Cambridge for some misconduct in 1724. but retrieved his reputation, was graduated and entered the Church, taking his first degree in divinity in 1740; in 1742 he was appointed Chaplain to the King, thereafter obtaining his father's ttvings as “ the Old Man ” resigned them, becoming Archdeo.con of York in 1751. “ Friend and Companion " to the Bishop of Winchester in 1752, and prebendary of Winchester in 1700. He died in 1777. He was a pluralist noteworthy even m an age of pluralists. Samuel Kerrich was born in lGfK), Pel-low of Corpus College, Cambridge, in 1719, and Vicar of Dersingham in 1729, and of two other livings at the same ; time, which he held until his death, in 17UK. The way in which he obtained these livings is characteristic of the | times.
On Aug. II, 1729, he heard that the Vicar of Dersingham was on his deathbed. The next day. Sunday, with a letter to the LfOrd Chancellor, he started , for London, where he got another from , Sir Robert Walpole to the Chancellor, whom he saw in his garden at Ockham, He stayed near him until the papers had been signed and sealed, and in two weeks from the time of the Vicar’s death had been instituted to the living. Quite probably his predecessor had not even been buried when Kerrich was installed rector. The churchmen of those days could give our office seekers cards and spades in the way of using " pull.’* Kissing went purely by favor then, and Dr. Pyle made no bones about saying so. Occasionally, when his letters contained items of what was to be news, or comments rather too strong on his superiors in the Church, he would end them with the word “Tace"; but usually he commented freely and without hesitation on the promotions and changes of the clerical establishment of the kingdom. There is no cant in the letters about being ** called " to another place; money and questions of comfort „ alone influenced Pyle^ind the clergy of whom he wrote in seeking and taking new livings. They were honest, if not decent.
In March, 1742-3, Pyle writes: ** My Lord of Norwich certainly goes to York at Lahcelot's death/' According to Mr. Hartshorne, this was Lancelot Black-burne. Archbishop of York, notorious for his free manners. At St- Mary’s, Nottingham, he ordered pipes, .tobacco, and liquors in the vestry “ for his refreshment after the fatigues of confirmation.” He is said to have been a chaplain on a buccaneer when a young clergyman, Benjamin Hoadly, son of Pyle's Bishop of Winchester, produced a play. “The Suspicious Husband,” known as The Profligate Pantomime.” because it consisted chiefly in entrances and exits through windows at night, and dissolute small talk. .Dr, Pyle remarks- that the Bishop was supposed to have helped him write it, a false supposition, but an enlightening comment on episcopal manners. In the same letter in which this town talk is

given, Pyle writes: “ Pray, have you seen his Grace of York's last sermon?
It is a fine one, and has recovered him the credit ho lost by his sermon last year. N. B.—Tj Page 15 it is the very sermon he preached against the * Beggars* Opera.* *’ it was therefore nearly twenty years old.
In 1747 the Archbishop of Canterbury died so suddenly that he had no time to sign the papers making his son Master of the Faculties or Judge of the church court. This son was a friend of John Wilkes, and was credited with being his tutor in immorality. Heie is a suggestion of the way things went:
** On Friday the Bishop of Norwich (sinee formally chosen of Ely) presented the Archdeaconry to Mr. Goodall.
1 was told it would be given to him, for that Mr. Hervey had only the offer of it on condition he could procure his own or some other living for Goodall. As this could not b? brought about, the affair is gone as above." Mr. Hervey could not get the cures of souls which suiteJ Mr. Goodall, so the latter took the Archdeaconry, which was filled just as the Bishop changed his see, and thus taken away from his successor. " Poor Professor Whalley is dead," writes Pyle again; " I told my father this news. ‘ What did he die of?* says he.
‘ Drinking, at first setting out with Jacobites,’ quoth I. ‘ Poor young man! ’ says he. ‘ he dead, and Tom Gooch alive!’ ’ ’	41 Tom ’’ Gooch was Bishop
of Bristol, Norwich, and Ely in succession. Mr. Hartshorne thinks the comment was on his Jacobite proclivities, though it might as well refer to his conviviality.
There was a “ servant question ** then as there is now; and sometimes its solution made trouble. Here is a letter to Mrs. Kerrich from a neighbor, to whom she had written about a servant:
Madam—‘Tis usual here with People of Fashion, to Inquire of the ffamily where a Servt is, whether or no Such Servt be disengaged before the Servt is Apply’d to; so in Answer to yours can only say that Ruth has not had Notice from either Mrs. Hendry or me to part, nor would she have given us Warning, had she not had a Promise of being your Upper Servant (as she says.) And as your Letter comes three weeks after such her Notice given us, Must think our Parting can’t at this time be unknown to you & am Yr hble Servt THOMAS HENDRY. She’ll go from us on Lamas day next.
Mrs. Kerrich in the following letter gave as good as she got;
Sir—As I had no hand in youn-Maid’s going away I neither know nor care when she go, but her Mother told me when she was here she shou’d stay at Lynn no longer than Micklemas, I can only say I am sorry I didn’t rightly consider who I was going to write to, if I had I shou‘d not have given myself that Trouble. B. Kerrich.
In 1752 Pyle writes that “ there is no Bishop of Durham appointed. It is believed that Bishop Trevor (of St. Davids) will be the man, though the King is for the Bishop of Norwich. But his Majesty has not always the best interest at Court. The new Bishop. I hear, will be Dr. Ellis, formerly of Clare Hall, j a minister of a parish in the City, and Prebendary of Gloucester." Bishop Trevor got the place, the King’s man, j Bishop Hayter, having to stay at Norwich. Of the Bishop of Chichester Pyle j tells this story: •* It is his manner, it j seems, before he goes to bed, to lay his j clothes on a chair, and then to go in his \ shirt to the fireplace and expectorate.^ Once last Spring, being a little absent, j he threw his breeches into the fire, and spit on the chair.” Of another prelate | he writes: " Old Mawson has married a * couple of his own servants in Ely-House Chapel, and is actually liable to transportation. I believe the folk were i married over again at St. Andrew’s Holborn and the thing is hushed up. If the story &ets wind, I intend to tell it that he read the burial service over the couple, and so. the law can't touch him." ” Lotteries were well patronized in Pyle's time, and even by clergymen. He writes: *' You know one of my brethren here, Mr. Exton. He has two livings about 300 a year, got 5,000 in a lottery, keeps this chariot, lives as much as he pleases with Lord Portsmouth. and is a dry, sly, old bachelor."
The great diseases of the well-to-do in the eighteenth century were gout and stone, Pyle suffered .continually from the former, and took all sorts of medicincs for it‘ taking 41 two ounces-of soap a day for six months together. Besides the oyster shell or eggshell powder.in small beer. I think the dcwes were 3 or 4 in a day." Other nostrums, much worse than soap, were taken for ills of the flesh—wood lice,, for example, in cases of cancer. .. >. ,... ,	....
