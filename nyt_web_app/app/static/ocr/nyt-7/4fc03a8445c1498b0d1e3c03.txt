NIPPON ROMANCE
Mrs. Hush Fraser’s Exauisite Little Story of the Japan of Cherry Blossom and Kimono.^
HE Japan which has subjugated the Occident is not the Japan whose banners are *' fanned by conquest’s crimson wing’,” but the Japan of cherry blossom and kimono, of gracious speech and gentle bearing, of urbane gentlemen and dainty ladies—of the “ suavlter in modo." rather than of this almost miraculous latter-day “ fortiter in re.M
Of the soft and poetic Japan is Mrs. Fraser’s story a flower—one which could have blossomed upon no other soil and in no other clime. Beginning with the oft-told tale, as dastardly as it is tragic, of an Anglo-Saxon’s shortlived passion and speedy desertion of a maid of the Orient, it passes into the happier idyl of her orphaned child and a nobler English lover. The plot is slight, but the story is told with surpassing grace, and possesses to a rare degree both atmosphere and temperament. The author takes us into the untrodden ways; into the Japan of the Japanese, not the Japan of the foreigner.	v
Him£, the heroine, is as nearly as possible a human flower—for, did the floral kingdom pass into the human, what would be the connecting link but a maid of Japan? One cannot but share the doubt expressed by one of the characters of the romance as to the possibility of permanent happiness in the union of a cultivated man of the world with such a being—a perfume, an acquiescence, an enfolding tenderness, an adoration; surely he i would long for Intellectual comradeship, for the fillip of an occasional difference of opinion, for the tang of vary, ing moods; even for a passing cloud, a 1 hint of hoar-frost to temper the unchanging warmth of the sun-filled air. Him£’s mixed parentage, however, suggests possibilities of la^er development than simply the opening1 of ; the heart of the rose, and, after all, our concern is less with a psychic problem than with an exquisite portraiture. We may have whatever doubts we please as to a marriage with a real HimC*, but the Him£ of the story is a creation so full of delicate charm that to touch it would be to rob it of its bloom.
Mrs. Fraser has not crowded her canvas—a typical young Englishman, clever, clean, versatile; a Japanese professor, trained in America; an aged priest; a simple-hearted old Japanese woman; a second sweet maid of Japan, suffice for the poetic tale^^e well as ^for very admirable delineation of diverse characters. Of these^' Mr. Kat-sura Nakayama, graduate of Princeton College,” is one of the best, a Samurai to the core, with the pride, the high-bred courtesy, the sensitive honor of his class, and yet shot through and through with American ideas, and expressing himself in racy slang—“ New York journalese,’' as the author has it —the slang, by the bye, although peculiarly amusing from its contrast with the personality of the speaker, is a bit overdone on the lips of a Samurai and a *' graduate of Princeton College.” A lovable young man is ” Mr. Katsura Nakayama,” illustrating the most engaging qualities of his countrymen, not the least among these their loyal family affection.
In “ A Maid of Japan ” Mrs. Fraser has told a romantic story, and has caught the very spirit of the country. She finely portrays those racial distinctions which are so elusive and so inexorable; but she shows beneath them the essential oneness of the heart of humanity. She has, too, a quietly incisive way of putting home truths which makes us wish she had done it more often:
The uncle to whom he owed (and from whom he expected) everything had, in some vicarious reaction against his own indolent existence, rendered only too easy by a fortune inherited, not earned, insisted on the necessity of businesslike work for his nephew and heir. Charles Barrington might find new mistakes to make, but he should not, if it could be prevented, repeat those of his eider, who realized mistily and late that the surest way to banish pleasure from life is to seek pleasure alone.
No guardian's restrictions could debar him from entering on the heritage

of hooks, music, art, which is bestowed with indiscrim mating bounty on the wise and foolish alike in our England to-day. Seer and clown, poet and Philistine* artisan and King's son, all may hear the same divine music, read the same immortal classic, contemplate in verity or In faithful reproduction the same undying loveliness of Greek sculpture and Italian painting, but, as in a still higher order of election, the maxim holds good that many are called and few chosen. May not the day come when it will be asked whether these apparent benefits have resulted, as their givers intended, in really elevating and purifying coarser natures than those which first called them forth? ’Whether they have not, on the contrary, already widened the borders of Philistia, and crowded the haunted realms of beauty with gross' self-seekers, eager to persuade their own mediocrity that there is nothing so great and fair aa to be beyond their apprehension.
Our fathers and mothers used higher thoughts and simpler words to govern and express their lives; the half-educated prigs who deafen us with the cant phrases of artistic hypocrisy, affect to shudder or go into fits of laughter at their forbears' crude taste in I color and decoration, at their humble notions of enjoyment and culture. But on the thinker who is not dazzled by all this cheap glitter the conviction forces itself that there was more sincerity and harmony, and therefore more j of art. in the fair ordering of every de- | tail of life, from the bleaching of fine ! linen and making preserves, to provid- j ing for the well-being of family and fellow-townsman, than in giving up the untutored eye and ear to the magnificent emotions called forth by glories meant as guerdons to the .elect, as encouragement to the striving and the pure in heart, but not meant as a de- : bauch of pleasure for the masked sen- j sualist who snatches at the unearned feast and goes away intoxicated, unmanned, believing himself a god, and sneering at the humble worker, tt> whom plain duty Is all in all.
Wise words these, worthy to be laid to heart by other than the author's compatriots; nor are these the only golden ingots In this little story so full of grace and charm. Mrs. Fraser's readers will find more in her tale than the idyl of a sunrise land and a Summer sea.
The format of the slender volume is a stroke of genius. A delight to hand and eye, it contrives to be only less suggestive of Japan than its content. Not often does M the outward visible sign ’* of a novel so thoroughly express its " inward spiritual grace.”
It is a pleasure to welcome a book so full of artistic simplicity without and within, with such genuine value underlying its lightly heaped blossoms of romance.
