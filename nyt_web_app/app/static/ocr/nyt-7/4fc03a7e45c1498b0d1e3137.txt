[ Certain qualities may be confidently | expected of Miss Murfree; interest of \ plot, vividness of description, spirit, and I naturalness of dialogue. Yet the hand [ which, as by magic, lifted the mistB from the Tennessee mountains, has lost j something: of its cunning in this latest story.
; The “ Storm Centre ” is a quiet coun-\ try home, around which are encamped j Federal forces of the civil war. Its courteous old host has two sons in' the
L
>	Confederate Army, but opens his doors
i to a young Northern Captain whose
I father had been his valued friend. Of j course the Southern mansion holds a
lady fair—and of course, and of course
\ '
j —the rest is not far to seek. *	'
! But it is told with a difference. Orig-[ Inal, not to say astounding, features are not wanting. Chief of these is an ! elephantiasis of conscience with which ! the Federal Captain is afflicted. True, the ethics of war define as virtues too ! many crimes of peace; but there are j not two opinions as to the turpitude of a violation of hospitality. Even the ! savage holds sacred the sheltering roof,
| Not so our gallant Captain, who !
straightway informs an impressing i agent of the accidentally discovered hiding place of his hostess's favorite horse: and afterward attempts to arrest a hidden son of the house upon a perilously stolen visit to hip foe-encircled home. Yet these things are scored to the credit of the man who has been received as a friend, and nursed to ; health by the too confiding family : whose secrets he betrays. One quite
*	agrees with his rival that “ such a conscience as that is a selfish beast, a raging monster, exceedingly deadly to the interests of other folks.”
The machinery of the story seems to creak at times; tlie denouement is suddenly sprung upon us, as if the writer, grown tired of her work, had flung it down in a heap; or, more probably, had cut out a few closing pages and tacked the end on " anyhow.” The bitterness of sectional feeling, so strong in those fatal early sixties, is almost ignored;
" the ladies*' are tiresome, the heroine is most unlovable, the hero, as has been shown, a cad—and worse.
But there are elements of power in the novel; it " goes.” and, having begun it, the reader will hardly he willing to lay it aside until £Tie end is reached.
