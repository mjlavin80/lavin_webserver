JT SEEMS that the decision of the Judges at the Warwick (England) Quarter Sessions, in the appeal of the Trustees of Shakespeare’s Birthplace for the exemption of the memorials at Stratford-on-Avon from taxation, was even more deliciously Shakespearean and reminiscent of Justice Shallow than we fancied last week. The ground of the refusal seems to have been that the preservation of the Shakespeare relics at Stratford is not a “ literary *’ object. Here are some of the strange questions asked by the lawyers who opposed the appeal:
" r>o you think that any appreciable proportion of these 30,000 visitors are stimulated to expend a shilling for a copy of Shakespeare’s works instead of spending it at the public house? ”
** Is there any evlden.ce that Shakespeare played shovel-board at the Falcon?”
“ Should I be far wrong in calling it [the birthplace} a show place, an interesting one, no doubt, but you do not expect any one to get instruction or literary knowledge there?”
“ Z>o ■ you think any one visiting the orchard would be inspired to attempt flights equal to Shakespeare? ’*
Nothing Is to be gained by laughing .at or sneering at the point of view and the frame of mind revealed 'in these questions. Both are eminently practical.
