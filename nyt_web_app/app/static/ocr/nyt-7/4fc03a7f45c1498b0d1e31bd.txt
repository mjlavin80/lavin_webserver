" >WLEDGE - WISE old Sun,
oces underneath an irlsed arch The strong ' majestic waters march Down to a dim eternity. ■
Alone that River's broad expanse,
The myriad curves of silver dance, ; While from the white-throned ^radiance Arrows of light rain on‘the waves!
.tip from those momentary graves, Transformed to" airy spirits, rise _
Bright forms in streaming draperies.
Mere curls of mist, they drift away Far down the "Riveras sweeping tide.
And scarcely touch It as they glide;
Like beautiful birds that dip their wings And skim the surface, are they borne By happy winds along the spray,
The while each spirit meetly sings Of Memory—Hope—all' precious things;
, And, as their, fingers kiss the strings, Awaking mystic melody Outrivaling the lark at morn,
Fain would we have them ever. stay.
But ah! they fade—they fade away .Like dreamy stars at dawn of day;
Stitt while their beauty on the mind Is imaged dim, they disappear,
And leave no lbigering trace behind To charm the raptured listener's ear.
Pensive the musing Poet stands On the white curve of jeweled sands,
And views with fond expectant eyes Those fair but shadowy Ariels rise.
He barkens each mysterious tone Which from their tiny harps is thrown. To catch and hold it for his own, Wherewith to stir the hearts of men. They, by the breezes wafted o'er,
Descend like frost-flowers on the shore; But all his waiting is in vain—
They melt and vanish in the rain,
And heard they never are again.
