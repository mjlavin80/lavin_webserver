With ail the new Interest which invests internal conditions in Russia to-day—and especially so-called administrative measures—the actual workings of the bureaucratic machinery of repression—a new edition of Lreo Deutch*s book of his experiences as a Tnnn under trial	as a
prisoner in Siberia is very welcome. This Deutch or Deuc of DeJtch, as bis name is variously approximated—actual transliteration of Russian into English being impossible—became In 1874 one of the body of young’ reformers called, aropagandists, who set themselves so eatcerlar and so injudiciously to the awakening of the Russian people. Deutch was concerned in the attempted violent taking off of a fellow-propagandist who had turnea informer. He was arrested, but -escaped. Others involved were less fortunate, and were duly executed. This book tells how, after a residence for a time In Switzerland, Deutch (now called by another name) undertook in 1884 to smuggle revolutionary literature through Germany into Russia, At Freiburg he was caught with the goods on him, and, being identified as his proper self, was turned over to the Russian police. These, though they took him as a common extraditable criminal, turned him over at once to the political powers, who banished him to Siberia.
The chief part of his book tells of his -convict life, and the impression given is rather one of the anachronistic character of Russians and Russian ways than one of particular cruelty toward the prisoners. Eventually Deutch escaped by way of Vladivostok and Japan and came to Half oil, and thence to America.
The first edition of this very interesting and ’Informing book—into the detailed merits of which It is not necessary to jro here—was printed in October, 1903. It has since been four times reprinted, and lhe present edition is reinforced by a preface which explains some contemporary Russian developments—especially in the matter ot 'Government controlled trades unions. It was one -of these ** legalized M trades unions, says the translator, which organized '* that procession of t>narmed strikers who with their wives and children marched to the Winter Palace in Petersburg to present a petition to the Czar on Jan. 22, 1905, and were massaered in large numbers by the troops under Government orders."
