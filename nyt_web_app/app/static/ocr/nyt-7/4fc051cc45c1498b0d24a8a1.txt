Mi\ Crockett has written a great many stories, and some of them excellent. This is not, perhaps, one of his best, but it goes with the gait of the “ true romance ’* —lance In rest, pennons flying, eyes ; flashing, women's tongues clacking,
! hearts beating—and is good to read. It is a; lively version of the tale of the life and , loves ot Margaret, Princess of Galloway and twice Countess of Douglas, and purports to have been written by that willful woman herself In her by no means sub- :-ducd old age and third widowhood.	^	■
You find her a maid of eighteen Summers or so fretting in a French convent ; and making uncharitable remarks about the good sisters. Then comes Abbot Laurence of Sweetheart Abbey—which, ■ for its .namesake,, is a great pet of Mr. ■ (Crockett. This Laurence (who is a sort ; of lay abbot)' manes very pretty, harmless love to the maid out of ihe nunnery and bears, her off .to marry her statesmanlike cousin, William, eighth Earl of :
Douglas, 'Whbse lovemak:ng leaves much
( ■ ’* r i . ■ * to be desired, but who has a brother
James, a perfect artist In that line. And : May Margaret is a woman and loves to be made love to, at the same time that she is loyal to her house and will marry the head of it, so that the estates may be kept together and the King of _ Scots troubled—he who is a Stewart, and by . consequent necessity treacherous. There- • fore May Margaret tells how she teased Earl William and kissed Lord James, his brother, and was caught In the act, and • thereafter had William for husband in name only. How when ‘William presently was slain by the King of Scots as the two sat at meat with the King’s arm about the Earl's shoulder, she took James {who was now Earl) In William's place. Also’ how James was* unfaithful and be- . 'traycd Magdalen McKIra, the daughter of the armorer—a Vast main with''many tall i sons *who were the unddlrig' of the de- -; spoiler. For they cast a great caqnon i and' battered to pieces Margaret’s castle ' : of Thrleve, where the false Earl shel- ■
: tered: '	-	.
•	Then' James fled, and Tils 'tvlfe was wedded to the Abbot of Sweetheart, un' frocked of his canonicals and presented by the King with the surname of Stewart in place of his own of McKim. For this . Laurence was the ^armorer's son and the ' sister of the lady whom Earl James betrayed. As for James, he found another -wife In England. It Is all a fearful matrl-monial tangle, but" history, and not Mr. : ’ Crockett* Is responsible for that, and cah-
*	onlCal law finds a way for1 the legalizing ( of it—as Is With much sly humor set forth in the text.	-	•
