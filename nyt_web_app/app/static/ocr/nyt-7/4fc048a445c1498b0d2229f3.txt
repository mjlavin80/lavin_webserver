It must be a poor detective story, indeed, that cannot command the interested attention of its readers. *' The Millbank Case " is only a fair example of the art. To begin with—or rather to end with— one quarrels with the motive for the murder. Kad the murderer been any one of the half dozen men vitally interested in the death of Theodore Wing-, and upon whom the reader’s suspicion alights at once, there might have been more sympathy for the crime. Nevertheless, since the main duty of this kind of story is to keep one guessing, Mr. Eldridge has probably accomplished his object after all.
Theodore Wing, who was not supposed to have had an enemy in the world, was
found one morning dead on his own doorstep, with a bullet hole in his temple. Trafford, the detective, had methods opposed to those of the invincible Sherlock Holmes. Therefore it took him somewhat longer to solve this mysterious .case. In the solving of it, too, he found other I mysteries aside from the chief issue. He found many reasons why Innocent men should have been the murderer—indeed,
why they might have been but for the intervention of Providence. He even found reasons why he himself should sacrifice his own self-esteem and the esteem of the reader by stealing the precious papers which were at the bottom of the whole tragedy and attempting to barter them. It was not Trafford's fault that he lost his chance to make a cool $100,000, or, for that matter, that he himself, like the late Theodore Wing, was not found face upward with a bullet hole through his temple.
