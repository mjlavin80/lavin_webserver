A pleasant volume of travel and guidebook information dealing with Southeastern Tyrol is the third edition of Amelia
B.	Edwards's " Untrodden Peaks and Unfrequented Valleys:	A Midsummer
Ramble In the Dolomites," (E. P. Dutton & Co., $2.50.) The book was written some sixteen years ago or more, when the country with which It deals was less well known than it Is now—but the region retains its interest and is still pretty well out of the beaten track of conventional travelers. The author, without making any changes in the text of the narrative of her travels of years ago—starting from Venice and coming out at Atzwang—has added notes to show where old inns have passed away and new inns taken their places, and to take account of other such changes of interest to the intending visitor. She provides a very readable description of the country—whose title to favor lies in its possession of those curious mountains called “ Dolomites,” mountains supposed to have had their origin as coral atolls or such like reefs In a far-off age when the Eastern Alps were a part of the sea-bed. Outwardly they axe remarkable for perpendicularity and a general tendency to resemble from a proper distance a Gothic cathedral. Also this country, where (some years ago at all events) the innkeepers were indisposed to fleece the wayfarer—quite the contrary—is the country of Titian, whose name is modernly so familiar to connoisseurs In fashionable shades of hair, produced by proper artifice or otherwise. The painter’s native place was Cadore.
The author says, by the way, that most of the travel in the Dolomites must be performed on muleback, and declares that in her time only two side saddles existed In all the country, a circumstance which matters less to women of our decade, to whom such gear begins to be old fashioned.
