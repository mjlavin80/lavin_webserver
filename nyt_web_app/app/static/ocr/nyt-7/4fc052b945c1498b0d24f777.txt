R- MORE’S ESSAYS, which were originally book reviews, are marked
r ?
by charm and Insight They are not unduly discursive—tho limits of the modern reader’s patience compels even the essayist of to-day to keep reasonably dose to his subject; the rabbi to one of Zang-will’s stories, who was popular among his older hearers because he could preach for three hours without getting near his text,
Is not Mr. More*s exemplar. He draws upon a fund of knowledge for appropriate references and comparisons! as an essayist should do, but 3hows his wide acquaintance with literature rather by suggestion than by thrusting it at his readers.
There are eleven essays in the volume, one of them, on “Hawthorne, Looking Before and After," distinctly occasional but none the less good reading when the | occasion .has passed. Very pleasing to os ' are those on the novels of George Mere! dlth and on " Nemesis; or, the Divine EnI YT"
■	The former essay, as Mr. More admits, j Is ** criticism, -whatever its value, almost 1 entirely, destructive." The essayist con-aiders Meredith a M fascinating genius,*‘ yet is obliged to Judge him harshly, as | one who has not done what *tie sets out 1 to do, though he took his own way about doing It. Mr. Meredith, he says, has not 1 only coined new words, but has distorted language to surcharge it with thought and sensation. He speaks, says Mr. More, "with some irritation of the need of disguising his deeper meaning for fear of seeming obscure,”
; .We fancy, however, that it is not pro-| fundity of reflection on human life which causes obscurity so much as the refraction of tiiis into innumerable burning 1 points. And herein Hes much of the difference between real depth and mere cleverness. * * * Henry Esmond is less obscure, because the thought is presented in broad masses, so to speak, which rest the mind while stimulating it, whereas The Egoist confuses with its endless, dashing epigrams. Mr. Meredith, like his own airs. Mountstuart, is “ mad for cleverness,*' and does not stop often enough to remember his Judgment on Sir Austin Feverel, * a maker of proverbs—what is he but a narrow mind, the mouthpiece of a narrower/' * * * Yet criticise his style as you will, there is after all a notfe of sincerity in it something so naturally artificial, if the paradox may be pardoned, that we are prone to overlook its extravagances, and can even appreciate its fascination for certain minds. It may be pretty well characterized ln his own words as ** the puffing of a giant; a strong wind rather than speech.”
I*ater on Mr. More notes that few ** of our English novel writers are great as stylists. It Is a noteworthy fact that any other class of authors—essayists, historians, divines, and even philosophers—can boast a greater number of avowed masters of language. Perhaps Thackeray • alone can be accounted a master in wordcraft, and certainly Meredith is not the least peccant among the brotherhood.” Mr. More seems to consider Meredith the chief literary exponent of what Lewes calls " coat and waistcoat comedy," of the " suppressed emotion ** style of acting, which thirty years ago gave us Charles CoghIan’s impassioned Shylock and Macbeth, and to-day provides the players who	i
think the highest art is the reproduction	j
oh the stage of the actual conventions of ! the drawing room.	!
In one respect Mr. Meredith has carried this passive physical expression to a fantastic extremity, which I mention as much for its amusing absurdity as for	|
its real significance. Apparently he has	|
found a new seat of all the emotions; this is no longer the heart, or the Bibli-	I
cal bowels, or the brain, but—the eyelids. Let me justify the statement by quotations:	“ Hurt vanity led Wilfrid to ob-
serve that the woman’s eyes dwelt with a singular fullness and softness void of fire, a true ox-eyed gaze, but human in	!
the fall of the eyelids.*’ "She had red-	i
dened deliciously, and therewith hung a dewy rosy moisture on her fcnderlids."
“ 'We are creatures of custom. I am. I confess, a poltroon m my affections; I dread changes. The shadow of the tenth of an inch in the customary elevation of an eyelid," These are not isolated cases. After a while one begins to believe that hope, fear, humor, love, hate, anger, horror, friendship cunning, timidity, modesty —all the passions of human nature—are bound up with the flutter of an eyelid.
It is the very ad absurdum of passive physical description.
The essay on Nemesis is in effect a short study of religious development, pointing out the universal belief in the envy and jealousy felt toward man by his god. Greeks, Jews, Hindus, Christians, all have felt it, all fed it, in greater or less degree.
