Dr* Hatnpson's book Is not a textbook for students, but an attempt to explain to thoughtful people more than they can get “ from frequent disconnected and sensational articles in the daily press, or from smart and * snappy * contributions to the monthly magazines." It considers radium in three relations—in its relations to the.scientific world, explaining why the new metal demands so much consideration a.s it has received and si ill receives; in its relation to the scientific views of the construction of the universe, and in Its relation to the future. The discovery of radium has made the scientific world consider seriously the long-accepted laws, such as the law of the conservation of energy, and has disturbed their belief in the atomic theory—has made them believe
in the divisibility of the indivisible atom, j Radium has given us perpetual motion in the constant output of heat, and now the | : scientific men see in it an equivalent of ! the long-sought philosopher’s stone, which ; can transmit the elements. AsJJr. Hamp-son says: “ If anything like the progress i that the last eighty years hnvc seen in our command of electricity be made rn ; the study of radio-activity, we may Icain how to control in common materials the disintegration change which occurs spontaneously in radium.” What will bo the results of such knowledge? We may learn to produce large qunntiti»*:-t of useful compounds out of cheap and useless substances, how to convert the heat of radium into energy, how to cure certain diseases—not cancer, however, Dr. Hamp-son reminds his readers.
The whole subject of radium is fascinating in its very vagueness. Dr. Hamp-son explains why it is. fully and completely, in popular language, with an irreducible minimum of technicalities. As a preparation for further study of the new element, or for those who wish merely to keep well abreast of the world to-day, his little volume has an important place.
