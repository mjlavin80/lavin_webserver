THE. HIDDEN WORLD.
The Shadows of a New Science-Three New Books on Hypnotism, Telepathy, and Metaphysical Phenomena Reviewed by Pendennis.*
HERE is nothing so important in the progress	of the	world as the veil it	customarily	wears	and what is behind	that
veil.
These three books concern the unfolding of that veil.
The scientist raises it with a conscious assurance that as far as he can see most of the unusual and the occasional In metaphysical phenomena is soundly material, though not strictly healthy. The spiritist raises it with emotional tremor, and what he sees is generally what he expects to see—ghosts, a presentiment of the dead living in another world. The psychologist never really lifts it; he stands close up to it, looks through it, and adapts his observation of half-told mysteries to the definite complexities of	definite	people.	The poet, perhaps an
unconscious	psychic	medium of everyday life,	yet
entirely discredited by science, alone plants in the soul a positive oasis of enchantment, inspires a classical vision appropriate to our ultimate appreciation of a future so mysteriously yet reasonably symbolized in commonplace things.
If any one car. lift the veil to see what is behind the mystery it makes, let the poet have his say about it, for the "best and clearest things the scientists have seen in these books to tell about survive in our remembrance because of the poetic instinct in all of us*.	*
There is scarcely any subject that so completely submerges the author of a book on these subjects as the continuous benumbing of psychical research with analytical form.
It is important to accumulate facts, it is also .Important to be sure of them, which entails tireless vigilance against deliberate frauds and unconscious errors, but when this is done, when these crude sands of experiment have been sifted and .atomized and filtered, why say, after all that, we have gained nothing except a little heap of unrelated, disassociated incidents? Is It not possible to mold these sands of mediumlstic information into one or two principles, such as have helped to establish religions, to regulate social laws? There must be some formula of advantage to us hidden in the accumulated wonders such as the members of the Society for Psychical Research can show in their reports!
At any rate one can read two of these books with some such impression, for they aim to accomplish something that the pure scientist might call altruistic, but that the great unbiased masses of living soul-tenants understand upon practical application.
Two of these books referred to are " Metaphysical Phenomena," by J. Maxwell, a Doctor of -Medicine and a distinguished lawyer in France, and *' Science and a Future Life/* by James H. Hyslop, Ph. D.. LL, D.# formerly Professor of Ethics and Logic at Columbia College. The third book, “ personal Magnetism, Telepathy, and Hypnotism," a practical course of instruction, by George White, must be classed by itself for obvious reasons, since it aspires to make every man and woman a practical hypnotizer to his or her worldly advantage over others less informed in the trickery of mind over mind.	:	.	.
Dr, Maxwell’s book, " Metaphysical Phenomena," includes a preface by Charles Rlcket, perhaps the foremost psychical observer, and President of the Society for Psychical Research, and an introduction by Sir Oliver Lodge. It has been translated from the French with faithful devotion to the author's ultra-timidity of acknowledgment, (in spite of his amazing number of experiments and their remark? able success,) by L I. Finch. In each of these books one is constantly reminded that it is not generally considered respectable to acknowledge one’s faith

ln metaphysical phenomena : such a» typtology, luminous phenomena*’ psycho-sensory phenomena.' spiritistic communl-cations, arid the long-sounding etosteras (of psychical research- Much that is con-' vincing and inspiring to a logical mind In Er. Maxwell’s book is so dilated with its timidity of assertion and its inherent dread of ridicule that some of the sfcrong-gest pages in it become but dry leaves because of this deadening apathy of enthusiasm or even satisfaction in the discoveries Implied.	.
One may become so conservative toward life that death remains the only aristocratic friend we can trust, but let’s be as human as we	be, let’s believe In
something- for a basis of faith, with science for a lawyer and sanity for a priest.
The most expansive, mood Dr. Maxwell permits for himself in his relation to this quite important volume is in a chapter headed ** Preliminary Remarks.’* He sounds the alarm against belief In that which he might otherwise establish in the very first sentences when he writes:
I hesitated for a long time before deciding to publish the impressions which ten "years of psychical research have left me. It might have been more convenient and advantageous for myself had I continued my researches in peace .and quiet. But the sight of a few brave men fighting the battle alone is by no means a matter of indifference to me. There is, a certain cowardliness in believing their teachings, while allotting them to bear all the brunt of the fray for upholding opinions which. require so much courage to champion. To these brave spirits I dedicate my book.
DR. MAXWELL HON-COMMTlAL.
A reader is compelled to accept the author’s estimate of his task, especially concerning technical information presented with a scientific " tendency ” for precaution. There are times when Dr. Maxwell says, In effect, as the savant of musical comedy, ** This may be true, but yet no, no, and then again certainly not, because If it were, then why was it7 In which case such inquiry might lead to an investigation entirely transposing the uncertainty of an original hypothesis, -which would compel me to say yes, yes, and then again, assuredly bo." One reads the 448 pages with amazing interest in the remarkable facts scientifically protected, showing undoubted proof of Innumerable mystic forces ever seeking to break through from beyond the veil that enwraps this earth, and just when credulity Is safely launched, the Doctor shakes his head and pulls away from what he has shown us, as though he had said, “ I cannot indorse any meaning of this. I can only report the existence of the phenomena,"
Literally we are more interested in the promise of a discovery than In Its intrinsic value upon Inception, and who can better invade its future than a man who has discerned the signs of futurity In it?
With all deference to the power of caution, this constant fencing witfc the conscious and the sub-conscious, ' with muscular automatism and personification, with telepathic perversion and complex revelation of ethereal forms, of luminous objects, of crystal gazing, and supernormal phenomena, leaves the reader In a state of confusion, not about the facts, for they are un questionably evidential, but about the actuality of their relation to the scheme of normal senses given to man.
*' Can I believe my senses? " asks the bewildered, whereas if he did but avoid bewilderment, which requires a basic faith of some kind, he would never ask the question-There is such a tremendous meaning to us in a book so carefully prepared, so elaborately and skillfully constructed, and so complete In its selection of experiments that verify against all argument, that one laments the assertion that it is not yet entirely ** respectable ” to believe them. And yet Dr. Maxwell is not alone in this contention, for it Is the common attitude of the very distinguished men who have advanced psychical research to where it is to-day*
Charles Richet, in his preface to Dr. Maxwell’s book, says:
We live in the midst of phenomena and have no adequate knowledge of any one of them. Even the simplest phenomenon is most mysterious, what does the combination of hydrogen with oxygen mean? Who has even once been thoroughly able to understand that word combination, annihilation of the properties of two bodies by the creation of a third body differing from the first two? How are we to understand that an atom is indivisible; it is constituted of a particle of matter, yet—even in thought—it cannot be divided. Therefore it behooves the savant to be very modest, yet very bold at the same time.
MANIFESTING INTELLIGENCE.
If there is no audacity about his convlc-8 tions, Dr. Maxwell has not spared the
f
mediums their audacity of truth or his own daring ’ with spiritistic' investigations.
To bdgtn with, he approaches the person-* ification, which he'describes as " the manifesting intelligence, * whatever that may be,” with a perfectly normal and friendly mind, strongly recommending people to’ treat it with a certain punctilious courtesy such as one would show to one's acquaintances and friends. Having thus ' . * ’ ■ * -
early in the first few pages of his book-acknowledged the possItJility of establishing. a normal human relation of conference with a “ personification," the author falls deeper and deeper into the inevitable confession that between himself and the metaphysical phenomena he has witnessed there Is an understanding by signs, visions, and sensations, that brings psychic, perception and the commonplace sensibility of sight, touch, sound, and smell into an Intimate rational exchange of ideas. He has done this with a constructive ability of such a sound, firm, and withal scientific calibre that this, book may well be accepted as the nearest writ of arrest issued up to the present timC against the sweeping unbeliever or the ill-mannered scoffer. As Mr. Richet says in. his preface, 0 I think I see here the lineaments of a new science," which epitomizes what Dr. Maxwell has accomplished. '	.
It Is tremendously important for any psychologic student to read this book, modern In its research and convincing of a vast energy behind the veil that covers the face of things as we are accustomed to look at them. Its timidity is a scholastic mannerism that its phenomenal facts eventually overthrow; but it carries but a faint hope to the spiritist, for it almost refutes the long-existing theory that the spirits of people who are dead and buried are the sole heralds of a desirable life after this one. This Is a book that does much better for our hopes than to proselytize an emotional phenomenon existing largely as a vague medium of religious comfort. It has a well-balanced scientific skill, that opens up for us suggestibility of a practical force, be It In the ether of air or in the electric momentum of our individual nervous energies, that will some day so dominate our activities and broaden our vision through a knowledge of its quantitative elements that eternal life will be as a matter of course, and we shall fully understand the Biblical parable why " man was made in the image of God."
PROP. HYSL-OP’S BOOK.
Prof. James H. Hyslop Is more definite and perhaps ethically more certain of the Influence of phenomena, such as Dr. Maxwell describes, upon a hereafter.
The very title of his book, " Science and a Future Life," contributes to the advanced theory in these matters,' that a new science is at work drafting for us an outline of a future life more certain than the canons of religion have established. The habit of absorption in immediate things has alienated a great many people from old church faith to creeds and cults that give their followers a promise of tangible and physical response, because of which some false and dangerous standards of high moral purpose and even conduct have crept Into sociological affairs. This book of Prof. Hyslop* s serves for this reason a double Interest, since it emphasizes the ~ necessity of scientific methods in a field of human aspirations too long accustomed to neglect scientific | approach of a Creator, who in every per! Bonification of life has ordered a sclen-i • tiflc, a natural growth. Nor does this
i book permit a blindness to overwhelm our j anticipations of eternal life, because of many contradictions in science to affirmations of the spirit.
It rather uses a scientific basis to protect a dream world that lives about and [ around us from any bewildering of its prophetic importance.
This book deals more Intimately with spiritistic phenomena, containing long chapters summarizing the Piper case. In his preface Prof. Hyslop lets slip the information that this book is a sequel to a work on philosophy still in the press. This Is especially interesting to know, that a serious compilation of a philosophic nature leads to a sequel of the kind we have found in ** Science and a Future Life."
There is much of this intellectual assimilation of intricate scientific complexities of experiment, even In this book, for It seems as though Prof. Hyslop seizes this subject with a mental assurance and ethical respect.that are not dependent upon the success or failure of mediumistic data. He sees a science in what many
scientists have not grasped in the psycho-sensory revelations of very usiiai ‘ experiments,'	.	‘
He does not gasp at their mystery or :calj the thing he caniiot explain a‘ delusion, which Is an easy, comfortable manner of leaving scientific darkness to eternal night, but he • tolls' you the story of spiritistic wonder, and then he adjusts it
to the ethics of human experience; he i . i . shows you that beyond the veil there is a
relation of things there to the things here, and that the final proof will not be awesome, or shivery, or at all ghostly— just an adjustment of our present uninformed senses to phenomena of nature we have not yet fully grasped. For this reason, it Is in many ways more satisfying than Maxwell’s " Metaphysical Phenomena," because it assumes a reader to be sympathetic to an intelligence of psychologic purposes.
It contains a brief account of the formation of the Socloty for Psychical Research, the parent body of all that is worth knowing or ever was known about metaphysical phenomena. -
A long, closely written chapter headed " The Problem of Future Life " suggests the! important theory of spiritistic prophecies and their intentions toward the creative elements of worlds beyond this. There is also a chapter headed “ Ethical Meaning and Results " that is In the direction of what was mentioned at the beginning of this review.
Altogether, Prof, Hyslop’s book is the broadest and most understandable work in accord with an intelligent ambition for what this new science can and will do that we have read up to date.
As regards the third of this group of three books, “ Personal Magnetism, Telepathy, and Hypnotism,” by Mr. George White, it Is so removed from the other two by a temperamental lack of scientific feeling for the enormity of the subject It touches that one reads it with regret for Its masquerade of values.
TO TEACH HYPNOTISM.
Its sub-title sufficiently indicates its character, being " A Practical Course of Instruction In Persdnal Magnetism, Telepathy, and Hypnotism.” In the preface it naively states that the greatest interest in the world is to obtain mental power over others, to make them do by force of mind what you wish them to do. Of course, once given a standard of this kind, much of the deeper purpose In scientific experiment of any sort would be lost.
However, this book then proceeds to unfold a bag of tricks by which the Mind (in capital letters) can become adept in controlling other Minds, (also In capital letters.)
We do not dispute the efficacy of mental science, or the possibility of acquiring some hypnotic facility orf influence enough to be led blindfolded to a hidden object in a room without having it first pointed out to us. Also there may be a benefit in exercising one’s faculties toward concentration of will, even if we must sit for half an hour in a room looking at a nail In the wall. But why offer as an Inducement to the unsuccessful a redemption of their failure in a little hypnotic jugglery, a telepathic trick or two*, or a contortionate magnetism?
Doubtless there Is a popular impression
i
that the best of metaphysical phenomena ts produced by conjuring, and that hypnotism Is an art that can be learned and applied to advantage—like a typewriter. This popular notion is the reasonable hope for the sale of iuch a. book.
It is well printed, easy to read, and swings along with the same sinister assurance with Which a magician introduces his tricks.
Not an important contribution to the new science, because it is too far on the outskirts of the inherent destiny of psychical research, it may add a serious quota to the new science, as the kindergarten accomplishes its share In preparatory scholarship, but when so sensitive and complex a thing as these phenomena are transcribed In books there should be behind them as unselfish a motive as the best literature Invariably has.
The author is no doubt quite sure that his book is to do a service by revealing certain tricks by which the mind can become more expert In dissembling than it Is normally, but that Is not of scientific imporatnce. It is merely a fanciful way of doing up old Ideas In new packages, for concentration of will power, a little telepathic Information and sub-conscious mind reading are actually dally, hourly occurrences even In commonplace lives.
One does not have to learn these things, one lives them. And there Is a danger in
crowding a normal development by prema-tu re-suggestion that puts the unthinking entirely on a side track, leading to.a little stopping place, already overcrowded, called charlatanism.
There Is one* very Important phase of sincere investigation—the anxiety of the scientific experimenter to keep on the straight, well-lighted roadbed of salient truths. This Dr. Maxwell does wjth such'' good effect that he has secured the best fnediumistic raps In daylight, and frequently without a professional medium. It is not necessary to train mediumistic qualities; they are usually discovered by accident, proving that they were existent without the medium’s knowledge.
In fact, all the greater secrets of the world have opposed a technical hunt after them, coming suddenly upon us, when we were ready to assimilate their train of practical importance to the science of living.	PENDBNN1S.
