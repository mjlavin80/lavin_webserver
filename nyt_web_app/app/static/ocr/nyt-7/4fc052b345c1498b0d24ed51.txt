In summing- up his study of Socrates, the latest volume in The World's Epoch Makers Series, published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, the Rev. J. T. Forbes, M. A., writes:
The purpose of the life of Socrates can never be Justly treated by limiting examination to the thinker or inquirer. Hid lifelong aim was to implant a new soul in Athens. The philosopher in him was the servant of the moral reformer. An illuminated mind and a changed life, and the second through the first—this was' his dream for the men of his day. Character must be built on knowledge. The Greek people "did not know, they did not consider.*’ * * * The Socratic ideal is limited in its range of appeal; it has the narrowness of a system intellectual and aesthetic in its root conceptions rather than moral; and it lacks strength to win fulfillment. If expansion in the realm of ideas is a real experience, so increase in the volume of spiritual force is a real experience to the world and to the indi-	I
vidual. This was the Athenian problem;	I
it was the Jewish problem; it is the universal problem. And it involves no diminution of the world's indebtedness to the sages of heathendom to believe that tbe victorious answer is in Him who gives to men Lo become sons of God.	.
In his introduction Mr. Forbes discusses the political conditions of Socrates’s time,	B
the civic ideal, and the religion of the	I
Greeks. Most of the book Is then given	I
up to a consideration of the teaching of	I
Socrates and its influence on men	I
like Laches, Xenopnon. Plato, and others.	I
The author has consulted French, Ger-	I
man, English, and other authorities on	I
the subject, whose names and works he	I
indicates in footnotes.	9
