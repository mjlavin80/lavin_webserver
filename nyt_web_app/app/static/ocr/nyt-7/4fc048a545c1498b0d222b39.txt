7?cw Tort Times Hook Review'.
I note In the article ** What Girls Want in Books," Quoted by you July 22, from The* London Standard, that “ a high school mistress " in England has given the Literary World her opinion that M hardly any [English] school girl can be got to like Keats," and that ** none read poetry of their own accord.*' As the latter statement is certainly not true of American school girls. It would be .interesting to
know whether they are so difficult to lead to so pure a Castalfan fount as the author of M The Eve of St. Agnes.** Will not The Book Rkview interrogate the professors of English poetry in tho girls’ colleges?
