From 177i> to 1S12 the town was the capital of the State of Pennsylvania, but it was not incorporated as a city till 1S18. Mr. Riddle records also the visit of Gen. Lafayette in IK£5— a visit which was made a gala occasion for the school children, who, arrayed gloriously in scarfs of gay colors, received the hero with those songs and shrill recitations which It used- to be the fashion to inflict upon the helpless visitor of distinction. •
The author speaks of the composite population of the place—Germans. Moravians, Scotch-Irish. Huguenots, Welsh, English— as providing for Lancaster tho most ! sturdy of Americanism, and gives a history as well of the various Church schools and other charitable institutions of the earlier days as of the publlc-school system instituted in 1S3S. Tn connection he gives much biographical matter about members of the School Board of the city from the beginning to the present day, and provides pictures of many of these worthies.

For Lancaster, like New York, Is something of a German town.
