New York Times Book Review:
I think that Mr. Kipling frequently shows a sympathetic familiarity with our Bible— that well of English undefiled. So his use of " an " before the aspirate is not surprising1 when we find it used so often in the Scripture.
An helmet, an heritage, an house, an habitation are but a few examples.
