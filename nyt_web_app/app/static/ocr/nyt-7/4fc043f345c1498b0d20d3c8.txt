WHEN the novelist who dares the autobiographic form produces an
■	Intense autobiographic impression, he has usually done something worth while. Mr. Robert Herrick, who, In his " Memoirs of An American Citizen,** assumes the pork packer, takes to himself so utterly all the moral and spiritual limitations and all the expanded business horizons of the modern (and Western) self-made man of commerce that you are forced to believe that Edward V. Harrington is a real person and at this moment United States Senator from Illinois.
This Harrington is introduced as a tramp, and his first public appearance is in a Police Court, falsely accused of picking a young woman’s pocket. He was a lad from the country whose disposition to be a law unto himself had unfitted him for the slow round of rural life. In Chicago his open eye, his boldness, his lack of certain finer scruples (chiefly matters of tradition) carried him far. He early learned the utility of illegal agreements for the regulation of trade and the division of profits, and saw no harm in these things. For he pursued ends in themselves legitimate and sold honest goods. He bribed a Judge and used pecuniary persuasion upon the Legislature of Texas—but only when his enemies were blocking his fair game.
His enterprises were real enterprises; they won money for himself and his associates; they helped the public. He was ready to aid his friends and good* naturedly disposed toward people in general* Therefore he respected himself as a fair man and just and resented . (while he could not understand) the view the clergy and many old-fashioned people took of his methods.
It grieved him when what the papers said about the things he did hurt the pretty little woman he had married— it puzzled him, too—but he ceased not at all to go his own way. He met and was drawn to another woman who looked at the finer scruples as he did, and admired and helped him—but no scandal or even excuse for scandal came of it. In short, he believed in the gospel that the strong must and should prevail and he followed the code of that gospel with a sort of’ high fixedness not inconsistent with much human kindness.	'
When the war with Spain came he flared up a patriot. He would have gone to the firing line himself if his vast schemes (which were toppling upon the very edge of disaster at that moment) had not involved the fortunes of many who had trusted him.
In short, this Edward V. Harrington was a big man, a successful American —such as modern conditions have made him. He had in him all the things that have gone to the making of strong men from the beginning and all that goes to the making of good men except an ideal to fit the higher and tradition-{ sanctioned moralities and a field in ; which the rules of these moralities are j practically consistent with the attain-, ment of the ends which bread-earn ing men must set before them. When he had won his Enillfons he felt a void an bought a Senatorship—seeing darkly a light beyond and groping for something j vaguely higher.
' The story contains other moderns almost as remarkably conceived—a corporation lawyer of the kind that by old standards ought to be eminent jurists and three women of three very real sorts of womanhood—of whom the best is she who smiles Inscrutably and sticks to a mysterious inner, assurance of the abidingness of religion and neglected standards of abstract right.
Mr. Herrick’s book is a book among many, and it comes nearer reflecting a certain kind of recognizable, contemporaneous American spirit than anybody has yet done.
