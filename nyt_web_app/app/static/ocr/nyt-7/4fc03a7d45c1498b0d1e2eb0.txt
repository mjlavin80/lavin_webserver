The Vouth of Wusl* i ngton
yets York Timrs Book Hcvicto:
Did Dr. Weir Mitchell display selective accuracy when he chose to represent George Washington as an autobiographer? It seems lo one that he did not. Indeed, one cannot help thinking that an author takes too great a liberty in so doing—a license, to use a stronger word, which might even be called immoral.
The reason for this objection is well , known. It is not to impart information when one repeats that Washington was the sort of man who rtever talked about himself. He was not only very reserved, very reticent, " he was the most absolutely silent great man that history can show.”	*	—	‘
Of course the author of " The Youth of j Washington ” knows this as well as any one. He must have thought it.a,quite proper thing to (lo, when he set about producing a book intended to affect readers as the actual narrative of Washington himself, written to read like his own : story, told in his own words, j One may decline to read the book, yet form some idea as to how skillfully Dr. j Mitchell has put together the touches of character, the stray sentences, the little Incidents, to make a striking imposition, one to produce an impression, it may be, on readers less Inclined to open a volume of plain history, j But the better such a book is, is it not the worse If it conveys a radically false ! Impression? Is it right to animate a book with the voice of a man who in life was not only unable to talk about himself, but—we all know about that time when the Speaker of the House of Burgesses said, "Sit down, Mr. Washington!” Nothing is more interesting than a relation in which the writer tells his own story—or more valuable. But that is not the point here. Washington, of all men, was most distinctly not of the type of those prompted to delineate themselves, as Franklin did.	.
It is perhaps worth while to ask for space to question this, if one feels about it in this way. As one pauses to reflect, it docs not seem a mere cavil. Writers of historical fiction are sometimes accused of playing fast and loose with characters who cannot defend themselves. With all due deference for a distinguished author, one cannot help asking if Dr. Mitchell ought not to' be called , to account for placing Washington In a false position, as he seems to do, and may to more than one who stops to think, when he represents tho most silent great man in history telling tho story of hla own life.
