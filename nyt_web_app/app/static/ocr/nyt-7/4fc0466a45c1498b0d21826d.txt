I have just seen the cheap edition of Ed^ar Poe’s works published by Funk & j Wagnails and edited by Mr. Markham, and a thing* moro unjust to the author and , his readers could hardly have been perpetrated. In “ The Raven " one deliberate chanjje has been made; in ** Lenore ” an entire line omitted from one verse; and in " Israfel ” is a misprint that quite destroys the sense. The poems, at least, should have found better treatment, livery lover of Poe should protest against such editing.	JOHN	B. TABB.
