The Blind Poet oS Harlem.
New TorK Times Book Review:
I read with a sense ot considerable enjoyment-in your issue of July 8 the letter of Mr. Frank P. Richardson ou “ The Haunted Temple and Other Poems,", by Edward Doyle, " The Blind Poet of .Harlem.’* The pleasure was due partly to the opportunity that the article afforded me of comparing my impressions of a new literary creation with those of a writer of evident scholarly attainments.
I - certainly agree 'with Mr. Richardson that “ The Haunted Temple" Is 44 Dantesque in’ vividness of description and profound significance." The picture of Conscience M tearing with both her hands her hair grave-grown ” In a whirl around the temple's dome, and her disappearance into a cloud over “ the upward-burning sand ” of " the drear aloft ” between recreant souls and their God, where she enlarges Into a whirlwind, can be paralleled only In the works of the masters.
It Is not to '* The Haunted Temple,*' however, but to the patriotic lyrics In the volume that I should like to draw attention in evidence that poetry of"a high- order is produced in this country at the present time. Take, for . example, 4‘ Liberty Bell,'* celebrating Caesar Rodney's ride to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, where his vote decided the adoption of the Declaration of Independence:
LIBERTY BELL,
Liberty Bell without a tongue Over the Hall of Congress swung.
True was its metal, and wrought well;
Yet as it swayed no one could tell Whether it ever or soon would sound.
“ Find Rodney—quick! ” the cry went round.
Far in the field, drear miles away,
Rodney was arming for the fray.
Learning that he, and he alone,
Could give that bell eternal tone.
How, thro* a cloud of wood and weed. He spurred and spurred his lightning steed.
Liberty Bell without a tongue I Over the Hall of Congress hung. Rightward and left it swung for hours. Whether the dawn or midnight powers That wrestled on high would win the bell For silence or sound, no one could telL
Out in the cloud of wood and weed, Village and town dropt Rodney’s steed.
I Into the hall the rider sprang,
Touched the bell, and, Godf it rang,
Rang! Rang a grand sunrise of sound. Awaking man the whole world round!
Patriotism Is never more genuine than in commemorating the deeds of our country's great men. And Caesar Rodney is not the only all but forgotten hero who is celebrated in Mr. Doyle’s verse, for I find in the volume glorious tributes to Commodore John Barry, Col. Knowlton, Major Leitch, and the 15,000 patriots who perished in the East River prison hulks. In the poem on the last theme these significant lines occur:
Wake, O ye dead—ye who forget Due reverence to deeds sublime!
’Tis a dead country ln quicklime That to the past pays not its debt.
I should like to quote the whole of Democracy ’* to show how the Miltonic sublimity of its imagination is sustained, but I shall content myself with the concluding lines:
** No.! ” spake forth God. Transfigured and refreshed By that almighty voice, Democracy, Haloed of brow, drew back his giant arms Above him like a bow, and with a spring Hurled forth the monster, raising, seen, a jet	■
From the abysmal billows into heaven 1 In such a volume it will never cease To fall In sunny showers upon our land. And form a rainbow all around the globe.
One of the noblest functions of poetry is to embody a free people’s loftiest aspirations, and in *' Democracy " Edward Doyle has done this with such consummate skill as to make idle the pessimistic query:	Is	there	any truo poetry written
to-day?	SAMUEL V. PIERCE.
