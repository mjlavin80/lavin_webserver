A. « BIOGRAPHICAL ” STEVENSON.
One rather shuddered at the announcement of a " biographical edition ” of Stevenson, edited by his widow. Stevenson himself was not;# reticent or secretive person. Of no: author have we a fuller autobiography, not in the form of an express autobiography. He was very quick to see what of hi% own literary and personal experiences would make salable M copy/' and to convert them to* that .use. Moreover, his private letters which were of any public interest have been published since his death, to the great gratification f * the reading public, and for j the benefit of his heirs. The announcement of the biographical edition looked like an attempt to. work his memory for more copy than It would fairly yield. And though Thackeray’s daughter had contrived to produce a biographical edition of his works which was as discreet and impeccable as it was interesting, yet it seemed to many that in the case of Stevenson there were not quite the same guarantees for discretion and impeccability as filial piety furnished in the other case. There were thode who even entertained apprehensions of painful disclosures of a Noachian character.
Now that nine volumes of the biographical edition are actually published and before us, it is a pleasure to say that all the apprehensions have turned out to be quite groundless. Good taste and a sense of what is interest- I ing have co-operated in the prefaces with which Mrs. Stevenson has furnished the several volumes. There is nothing which one can reasonably wish had been omitted. And what is quite as remarkable, considering Stevenson’s own communicativeness and the previous communications of his survivors, there is much that is new and which one would not like to have missed. The prefaces are strictly relevant to the composition of the books they respectively usher in, and it is really rather remarkable how much, in spite of their brevity, they find to tell which is worth j telling, when we thought everything 1 worth telling had been told. Some of the prefaces actually add an interest I to the works to which they are prefixed.
It may be added that a new and com- : plete edition of Stevenson, in a moderate compass and at a moderate price, had come to be a desideratum quite apart from the biographical element. This desideratum Messrs. Charles Scribner’s Sons have admirably supplied. For a library edition, indeed, nothing could be better than the " Thistle/' which we find distinctly preferable to the more monumental and less wieldy “ Edinburgh/' as being lighter in the hand and narrower on the shelf, while in every point of artistic bookmaking it is at least equal to the Scottish “ definitive/' But of course the “ Thistle ’’ is not portable, in the sense of being pocketable. One can readily imagine the possessor of the larger edition acquiring the smaller, on the score of its superior convenience for traveling. And the booklover who has not the “ Thistle *' should by all means equip himseK with the " Biographical/’ Though not on very thin paper, it is on paper which admits of from 350 to GOO pages in not much more than hal^. an inch of thickness; the paper is
