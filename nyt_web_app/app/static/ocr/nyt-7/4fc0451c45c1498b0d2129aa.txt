war. Thus circumstances alter cases, and Mr. Browne is <rlear-headed enough to draw the prnner lesson from what he has seen. It is to him, and he puts it in plain words, still a question whether South Africa shall be a Hritish colony or an Independent principality, broken from the mother country by the joint efforts of disgruntled and discoura&ed Dutch and Anglo-Saxon coionists—Angio-Saxon being used purposely instead of English, because he has recognized the growing importance played by Americans in the affairs of South Africa.

Mr. Balfour Browne Is a prominent London barrister, Secretary to the Railway Commission, a learned writer on legal subjects, and a stanch Tory, who, while having small liking for Chamberlain, refers to the free trade slogan as " another venerated rag." Last year he was carried to South Africa by a professional engagement* It was his first visit to an English colony. While homeward bound, alter an absence of about three months, he jotted down, without attempt at system or plan, a number of reminisccnces, Impressions, and opinions of things seen and heard during his trip—timid essays at nature descriptions forming a quaint but far from displeasing setting to professional discussions of grave problems— and these random notes form tho present volume. Few of the facts or conditions er issues referred to by Mr. Browne are new to the public. Yet there is something startling —in his presentation of them. Americans have special reason to be interested in his conclusions. There were two problems in particular that he encountered in some form or another almost every day he spent on African soil. One of these might be termed the “ black question," while the other was the question of how to obtain cheap labor. Both are not unfamiliar in this country, and in this fact lies the chief interest to us of Mr. Browne’s book, that almost every one of its pages proves that Englishmen soon must look after their own lynching^ and their own negro 1 roubles instead of giving their attention to American unpleasantness of that kind. The sum and substance of Mr. Browne’s observations in the colony-may be found in this simple passage: "That South Africa is, or may. be, a white man's country is a dream—a delusion.”
He had been little more than a few hours fn the colony when he heard how the mistaken leniency of Government fudges toward negroes arrested because of assaults on white women and children compelled a number of colonists to band together in a vigilance committee, the members of which caught one of the offenders and prepared to lynch him in true
>	Southern style. The Kafir " boy ’’ was rescued by th® authorittea the nick of time and sent to prison for ten years—to the disgust of the whole colony. But the Incident resulted in a new law making a capital offense of such crimes.
The principal trouble Mr. Browne found Is the difficulty to get the negroes to work. And it Is a double-edged trouble; the negro who does not work, but lives In laziness on what is earned for him t»y the <plves bought for the proceeds of six Months' of employment In the mines, is much more dangerous than the one who “works, and the mines cannot be run profitably unless there is an abundance of cheap labor, which means colored labor-black or Imported Chinese. Both difficulties, Mr. Browne thinks, might be solve<5 hut for tlie squeamishness of the great British public and the subserviency of the politicians to Its wishes. He found to his surprise that to-day the white colonists' want just what the Boers wanted before, namely, freedom to settle their own labor questions, and that 'the altitude of the English toward the blacks and Boers. In the Transvaal today must be the same which the Boers, assumed toward the Uitlandere Defore tho
