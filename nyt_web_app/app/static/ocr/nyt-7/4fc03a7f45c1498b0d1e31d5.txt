Reminiscent of HucldebcsTy Finn.
l'UCKER DAN. By Charles Bass Jackaon.
Now "York:	G.	W-	i^nn-nghnjn	Company*
Ttiere is much that la wholesomely amusing in this little volume about the escapades of two youngsters, who remind os strongly of that familiar pair Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, and as the aim of the author seems to be nothing more than this, the book quite fulfills its purpose. The style Is simple, with here and there little bits of homely humor and philosophy, though the latter is well-nigh lost and. soon forgotten.
The story has not overmuch sequence,
*	the chapters being different adventures of the two boys bound together, though toward the end a strain of heart Interest lends a suggestion of development. Uncle Binny, the nearest relation of Tucker, is th** butt of a series of misfortunes brought on by the two in the first half of the book, while later a certain Tim Flaherty, a near-sighted policeman and not at all venerated by the two yourifesters, has his full share of trouble. Throughout everything, however, Salvlna, a buxom country lassie, stands true to Tucker.
