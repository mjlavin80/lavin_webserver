' Byron was not a man who used language to conceal his thoughts, though his editors, have sometimes felt constrained to use asterisks to conceal his language. Making due allowance for the fact that he wrote his letters and posted his diary more often at the hours of reaction than of sublime exaltation, we get from them a more convincing impression of the real man*than is usually to be derived from documents of the kind; and Mr. Bettany’s anthology of his opinions has, therefore, ,a real interest and value. Occasionally, it is true, the class! fication of the opinions leaves something to be desired. Under lhe heading of " Byron’s Religious Views,” for instance, we read
M '
that he “ saw the tigers sup at Exeter
*	Change*” and that “ there was a hippopotamus like Lord Liverpool in the face, and the ' Ursine Slith* had the very voice and manner of my valet." The religious significance of these observations certainly is not superficially apparent even to those who talce the broadest views of the bearings of belief on conduct. .^These editorial lapses are not, however, very numerous; and the compilation Is on the whole satisfactory and instructive. There ts nothing new In It; but it gives us a convenient synoptic view of the poet In his various relations with his times and his contemporaries.
Thus seen, Byron strikes one chiefly as that distinctively English product—the brilliant amateur who can beat the professionals at their own business, likes lo do so. but absolutely refuses to take the business seriously. The foreign critics may or' may not be right in acclaiming him as the greatest man of letters of bis pcricd. What is indisputable is that he w**s the least literary of them, In any narrow sense of the word, and also the most flippant. The ethers had fixed points of view, theories, and systems. Byron hated systems. ** When," he wrote,
** a man talks of his system. It Is like a woman's talking of her virtue. I let them talk on.” So little could he enter Into Wordsworth's reelings about the priesthood of letters that he wrote: ** The end of all serlbblement is to amuse.1* The doctrine, it may well be, did not injuriously ai'fcct his own creative work, since genius 2an generally be trusted to ride ever its own theories In practice; but it certainly imparted a very loose impressionism to his Judgments of his fello^r-craftsmen. As a critic he had no principles, but only likes and dislikes; and his personal and literary animosities ware so inextricably entangled that he was very seldom successful ln anticipating the verdict of posterity. He scoffed at Keats, calling him “ Jack Keats or Ketch, or whatever his name is,” applying to him
many epithets for which asterisks are substituted in the text before us, mid describing his verses as ** neither poetry nor anything else but a Bedlam vision produced by raw pork and opium.” What he said about Southey and Wordsworth is too well known for quotation: but it may be less w-all known that he called * Coleridge, in so many words. “ a d—d fool,” and preferred r to the Lake School not only Scott, but also Moore, Campbell. ar*d Rogers. In all theae obiter dicta the note of the amateur, contemptuous at heart of all the tricks of the trade which it pleases him to follow for his amusement is loudly audible. * * • It is not altogether an agreeatrte tone, for the jester too often seems to be jesting in order to keep up his personal dignity in the presonce of the Eternal Riddle; but Lhe haughtiness of It as it appeared in
11	Cain ** and “ Don Juan *’ made a great impression on the Continent. In an age of sycophancy and ;>f multitudinous checks upon the free utterance of opinion, Byron forcibly appealed to many people who were quite incapable of deciding whether his poetry was good or bad, because he had no mr>re respect for the Trinity than for the Holy Alliance, and no more regard for the Holy Alliance than for Robert Southey.
