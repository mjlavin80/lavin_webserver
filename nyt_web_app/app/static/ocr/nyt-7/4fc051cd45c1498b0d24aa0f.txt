j Summing up Jonathan Swift’s work,
, apropos of his Irish "Historical and Pollt-ical Tracts "—the volume containing which is the seventh to appear in the new edition of his prose works, edited by Temple Scott—the editor writes in his introduction:
Looking back on the work Swift did and comparing its effect at the time with the current esteem in which he is held in the present day, we shall find that his reputation has altogether changed. In his own day. and especially during his life in Ireland, his work was special, and brought him a special repute. He was a party’s advocate and the people’s friend. * * * He was the friend of Harley, the cham! pion of the Protestant Church, the Irish patriot, the enemy of Whiggism, the opponent of Non-Conformity. To-day all these phrases mean little or nothing to those who know Swift as the author of “The Tale of a Tub ” and '* Gulliver's Travels." Swift is now accepted as a great satirist, and admired for the wonderful knowledge he shows of the failings and weaknesses of human nature. He is admired but never loved. *	*_* What is left of him for us
Is the result of cold analysis and almost heartless contempt.
To each tract Mr. Scott has prefixed a I note telling of the source and giving a r6sum6 of its contents. Here and there also are fac similes of the original title pages of the various documents. Besides these prefatory notes, the editor has also provided footnotes explaining certain references made b3' Swift to people, places, or events.
