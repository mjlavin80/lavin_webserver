Very serious, very earnest, Is Dr. Thud- | leum's volume on cookery. When first published, ten years ago, it was called " The Spirit of Cookery," and that name | describes it as well as the present name, ! though not so Intelligibly. The book Is not a cook-book, except Incidentally, it contains recipes, but they are no more to be followed easily than are the operations In the ** key" to Todhunter’s algebra, which generally left their victim statted in the most difficult part of his problem, with a reference to some earlier page. So with the recipes in Ur. Thudicum's able book. For instance, in making " hare soup M you use “two quarts of standard broth,” regardless of the number of feast-ers; you comminute the flesh, and flavor ' your broth with tincture of cayenne-^ The book is not a cook-book, therefore, in the ordinary sense. But it explains the why and the wherefore of good cooking, and a person who should assimilate Its teachings, and then apply them to the ordinary cook-book recipes would undoubtedly produce excellent and appetizing results.
There are interesting side remarks In the book. pr. Thudlcum attacks the memory of Brillat-Savarln, patron saint of downtown luncheon eaters. He quotes approvingly Cargme, who ‘ said that BrIHat-Savarin_did not know how to eat properly, and simply filled his stomach; and_r>umas, who. said that he was " simply a vigorous eater/* and M. Pagfts, who remarked “ one nowhere heard better talk about dining, and nowhere ate^ worse dinners,'than at Brillaf-SavarJn'S' table/’ Heresy,' this,' undoubtedly; yet I ; when one recalls that.. Savarln , liked *. to begin .a dinner with -six., dozen, oysters,, there -Seems to be more" than-‘a suspicion ‘ of orthodoxy about 1^ ;	.
