Kcw York Times Book Review:
The whole trbtitde in this discussion about poetry ’ likely arises through confounding poetry1 with "verse." One has nothing to do*with the other. I do not say "we have run out of verse writers,-for there is too much melancholy evidence against me. And when I say that we have no more poetry, I use the term properly, and mean that we have no more imaginative work—and can save our time looking
for It!	'	■	...
All the opinions I have seen on this subject plainly show that the writers not only confound poetry with verse, but seem to think that there is something, largely abstract and promiscuous about, the production of -poetry* .They seem to think that poetry is a product which is apt to vary with modern times and seasons and external circumstance, implying that at present things seem to be dead against the children of the Muse:	Ncr
does your interesting correspondent. Miss Sampter, consider that heroic inspiration Is at all necessary v street cars and automobiles will do on a pinch. Miss McGill is amiable enough to opine that if the poor, harassed poet, might only be stimulated by uome sort of an American lau-reateship—I presume not *’ made in- England	pres to I all would be changed in
the twinkling of an eye; the sun and moon and- stars of the ■ poetic firmament might indeed then sing together vibrantly in glory.	,	.
On the- contrary, ■ do not immutable— and absolutely natural—laws govern creative- poetry? Can we -expect, like some foolish husbandman, wheat of thistles? We are sowing; and have been sowing for a half century, the-tares of a thoroughly superficial restless, -materialistic age. Can the gentle and splendid flower of true poetry spring from such soil?
No. Our deadly,, paretic materialism can but continue to-spread, snuffing out in its progress not only ■ the imaginative faculty within, but many of those beauties of nature and art on which it might thrive and give .true increase. No lau-reateships, no adventitious aids and comforts are worth a brass farthing; the poor poet lies dead,-* crushed under the wheels of automobile and trolley car; even the " willows" whereon his harp was once wont to be hung, (and might hang still,) have been uprooted and replaced by a signboard shrieking the efficacy of Fly Screens, or Surpassing Coffee. or Pallid Pills.
