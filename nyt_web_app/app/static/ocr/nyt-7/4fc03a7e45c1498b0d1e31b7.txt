The blessed Catherine Benincasa, called of Siena, was a holy woman and a woman of affairs, moreover, in the scandalous drys when two Popes reigned In Christendom—one of them at pleasant Avtgnon under the ^ing of hia Most Christian Majesty of France. In this collection are letters of tho- saint of highly florid and uplifted wording jg.ddressed to Pope Gregory XI., (.whom she visited at Avignon in the interests of the Florentines,) to Pope Urban VI., (whose trusted adviser she was in the great schism,) and to Pope Clement VII., whom tho Cardinals set up in Urban's place. There is a letter also to Charles V. of France bid-dlr.g him make peace with brother Chris-| tian monarchs and take up the crusade,
| and even one to that bold English soldier of fortune, Sir John Hawkwood. Him she i addresses as “ most beloved and dear
s'*
i brother in Christ," and bids cease selling | his sword to the highest bidder and go crusading also, j Other letters there are to religious men and women, to her mother and her broth-I ers—to all sorts and conditions of folk. St. Catherine’s letters are accounted classics in Italy, but the perfervid language of religious ecstasy in which they are couched does not fit the English toi.gue. In the translation, therefore, all but the devout will find them hard reading in spite of the bearing they have upon a most Interesting period of history and In spite, too. of the saint's boldness in rebuking the sins of her correspondents.
Catherine (it may be added) was born in 1347, the youngest of the twenty-five children of Jacopo Benincasa, a dyer of Siena. She was therefore a woman of the people. She made a vow of virginity at seven years of age, and took at that childlike period to the most ascetic practices, so that when she was grown she washable to live chiefly on salads and water. At seventeen she donned the habit of St. Dominic. and for three years thereafter dwelt at home as a recluse, speaking only to her confessor. After that she began to acquire a reputation for sanctity, and as previously hinted began to take a more or less conspicuous part in the troubled life of her time, striving to do good. Now she is at Florence, now at Pisa, now at Avignon, her mission usually that of a peacemaker between belligerents. Now she is Urban’s earnest supporter and adviser and now que1l3 a revolt of the ever-troublesome Romans. Busy letter writer as she was, St. Catherine learned to write only three years before her death. Rich young nobles, her disciples, acted usually as amanuenses. She died on April 30, 1380, alter a. holy vision a-t St. Peter’s.
