Scotch View of ** Nancy Staii
New York Times Book Rcvictc:
Inquiries as to the historic value <*f " Nancy Stair " having reached me from time to time, it seemed best to get the opinion of a Scottish writer of the Burns country rather than to trust to my limited knowledge of Scotland and her traditions. So I sent a copy, of the book to 1 Mrs. Helen Jane Crawford, Kilmarnock, Scotland, an authority on the history of 1
the West Country.” Mrs. Crawford, first over the pseudonym of Helen Stein, and later her maiden name, Helen Steven, has been for years an industrious contributor to The Scottish Magazine and other publications, and has printed a volume of Scottish dialect sketches through John Menzies & Co., Edinburgh, some of which are as charming as anything which Crockett or Barrie has ever written.

' tying her pony to the. railing of the l Parliament House, was too funny. * The wind playing through the gowan tops ’ is past laughing at, and many other liko things. She (Nancy) speaks constantly Of the funny way Bhe was * raised.1- That f Is pure American ; we say * brought up/ op * reared.* We speak of ' raising * vegetables, out never children, or. even cattlo.
. Again, Nancy constant# calls her father/ by; his Christian .• name; that may bo , American, .but it is certainly neither Eng* j lish nor ^Scottish—indeed, for a child to do so even, now would be considered not only irreverent, but . impertinent in tho
