Mathematics-
P. M. Saxelby, M. Sc.. B. A., Head of the Mathematical Department at the Belfast Municipal Technical Institute, has written “ A. Course in Practical Mathematics/* which Longmans, Green & Co. are about to issue. An idea of the treatment of-the different branches of mathematics is given in the explanation of the section on trigonometry, in the preface. The author writes:
In the chapters on trigonometry, for instance, while results are nowhere given without proof, the deductive treatment is. as far as possible, accompanied at every step by graphic or arithmetical verification, to enable- the student to realize clearly his own experience of space, and to see that ho is not dealing with an arbitrary system of symbols alone. Every one has in his own mind the fundamental notion of a rate of increase from which the different calculus took Its rise, and this should be clearly defined before proceeding to the analytical process of differentiation. Accordingly, the subject has been arranged so that, after a course in . plotting to fix the notion of the function of a variable clearly in the student's mind, he is introduced to the methods of differentiation by a chapter on rates of increase treated by arithmetical and graphic methods.
There are a suggested course of reading, some examination papers, and many mathematical tables, besides numerous .
diagrams.
