NOTE that you Bay in your editorial of July 8 on Mr. Whelpley*a book, " The Problem of the Immigrant,” that “ all countries wheocs come to our shores the emigrants regarded aa least deirable are pow doing their best to check or regulate emigration/’ and you cjte Russia and Italy. This statement is open to question-
The emigration law of Italy la not In truth a restrictive act; its purpose is to protect emigrants and its operation serves to facilitate the emigration to this country of undesirable and to retard that of desirable persons. This is clearly understood by the Italians themselves, as is shown by the following translation from an Italian paper published in'New "York:
“ After Australia and British Columbia,
(where illiterates are excludad,) now
comes Southern Africa, and very soon the
United States of America will follow.
What then will become of our emigration,
and particularly that from the Southern
provinces? It is enough to glance at the
grand total of the permanent emigration
from the Neapolitan provinces for the
first six months of the current year (1902)
to understand what terrible menace hangs
over these regions, and what duties fall
upon the shoulders of those in charge of
our public affairs in Italy. In view of
such danger what is there lett for na to
do? We can only endeavor to keep as
long as possible the other openings which
at present we have for our emigration,
and acquire a new one. as. for instance, the Transvaal. In Brazil, where there Is still a large field for opportunities. It would be heartless to push on our emigrants and afterward see them treated with inhumanity and with oppression without being a.ble to give them sufficient protection.”
Northern Italy furnishes a much better immigration than that which comes from the Neapolitan provinces, but the Northern Italian cannot subsist on the pittance that sustains his Southern brother. Bad immigrants drive out good ones just as bad money drives out good money, and so long as Governmental assistance fosters a large emigration from Southern Italy, so long will the Northern Italians fail to find a sufficient inducement in this country to come here in large numbers. It cannot be said that the operation of a law which sends us five times as many Southern Italians as Northern is working to our advantage.
In Russia the doctrine of " indissoluble allegiance " is still maintained, and ablebodied subjects of that country find Jt difficult to evade military service and cross the border. No such strict supervision is exercised toward persons physically incapable of bearing arms, and many such leave Russia every year. In the twelve months ending June 30, 2904, 145,000 Russian subjects came to this country, and while I do not wish to be understood as saying that all these persons were of poor physique, I do assert that but for the restrictive measures of that Government the immigration from that quarter would have been of a better quality.
The disclosures made last year by Special Agent Marcus Braun showed that Hungary had gone into the emigrant business on a grand scale, and in return for the establishment by a transatlantic steamship line of a port of call at Fiume, had guaranteed to deliver to that company not less than 80.000 emigrants a year. This eunrantee was carried out with great hardship to prospective emigrants, and several cases came to my personal knowledge at Ellis Island where the holders of steamship orders calling for transportation 'over other routes were obliged to deliver them up to Governmental officials, the emigrants being sent against their will and at additional expense to themselves, to the port of Fiume for embarkation. One such case was that of an American citizen who was not permitted to leave the country except from the port fn question, although she held an order purchased in the United States for transportation via Bremen. On representations by the State Department the Hungarian Government made full reparation. Inasmuch as tho penalty provided for in the contract between the Hungarian Government and the steamship company called for the payment to the latter of a large amount of money in the event that the number of immigrants furnished each year fell below the minimum limit agreed upon, it is conceivable that Government officials were not overzealous in keeping back immigrants, however undesirable they might prove to be, who presented themselves for passage.
Rigid enforcement of our exclusion laws, such as characterized the administration of the late Commissioner at Ellis Island, and as now characterizes the ad-
sioner Watchorn, has doubtless Impressed foreign Governments with the necessity for holding back such Immigrants as are manifestly ineligible, ' but this action ia not to be taken as a. bona, fide desire on their part to “ check or to regulate emi-
gration.
