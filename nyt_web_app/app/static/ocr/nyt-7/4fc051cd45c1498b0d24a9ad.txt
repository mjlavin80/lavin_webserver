LONC OJNT msrc LOTHE IX
r DICKSBEBfVY is the name 1 *. o£ the author stamped on g the cover of the book; F.
: DIckberry la his name on the title page. One who buys “ The Storm of London: A Social Rhapsody," (Boston, Herbert B. Turner & Co.,) having paid his $1.50, has a. perfect right to take his choice. Dicks-berry or DIckberry, what, does it signify? Probably the author’s name is neither.
\ There is, to be sure, no reason why he should be ashamed of his book from a moral point of view. It is not particularly brilliant, speaking artistically. For Instance, a certain heavy storm of wind and rain and lightning deprives Londoners of all their clothes. Linen, cotton and silk, velvet, flannel, broadcloth, and Harris tweed all disappear. How? No theory is advanced to cover that important point. •
The curtains, bedclothes, carpets, rugs, and furniture coverings all go. There is not a lace curtain or a yard of tape left in all the metropolis. Paper I goes, and the daily journals are wiped out of existence along with the tailors’ shops and the haberdashers. Books vanish, there are no letters, and the Post Office Is useless.
The Londoners, high and low, are left naked. The poor go about their business. The milkmen and the butchers* boys rather enjoy the situation. But polite London remains in confinement for twelve long days. Then it breaks forth. It must have air and exercise.
It breaks forth, unclothed, like a multitude of Greek gods.

Yet the streets are full of horses, harnessed to carts, wagons, and carriages. Leather has not vanished, and men and women have often been clothed in leather. Beds of plaited rushes remain. Plaited rushes could be used to cover nakedness, at a pinch. What is more, all the masterworks of the painters remain hanging in the galleries. There is canvas left in London, then. Why not canvas coats and frocks 7
Swarming the streets without their clothes on, the men and women of London society are unable to recognize each other. Long practice in concealing one’s emotions and suppressing ideas has deprived well-bred Englishmen of all facial expression. This is the sharpest note of satire in Mr. Dicksberry-Dlckberry’s *' rhapsody." The author’s motto is this, from *4 Sartor Resartus
Clothes gave us individuality, distinctions, social polity; Clothes have made men of us: they are threatening to make clothes-screens of us.
mhus, with the clothes of London, the individuality of its inhabitants, their distinctions, and social polity all disappear. London is made over on a basis of Arcadian simplicity. A policeman being the equal of a Duke, every man becomes his own policeman. The music hali ’* artists,” the only students of physiognomy, establish schools of observation. Society is annihilated because it is impossible to know whom to bow to, whom to nod to, and whom to snub. Chariots take the place of victorias and broughams. The paintings of Sargent and his contemporaries are frowned upon. ** Sargent is the satirist of a clothed society.” The nude figure and the landscape are now in favor.

The dance of society is abolished. The sports and pastimes of primitive ages are revived. Perfectly nude and astonishingly modest, yet unashamed, Duchesses and Countesses pose by huge alabaster vases or recline on marble couches.

But we shall not attempt further to summarize the book. It is worth reading- It Is undeniably smart. Of course, the story is all a dream. How could it be otherwise? From our own point of view, we should call it a pretty bad dream, but we have no idea of forcing our point of view on Mr. Dicksberry,
