MORE. BOOKS OF AMERICAN HISTORY.
The Sixth Volume of the American Nation Seiies and .	Other	Recent Works.*
Written for The New York Times Book Review by ROBERT LIVINGSTON SCHUYLER,
Member or the American Historical Association.
O	THE period whose history this volume of the American Nation seeks to relate, such terms as “ The Forgotten Half-Century ” and “ The Neglected Period of American History have been applied. It was passed over quickly by such general historiafts as Bancroft and Hildreth, and it must be confessed that it is lacking In those dramatic incidents which the history of the seventeenth century and the Revolutionary period furnish. To the student of institutional history, however, the early eighteenth century is by no means unimportant, and it is from this standpoint chiefly that Prof. Greene, the author of a well-known work on ** The Provincial Governor,” attempts to describe it. His is one of the first efforts that have been made to write a comprehensive account of the provincial system as it existed from the accession of William HI. to. the fall of Walpole.
Of late much literature of a monographic character has been produced which bears upon Prof. Greene's subject. and of this he has, of course, been able to make extensive use. There is also available, as he says, an almost bewildering mass of local and antiquarian publications.'* . Comparatively little attention is paid to- the great contest with France, which is reserved for Prof. Thwaite’s " France in America ” to form the next volume in this series. The central theme is the provincial system, of which the dominant phenomenon was the Royal Province; this latter was at once a local government and an agency in the general organization of imperial control.
TAKEN as a whole, tho period under review was one of a gradual tightening of the reins'of British control. While this tendency appears in its most exaggerated form just before the revolution of ICS!), when all Now England, New York, and New Jersey were incorporated in a single Government under Andros, it is traceable throughout the reigns of William, Anne, and the Georges. Had the process of the extension of direct royal control not been interrupted by the revo~ lution of 1GSU, such control would probably have been secured in all the colonies.
The solution of the colonial problem at the accession of William III. was in the rature of a compromise. The popular representation which had been wiped out by the reactionary policy of James II, was restored, and the principle of extreme consolidation was abandoned, though Massachusetts, Maine, and Plymouth were organised under a single royal government. Tlie Massachusetts charter of 1091 was itself a compromise between imperial and local interests, and the government organized under it partook of the characteristics of both corporate colony and royal province. The net result of events ln the decade 1CS1-91 was a marked in~ crease of imperial control over the colo* nies. Its enforcement and extension are ably sketched. Prof. Greene regards the statement that the Walpole era was one of " salutary neglect M for the colonists as an attractive generalization, which, however, has to be seriously modified, j ** Though the trade laws were less vigorously enforced than they were in later years, and though the* proposal of taxation by Parliament was ne\er rarricd out, the colonists were bv no means left to themselves. Popular legislation was repeatedly defeated by the roy.il vcio. and Parliament exerted its authority over the colonies even in the face of strong rlsist-ance." Walpole’s influence, he says, "was apparently in the main the negative one of discouraging overaggressive schemes of colonial control.” Such agencies of colonial administration as the Board of Trade, the Courts ot Admiralty, &c., are carefully described. The Secretary of State for the Southern Department, who had much to do with colonial matters, was during a great part of this period the*
Duke of Newcastle, whose chief interest In the colonies unfortunately was the spoils of office. The most important colonial act of the Walpole era was the Molasses act of 1733, which, if strictly enforced, would have seriously crippled New England.

PROF. GREENE has a good deal to say about internal politics. 41 The fundamental part of provincial polices after the revolution of 1689 Is the conflict between the ^Provincial Governor and the representative Assembly." The former stood for the royal prerogative and imperial control, the latter for the representative principle and local interests, and the struggle between imperial and local interests, makes up the political history of the period.
The absence of great public names from the history of this whole period is due to local conditions which did not furnish opportunities for great statesmen. Still there were some men of prominence, and they form the subject matter of Chapter XIII. on “ Provincial Leaders.” The last chapter on ** Provincial Culture M should be read by persons who hold that there was no provincial culture. Prof. Greene gives the Anglican Church credit for exerting an “ important civilizing influence,* Jonathan Edwards, he says, was " perhaps the keenest and most original thinker America has ever produced.”
Prof. Greene has succeeded in his purpose of generalizing on tendencies and correlating conclusions already familiar to the specialist. He has made careful and discriminating use of his material, and apart from a useful text has given us a valuable critical essay on the authorities. The function of this volume in the series is to bridge over the period between the founding of the colonies and the beginning of the Revolution.

?t.20.
THIS admirable little book is designed to give a popular account of the life, manners, and customs of the American colonists in the seventeenth century* Particular attention is, therefore, paid to social and economic rather than to political and military history. It may profitably be used as a corrective to the numerous short textbooks which leave upon the student’s mind the Impression that tlie life of the colonists was an endless round of fighting and political activity.
Mr. Eggleston emphasizes the fact that even in the very earliest charters granted •by the English Crown it was provided that the colonists should have all the privileges enjoyed by Englishmen. These guarantees were made much of by the popular party in its conflict with prerogative and proprietary interests; and this conflict is the central thread in the narrative of colonial history. Special honor is justly paid to Rhode Island as the only colony where complete liberty of conscience and equality before the law arose.
John Smith occupies a commanding position in colonial history and in the pages of Mr. Eggleston s book, “ It is not too much," he says, " to say that English civilization and the English power were first planted on this continent by the genius, the courage, and the abounding energy of Capt. John Smith.” * He is inclfned to resent the attacks that some recent critical writers have made on Smith's reputation for veracity, and thinks there is no reason for rejecting even the famous Pocahontas rescue story.
After reading this lively little narrative one can without hesitation commend it to those who find the ordinary one-volume histories dry and meagre, and who have not the time or inclination to consult the larger works.
ADMINISTRATION OF LAW.
THE AMERICAN JUDICIARY. By Simeon E. Baldwin. LL. D. The American State Series. Pp. xm.-403. New York: The Century Company. $1.25.
JUDGE BALDWIN'S work is divided into two parts, the first on the nature ~ and scope of the judiciary, the second on the organization and working of the courts. State and Federal.
The substructure of American law in the colonies, as he shows, was the common law of England. Considerable importance is attached to the revisory jurisdiction of the Board of Trade as a factor in keeping colonial law in line with English law. The strict tripartite divison of governmental powers set forth by Mon-
! tesqufea was followed" in the earlier State
*	Constitutions, but the Federal Constitution practically recognizes that thfs theory is not supported by American' experience'
■	and does not ‘insist upon so complete a separation of functions. An^interesting example of the participation alStlie judiciary in legislation is to be found in tbe early history af the State of New York. The Constitution of 1777 provided for a council of revision, of which the Judges of the Supreme Court formed a part, to which all bills which passed the Legislature were submitted before becoming law.
In commenting on the force of precedent, Judge Baldwin lays spggial stress on the importance of the writings of such jurists ag Blackstone, Kent, and Cooley, and shows that courts have overruled their own decisions as a result of such eminent opinions. In Chapters V. and VI. he describes the power of the judiciary In developing the unwritten and In interpreting the written law. Judicial construction furnishes the Constitution with the necessary flexibility. Under-the title " The Judicial Power of Declaring What Has the Form of Law Not to be Law" he discusses the power of the courts, and the exercise of that power, to declare statutes upconstitutional and hence void.
The fundamental distinction between the two sets of judicial establishments is that the Federal courts are by the Constitution invested with certain express powers, while the State courts have all the judicial powers pertaining to sovereignty except those expressly delegated to the United States courts. Thfs means that the great mass of litigation In the country has to be disposed of by the Slate courts. In such a work as this the relations between the courts of different States and those between State and Federal courts receive, of course, careful attention.
Upon the jury system. Judge Baldwin is very instructive. ** A jury trial,” he says, ** Is a poor mode of doing justice, if there is a rule of law which, as applied to certain facts, should control the verdict, unless that rule of law be both stated by the Judge, and .so stated as to impress upon the jury that it is its sworn duty to apply It, if the facts which they may find to exist are such as to come under its operation.” Ho believes that “ it [the jury] should be so instructed, even if declared by express statute to be the judges both of the law and (he facts."
1 Altogether, Judge Baldwin has made a noteworthy and successful effort to explain in moderate compass the judicial system under which we live. His work maintains the high standard set by the other published volumes of the American State Series, which is being written by acknowledged authorities, under the editorship of Prof. Willoughby of Johns Hopkins. As Professor of Constitutional Law at Tale and Justice of the Supreme Court ot Errors of Connecticut, the present author's claim to speak with authority win hardly be disputed.	R.	L.	S.
