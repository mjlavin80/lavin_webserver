IBIMIGRAT ION
npHE immigrant, that is to say, the man leaving a native country te take residence and seek livelihood in another country, has been since the dawn of time decidedly a " problem." Sometimes the problem has been for the country in which he arrives, " What will it do with him?” At others quite distinctly the problem has been,
'* What will he do with it? ” At present in the United States both these problems are offered to our study, or are being: worked out in our “ midst ” with lamentably little that can be called study on the part of those who really ought to be able in a considerable degree to influence the result. In the United Kingdom the matter is pressing on the attention of the Government and is receiving a kind and amount of attention never before directed to it. This largely happens because the United States rather tardily asid In not a very intelligent fashion, but with a good deal of energy, has for the past few years been shutting out a lot of immigration of a patently undesirable kind, and tbe refuse has overflowed on the shores of England.
There is in this country and in England much sentiment of one sort and another on the question of immigration. There is not available much authentic ’ and systematized information. The man who sets out with the laudable purpose of basing his opirion on a fairly complete set of facts, finds himself seriously hampered by the absence of ! trustworthy material for forming opinions. He can fill his library easily with books on the migrations of ages ago; but he cannot readily lay his hand on j publications that will tell him of the nature and extent of the immense currents of migration that are moving with varying rapidity and volume \ across the face of the Western world, including the most civilized and highly organized nations of modern times. It is to supply in some manner this obvious want that Mr. James Davenport Whelpley has produced through B. P. Dutton & Co. " The Problem of the Immigrant." His book is large and some-
\ what expensive, (?3,) and though it is ! unquestionably useful, containing much I that cannot be,got in any other form, we cannot help wishing that he had at once condensed and enlarged it and made it, as it might be, considerably more useful than it now Is. '
The feature of chief value in Mr. Whelpley-s volume Is the collection of laws with reference to immigration in
■	tbis country and in the European countries where such laws exist. Those laws are given very fully. In the case of the United States they are given too fully, "since a number of provisions are printed iliore than once. Equal accuracy and greater clearness might have been at-
•	tained had these provisions and some others been carefully summarized. Indeed In some cases the text of the laws requires explanation to make it intelligible. Nevertheless, as we have said, the book is more useful than any other bearing on the same subject- Its care’ tul reading will dispel some errors into which the citizens of our land are prone to fall.
For one thing Mr. Whelpley brings out the attitude of the various* European nations as to the expatriation of their people and as to the management of transportation companies even when only passengers across their territory are concerned. It is true that this attitude is only recently assumed and defined, and legislation embodying it has nearly all been enacted within the twentieth century. But it Is also true that all the countries whence come to our shores the immigrants regarded as the least desirable art* now -doing their best to check or to regulate emigration. In Russia emigration is completely illegal, and Is carried on in direct violation or evasion of the laws. In Italy it is allowed, but only on extremely strict conditions, the Government supervising and controlling all agencies and holding them to the closest responsibility. The aim of the Government is on the one hand to see that the emigrants are not Imposed on, and, oh the other, to prevent the shipment of emigrants likely to be excluded from the countries of destination, especially our own. It Is the spirit thus shown that makes it seem quite possible that an International conference on the whole question of migration, as very forcibly advocated by Mr. Whelpley, would result In great good.
