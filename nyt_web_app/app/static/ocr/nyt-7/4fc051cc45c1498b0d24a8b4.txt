•	history breaks on the sharp-'ly defined ‘ line btetweeh heathendom and Christ!anitir^. ; St. Patrick's . position 'and ' * that of ;
: his followers is shi^wn . in. his poem,
; " The /Watchman's < Cry.” He is alone In the darkness. waiting for . the dawn. The atmosphere stifles and oppresses, him.	girds, himself.in the
name of the Trinity against the malign spells of the Druids. All their thought is to do evil. It is a writing of great force. The language -is that of • a later day, but the spirit is clearly of the fifth century. ''What to us is the life blood, the . genius, of a great nation was to him an- . athema. Cruelty and evil lurked in-ail the poetry and traditions of the heathen. The poets lived on, but no Christian pen Svould recorfj. thair thoughts, their anriafs. , A century and a half- later thei Churchmen made an organized attempt to' extirpate the bards. St Columba, himself a' poet, permitted them to. exisjt in submission to the Church, but historic continuity was r lost. Tfghearnach- \va*s! an authority on the early Tilstpt-y .only as Herodotus was an. the legend of the Tcojan war. A fair comparison may be made with Bede, most candid arid cautious of historians. He wrote two centuries alter the Saxon, set- :
tlement of England, but his genealogies represent Woden , as the grandfather or great-grandfather of each Immigrant
Cucullin must be an early reduplication. The first syllable cannot stand for " hound," as the annalists supposed, for cu becomes cun or con in composition as well as in the oblique cases: Such a compound is- found in Cunobelinus, or Cymbe-line, the " hound of the dawn," like Sar-amaya and Hermes. Belinus or Bellerus represents the disk of the sun dipping its lip in the eastern wave. Bel or b^lre is the Irish for lip, corresponding to Latin fcellus, ** Kiveetlips bcllaria. .** sweetmeats ; Greek phileo.. "I kiss,. love,” phiale .“.round-lipped saucer,’.* phalara, metal disks on the horse’s Dridle. A siral- . lar dawn hound Is Mancunium,. the epo-nymus of Manchester, and St. Mungo-n. In this case mun or man is Irish for “ ointment, liberality, goodness," found * In the Latin Manes, Manius, mano-" I * distill trickle.” The. a and u roo‘.s meet as in canis, cun. Mungo was a historical character, but bore a mythological Clan name like Bridget of the Brigantes, or the MacNamaras. Coun Maras or “hound of the sea" is cunobelinus. The Brigantes, now the O’.Briaps, were devotees of Brigindo. St, David of YVal^s, with the Davit ts and Davises, was of the Demetae* Devetae, Dyfydds of that region.’	*	.	.
Shane is modern Gaelic for. John, but Olsein was old Irish for “ the grandson of the ancients.” The early Irish did not use family names, but they compounded words. Sen, old, is found in tho Gallic name of the Senones or ** glorious ancients." The termination here is from- the root ven ■ t>r ‘ von—“ lovely; delightful,” found, reduplicated, in Vennavenna, birthplace of St. Patrick; Vonvania or Bono-nfa, (Boulogne. Bologna;) , Vl[vjenna,
“ victorious delight,** now Vienne; in the Gallic Divona, Greek .pifvjone, “joy. of the gods," which in Latin become?.Ivon-, us;’bonus ** good." The Latin, as. .usual. Is mdral; tne Greek and Celtic poetical.
There was comparatively recent migration between Wales and Southern Ireland, as is shown by the Menapii on both sides of the sea. This is the,only Cymric root in Irish names. Ap, (not. here map,- mao-“ son *') "pras Cymric for aqua, 14 water.” The Menapii lived on “ narrow water," or straits, like the Menapii near the Straits of Dover. Rutupiae was " water road" between Thanct and the.mainland. The Irish form is found in • the Minch, min isc, " narrow water," as innis, inch— in. isc*.44 in the. water/*, " an island.'t La Manche, ..between Cornwall and Cher-’ boprg, was .man isc, " bright water."
The early Irish. were a comparatively, feeble folk. . The Romans would not *take the trouble to conquer, them with a single legion. There .were no metals,- and Ireland remained a market for hides and slaves, and the. slave trade' perpetuated the hideous conflicts of the > clans, described in. the lives _o£ all the Irish saints. Christianity was . the Promethean spark which, developed the genius, the daring of the race, to nobler ends, and sent out j their missionaries to change the face of England and the Continent. Even the monks made their monasteries and churches, .of groups of small stone buildings, thatched with straw. The- glories of. Tara's halls are a reflection of the same mediaeval imagination which reared . the splendors of Arthur’s Court amid the ! wattled cabins of Celtic Glastonbury^
