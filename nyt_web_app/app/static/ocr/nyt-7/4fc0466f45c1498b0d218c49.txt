^ Messenger ( was for several years tbe leading magazine in America. In Its day, too, there existed on this side of the ocean but one magazine older—the Knickerbocker—and the difference in favor of the latter was only about six months. Students of American literature, of course, are familiar with the rightful place of The Messenger in American literary history, but a book like the present which tells about the magazine from the beginning—what it aimed to be, what it printed, who the contributors were, and who the several proprietors, editors, and publishers—is one very useful for- more ' or less interested Americans to have and to read, especially as' the files of The Messenger are scarce and difficult to ob*' tain.	„

DR. MINOR (now an old man in his eighties) uses toward writers the tone which belonged to his generation in a country then even more provincial than it Js now. And he writes himself in a past manner and without much art These old gentlemen looked very hard at the moral and useful side of what they were apt to name an ” effusion ” of somebody’s ** able pen.'* They had uo notion at all of what is called ■ " art for art’s sake.” So you find Dr. Minor (and his predecessors and success* ora in the editorial chair of The Messenger) shaking their heads over ** Mr. Poe’s ” unfortunat^ taste for gloom. M We cannot but lament/' says one of them,
“ that he has drunk so deep at some enchanted fountain which seems to blend in his fancy the shadows of the tomb with the clouds and sunshine of life.” This while Morelia " is in question, and Poe’s style is given unstinted praise. Again, when 44 our old assistant, Mr. Edgar Poe/' (then connected with the " Gentleman's Magazine ”) has written " The Fall of the House of Usher,” the then editor of The Messenger is led to m:
It is written wi th great power, but leaves on the mind a painful and horri-blo impression, without any redeeming admonition to the heart. It resembles a finely sculptured statue, beautiful to the eye, but without an immortal spirit. We wish that Mr. Poe would stick to the department of criticism; there he is an able professor, and he uses up the vermin who are continually crawling unbidden into the literary arena with the skill and nonchalance of a practiced surgeon.

THE Southern Literary Messenger was founded in Richmond, Va., August, 1834, by Thomas W. White, who announced himself printer and proprietor and had editorial assistance from" many gentlemen, but especially James E. Heath. The magazine was Intended to be a fortnightly, but soon became a monthly. The first number contained “ letters of commendation " from Washington "Irving, James Fenlmore Cooper. J. K. Paulding,
•THE SOUTHERN LITERARY MESSENGER. 1S34-1SC4. By Benjamin Blake Minor, LL. tX, editor and proprietor Cram 1843 to 1847. Svo. Pp. 251. New York and Washington:	The	Nealo Publishing
Company. $2.
John Quincy Adams; and others., The con- -. tributors 'include ;Mrs. Sigourney and R.
Wilde; In the fourth number Mr. Heath as book reviewer “ pounces upon. ‘ Vat-hek, an Oriental Tale,* by 7$r. Beckford. -and pronounces it to be the production of a sensualist and an infidel—one who could- riot in the most abhorred and de-.praved conceptions, and whose ’prolific fancy preferred as its repast all that was diabolical and monstrous rather than what was beautiful and good.0
In those early numbers, and for several years, The Measnger printed many ad-^ dress03—it was, remember, the golden age of oratory in America—at the inauguration of college Presidents and upon like occasions. Many college Presidents and professors, of law are naturally contributors, Including Thomas Dew and Beverly Tucker of William and Mary and William Maxwell of Hampden-Sldney, while the magazine early became the organ of the Virginia Historical and Philosophical Society, of which Jonathan P. Cusliing (a Northern man by birth, but then President of Hampden-Sidney College) was founder and first President, to be followed In the chair by Chief Justice ' John Marshall.
In March, 1835, (the seventh number,> Edgar Allan Poe appears with his tale “ Berenice/* which the editor praises, though he “ thinks there is too much German horror ” in the subject. After that Poe is a frequent contributor. In 1836 Mr. Poe takes the editorial chair and proves himself a very trenchant critic of books—so much so that we presently have a note of polite warning from The Courier and Daily Compiler of Richmond advising against “ obtaining a character for regular cutting and slashing." To which Mr. Poe replies crisply and the paper rejoins. Dr. Minor has quoted objection, answer, and rejoinder in full and all three' are good reading. But in the January number of 1837 appears this ** curt anno uncement “Mr. Poe's attention being called in another direction, he will decline with the present number the editorial duties of The Messenger.”
Dr. Minor says Mr. Poe afterward 44 besought the proprietor to reinstate him as editor, but Mr. White in terms firm yet kindly rpfused to do so.” It does not appear to be known who succeeded the author of “ The Raven/’ but Mr. White was assisted by various gentlemen of literary bent In Richmond—Mr. Heath, Judge Henry St. George Tucker, the Rev.
E.	H. Chapin, and a certain Mr. Spar-hawk, “ employed in one of the offices in the basement of the Capitol.” Pretty soon, however, a young naval officer, Mathew Fontaine Maury, began to write for The Messenger, and it is not generally known how large a part the famous geographer had thereafter in the making of the magazine. He presently became to all Intents and purposes editor, and the copy (it Is interesting to read) was sent back and forth to Washington under the frank of William B. Lewis, Auditor of the Treasury of the United States. Maury wrote under the pen name of Harry Bluff, and The Messenger at that time devoted much space to the navy.
IN 1843 Mr. White died, and the author of the present volume, Benjamin Blake Minor, then a young lawyer, became editor and proprietor. Two years later he purchased from William Gilmore Simms his Southern and Western Magazine of Charleston, S. C., and absorbed the latter in The Messenger. B. B. Minor conducted the periodical till 1847. when he retired to take charge of the Virginia Female Institute, at Staunton, Va. Dr. Minor has, of course, a pretty full account of his administration, and dwells lingeringl-y upon the contributions to The Messenger of his wife—his " consort" he calls her—Virginia Maury Otey. This lady used to write both prose and verse, and signed herself romantically " La Vision nai re. “
Dr. Minor was succeeded by John R. Thompson, whose period of editorship is the longest and most famous in the career of the magazine. Mr. Thompson continued in charge till 1SG0. Like Dr. Minor, he was at the time of taking up his task a young lawyer. Under Thompson, Poe for a while just before his death was a rather frequent contributor. i In I860 Dr. George W. Bagby took Mr. Thompson's place. Dr. Bagby was pep-pory as a critic, and Dr. Minor calls him '* warlike, advisory, supervisory, eclectic,
I facetious, and sometimes atrabilious **; j as for the “ Editor’s Table," in Bagby*s bands that Is described as 41 bellicose and querulous, yet hopeful, even pious/’ From February to June, 18G4, (when The Messenger ended Its career,) Frank W. Al-friend was editor.
In spite of obvious faults (and partly becaaise of them) Dr. Minor’s book has 1 both permanent value and contemporary j interest—very great interest to those ! who know the South—hardly less to those i who may wish to know more about that
I	section than they now do.
