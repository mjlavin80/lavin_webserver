It so happens that a recent book about a certain regiment of Ohio volunteers has described some of the glories of Gen. Sherman’s march through Georgia to the sea, and made no mention of certain less glorious aspects of that famous expedition. The book before us supplies the omissions of the other. That was a soldier's proud record of his marches and his battles and his wounds and his rewards; this is a woman’s story of what the women of the conquered country suffered from the men who marched and fought and more or less reverted to “ the primordial beast ’* so beloved of Mr. Jack London. It is a circumstantial narrative and bears upon the face of It evidence of a pretty close adherence to the facts. Of course. It frequently errs in attribution of motives, but as to the deeds themselves they are self-evidently actual deeds.
War is, to be sure, war, but irruptions into houses where only women are and the battering down of bedroom doors, ransacking of bureau drawers, the wanton rending of feminine fripperies, and the tearing of bindings off old books, are no part of the duties of the soldier. Here is a woman who sets down what she saw of this kind of happening in her own house and the houses of her neighbors. She sets down now and then cases where there was punishment for the offenders and even restitution, but she doesn’t omit cases where there was neither, and she relates in particular an incident of an officer who invaded her house during her absence, demanded the key to the library, loaded a buggy with books, and drove off with them.
Naturally stories of the taking of cattle and the making of messes of molasses, lampblack, flour, and silk bonnets upon drawing room carpets are related, too— even to the stealing of a bag of money-all her savings—from beneath the protecting skirts of an old negro woman, and the taking of the poor creature’s last chicken. But cattle and food and money are of the sinews of war. Even the'author seems to feel no great bitterness in these last cases. She merely insists that the truth Is the truth, and should be known, and adds that only the women are in a position to tell it—the men of their families being otherwise engaged at the time.
The present author admits comic incidents as well as tragic incidents. She tells, for instance, of an Irish servant who so scratched a stout thief in blue that his face was a sight to see. She tells of another bold woman w^o knocked down with a chair two fellows who entered her house to get, as they said, " hospital sheets," and were at the moment of the assault engaged In looking for tobacco in her bonnet box. Another story is of an ill-conditioned Colonel who refused a pretty girl a pass because she had, with the chartered insolence of her kind, arrayed herself in a gray jacket of conspicuous Confederate sympathy and re* fused to take off the obnoxious garment. And other stories are of other officers in blue who had better manners and more sense of humor. Contrariwise, still others relate to a certain General, who shall have to be nameless, though the author is explicit as to that. This gallant officer had a sort of mania for confiscating ladles’ carriages. But he seized that of one gentlewoman who was too much for him. She came and took the carriage back under his orderly’s eye, ordered her coachman to put in the horses, and then sat in it In front of the General's headquarters until he consented to return the cushiony which had been removed and taken Inside.
There are many such humorous matters mixed with the sufferings and humiliations here reported, but the whole is not likely to promote Southern amity toward the late dear enemy.
