N an article in The International Journal of Ethics, entitled " The Optimism of Thomas Hardy," Prof. Ernest Sutherland Bates of Oberlin College declares there are two kinds of optimism, docile and heroic. The first variety has prevailed in this country. It "assumes without question the ultimate worth of the social order in which we live.” It assumes the pre-eminent value of human happiness. " All that happens, happens for the best, thus saith the docile optimist.”
RaJph Waldo Emerson taught us the doctrine in such winning form as raised our souls to the heaven of his own belief; Sidney Lauder sang in lyric strains of triumph the* same laith when he told how wandering over the whole world Love seeks in vain for "Hell; Walt Whitman taught us in his franker fashion that every human motive or emotion is a motive or emotion for good, and. finally, our greatest literary force of the day, Mr. William D. Howells, in his complete creed of the conventional and commonplace, stands for docile optimism without limit. Surely I would not deny great value to this literature. Emerson is inspiring and Lanier is comforting. Whitman invigorates and Mr. Howells pacifies. Nevertheless in its appeal to us at the present time does there not seem to he something lacking in this type of American work?
S*
Across the Atlantic Ocean Prof. Bates finds his heroic optimism. We gather in passing that even Ibsen Is a '* heroic optimist,” along with Zola, Tolstoy, and Hardy.
And among the foremost of the brave, among the most heroic of heroic optimists must be numbered Thomas Hardy. A heroic optimist is not at all a docile optimist. One of the very first dogmas of the latter is a religious veneration of the universe.
This heroic optimism, It really] appears, has traits akin to that which we call pessimism.
Hardy's deepest misery is forced upon him by the apparent lack of justice in the soulless Order of T1 ings absolutely careless of human happiness. He finds that heredity and environment inevitably drive many men to deeds of unir.tended evil and final self-destruction* Then how can heredity and environment, the most tangible representatives of the Ultimate, be considered in any real sense to be good? In vain Hardy seeks in Nature to Und justice; all the evidence he can accumulate tends to disprove the hypothesis.
In short, we must ride boldly through the Valley of the Shadow of Doubt, if we would follow Hardy. But, still, Hardy Is neither materialist nor pessimist. Moreover, Tess is really " a pure woman faithfully presented.” Of all Hardy’s characters none is perfect:
Hardy Is not so childish as to believe in any possibilities of human perfection-— and even Tess, the salntliest of them all, feels the for?e of sensual temptation. Nonetheless I think a fair reader will realize that human nature, as seen through Hariy's eyes. Is redeemed by its power of human love. To be sure, love even when exalted to its highest form of self-sacrifice seldom seems to produce the conventionally expected insults in mitigating human sorrow. On the contrary, we must grant that tne world for Hardy is not a world where permanent happiness and tranquillity are generally attainable. Misery is all about us. and increase oi love Inevitably brings increase of suffering. Does this view make Hardy after all a pessimist? in his own eyes, I grant, he is Probably a pessimist, for in his metaphysical side-remarks the note of despair is beyond question often sounded. The deeper Hardy, however, whose manhood speaks to us through his spontaneous pictures of life
more entirely than in his reflective remarks I certainly call not a pessimist but an optimist, for he shows a worthy humanity, true to itself, unconquercd by destiny, sanctified by love.	..
