AN BNGLTSH OPINION.
Marriott Watson in The L. o»do o Chronicle.
AND yet things did happen, even in Mr. Howells’s novels. How familiar to one who can look back on twenty years of novel reading were those little, yellow paper-bound volumes In which Mr. Howells had his introduction to the English public! There was "The Undiscovered Country/* and there was lhe delightful tragi-comedy, “ A Foregone Conclusion.” and then, agatn. ** The Lady of the Aroostook.’* No one in England was doing quite that sort of delicate, easy, sophisticated work, and no one now is doing it. It was full of a sense of humanity, of kindly humor, of pleasant cynicism, of intimacy with the moods and vicissitudes of character.
But with the emergence of his passionate Americanism Mr. Howells began an unconscious revolution in his methods. He degenerated into mere particularity, ai-most into garrulousness. He would take ever so many chapters in getting his heroine down a street. He dwelled on the uninteresting details; he refused to eliminate the unessential. His theory was that no cultured reader should take an interest In events, but that the soul should be probed and plumbed for its uttermost secrets. 1 Well, there comes a time when the souJ refuses to yield uitf any more of its secrets.
Art, you see, is not merely analytic; it Is, in its ultimate manifestation, synthetic. And to get a living picture of life it is not -necessary to focus under the microscope all the petty and irrelevant psychological changes of a character. Every one's history each day is built up by a thousand subtle fluctuations of the mind. Out of a mass of emotions, sentiments, feelings, and sensations every action is evolved. At least it presupposes a succession, or tradition, of such mental phenomena. But only vital things matter in art, and a consideration of tbis emotional ** histology ’* is not necessary or useful or interesting.
But one fancies, and one hopes, that with Mr. Howells the wheel has come full circle again. At least, some of his more recent work would suggest that he has returned to the ideals and manner of his earlier days. This would be cause for general congratulation. He is, and will remain, the most distinguished literary force in America. His name is indissolubly involved with Ajnerican letters; and he worthily Inherits and supports tlio tradition of the America, which was Emerson's, which was Longfellow’s, which was Oliver Wendell Holmes’s.
