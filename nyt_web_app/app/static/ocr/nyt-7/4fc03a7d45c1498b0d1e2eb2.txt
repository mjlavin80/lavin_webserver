Tudor Jenks opens this new book in the Lives of Great Writers Series, which A. S. Barn 63 & Co. have in press for publication in the course of the Summer, with a description of the Puritan and the Cavalier during: the life of the blind poet. He writes of these -types of our American forefathers:	_
The Cavalier was fond of good food and of wine, and often drank to excess. He was used to a gay and idle. social life, and this gave opportunity for immorality. His reading was of the literature meant to appeal to tastes not over nice, and his habits were formed by these influences. The Puritan household was less lavish, and more conducive to temperance in eating; drinking, and dress. The extravagant habits of the Cavalier by ; very contrast led the Puritans to the other extreme. Instead of dazzling colors, j they chose the sober hues. In place of the lovelocks curling upon the shoulders and lace collar, the Puritans wore the modest linen collars or small ruffs, and clipped their hair more* nearly to the length now so universal among men. Jewelry was avoided, their speech was formed upon Scriptural models, and' their whole carriage was in accordance with their ideas of seemly simplicity. * * * Their reading was more given to theological discourses and treatises, and their talk was much upon the same endless subjects.
