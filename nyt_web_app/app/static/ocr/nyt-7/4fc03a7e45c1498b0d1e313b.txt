MR- SWINBURNE'S book of prose fiction, " Love’s Cross Currents/’ of which something has been said In	each of the	last	three	num-
bers of The Book Review, and which is now on all the book stalls, is, as we have intimated, merely a revamping of an old work. The Tatler (a name since revived again for a periodical by Clement Shorter) was a weekly published in London in 1877. E. Francillon, the	novelist, was	its	editor.	Mr.
Swinburne’s story appeared in this periodical, as a serial, from Aug. 25 to Dec. 29, inclusive. It was called “ A Tear’s Letters. By Mrs. Horace Manners." "It consisted,” says Dr. Robertson Nicoll, who remembers its serial publication, “ of thirty chapters, a lengthy	prologue, and	an	ironical	prefatory letter.” This describes " Love’s Cross	Cur-
rents '* exactly, except that the dedicatory letter to Mr. Theodore Watts-Dunion is not in the least ironical. There have been no fundamental changes in the book, though it has all been revised by the au^ thor. Curiosity will impel many to read it, but it will scarcely increase the fame of Mr. Swinburne's prose.
