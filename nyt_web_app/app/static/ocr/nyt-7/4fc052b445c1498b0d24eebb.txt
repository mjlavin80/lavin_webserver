This, writes Prof. Coring W, Ba vtcn Ir. his preface to " The Hebrew Prophet,’* is “true of Israel’s religion at its best; for the highest expression of religion In Israel Is found in the writings of the prophets.’* He continues:

*	Therefore God’s interest in man and in the world is broad indeed. _______________ The prophet was in a measure cognizant of that great truth. * * * prophet was a statesman, a i	9- Political economist, as well

Prof. Batten writes about the popular conception of the Hebrew prophet, tbe prophetic institution, the prophet's call, his credentials, writings, his relations to Church and State, and bis vision.
