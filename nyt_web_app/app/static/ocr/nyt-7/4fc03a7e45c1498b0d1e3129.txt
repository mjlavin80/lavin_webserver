Concerning H. W. Boynton's review of Dr. Brandes’s " Main Currents of Nineteenth Century Literature,’* permit me to say that, in Moore's poem, (a " doggerel ditty,” fn the estimation of Mr. Boynton,) " She ts far from the land where her young hero sleeps," &c.( the word ** she ** refers not to Ireland but to Sarah Curran, Robert Emmet’s betrothed, and daughter of the famous orator and advocate, John Philpot Curran. Permit me also to say that the poem classed as “ doggerel ” by your reviewer has hitherto been regarded by educated persons as genuine poetry, entirely worthy the genius of Thomas Moore.
WILLIAM B. CLARKE. New Yorlc, July 20, 1905.
