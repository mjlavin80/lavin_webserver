MILLIONS OF MISCHIEF. A Story of a Great Secret. By Headon Hill. 12nto. liluHlmted. Akron, Ohio:	The SaalfJelU
Publishing Company. $1.50.
This is the story of a plot to kill the Prime Minister of England, and in the working out of his story Mr. Headon Hill has Indulged in melodrama of the most pronounced character. There is nothing lacking, from the kidnapping of the beautiful heroine and her transportation on board the ship Nightshade, under the command of the wicked Capt. Belcher, to the fight on board this same vessel, shipwrecked in a storm, where the villain and the quasi- villain locked in deadly, embrace drop into the seething ocean.
The much-maligned hero was accused of the willful murder* of his mother and sister. He was condemned to death, and might have been hanged the day after the story opens but for the fact that Ijord Gideon Marske and two of his colleagues of the Cabinet required the assassination of the Prime Minister to fit in with certain plans they had in view. Since Arthur Rlvington was already accused on circumstantial evidence of two murders, why not Jet him be hanged for three? Therefore, with the aid of one Herzog of the Secret Service Corps, and for slight maladventure of his own in the power of Sir Gideon, Arthur Rivincrton was assisted
to escape from prison and set in a position to execute his third murder.
Seemingly acquiescent, Rivington employed the time permitted him for his third crime to track down the real murderer of his deceased relatives. There was one, the lovely Janet Chilmark, who believed implicitly in him. With her help —or, in fact, entirely through her quick wit and heroic efforts—since Rivington was under the strict surveillance of Herzog—things were cleared successfully, but not before, as Mr, Headon Hill well names his book, there was “ millions of mischief " to deal with.
There are any number of readers who will enjoy this kind of book.	.
