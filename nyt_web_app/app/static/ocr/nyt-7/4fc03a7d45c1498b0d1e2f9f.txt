“ Slie wrote from memory," declares Mr. IWEa.Uia.rn Deinbleby.
Talking? cow only or tbe penalties of literary fame, we are threatened with some fresh “ revelations ” about Charlotte BrontS. Some years ago Mr. J. Malham-Dembieby contributed to The London Saturday Review an article touching a 4* key " to “ Jane , Eyre/’ the need of which had not beep felt by a whole generation of athniring readers. This alleged “ key " was contained in a long-forgotten book by one Frederic Montagu called "Gleanings In Craven.” which Mr. Malham-Pembleby had unearthed, and which, he assumed. Miss Bront€ had read and inwardly digested. So the matter then rested in spite of the protest of many sensible persons who knew much of Charlotte , Bronte and her work. She was not an original genius, but a follower in the footsteps through the-fens of a forgotten Montagu. But Malham-Dembleby is not satisfied. There are on any things, after all, in Miss Bronte's book for which Montagu provides no key. Some letters of Charlotte, alas, were destroyed. The world has been permitted to believe that the Ha^ worth clergyman's daughter, gifted with creative genius, wrote movingly of things she had-not encountered in her own narrow experience. Malham-Dem-bleby now sends another fetter to The London Satur- * 'A. day Review. He knows a writer " who was' familiar llndeed with the very Intimate circumstances of* Charlotte' Bronte's Brussels experiences.” There Js a ~J*‘ sensational^. - book in the : air/, you . may be surel-
