WENDELL ABRO AD.
The Harvard Professor . Rebukes France for the Quality of Its Current Literature.
EOF. BARRETT WENDELL'S recent lectures at the Paris Sorbonne drew very considerable audiences, but the most interesting result of the international exchange of educational courtesies has come at the - % * ♦ -
close of his series of talks on American literature. Approached by a newspaper reporter, Mr. Wendell, after many ! compliments to the French genius, ventured to express his regret that modern French literature was less read in America i than, by reason of its style and subtlety, it should be. Its insistence on topics not | generally exploited in print in Anglo-Saxon countries was, he explained, the cause of this apparent lack of apprecia- i

tion- ** A great part of your literature of to-day,’' lo auotc the words of the interview, " touches subjects too crude for young girls. Now, it Is with us the cus- j tom to write books that can be read by everybody. It seems to us that what young girls can neither hear nor see should not be submitted to the public.” Further, Prof. Barrett Wendell quoted the remark of an American greatly interested in the spread of French literature, to the effect that RGjane’s recent tour, with its suggestive productions of the-most highly colored modern school, had counteracted twenty years’ good work in teaching America to admire and respect the French literary art. In short, a Paris journal sums up the situation with the remark: "In a polite way,. the eminent professor gives us to understand that as Impurity, unrestrained, is little by little replacing moral works in our literature, Americans are beginning to turn from it completely."
Allowing for the slight exaggeration of the remark that our English and American literary Ideal is altogtether that of lhe " Young Person,*’ Mr. Barrett Wendell states an undisputed fact, and the French literary set have been quick to* note his courteously expressed criticism. The universities have eagerly welcomed the Harvard professor who has so well carried out the American part of these " conferences internationales,” and his word carries great weight. It is interesting to note what the litterateurs of Paris feel on this point, how they take this moral " boycott ” of that art on which Franco has always prided herself.
Prof, Barrett Wendell has, as a matter of fact, merely given utterance to a criticism that is more and more often heard in France. The country where the home is of supreme importance, where, perhaps more than anywhere else, women are completely devoted to the interests of husband and children, is represented, in the literature of the hour, as tho land of the stupidly deluded and the altogether frivolous. The French critics of French literature are keenly alive to their position before the world. They sec the faults of the modern school of fiction as clearly as can Prof. Barrett Wendell or the Cer-cle Francaise of America. They welcome the American professor’s frank expression of his views, and are eager that their countrymen should profit by this and every other opportunity to see themselves as others see them.
The fight against what the French call the literature of the boulevards has baen, and still is, energetic and not without a fine flavor of quixotism. To speak clearly—to cry from the housetops—against the idols of the day is hardly what may be called a practical way of setting about the earning of one’s daily bread; but the French are the last nation td be accused of lacking the courage of their convictions. A band of writers—journalists, poets, essayists—has not hesitated to protest vigorously against the school of the boulevards and the eternal Parisienne, with all that follows in her train. The lovers, one. two, three; the dull husband,, tho attractive lady who, after sundry amorous episodes, remains admirably fresh and ready for new worlds to conquer; all the more or less subtle psychology— always in the same style and of the same situations—is beginning to weary Francc as it has apparently already wearied the rost of the world. It has beer, for several years past a matter of common knowledge not only from general observation but also from statistics that the world’s interest in French literature, other than serious works of research and criticism, was on the wane. Two years ago M. Jean Finot, writing in La Revue, said tliat French literature was undergoing a crisis; French books, he showed, were selling badly abroad, and this was no less than 4* a genuine social calamity."
M. Jean Carr^re took up the cudgels and said his say boldly.
M. Carr&rc and those who agree with him in his fight against certain evil tendencies in the national literature feel that the French' books of the moment give themselves up far too exclusively to things
purely (or impurely!) Parisian'. It is a J matter of Parisian mahners.of Parisian society, of details peculiar to the capital, of situations that could not elsewhere ex- ~ 1st. The literature of the boulevard Is ’ bounded by the walls of Paris. SalcT a German wit: " A Frenchman is a deco-xated gentleman-- wha knows no geog- | raphy*" and this, , say the French critics . of the French is only too true. • *' :
They give their reasons for this state of -affairs. Paris, they contend, is given over to the " arrivist ” who is the French cousin of the American " climber,” with this difference, that his goal is not an entrance to " society/’ but literary glory, a ribbon in jhla, buttonhole, and a seat in some more or less learned, more or less distinguished,' society of the similarly decorated. " Never,** says a well-known critic, ** has there been such narrowness in the French spirit as to-day.
We shrink into ourselves with a kind of ostrich timidity; you might say that we were frightened at the larger movements of humanity beyond our frontiers and that, not wishing to take part in them, we let ourselves grow dizzy with the noise of this cannon called Francc and especially of this village called Paris,”
What, was asked, did the critic hold as the origin of all this narrowness, this essentially provincial spirit so deprecated by the more intelligent men of letters?
"It fs hardly the fault of the poor men of^wit who originated the school. They did not realize what they did and only painted their generation as they saw it. There is a proverb thalt a people has always the government that it de-| serves; similarly it has the literature of which it is worthy. It is not pleasant to have to admit that France has deserved the writers of the boulevards. For half a century they have been blunting our hearts and dulling our consciences with lhe tricks of skepticism. They created '.n ' us this frivolous, fickle spirit that makes j us keep spinning about in the centre of the world, while we think that the world is revolving .around us. They invented a , Paris shining with artificial fire and i dazzled our eyes by that pretense of light. They have replaced the robust gayety of France by ‘ Parisian irony.’ Instead of a brilliant band, small, but for all that influencing the world by its work, we 1 have a crowd of idlers that people come to see for their antics!
" It Is hardly surprising that the rest of the world is not interested in the chronicling of our particularly * small beer.’ Even our best writers do not seem to realize that a work of art must be, before everything, a complete creation, bearing in itself the gift of life, a work in which the author’s thought springs from the intensity, the struggle of life, as hcai springs from movement. Carried away by the pleasure of treating questions of immediate interest, they are a little too ready to make themselves the servants of the public’s curiosity, and they keep hastily tossing books into the midst of the hurry of life, regardless of their future fate*
*’ Some of them take a medical problem and dress it up in a vaguely romantic story; others write polemics similarly disguised, on the army and the Church; then, still in a great hurry—110 time lo be lost!—they give the world trilogies to dc-fend a political party, the name and spirit of which change with the seasons, or volumes on the rights of woman or the truly palpitating question, ‘ At what age should a man marry? ’ All these modern books, even when well written, have this fatal defect, they cannot get away from the narrow interests of their country and their day. Future generations simply will not be able to understand them.
" The criticisms in America on Rejane’s _ tour have interested ug all. In the theatre there is the same trouble as in literature, with this added evil, (not, however, peculiar to France,) that managers persist in making a vulgar business of a great art. But with us this is an even more serious trouble than elsewhere.
The drama has always been one of the greatest glories or the French genius, one of the most powerful means of spreading our ideas among other peoples. We have what no other nation can boast, four subsidized theatres. Nowhere else is dramatic art so appreciated, so Joved, and as a natural consequence, nowhere does it need such careful criticism, such unsparing condemnation when it is bad.	J
“ You think me pessimistic. I am not j at heart. I have a tremendous faith in the fundamental sanity and in the recuperative power of the French people. The blight of boulevardism cannot kill so real, so vital a thing as the French genius. The reaction is already beginning. We do not want to lose our ancient glory. The passing of time has already destroyed most of the old haunts of the boulevardicrs; this is the symbol, we hope, of the passing of their dominion over the national spirit. Clever, sane men are beginning to find an appreciative audience even in Paris! They are considered a little unpolished, of course, but they are not called stupid. Happy omen! ln fact some writers have even mentioned the existence of neighboring nations. A great step in ad van ", I assure you! They have even told Paris that these nations were posse; sed of an art—a literature.
