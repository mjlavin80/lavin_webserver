ton schoolgirl, printed in The New Tore "Times last Monday, has formed scarcely less of a topic than his admirable. short story in The Century. It Is refreshing to know that an author'who has been made the subject of a worldwide chorus of more or less sophist!-cated and often purely perfunctory praise, is still susceptible to the artless and unqualified admiration of youth. Perhaps the most interesting part of his letter is pie postscript, which we here reproduce:	'
Have you. read Mrs. Ewing’s books. “Six to Sixteen”? If not, get them, because you will love them.	.
This'is excellent advice. Perhaps Mrs. Ewing’s books are not read by the children as much as they used to be. She was Juliana Horatia Gatty, and was the daughter of a Yorkshire clergyman. Both her father and her mother were writers, and her own story-telling gift was early developed. She was born In 1841 and died in 1885. Her husband was Major Alexander Ewing of the pay department of the British Army, and with him she settled in the Province of New Brunswick. She was long regarded as one of England's best writers for children. The list of her works in Allibone’s Dictionary of Authors comprises thirty-three titles. “Six to Sixteen/' recommended to Miss Nannie Peck by Mr. Kipling, was published by Roberts Brothers, in Boston, in 1875. This book for girls had been preceded by “ We and the World,” a book for boys. Neither of these, however, was her *' best seller.” ” Jackanapes " (1883) had that distinction, as 34,000 copies of_ that book were sold within a year of its publication. The London Academy said of it that it “ recalled Thackeray in tbe purity of its pathos.” Most o£ her books were col- . lections of short tales. Her poems of child life were much admired. Doubtless Mr. Kipling1 s letter will cause a revival of interest in Mrs. Ewing’s stories.
WRITER in The Independent is sure that “ a modern man cannot stand it to live in- the woods for a month without a book.” Of course, this is a touch of hyperbole. There are plenty of men of unquestionable modernity who could “ stand it ” to live in i the woods, or anywhere else, for a year j without a book. But the remark is true : enough of many men. The Independent writer holds to only one book for his vacation—one to carry and to use when ! the conditions are right for reading. John Burroughs’s '* Far and Near “ is his present choice. The idea has its j fascinations. The thing is worth try! ing. But we may not all care for Burroughs or Thoreau, and the influence of the woods themselves might be too strong for Walpole or Sir Thomas Browne or Marcus Aurelius. Most novels seem out of the question. There are men who can read their Horace anywhere, in any season. The question is a large one. If you were to be in the wilderness a whole month with only one book, what book would you choose?
READING “ Robinson Crusoe ” again, with an eye chiefly to the adventures of its hero after his release from his island, {the part of the book we all used to neglect, while we read the island chapters till we knew them almost by heart,) Mr. de Kay has found material for an excellent and timely article which we print this week. Defoe's comprehension of things beyond his vision was one of his extraordinary traits. He could not have dd-| rived his knowledge of the Muscovite, the Tartar, the Chinaman, and the “ Japonian ” from books. He had a way of absorbing the talk of people he met which enabled him to make nol
only “ Robinson Crusoe-” but his-story of the Great Plague ana others as well ; perpetually real and vital. His * * world politics V show him4n the light of a fair prophet, with -his prophecies a little ; awry because of the lapse ot time.
THE writer ot The. Point of View in the August Scribner's raises the . alarming. cry that a critic should be a biographer. Critics, he believes, must not confound the author of “ Axj Amazing Marriage ” with the author of '“Beauchamp's Career” or the author of “The Golden Bowl” with the author of “ Watch and Ward.?’ They must be awarei in short, of the changes, physical and psychical, intellectual and mpr&l, in the human entitles of which they write. The critic must be endowed with a strong enough sense of responsibility never to “ mutilate the inpage of a creative mind for his readers.” This * would, indeed, be putting the game of criticism beyond the reach of the many. When the time comes that no reviewer may write in amazement that “An Amazing Marriage ** was penned by the hand that penned a masterwork like “The Ordeal o£ Richard Feveril” we are afraid there will be comparatively little reviewing. If there Is to be a complete biographical background, either expressed or suggested, in every I critical article on a book we fancy that criticism will grow more tedious than it ; is reputed to be now. However, the heart of* the Point of View writer is in the right place, even though the reader of a review of a novel wants to learn from it the exact, positive .worth of that ! novel, rather than Its relation to it3 author's mental, spiritual, and bodily development.	.	_	(
EACH new batch of the little volumes of the Biographical Edition of Robert I^ouis Stevenson’s | works, as it comes from the Scribner j presses, is sure of a cordial welcome. Mrs. Stevenson’s “ intimate ” introduc- j tions are always Interesting, though it is noticeable that she has none for " Virginibus Puerisque,” which begins with some highly sarcastic remarks on j marriage. With these essays on the re- ! lations of men and women are bound, in the handy little volume now at hand, a selection of other papers on miscellaneous subjects, but all as fresh and | readable as when they were written.
** The Dynamiter,” that extravagant caricature of sensational fiction, which nevertheless contains a few of Steven- j son’s deftest touches, Is another new volume. Mrs. Stevenson tells how it originated, in stories invented while he was ill at the Hyfcres chiUet. Other new volumes are “ The Black Arrow ” and “ Travels with a Donkey."
AUTHORS are not proverbially as generous as actors, but they have as a body, doubtless, the manifold traits of humanity, and have hearts alive to the woes of their fellow-men in their private lives as well as in their books. The ladles who are members of the Quarter Club of Baltimore, an auxiliary of the Tuberculosis Commission of Maryland, have an earnest of the generosity authors are capable of. Many English and American writers have put their autographs on the fly leaves of books written by them which are to be sold at auction in Baltimore on the 28th and 20th of next November. The Quarter Club already has received more than $4,000 in subscriptions for the charitable work in which it is engaged, and is* striving to raise the sum to $25,000. Tbe President of the club is Mrs. Knox Taylor of Plainfield, N. J., and the Treasurer is Miss E. T. Reeves, 02G North Charles Street, Baltimore. Either will receive advance bids for signed books by the following authors:
