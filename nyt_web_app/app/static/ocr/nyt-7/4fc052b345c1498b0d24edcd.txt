JOHN HAY
MONG tlie various tributes that have been paid to John Hay naturally one was to his quality as " literary man,” both as poet and as “ prosateur,” to borrow from the French a locution which it is to the discredit oC our language that It does not supply. Those who knew John Hay, and the far greater number of his compatriots who had not that advantage, have been stimu-. lated by his death to do what they had neglected to do during his life, insomuch that his publishers report, in answer to inquiries, that his books are " sold out*”
That fact is nothing, critically speaking, It denotes merely a momentary curiosity, excited by the eminence of the author in quite other than literary fields. But when one undertakes to investigate and report upon John Hay's strictly literary claims, in prose or in verse, he is at once held to a different and stricter standard.
As a matter of fact, and as a conscientious literary critic, one has to coincide here with a leading article in one of the New York newspapers, when John Hay’s death was first announced. The works are, in truth, so many manifestations of the “ amateur .spirit,” to which the newspaper in question was so wildly wrong in attributing the success of the late Secretary of State " ln his vocation.” Literature, ln prose or in verse, was his avocation. Looking through the “ Poems" and the M Castilian Days ’’ with the sincerest wish to find enkindling sparks of genius, one is compelled to fall back upon the *' Pike County Ballads *’ of the author’s youth. There is a “ human document.’* There, more specifically, is an American document. The author ©f Little Breeches ’* and " Jim Bludsoe " had “ sized up ” his countrymen, had sized them up as accurately as, in tbe next generation, Mr. Owen Wfcter sized them up in ** The Virginian.”
John Hay was a journalist. He was more than a merely good journalist. To repeat Bagehot’s remark about the Lord Chancellor who must have beard a million speeches, and who laid it down that one of Macaulay's was the best he ever heard, we may adduce the judgment of Horace Greeley, who must have read a million " editorials,” that one of John Hay’s was the best he ever read. But the very facility that makes a happy writer of leading articles on the topics of the moment in so far disables a man from competing for the approval of “ time and of the world.” Strictly speaking, the poetry, outside of the dialect ballads, is not much. The very best of it is " The Stirrup Cup,** which just now derives a personal and pathetic interest from the death of the author. Nobody could be freer from illusions about his own work than
■
John Hay. When once he introduced a friend to his daughter, saying, “ She is . a better poet than I am,’’ the remark ! was not merely modest, but had a crit-
i	ical value, as is evinced by the pages which Mr. Chilton Collins has kindly dev'otetf* to American poetry.
But in prose—that is another matter. *' Castilian I>ays ’* is a piece of prose. Striking, suggestive, illuminating, those sketches are. But they are the essays
of an amateur, of a journalist* of a publicist, rather than of a man-who is primarily interested in his own com-
*	position. Mr, Hay’s long and almost lifelpng' friend, Clarence "King, in that wonderful fragment, " The Helmet of Mambriho,” touched heights of prose writing which so thoroughly ah honest man as John Hay would be the first to own that he himself had not attained. But nothing is ever lost. We need not emphasize too much the workmanship of Mr. Hay’s part of the ** Life of Lincoln." Workmanlike It is, and workmanlike. rather than artistic, is the adjective we naturally apply to it. But those official orations which he deliv-: ered in England during his mission, there, notably that on Sir Walter Scott, and most of all/KTs-funeral'oration over the boay of President McKinley, these are great addresses. These give the reaf measure of John Hay’s power of writing prose. The scholar I iness, the culture, in these is a by-product. What the orator is really after is to enforce j a political truth, in the case of Scott the " solidarity ” of the English-speaking peoples, in the case of McKinley the emergence of the United States from their historical isolation. As we
say, all the rhetorical and scholarly
0
\ adornments of these addresses are incidental. They are mere by-play. But whoever wishes for a measure of the literary quality of John Hay may be confidently recommended to betake himself to these addresses and may be confidently assured that he will not be disappointed. He will be certain that' the late Sec»etary of State of the United. States was, on an occasion that suited him and filled his own conception of a great opportunity and that called out his powers, a master of English speech.
