A characteristically concise volurno from tho pen of that eminent Oxford don. Dr. Percy Gardner, nmy Ik* considered with a new edition of Lucy M. Mitchell’s “ History of Ancient Sculpture,” if for no other reason than that the authors treat of different phases of the same general subject. While Mrs. Mitchell treats of the ancient sculpture of the world, from Kgyptian through Chaldean, Assyrian. Persian, to Greek and Roman, according to a distinctly historical method, Dr. Gardner confines himself to Greek art and the rules which its development has fixed in architecture, sculpture, painting^ and in the ceramic anti medalist's .arts—by themselves and in their relation to the literature of their time.
About the time that Prof. Charles Eliot Norton was writing his introduction to a revised edition of Dr. Franz von Rebei-s "History of Ancient Art.” the author of " A History of Ancient Sculpture ’* was putting the finishing touches to her two-volume work. That was nearly twenty-five years ago, and what Prof. Norton wrote then about the necessity of revising Reber’s book—then only ten years old —on account of the progress of discovery during the last decade, is still more significant to-day. Owing to recent discoveries in the Nile Valley, and particularly in Mesopotamia, much of the hitherto written history of ancient art will have to be recast, especially in the department of architecture. Thus, while the Reber . of 1882 is practically out of date, the Mitchell of 1883, dealing, as it does, entirely with sculpture, is not by any means as obsolete as its German contemporary. The chief points of interest in the new edition are its publication in one instead of two volumes and its greatly reduced price.
1 For the benefit of those who are unfamiliar with “ A History of Ancient Sculpture " it seems proper to state here that, while Mrs. Mitchell follows along
the general lines pursued by Reber, (that is to say, each period of expression has its historical introduction with descriptions of those human activities which made its art what it was,) the sculptors themselves and tlicir work receive much more biographical and critical attention than the eminent German devotes to them, and this attention is- heavily weighted with pertinent extracts from • ancient authors as well as with the most authoritative judgments of modern connoisseurs. For the price at which it is now published we know of no work which may successfully rival Iaicy M. Mitchell’s “ History of Ancient Sculpture."
Such a handbook as Dr. Gardner's has lu'en badly needed, fpr it offers an intelli-g.inL and practically unerring method for the judgment of the art of Hellas. He has built up his " Grammar ** by means of tlie existing fragments fiorn descriptions of originals and by contemporary writers, an 1 he is certainly justified to introduce corollaries of his own where propositions fail him The structure being completed, he assigns cach work of art its proper nicii?. The danger, of course, is that the reader may attempt to apply his method to Inc art of a country which is still productive, and thereby call upon Gardner to confiim the school of scientific criticism in alt its mathematical tediousness. It shcuid be remembered, however, that the art of Greece is finished and that nothing can alter the dramatical rules deducted from her monuments. To them scientific criticism may be unerringly applied, but not to the art of a country which is in an age of eager development and production; and, as far as Greece is concerned, there is nothing to prevent other critics taking up the subject according to the scholastic and Impressionistic points of view, and from the foundation of exact conception as laid down by Dr. Gardner.
