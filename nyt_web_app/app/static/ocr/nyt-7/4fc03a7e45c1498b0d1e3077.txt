ED WIKI DROOD
A New Book Containing Clues to the “ Mystery ** of Dickens’s Unfinished Story.
CUMING WALTERS is the author of " Clues to Dickens’s Mystery of Edwin Drood,'* just published in London. Six numbers of this novel appeared between April and September. 1870. Dickens died in June of that year. The sales of this novel, as far as the monthly numbers went, far outstripped those of any of its predecessors. Naturally the curiosity of readers of Dickens about the story has been frequently manifested. So-called ** sequels ’* to Dickens's work have been eagerly bought. Yet many good judges have assumed, from the quality of those chapters the master novelist had finished before his death, that " The Mystery of Edwin Drood ” would never have equaled in merit the best of his earlier works* George Gissing, a close and sympathetic student of Dickens, believed that the mystery would have turned out to be ** paltry.** A recent writer in The London Chronicle takes the opposite view. He says:
The story, of course, is not in Dickens’s most characteristic vein. During the last years of his life his association and occa- j sional collaboration with Wilkie Collins. 1 in the service of " All the Year Round; ; drew Dickens aside from his familiar i method of. leisurely narrative, and concen- ! trated him upon the novel of mystery and , incident. No doubt his public readings tended in the same direction; his whole cast of mind and habit became more dramatic, more vividly theatrical in grasp. !
The influence may be seen at work in I " Great Expectations ”; it permeated the riverside scenes of “ Our Mutual Friend **; it is the very essence of '* Edwin Drood.” Certain conservative Dickensians, especially those who are blind admirers of "Pickwick," are disposed to deprecate change in their favorite's methods, but they are almost certainly wrong. The j misfortune was that Dickens died before I he had had time to complete the union i of the two styles. In "Great Expects.-ttons” there 'are several loose threads which he had not been at' the pains to take up; '* Our Mutual intend" holds i .the two methods in solution; it almost looks as though " Edwin Drood ” would I have been the first story in which Dickens’s peculiar gift for eccentric life and character was to unite w$tb a fine constructive power of which' he had hitherto given little direct evidence.'	1
The fragment is full of typical Dickens figures; it is also radically unlike the rest of his work in the intense interest of the plot,. taken merely for its own sake. Had that plot been worked out on a scale commensurate with its unfolding, we incline to believe that " Edwin Drood ” would have been one of the most popular of all its author’s works. Everything of course depends upon the development to which It would have been sud-; Jected.
The -same writer says of the new book ^ of *' Clues,” mentioned above:
There have been various attempts to ^ork out the story, some ingenious, some .impertinent. We are familiar with most of them, and have no hesitation in saying that Mr. Cuming Walters’s interpretation, contained in the modest volume before us, is by far the most closely reasoned, the most reasonable, and the most satisfying that has yet been given to the public. Its publication must indeed* be regarded as a landmark in the history of Dickens literature: Most of the interpretations of the mystery have, carded with them their own . criticism of-the story which they seek _ to. complete; they .nave been so obVious that they leave "Edwin Drood” •with the prospect of having'grown into a very ordinary melodrama, -	.	_
Now Dickens was no mean critic of his own novels-, and he believed thoroughly In • .** Edwin Drood.” .I have a very curious \ and; new idea,*' he. said: - ** not a communicable one, though difficult to work;" He very seldom expressed himself with so much confidence in his own work without that confidence being justified in the performance. Mr. Cuming Walters's solution of the V .Mystery-’ is the first w6 have ever seen to suggest the justice of Dickens's ' own enthusiasm^ It presents the scheme of an engrossing story, and presents it as the result of most intimate and searching analysis. .	*	.
We shall not'divulge Mr. Walters's the- ; ory, partly because; to do so requires more space than we have at our disposal, but : more particularly; because a brief account ; of it would do Injustice to the ingenuity and intricacy with, which it is propound*, i ed. . It is sufficient to say that the three : questions—(1).Was-Drood-dead?* (2) Who i was Datchery7 (3) .Who was th.e Opium woman? are searchingly investigated, • with the .result; In the case of Datchery, of- a .most surprising and novel- theory, ; which, after.testing it from every point of view, we are inclined to pronounce im- j pregnable. :	'	»•	'!
A good* $eal of Mr. .Walters's persuasive- , nesa may be due to. the keen and critical ! arrangement ’of his arguments; but at i present we are certainly convinced' that I be. has- at-last succeeded in clearing up ! ^one of the most fascinating enigmas in I modern literature. - Upon the skfiT and 1 tact with which- he has 'fulfilled his task we desire heartily- to congratulate him. His;theories will very possibly provoke
•	controversy, and there . are- details :inr which they may, perhaps, , yield to criti- i clsnr. But. it is. safe to-say that hence- ! forth, whenever “ .The Mystery of .Edwin Drood #* is discussed;'the first solution, to \ be considered; and (we believe) the last 1 .' to be relinquished; will be that which Mr. .1 Cuming Walters has so elaborately set ! forth in this unpretentious but highly sug- j gestive little volume.
