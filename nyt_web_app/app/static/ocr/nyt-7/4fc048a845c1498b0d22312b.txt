THE. UKIYO-YL ARTISTS.
Dora Amsden’s Study of Japanese Col* or Prints Before and After Hokusai.*
Written for The New York Times book Review by CHARLES DE KAY.
LMOST all Japanese woodcuts printed in colors from a single block in the method of the “ monotype," or else from as many similar blocks as there are colors in the picture, after the old-fashioned method of the colored lithograph— those prints namely which are best known in America and Europe—belong to the popular and democratic section of the art of Nippon. They depict secular subjects much oftener than religious and they represent a vulgar art disdained by native scholars and classicists. By as much as they differ from the traditional subjects and methods handed down from the masters in China, by so .much are they regarded askance by the literati of Japan. Or shall we say were regarded? for Japan is changing so much in many ways that It is hazardous to apply to the present what was true a couple of decades ago.
Ukiyo-ye is the actual world about us, or, when compared with the stable world of meditation, the " floating '* universe of change that mocks us as the only stable thing. In a country like Japan, where the art instinct has expended itself upon a thousand useful objects, the art of Uklyo-ye is riot confined to color-prints; but these at any rate are the most viable and conspicuous forms which it has taken. So the little volume Miss Amsden has so daintily prepared deals exclusively with prints.
Impressionism in Europe and America has run a great and on the whole a very instructive course* and since its Oriental root may be traced to Japanese prints, the appearance of a monograph on this one department of Ukiyo-ye is timely. We get a brief notice of Japanese art prior to the rise of the popular school, when pictures of gods and saints. Princes and heroes were the only objects, that pleased noble patrons. Singularly enough, the first stirring of the kind of picture which can be called pre-impressionistic occurs in Japan about the same time that a similar phenomenon can be traced in Europe. Ukiyo-ye has been tracked back to the sixteenth century, but in Europe it is that century which saw the beginnings of impressionist painting and also of that popular painting of the life of men and women in public which flourished exceedingly in the seventeenth. The Greek Theotocop-ulos opened the ball In Spain with his impressionistic portraits and religious pictures, followed by Velasquez and the great Flemish and Dutch painters, some impressionistic and popular as well, but others merely popular, and as to method preserving the old lines. The parallel will be closer if one considers the European wood engravers of the sixteenth and etchers of the seventeenth centuries in their resemblances and contrasts with the designers of prints in Japan.
Just now, that the Japanese have Imposed themselves upon the world by the exercise of the only argument capable of appealing to Europe, namely* military and naval success, their oUtflhs to art and literary eminence were never so secure. It Is amusing to note the supercilious tone of as good a lover of Japan' as Mr. Basil Hall Chamberlain when, In “Things Japanese/* (1890,) he deals with the native art.. There was need of a more sensitive nature, such as Lafcadio Hearn possessed, to divest itself of prejudice and- sympathize with the Japanese mind by dint of living a Japanese life. Miss Amsden has good-wlii and certainly is far removed from the ordinary denseness which fails to understand an alien point of view; yet it can scarcely be said thatshe offers a new departure in the estimate of Japanese? art. Very modestly she says:

breviations of figures combined and recombined, it was natural that writing arid drawing should be closely .united, and all the mofe so, because the same implement, a brush, was used for both. Japan received from China* the subjects and methods of drawing, just as she received her writing, but in the latter she made more changes than ia the former. So that until the popular art arose she was always going to school to Chinese masters. As always occurs, the aristocrats who gave the tone were fanatically devoted to the traditional and exotic, fanatically opposed to the development of popular art. The academy founded by Motomitsu in the eleventh century ‘‘led up to the celebrated school of Tosa, which with Kano, its august and aristocratic rival, held undisputed supremacy for centuries, until challenged by plebeian TJki-yo-ye, the school of the common people of Japan,” Tosa centred aboi:t the Court of the Mikado at Kyoto,
The ceremonial of the court, its ffctes and religious solemnities—dances attended by daimios in robes of state failing in harmonious folds—were depicted with consummate elegance and delicacy of touch which betrayed familiarity with the occult methods of Persian miniature painting.
Tosa was combated in the fourteenth century by Kano, a school starting with Josetsu, a Buddhist priest from China. To this day it continues to be the stronghold of classicism, “ which in Japan signifies principally adherence to Chinese methods, a traditional technique, and avoidance of subjects which represent everyday life." Gradually Kano became the school of the Shoguns, as these major-domos placed the Mikados on the shelf and absorbed the government ' of the country. Politics expressed itself in art at that period, as it still does to-day ln Germany, for instance, where the academic school belongs to the imperial Government and the Secession is in opposition.

Although its beginnings lie so far back, the popular school of Ukiyo-ye devoted to the ** floating world ” did not come to full blossom until the beginning of the last century, when Hokusai lived. He is so important an exponent of the school that this little volume might as well have been called the Book of Hokusai, for he is the centre to which all past art leads up and from which modern art flows. In one of the prefaces to his published works Hokusai, who died in 1849, gives us this sketch of himself:
From the age of six I had a mania for drawing the forms of things. By the time I was fifty I had published an infinity of designs; but all I have produced before the age of seventy is not worth taking into account. At seventy-five I learned a little about the real structure of nature—of animals, plants and trees, birds, fishes, and insects. In consequence, when I am eighty I shall have made still more progress. At ninety I shall penetrate the mystery of things: at a hundred I shall certainly have reached a marvelous stage, and when I am a hundred and ten everything I do—be it but a Iin& or dot—will be alive. I beg those who live as long as I to see if I do not keep my word. Written at the age of seventy-five *by me—once Hokusai—to-day Gwakio-Rojtn, " the old man crazy about drawing.”
Though Hokusai did not usually engrave his own drawings, he passed four years as an engraver and could direct those who popularized his work. He composed the Mangwa, a volume for artisans, in which he gave examples for architects, landscape and flower painters, carver" of inros and net-schukes, modelers of ivory and tortoise shell. Of a tempest at sea found in this manual for the artist and artisan an admirer has said:
Man becomes a mere insect, crouching in’ his frail catamaran, as the giant billow topples and shakes far above him. The convention of black lines with which Hokusai represents falling rain is as effectual as his conventions for water are fanciful. The storm of Rembrandt, of Rubens, or of Turner is often terrible, but never really wet. Constable gets the effect of wetness, but his storms are not terrible. Hokusai knows how a gale lashes water into foam and bows the tree before it; how the gusts blow the people hither and thither, how sheets of drenching rain half veil a landscape, how the great white cone of his beloved Fuji gleams through a steady downpour!
Innumerable as his pictures are, there | is every reason to believe that more ; have disappeared tha.n those which are j known.	I

the shade of color and the manual touch of the printer as he manipulated the pressure. One recalls Whistler " snooping ” in old shops in Holland for reams of paper long forgotten by the shopman but made originally of sterling stuff by hand and tinted by age. One thinks of the hours he passed printing his delicate lithographs and etchings and perceives that even on the mechanical side he followed Japanese forerunners.
To the connoisseur one of the most important considerations, scarcely secondary to that of coloring, is this vibratory quality depending equally upon the texture of the paper and the magnetic pressure of the master printer’s fingers. This characteristic seems to have vanished from the modern print and cannot be imitated, though the enthusiasm for fine specimens has flooded the market with spurious antiques, deceptive to the uninitiated. * * * The coloring matter laid upon these ear!v blocks was extracted by myste-riuus processes from sources unknown to the modern world, which, alas! by supplying the Eastern market with cheap pigments led to the deterioration of art in this essential particular,

Just as the rugs of Asia have suffered from poor dyes imported from
Europe, the color-prints of Japan have lost their fine edge. Fortunately a school has been established in Japan which sets its face against these inroads, and perhaps the result of Japan’s success in driving back the most dangerous and grasping of the European robber nations will be a general movement toward the old methods in art and a return to the materials which helped Japanese masters to produce objects of industrial art finer than anything of the kind, even in the mother country China,	CHARLES	jde	KAY.
