Who Is No Pessimist.
HE saddest and most discour-' aging feature of current lit-' erature is not the lack of fine .examples, but the pessimistic critic’s failure to give them recognition. Only the strik- j Ing example compels his praise, w&le those many which quietly give satlsfao-^J tion of the highest order escape his no- ! tlce. Thus unwittingly, he strengthens the j
cause of the PhlUs-A Veteran tines, flatteringly con-Observer ceding to them the en- , tire field, which, to the ] contrary, is really held j by a constantly emerging host whose ban- j ner and watchword have eluded, his discernment because he is vainly looking for types that have disappeared—for a Poe or a Dickens or a Hawthorne. * * * Hawthorne is the one really great prose author of the earlier period whose originality of
pcnius seems to defy comparison. That
our fiction is not like that of Poe or Crockden Brown or Cooper is surely not to its discredit. For ourselves we prefer Mrs. Deland's, Mrs. vvuklns-Freeman’s,
Mrs. Wharton's, or that of any one of half a dozen contemporary American women we might mention, to say nothing of James, Howells, and Mark Twain.
If the multitude of readers are reactionary, so also are the majority of writers who especially appeal to the multitude. Thus enti*ely separate from the lasLing literature of me present is that larger, noisier, and more showy world of literature which in a brief time goes to pieces, and which in no way marks an advancing stage of evolution nor Is related to the continuous current of human culture. It coexists with democracy, whose . merely superficial aspects it may represent. *	*	*
In fiction generally, and notably in American fiction, the trend seems to. be away from the portrayal of conventional society and of institutional life in even its larger meanings. Few writers excel in that field to-day, as Mrs. Humphry Ward does, and even she In the creation of her recent heroines. Julie Le Breton and Lady Kitty, runs far away from the conventional type- The most difficult of all classes of stories to secure for magazine use is that successfully portraying urban life. Of the so-called society stories which are written nearly all are shallow \ and meaningless, the bright exception | only proving the rule.—Henry M.

Exactly two years ago Dr. Weir Mitchell made public the fact that he was engaged in the study of what he then called “ Cat Fear "—that curious feeling of repulsion which many persons experience at the sight or even at the unseen presence of a cat. We felt a good deal of interest in this matter not because we are personally troubled by cat fear, but because the thing Itself is xrery interesting and because we had some theories of our own upon the subject. Likewise we thought it a pity that this odd neurotic obsession should lack a scientific name. Therefore, in The Bookman for June, 1903, we coined the word “ Aelurophobia," and suggested it as an adequate term for cat fear. Dr. Mitchell has now published In a medical journal the results of his researches on this topic, and we observe that he has adopted the name Aelurophobia. He has not, however, given us any credit for It, as we think he should have done. We are rather pleased with tbat particular word. We never coined but two words. This is one of them, and the other is the adjective “ hyoeephalous." which is a euphemism that comes in very conveniently when talking about Englishmen. We just note this little circumstance as a matter of record, ivnd desire it to be considered a mild protest.—The Bookman, New York.
The Summer number of Country	Life contains
a hitherto unpublished poem by	Robert Browning, the	first fourteen
lines of which, with the title, 11 A Forest Thought,"	and	the poet’s	signature, with
the date	“ Nov.	4, 1837."	are reproduced
in fac simfle. It Is often said that Browning worked very hard upon his manuscripts, altering and correcting, polishing

perhaps sometimes, but more often,' unfortunately, plunging deeper Into‘obscur-■
ity in the effort to get the whole of Ms thought Into his lines. There is no! trace of such effort and elaboration here. Browning, it appears from t'ic note prefixed to the poem, had been with some > triends to the christening of their son.
: On his return from the church to the : house .he went into a room by himself, and after a very short absence returned with the poem, fifty-two lines in ajlj complete. The fac simile shows not a single correction. The fourteen .lines are as unblotted. as Shakespeare's.
And there is no occasion to wish It otherwise. The poet was seized with a simple thought, and simple and beautiful, expression seems to have come to him without pause or difficulty. He is here the poet of “ Oh, to be in England! ” not of *• Bordello " or the “ Parleyings." He likens human birth and growth to that of the fir trees " in far Esthonian solitudes." The parent trees grow up and lose their youthful beauty:
But just when beauty passes away And you half regret it could not stay.
For ail their sap and vigorous life—
Under the shade, secured from strife,
A seedling springs—the forest-tree In miniature, and again we see The delicate leaves that will fade one day, The fanlike shoots that will drop away, The taper stem a breath could strain— Which shall one day foil the hurricane:
We turn from this infant of the copse To the parent firs—in their waving tops To find some trace of the light-green tuft A breath could stir—In the bole aloft Columnlike set against the sky,
The spire that flourished airily And the marten bent as she rustled by.
Jrvnc Welsh Carlyle would have no need
to ask in this case, as she did in that of '* Sordello," whether the subject of the poem was a man. a city, or a book. Browning's reputation would gain If some one would find more unprinted poems like this and lose a good many of the printed ones.—London Academy.

Fridtjof Nansen— to be sure, he has been a man of action as well as a writer—seem hard at work turning out page after page on the situation they have done a good deal to create. The same phenomenon was to be noticed in 1793, when the writers proved themselves even worse guides than the orators. Inasmuch as they had the courage of their opinions, which orators, as a rule, have not. Meanwhile they might do worse than read again the correspondence of their countryman Ibsen. His phrase about the few members of the Storthing who will turn out In arms when the Russians march through Lapland to the attack of their fatherland can be especially commended to their study.— Pall Mall Gazette.
Mr. Shaw’s connec-Shakespeare la tj0n with the stage
Really	as a writer of plays

may condone In some
degree his irreverent opinions as to the
art and character of Shakespeare. As
somebody in Dickens remarks with just heat, ** It's low—that's wot it is—it's low *’ —and we know that the membeis of Mr. Vincent Crummies’s company were In the familiar habit of referring to the great poet as Bill ”! Mr. G. B. Shaw's remarks are of a piece with this greenroom vulgarity: they are " low,” but, we must repeat, there is a good deal of truth In them. Shakespeare Is the great English fetich to the mass of people, a monument as respectable, as meaningless, and as ossified as Stonehenge. Deny It, diminish It, explain it how we may, there Is no longer a spontaneous, natural ue-mand for his plays on the stage, and the revivals we see from time to time are merely a compliment to outworn tradition.
Worse even than this, he is not being read, save by the professed student, and the statistics on this subject are not to be relied upon—all the English-speaking world is in collusion to hide the truth, all the universities and colleges keep up the grave mummery that deceives only the simple minded. The terrible but wholesome fact Is that Shakespeare is fast becoming hopelessly antiquated like his contemporaries, Ben Jonson, Greene, Beaumont, and Fletcher and the rest of the Elizabethans. The world has grown tired of revolving around Bill. It is preparing to try its own axis for a while.— Michael Monahan in The Papyrus.

Literary Associations of Oar Embassy In London.
The departure of Mr. Choate and the arrival of Mr. Whlte-law Reid give Mr.
F.	S. A. Lowndes opportunity for a pleasant essay in The Fortnightly Review on “ The Literary Associations of the American Embassy In London.’* It is rather curious, when one comes to think about it that the United States should have sent us a much larger
number of lettered envoys than France, Germany, Italy, or Spain. But so It is. The countries of Dante, Goethe, Voltaire, and Cervantes find their representatives “ at the Court of St. James’s " in busy politlicans, adroit diplomatists, or titled grandees: the Republic provides us with poets, essayists, and historians.
Mr. Lowndes reminds us that Benjamin Franklin, John Lothrop Motley, George Bancroft. James Russell Lowell, and John Hay were all at the American Embassy in London at some time or other. The list suggests that the study of history and literary criticism Is a more hopeful pursuit in America than in England. In the latter country, If the student Is lucky. It may possibly bring him to an ill-paid professorship; In the former It may lead to one of the most agreeable and dignified positions which any person, not of royal blood, can occupy.

Phase,’* by . Oscsr
Brownir.j] and, Indeed, hiving admitted; that it fills a place, I must frankly con-;: fess that I could have wished that'ft h‘&d' been done differently in parts. For ex-. -ample, Mr. Browning, rightly says that accounts of Napoleon’s early years have been garnished by a number of stories entirely devoid of foundation. This is true; but . what an Interesting chapter could have been made with some such title as " Fact and Fiction in Naikrieon’s Infancy." For example, Bourrienne claims that he knew Napoleon from his ninth year onward, and that he was his *‘ inseparable companion M at the school at Brienne; he further says that for the eight succeeding years they regularly corresponded. He proceeds to tell many stories concerning Napoleon's life in the school, all of which will be found by any one In the first volume of Bourrlenne's Memoirs. Now Mr. Browning does not once refer to Bourrienne. He knows that he was largely a maker of fiction, and he therefore ignores him: but what I should. Imagine a student might reasonably demand was some kind of analysis of Bourrienne’s statements. The same criticism applies to Mme. Junot's Memoirs^ where there also .Is much concerning the young Napoleon that Is apocryphal. It would be interesting to know what part Mr. Browning thought was apocryphal and which not. All of It was certainly most entertainingly strung together. In any case Mme. Junot’s statement that Napoleon was in his youth downright ugly and that a great physical change came in the seven years o£ early manhood is borne out by his portraits.— Clement Shorter in The London Sphere.
and inspiring, reading are giving at least half an hour a month to a perusal of Edith Wharton’s “ The House of Mirth," now running In Scribner’s. As the complications of Incidents as well as of characters unfold themselves one is almost overwhelmed by the myriad of labeled Items which the author must for years have patiently pigeonholed in her archives of chronic and chronicle scandals. The artist in Mrs. Wharton, however, has never failed her, and these episodes and characters present, through her skill, an illusion of reality instead of a mere copy of the things and persons themselves, which would be quite obnoxious, not to say painful, to some families.
In the July installment of the story, which will probably reach you as you print this letter, the scene shifts to Monte Carlo and Nice, and the movement of narrative becomes more rapid and threatens to envelop the curious yet utterly human heroine, Lily Bart. In a divorce scandal. The original of the episode on board , the yacht Sabrina filled much space in international society columns some twelve years ago, when dispatches dated Naples and Sorrento kept the wires hot. The delinquent on that occasion was dropped quietly into the bay, to be fished out by the sailors on board a neighboring merchantman. In Mrs. Wharton's story, however, we are not told whether the jealous Dorset gave Ned Sllverton an unexpected morning bath.
As I have said, Mrs. Wharton has made full use of the “ chronique scandaleuse '* at her disposal. She has, however, made an artist’s use of it. She has done for the smart set of New York what Zola did for various phases of Parisian society— phases which might as well be nameless.— Walter Littlefield in Chicago Record Herald.
