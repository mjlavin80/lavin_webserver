11.—PROSPERITY’S FAULT.
Vcw Yart Times Book Rct-ieic:
IT is evident that none of the host of would-be enlighteners has as yet succeeded in presenting a really satisfactory and convincing answer to the question of our poetic sterility. It is not a question that Is independent and complete in itself, and, therefore* in need of a peculiar explanation, but its cause must be sought in that greater principle which caused the decline of our general literature, comprising all its various branches and forms or expression, whether poetry, fiction, or essay. It is a fact which even the super-ffcial observer cannot fail to notice, that our literature has degenerated since the days of such masters as Hawthorne, Irving, Lowell, Fiske, Prescott. Emerson, Poe, and Longfellow, and if the deteriorating and dissolving effects are more noticeable in the realms of the gentle and heavenly Muse, it is owing to the fact that poetry, partaking more of the nature of luxurious and ornamental, rather than of Teal utility, as well as requiring more abstraction and inspiration in its production, must, in the natural course of events, be the first to feel the rude and destructive hand of adverse fortune. It cannot be due entirely, as the originator of the symposium presumes, to The chilling spirit of J
rampant mateftalism, for among the. myriads of the greater'and lesser luminaries in our literary firmament there surely are a few who are above the*grasping and debasing spirit of barter; “ Nor is it due to the supposedly gross and Indifferent': materialism of the reading public; for, as a correspondent pointed out, in “ a coun- j try where we pride ^ourselves on our patronage of art, where continually some Croesus calls down Europe’s chagrin and envy by bringing home a masterpiece,” where the best productions of the German and English poets, and'sclentists are readJ more widely than ‘ in their native lands, | the people cannot be entirely devoid of the impulses which are required' for the { appreciation of the sublime works of genius of their own writers, albeit they prefer to follow themselves the more re- 1 munerative paths of commerce.
The real cause is, I venture to suggest, j as follows: If there be any truth in the adage that “ necessity Is the mother of j Invention/* then the antithesis is also ob- i vious. Without this incentive, without the powerful aid of feeling a want or a priva- ! tion. be it mental or physical, none of the things and articles of comfort and luxury the possession of which we so much boast would ever have been created. And the American author of the present day, as a member ot this Nation, is not aware of
I	Mr
any mental or physical agony or privation, of any restriction or prohibition—in short, of any '* burning question" which shall require the aid of his pen and. his dormant genius. M Peaceful tranquillity* ’ and the blessings of freedom and guarantees of liberty 'are indisputably a blessing and
the proper auspices under which to rear a nation possessed of: a healthy average normal character, but it lacks the requisites for the creation and development of the exceptional, the supreme, and towering genius, the valorous and unflinching hero, or the being who, at all hazards to his oWn safety, will go about the land diligently sowing the seeds of a new thought. Washington would, perhaps, have remained an obscure Virginia surveyor or an officer In the English militia of the Colony had not King George and his Parliament been possessed of such short sight and long ears, and utterly refused to listen to the plaintive voice of justice on this side of the Atlantic. -History's record of Lincoln would have been brief, Indeed, but for the opportunity afforded his soul to unfold itself and display all its magnificent sublimity during a great and trying war fought for a sacred cause. Harriet Bsecher Stowe, being a witness to a horrifying slavery and bondage, could work herself up into that state of frenzy required for the production of an M Uncle Tom's Cabin,*’ but no present-day writer, with slavery only a bleak memory, eould produce such a monumental work of the subject. This is also the explanation to the apparently enigmatic puzzle why the semi-barbarous Russian Empire can boast of such a powerful and variegated literature which may well be the pride of a more advanced and cultured land. The Russian author is yet surrounded by religious intolerance and persecution; he beholds political corruption, official suppression and oppression, and an Ignorance and grinding poverty which is almost universal, and his feelings are kindled and fanned into an uncontrollable flame, and his writings become as fiery and consuming as the tirades of the prophets of old, albeit they may appear hysterical to the foreign reader. That is why she can boast of her Tolstoys, Dos- ] toyerskys, Tourgeneffs, Gorkys, and j Chechows, men whose works make mill- | ions of people in all lands think and seek a more perfect life, while our country can only boast of writers of tell-tale novels, gossipy -stories, and boarding school histories, and volumes of essays. The same is true of Germany, which, while possessing more freedom than Russia, Is yet by no means so far advanced in that respect I as this, land of ours, and which is yet | grappling with many knotty and vital problems long since settled over here. Ancient Rome having conquered the entire habitable globe, and not fearing any further aggression, became degenerated. Her once peerless army became effeminate and unworthy of vanquishing any enemy, no matter how inferior, and had ; to submit to the plunder and the subjection of the Vandal Goth, and even so the American, having vanquished all his spiritual enemies, has, through these sclf-same causes, become barren and unproductive, and must henceforth become the intellectual vassal of the Teutonic and Slavic producer of literature,
