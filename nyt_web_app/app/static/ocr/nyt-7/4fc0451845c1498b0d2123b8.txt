A writer in Tho Dial has discovered that Shakespeare in the scene between Dogberry and the watch in “ Much Ado About Nothing M precisely foreshadowed the attitude of President Buchanan toward the South in his last message to Congress. Apprehend all vagrom men, said Dogberry, but if they will not stand, let them go, and thank God you are rid of a knave. The Southern States ought not to withdraw j from the Union, said Buchanan, but if they should ! withdraw, there is nothing to do but let them go and wash our hands of the whole proceeding. The paral- | lei is far-fetched but amusing. Similarly, The Dial finds a close resemblance between the conduct of the Dreyfus trial and that of the Knave of Hearte in •• Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.'* The likeness la, indeed, amazing. The prototype- of the famous bordereau is the letter alleged to have been written by the Knave to somebody, not in his own handwriting, and unsigned. The fact that the letter is not in the Knave’s handwriting shows that he imitated
- m
somebody else's hand. The fact that it is unsigned “ proves his guilt/* We do not know whether to class these two literary, parallels with the penalties or the prizes of literary fame. The general theme of The Dial's article is the relatloji of literature to life. It includes a well-timed Drotest against the habit of forcing the merit of master works upon immature or ’ untrained minds.
