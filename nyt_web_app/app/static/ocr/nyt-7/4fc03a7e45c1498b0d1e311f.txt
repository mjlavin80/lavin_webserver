WHISTLER.
Mr, Way’s Catalogue of tfie Great . Painter’s Lithographs.*
lithography Whistler found a. medium eminently suited for the expression’ of his genius. A master of all the* various means known to the artist for permanently recording* tbe evidences of his talents, Whistler was never happier in his results than when Impressing his genius on the lithographic stone. Here his penetrating powers of observation, his genius for instinctively seizing upon the essentials, the spirit, and life of the scene before him, could be most rapidly And spontaneously recorded. His light and magic touch was here entirely unhampered, and a vivid sketch, one full of brilliant suggestion—for much more is visable than what is actually recorded— was iTip.vita.bly the result of his efforts in
this direction.
Thomas Way, the father of the compiler of the catalogue now under consideration, and the only printer Whistler intrusted with this work, excepting five lithographs which were printed in Paris, was the first to call the artist’s attention to the possibilities offered by the lithograph as a means of artistic expression. TJntil Whistler began experimenting with the subtle chalk it had never attained to this dignity, but now it is a recognized medium, although as yet no one has
*	eaualled the brilliant performances of him who may with propriety be called the pioneer. Whistler Is unquestionably the supreme master of the lithograph.
The first edition of this work, which appeared late in the Spring of 1S9C, recorded and otherwise described one hundred and thirty lithographs as coming from "Whistler's hand, and although this new edition accounts for one hundred and sixty specimens of the artist's genius In t>iig direction, but.very few of these additional thirty are anything but prints which Whistler condemned and did not desire to be recorded. Description of hitherto undescribed states of certain lithographs have also been added, but those in colors are not described, as this would entail a separate description of each printing. Following the number and the title of each lithograph recorded in this catalogue we have a sufficiently exact description of the drawing to place it, note of the number of proofs made, whether or not the drawing was signed, and the date of its execution. Note is also made where a lithograph has been reprinted, and lithographs iaeued as supplements to art journals have this part recorded. Perhaps a more exacting lithographer would have added the dates of such periodicals; certain it is that Buch additional data would have been of service to the collector.
A new introduction, covering nine pages, has been written for this edition; the original foreword has been retained also, it may be noted, but the curious portrait of Whistler, worked on a little by the artist himself, has been omitted from the revised version. In these pages the author gives us numerous interesting technical remarks on the art of lithography in general and as applied to Whistler in particular.
As regards the format of this small volume, we have nothing but praise. Set in type bearing somewhat the character of Casjon, at the Chiswick Press, and printed on a most gratifying hand-made paper, it is substantially bound in brown boards, held together by a strip of pure vellum.
Thus we now possess a satisfactory catalogue of Whistler's lithographs, and Frederic Wed more has given us one of the etchings. It now remains for some industrious spirit to draw up a descriptive list of the paintings, the pastels, the wa-ter-colors, and the drawings. I suppose we may reasonably expect to rind such
