Stevenson's Use of Slang
Veto York Times Book Renew:
That there Is nothing’ new In the world seems even to apply to the use of slang. One of the colloquialisms ln general use for several years Is familiar to most— ** There's nothing doing.” Reference to Robert Louis Stevenson’s prologue to Black Andie's tale of Tod Lapraik (Chapter XV. of M David Balfour") brings to light ** There was nothing doing,” (second sentence of the second paragraph.)
That Stevenson, a purist of the purists, should use this form of speech years before Its current use would seem to discredit the definition given in Burt's Standard Family Dictionary—'* Slang: Vulgar, unmeaning language.”
What explanation can be found Tor the use of the word “ dollar " in the same 1 book? Note the last sentence of the sixth from the last paragraph of Chapter XXII. Stevenson makes hla hero say: “ I advanced him to that effect a dollar or two
*	*	* " Was this monetary standard In
use, either in Scotland or Holland, at tho period covered by this charming love story?	STANLICUS.
