Edward Latham, the well-known compiler of dictionaries of names, abbreviations, phrases, &c.. has compiled a new volume of “ Famous Sayings and Their Authors,” which E P. Dutton & Co. will send Out next week. There are English and American sayings as well as French,
; German, Greek, Italian, and Latin ones. Historical sayings have been included for their value; there are also some " dyins words,” which have been inserted on account of the interest they have owing to the fame of the person who spoke them-The compiler points out In his preface that It has been his object to give a " fair-i ly representative ” collection of historical sayings, real or apocryphal, rightly or wrongly attributed, as the case may be; he tells to whom the Baying was delivered and under what circumstances, adding also, wherever possible, the authority and the varying versions.	____
