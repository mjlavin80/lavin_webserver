T has been said during these days of mourning for Mr. Hay that he was never caricatured. But once, at least, his own pen essayed the task from wnlch the artist’s pencil recoiled. In September, 1871, Walt Whitman rtcited an original poem at the opening of the American Institute Fair in New York, and the next morning the greater part of it appeared Ln The Tribune. In the course of the day Bayard Taylor sent into the office a group of Imitations of Whitman, Bret Harte, John Kay, and Mr. Joaquin Miller, and they appeared the next morning under the heading, '* Tho Battle of the Bards." Taylor had made each poet claim supremacy, but had left the verses otherwise unconnected. Mr. Hay, as night editor, gave them an introduction, setting forth that " some portions of Mr. Whitman's remarkable poem had been omitted," with great regret, inasmuch as the officers of the Signal Service think it not
probable that “ another such disturbance of the elements will take place tn this century." " The Night Editor," said the introduction, ‘‘ has been severely censured for slaughtering this exquisite morceau, and compared to the base Judaean who threw*' a pearl away richer than all his agate.” Bret Harte was described as “ lounging forward from among tho refrigerators,” when Mr. Whitman’s voice “ had died away among the patent pumps and corn cutters, which cumbered the vast amphitheatre.” " Air this a free fight? ’* he asked, and read his verses with exquisite expression, after putting htfl hand behind his hip; and then followed this caricature:
“ Here a long, lank, farmer-looking man, with travel-stained garments of Kentucky jeans, a weather-beaten face, rough with two days of grizzled beard, enormous brown hands and wrists protruding from the short coat sleeves, and a general air of melancholy and tobacco about him, came slouching up to the platform, and, taking off his tattered fur cap, said to the Presidents
•	Good morning, Jedgel I drapped in to take a hand long o' the other poets, but of ye ain't got no better stock nor this, I reckon 1*11 skeet back to Spunky Pint. Why Jedge! my little Gabe—he’s at school at Hell's Bend in Magoopin County—dog-gon my skin ef he can’t sing the socks off that thar little Gambolier.'
‘ Confine yourself to your own poetry,' said the Chairman austerely, and the Pike sadly shook the hayseed from his Ioag iron-gray hair, and read these rhymes in a snuffling tone, curiously at variance with their libertine^ tendency."
In 1876, when reprinting these imitations in the volume with ” The Echo Club,” published in 1872 in The Atlantic Monthly, Mr. Taylor gave them the entire .setting added by Mr. Hay, saying that it probably contributed even more to the amusement of the public than the poems themselves. He added, “ Tho rare liberality—nay, in a literary sense generosity—Which the editor exhibited would be universally appreciated, if it were proper to mention his name.” The name was no secret to any journalist after these significant words, and so Bayard Taylor may be said to have brought the first
blossom for the garland of praises which the Secretary's countrymen are now weaving with “ bells and flowerets of a thousand hues.” Liberality and generosity do not bloom so prodigally tn the fields of literature that the praise should be forgotten.
In the “ Life and Letters ” of Taylor Mr. Hay’s name Is not mentioned, but Sept. 18, 1871, nine days after tho publication of the ffrur imitations , and the introduction, Taylor writes to Mr. Reid, editor of The Tribune, that during the last week or two he has been " trying an experiment in regard to those imitations,’’ evidently, from the context, meaning certain parodies written in his earlier years, and with a few exceptions unpublished* He refuses to allow them to appear as they are, hesitates between The Tribune and The Atlantic Monthly, and at last throws aside nearly all the old matter, rapidly writes between thirty and forty new imitations, adds critical conversations by way of setting, and gives them to The Atlantic as “ The Diversions of the Echo Club.” Apparently Mr. Hay’s improvised humor gave the crystallizing touch to a vague project long cherished, and was really responsible for the writing of “ The Echo Club,” and certainly no collection of his writings will be completp without “ The Battle of the Bards.”
