HE ghost of pore Bill Shike-spearc,
’E couldn't set no rest;
For years an* yunrs e wa!ke*d at night With fee/in'.s most distressed To 'ear the* controversies Which was as dry as dust,
Excep’ the rather rude remarks About ’is litest bust,
“ Tis	mighty	ion?,”	thought	Bill,	an’
sighed,
“ Since J ‘ad any bust.”

’E was a patient ghost— j	Could	stand a	goodish	bit o’ sauce—
J	But	wot annoyed ’Im	most
Was bcin* patronized by folks Who midc books by the ton.
An* thought as thej' was wise because They ’ad no sense of fun. j	" ’Tis	mighty	long."	thought	Bill,	an’
,	groaned,
** Since I *a<3 any fun.**
The ghost of pore Bill Shikespeare,
’E didn’t care a fig f parties thought ’emselves like 'im Because their ’eads was big,-But, oh! it gave ’im quite the *ump When parties cried, ** Look ’ere!
We’ll champion Shikespeare, yus! we will Till w-e Ties on our bier! ’’
** ’T13 mighty long,” thought Bill, an' coughed.
" Since I ’ad any beer.”
The ghost of pore Bill Shikespeare,
’E couldn’t get no rest Till one fine night 'e finds a book Where^things was free expressed.
E didn’t know the hauthor's nime.
But thought ’e’d 'ave a peep.
An' soon ’e rubbed hfs heyes as if ’E meant to do a weep.
•■Tis mighty long." thought Bill . . . an’ smiled.
An’ yawned, an* fell asleep.

There is no doubt about the Americans being up to date in the matter of text and hand books In connection with their various branches of business. And there is method and system in tbe way they compile them, I only wish there was more effort in this direction In our own country- These " helps *’ are of immense value to the young man setting out in some particular sphere of commerce. There are so many channels nowadays to which the youth is attracted, and there are In all of
them splendid opportunities. In order to make the best of these opportunities It is positively essential that1 a knowledge of mercantile business, its laws, rules, qnd methods of operation, should be possessed by him who would achieve a first position. Do not be skied, but get hung oh the line. It will be a fierce light, but the fiercer the light the greater the triumph, morally and financially. One of the arts of business Is to economize only the necessary amount of labor which it is possible to learn from our own or other people’s failure- Search these failures closely, and you will save many serious blunders and bad losses in the future. It is worth while to train yourself while young and learn all the technicalities of business life. You are founding an orderly existence in your efforts to carve out a future for yourself, and yon will find that the evils liable to result from ignorance—and even inexperience*—will be much smaller than those which will occur to the untrained mam It Is this that the Americans are teaching seriously and earnestly in their business schools*—Matthew Cripps In The Young Mas, (London.) ~

There 13 a large amount of literature connected with the rose. Of course* every writer on flowers was bound to mention it, but,, as far as I know, tho first book solely devoted to th* rose is by a Spanish physician named Mo-rmrflfg. IX 'was published at Antwerp In 15S1, under the title of ** De rosa et parti-bua ejus.” and though a email book, chiefly concerned with the medical qualities of the rose, it is wen worth reading, for the writer was an enthusiastic admirer of the flower; so that he sums up its virtues in the words, * Inter meOlclnas bene-dlctas benedictlsslma merito nuncuparl potest.** Since that tftno there haa heen-an increasing production of boobs on the ‘ toss, so that tn the ** BibUografia de la Rosa,” by IX Mariano Vergara, published at Madrid In 38S& oon than a thousand books are mentioned* and the number now ia much larger.

“ Literature.'
Roses from Nature,** USO-lSlO, a beautiful book, now become rare and expensive. 2r^ 181 i» appeared Dr. Lindley's “ Rosarum Monographia,” a perfect monograph of the family, which still holds tlie highest rank, but of which a new edition, brought up to date, is much to be desired. It would be tedious to attempt to select the best books on roses from the large number now in existence; but no rosa-rian'y library should be without " Ros Rosarum,'* by the Hon. Mrs. Boyle, and M. Joret’s two books, ** La Hose dans rAntiquity.” &c„ and " La L6gende de la Rose.” The “ Ros Rosarum " is an excellent selection of the poetical notiecs of the rose from the earliest times and from all nations; while M. Thoret’s books ar« full of curious points connected with the flower, also from the earliest times and from all civilized countries.—Canon Ella-corobe in Cornhill Magazine.

_	At that dinner [of the
Printers'	Pension] Mr.
Anthony	Hope spoke
charmingly in response to the toast of ** Literature,"	But	I	was amazed	to hear this
eminent novelist declare that	he had never
heard a good definition of what “ literature ” is.. Surely the task of defining literature should not be in the least difficult —may not great literature be described as the highest form of bal-xncing the words of a language to express ideas? That is why Shakespeare and Dante stand on the
pinnacle which Is universally conceded to them. One has only to read these writers to obtain a standard from which to form one’s taste. It is possible by reading the writings of men whose work has stood the test of ages to formulate a very clear Idea as to the highest gift of expression. We may build up a standard of taste for good poetry written to-day by a study of the good poetry of the past; we may build up a standard of taste for well-written history or biography by an acquaintance with the best effort In that direction that has been done in the long ago.—Clement Shorter in London Sphere.

We have thought S. F. Bcnaon’s for some time that and	the phenomena of
Henry Jame.Vs spiritualism present
Treatment of lhe Mystical.
difficulties too great for the novelist to tackle. That opinion of ours	been
strongly fortified by ihe reading of this new novel of Mr. Benson’s.
Mr. Benson is an extremely able and versatile writer, and where he fails we feel nobody else, that we can think of, Is likely to succeed. Of course failure is a comparative term, and there are many
senses in which '* The Image Tn tne Sand " Is by no means a failure, for it is interesting and wejl written. But it does not achieve the grue; that is what is the matter with it It does not achieve the grue as Mr. Henry James achieved It in the first of the two stories in '* The Two Magics," and in one or two shorter stories published in the volume called " The Soft Side.” But then Jn those stories Mr. James was not treating of modern spiritualism but rather of the older fashioned sort of ghosts in which we all of us sometimes more than half believe. Moreover, Mr. Henry James is, of course, Mr. Henry James.—London Chronicle.
Want In Books.
_	On	the	subject	of	what
girls read, a high school mistress has given The Literary World the results of a vote taken among the four top forms of a typical girls* public school. She thinks that the following are the chief Interests that girls look for in the books they read:
(1)	Tears—a girl has this advantage over her brother—she lacks his interest in gore; <2) adventure; (3) school or college interest; (4) lovemaking of a very unromantlc kind, but with a weepiness somewhere. She can put up with humor, but she rather distrusts wit. Though the'library has been flooded with American books, She prefers the home production; probably the unfamiliar setting is the drawback. This lady adds that ~ all girls,’* even very dull ones, like Shakespeare, and most read hfm for pleasure, apart from the plays read in school/’ But hardly any schoolgirl can be got to like Keats,” and, further, 41 none read poetry of their own accord.** This does not seem to agree with the statement about the Hiring for Shakespeare. hut perhaps the writer agrees with Mr. Bernard Shaw, and does not count Shakespeare among the poets. At any rate, there is no doubt that the taste Cor poetcy among the rising generation is very little developed. Our girls care for poetry now no more than their brothers at school and college. Perhaps they are too busy with hockey and cricket,—London Standard.

w The Americans . What Ha* are-a brave, Indus-Happened Since trio us, and ‘acute
—-r- tat **
have hitherto shown so Indications of .genius, no approaches to tbe heroic, either ln their morality or tbeSr	•	•	•	In	the	fern?	quar-
ts»«f tha globe, who re&dran American
book? or gees to an American play? or looks at an American picture or statue? ’’ it was in 1820 that Sydney Smith made this oft-quoted query in The Edinburgh Review. However much the supersensitive eagle may have writhed at the time, there was rcallj little to offer in reply except judicious siJencc. America had no indigenous plays, no pictures, no statues; at l^ast none that could reasonably claim the attention of the foreigner. As for books of distinction, they could be counted on tho fingers of one hand: Jonathan Edwards's Essays, Franklin’s Autobiography, and the novels of Brockden Brown,
which Shelley records as having read with delight in his uncritical youth.
Nearly a century has passed since Sydney Smith put our artistic pretensions to the wall. We still have no enduring plays to boast about; the drama is yet a matter of importation and piracy. But when it comes to literature there is a different story to tell. Irving is a respectable figure snywhere. Poe is an accepted classic in every cultivated nation. Longfellow’s bust is In Westminster Abbey. Hawthorne is rccognized as an artist of rare skill and distinction. Emerson, friend of Carlyle, has been pronounced by Matthew Arnold to be one of the most significant prose writers of the nineteenth century. Whitman is honored abroad as a poet of original and significant quality. American fiction, not to speak of the western nations of Europe, can be read in Russian, Bohemian, and Servian. And finally, when Mark Twain makes a joke, all the civilized world joins in the laugh.—The Outlook, IV ew YorK.

Genius.
When a	man of
Tlie Penalties mighty genius begins and Prizes to make his presence felt in the world* there invariably	arises a
frightful howl from the critics—whose prejudices, arising from deep learning In ** schools ” and regard for precedent, have received	such	a	violent shock.	Wagners
lyric	dramas	were branded as uncouth
noises: Whistler's paintings as little bet- | ter than tinted wall paper. This deluge ; submerged Keats, while Byron replied to his critics in as vigorous terms as they i themselves employed, and Whistler in his '* Gentle Art of Making Enemies " immortalized many carping critics with his
shafts of stinging wit and biting satire.
Comes the day, finally, when the muai- ’ cian, the poet, the artist, wins universal recognition. Perhaps this day arrives in time for a grateful country to give him a bit of ribbon—an action spoken of In such an appreciative manner by Browning— perhaps It comes too late. It is then that the industrious one busies himself with compiling and editing all the odds and ends of literary material left by the deceased that he can get into his ravenous clutch. The masterpieces were rejected and cast aside a few years ago: to-day every unworthy scrap of rubbish is carefully collected.—The Literary Collector, Greenwich, Conn.
