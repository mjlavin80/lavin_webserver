THE. DISPUTE, ABOUT OUR POETS.
Continuation of the Controversy, With Some Assistance from the Versifiers Themselves.
Iv—MATTHEW ARNOLD’S VIEW.
H," cries my friend, “ but who hath taught .
Why music and the other arts
Oftener perform aright their parts	.	,
Than poetry? why she, than they,
Fewer fine successes can display?
For *tis so, surely! Even in Greece,
Where best the poet framed his piece,
Even in that Phoebus-guarded ground Fausanias on his travels found Good poems, if he loolr’d. more rare (Though many) than good statues were—
For these, in truth, were everywhere.
Of bards full many a strobe divine,
In Dante's, Petrarch’s, Tasso’s line.
The land of Ariosto show’d;
Xnd yet, e’en there, the canvas glow’d With triumphs, a yet ampler brood,
Of Raphael and his brotherhood.
And nobly perfect, in our day Of haste, half work and disarray,- .
Profound yet touching, sweet yet strong.
Hath risen Goethe’s, Wordsworth’s . song;
Yet even I (and none will bow ,
Deeper to these) must needs allow They yield us not, to soothe our pains,
Such multitude of heavenly strains As from the kings of sound are blown,
' Mozart, Beethoven, Mendelssohn.
" Only a few the life-stream’s shore With safe unwandering feet explore;
' Untired its movement bright attend.
Follow its windings to the end.
Then from its brimming waves their eye
Drinks up delighted ecstasy.
And its deep-toned, melodious voice Forever makes their ear rejoice.
They speak! the happiness divine They feel, runs o-’er in every line;
Its spell is round them like a shower—
It gives them pathos, gives tfifem power.'
No painter yet hath such a way,
Nor no musician made, as they.
And gather’d on immortal knolls Such lovely flowers for cheering souls.
Beethoven, Raphael, cannot reach The charm which Homer, Shakespeare, teach.	-
To these, to these, their thankful race Gives, then, the first, the fairest place . And brightest is their glory’s sheen.
For greatest hath their labor been.”
—Matthew Arnold, “ Epilogue to Lessing’s Laocoon.”
