^J\HE widow of George Frederick Watts announces that she has authorized no biography of her husband, and has turned over his letters and papers for that purpose to nobody. On the contrary, she intends to write the only 14 authorized biography ” herself, or to compile it from Watts's letters and papers, using his own language as far as possible. She asks all who have letters or even short notes from Watts to lend them to her. Her address is Limnerslease, Guildford, Surrey. She says that toward the close of his life Watts found himself a popular subject for authors, " with real regret/' If he had “ believed himself free to choose, he would have decided then and for the future that by his pictures and sculpture alone his mind should be expressed.” Mrs. Russell Barrington's ** Reminiscences of George Frederick Watts/* to which we alluded some weeks ago, shows that Watts was a very interesting man, and that there was much more worth telling about in his life and character than his paintings and sculptures tell.
