The Boss of Little Arcady—The Franciscan Missions—A Novel and Children’s Books.
HEN Mr. Harry Leon Wilson’s "The Boss of Little Arcady " appears next month It "will be found that, following the fashion prevailing among the younger authors, he has made it quite unlike either of his earlier books, and thus avoided the odious comparison dogging the footsteps of writers who, like Sir Walter Scott and Mr. Howells, are faithful to one type of fiction, " The Spenders ” pictured the encounter between Western and Eastern standards; ** The Lions of the Lord '* was historical; the new book belongs to what may be called the farcically idyllic schooL Its scene Is a village so placed that a dweller therein may say both “ back East" and “ out West," and " isle and haven In a sea of laud flattening away from It on every side,” and a country sea withaL Its citizens are curious and gossip furiously, but their worst sin is occasional mild intoxication, and they are not vexed by the weariness, the fever, and the fret which annoyed Mr. Keats. Such small troubles as assail them are presented to the Boss, the editor of the weekly paper, to be allayed, and certainly come to an end. If not always by his skill. The hero Is a one-armed veteran of the civil war, cherishing the dream of a lost love, and modestly incredulous of success of any species, and, like his townsmen, unconsciously happy. The heroine comes to him from her native South instead of his going thither to woo her, according to the accustomed scheme, and a devoted ex-slave also appears, but the author manages to prevent both of them ' from becoming purely sentimental, and so from gentle drollery to drollery the story makes Its way to a happy ending* -The book will make an entirely new set of readers for its author, yet will not alienate any friends whom he possesses. That the number of those friends is large Is shown by the orders received daily by his publishers, the Lothrop, Lee & Shepard Company, ever since the first announcement of the book.

Mr. George Wharton James, the author of “ In and Around the Grand Canyon " and ** Indian Basketry,’* has prepared a somewhat elaborate work on the California Franciscan missions, a topic of which the Bast is almost completely ignorant. It is true that from time to time good illustrated papers touching one or another phase of the subject appear in the Pacific Coast magazines, but their influence hardly passes the Rockies, if, indeed, it comes beyond the Sierras. Mr. James has given much .space to the mission architecture, which was, of course, essentially Spanish, although modified by the nature of the material at hand, and the chapter on this topic is written by Miss Irene Sargent of The Craftsman. Mr. James himself has carefully studied and minutely described the Interior decorations of the churches, especially those produced in this country by the pupils of the Fathers, and he has given an account of the pictures at the missions, ana very remarkable some of them are. He has also considered the story of " Ramona " as related to the mission, a matter Interesting to all Mrs. Jackson’s readers. The illustrations are reproductions from photographs of excellence always strange to the Atlantic coast, doubly pleasant to the eye since the coal strike caused Atlantic air to lose. its transparency. Mr. James and his friend Mr. C. C. Pierce of Los Angeles have taken the pictures expressly for this work, which will be issued by Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. as among the larger holiday books.

Miss Alice Brown will have a novel on the Autumn list of 'Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., a novel of that New England rural life which she makes so much more vivid than the rivalry and struggles of that upper Bohemia which she now and then portrays. The title will be " Paradise," and cheerful confusion it will make among the booksellers with two books by Miss Phelps having the same word in the title, to say nothing of Mrs. Goodwin’s “ Four Roads to Paradise."

The Contributors' Club of the August Atlantic opens with '^A Secret Story," a revelation vouched for by the editors as " written by one of the oldest and most truly original of our American writers of fiction." It comes at the right moment to receive attention, for it tells of a psychical experience, but who is the writer?
