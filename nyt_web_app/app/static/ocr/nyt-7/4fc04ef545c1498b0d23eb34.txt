IsLAMISM TO-DAY.
' Mr. Wollaston's Well-Made Pttch-work of Items About the Fol-"	lowers	of Muhammad.*
R. WOLLASTON’S book is a sort of macfedolne—a mixing together of the writings of other men on the subject of Islam. Its author does not pretend that it Is other-
*	wise; "in fact,” he writes in his preface, ** in many cases information is given in the very words of authors who dealt with the sublet years ago." He has done his work of choosing and mingling in an able manner; probably he could not have done so had he not possessed a considerable first-hand knowledge of the subject.
*	Much of the book is devoted to the history of Islam, a chapter being devoted to_ the history of Arabia before Muhammad’s time, a second to the Prophet, and other
chapters to the development of Islam under Muhammad's immediate successors, under the Omaiyad and the Abbaside Caliphs, during the crusades, and In Spain. Of more interest, however, are those describing the Quran (or Kacan) and the pilgrimage to Mecca.
ALL ABOUT THE KOHAN.
THE word Quran means " that which ought to be read." It is divided into 134 chapters called " Suraa” a word meaning really " row,” order,” series.'* In manuscripts these chapters are not numbered, but bear titles, sometimes derived from the subject matter, but usually from the first important word. Some chapters have two or more names because of differences in the manuscripts followed. Each chapter is divided into smaller portions, called verses by non-Moslems, but in Arabic known as " ayat,” signs or wonders. The ez»iJre book again is divided into sixty equal portions, called Ahzab, each sub-divided into four equal parts; or into thirty parts called Ajza, each consisting of two Ahzab, and again divided into four.
All the chapters except the ninth begin with the Bismilla: ” In the name of the most merciful God.” Twenty-nine begin with certain letters of the alphabet, which are believed to be the peculiar marks of
the Quran, and " to conceal several profound mysteries, the understanding of which, the more intelligent confess, has not been communicated to any mortal, their Prophet only excepted. Notwithstanding this, some commentators guess at their meaning, and suppose the letters to stand for as many words expressing the names and attributes of GotL His works, ordinances, and degrees. Others explain the intent of these letters from their nature or else from their value in numbers.” The Quran was probably the first prose work of a high order written in Arabic; *• its diction is rude and rugged, but for grandeur and sublimity it probably approaches nearer to the Bible than any [other] work extant.” We , should like to know if this is Mr. Wollas- ; ten's own view of the book. Muhammad appealed to the Quran as a proof of the divinity of his mission, challenging any one to produce a single chapter compara- | ble to the book which God had whlspertd in his ear. Labid, a famous poet of | Arabia, took up the challenge, and a ; poem which he offered was affixed to th® gate of the temple at Mecca. When the second Sura was placed by its side Labid, who was an idolater, read the first few verses, and was immediately converted to the new religion. According to another j story, some " religious Nihilists " hired Ibn al Muqaffa to rival the Quran. After six months he was found absorbed in study, with a blank sheet of paper before him, while the floor was strewn with torn manuscript; he confessed that he ! could not write a single verse equaling the
Quran. ,
According to Muslim tradition, the Archangel Gabriel paid 24,000 visits to : earth while revealing to Muhammad the wishes of the Creator. Some few chap- ; ters were delivered entire, but the greater j part was revealed piecemeal and written | down at the Prophet’s dictation- by Zaid, , his secretary. The first revelation, it Is ! generally agreed, contained the first five verses of the ninety-sixth sura. After i the passages had been written down they were published to the Prophet's followers, several of whom took copies, while most 1 learned them by heart; and the originals j were then placed in a chest, in no particu- : lar order. For this reason it is uncertain when many of the passages were revealed. Abu Bekr, Muhammad’s first successor, collected the originals, which were on palm leaves and skins, and had copies made by Zaid from the dictation of those who had committed the passages to memory; he further placed the suras in the order still followed, putting the longest at the head of the list, without re-

gnrd to historical sequence. Some . time later Osman had the Quran copied in. the Quraish dialect, and suppressed the versions made by Abu Bekr. Seven chief editions were made later, two'at Medina and one each at Mecca, Kufa, Bussora, In Syria, while the seventh became the common edition used throughout Arabia.
I As it was found impossible. for Muslims I not Arabians to pronounce the Quran with the pure Meccan intonation, and as ; there were no vowel points to guide them, j no fewer than seven different ways of i reading the book became current. A voice from heaven revealed to mankind that the Book might be read in seven dialects; a School of Readers, seven in number, then was formed, wbose readings are accepted through the Muslim world.
WHAT ISLAM MEANS.
SLAM, the word given to his religion f by Muhairimad, means resignation or submission to the service and commands of God. It Is divided into two parts: 1, faith and theory; 2, religion or practice. Faith is bcilt on one fundamental base—the confession of faith:
** There is no God but God, and Muhammad is his apostle." The four points of practice are: Prayer, including purification, almsgiving, fasting, and the Hajj or i pilgrimage to Mecca, ” There can be no good in a religion wherein Is no prayer," was a saying of Muhammad's; the faithful, therefore, are enjoined to pray five times every twenty-four hours; before sunrise, when noon is past, before sunset, after sunset, and before the first watch of the night. Muslims must face toward Mecca when they pray, and must not shorten their prayers except ln special .cases, as when on a journey or preparing for battle. The time for prayer is announced from the minarets by the Muezzins, who are generally blind men, chosen that they may not see Into the hoases of the faithful from the balconies of the minarets. Friday " the prince of days,*' is the Muslim Sabbath. The faithful do not obey the Prophet's command to ** take their ornaments to every mosque,’* but lay them aside 41 lest they should appear proud and arrogant-” They do, however, wear good clothes when they attend the Friday services.
The pilgrimage to Mecca, is “a duty toward God Incumbent on those who are able to go thither "; and ordinarily one is " able ” if he professes the faith, is over fifteen, is free, and sane. Even yet the pilgrimage Is rpade by thousands each year. The Kaba in Mecca, the most sacred spot In the Muslim world, is the. oldest house on earth, having been made by the angels for Adam; the present building, however, is the tenth Kaba, the others having been variously taken up to heaven, destroyed by the deluge, or destroyed by fire or lightning: It dates from about 1620 A. D. The pilgrim to Mecca halts about five miles from the city, bathes and is shaven, and assumes the pilgrim robe, Ihram; this is kept to serve as a shroud. He then enters Mecca on foot by day, and goes at once to the sacred mosque, taking care that his glance falls first on the Kaba; he tljen touches the sacred black stone with his right hand, and kisses it, and goes seven times around the Kaba, thrice with a quick step, four times slowly. Then the pilgrim goes to the Magam Ibrahim and says two prayers; then returns to the Kaba and again kisses the stone. If he enters the Kaba he pays a fee pf about a dollar, and vows never thereafter to walk barefoot, to pick up fire In his fingers, or to tell a_ lie. After leaving the Mosque the pilgrim goes to Mount Safa and asks forgiveness of his sins, and then runs several times up the hill of Marwa, in memory of Hagar’s hasting In search of water for herself and Ishmael- On the proper day the pilgrim goes to Mount Arafat, and hears the three-hour sermon, so important that If he is late he loses the entire benefit of the pilgrimage. The next day he throws seven stones at three pillars to drive away Satan, and then goes to the Valley of Mina to assist at sacrificing animals. The valley extends itself if an unusual crowd of pilgrims is present. When this sacrifice is over the pilgrim rests, takes off his Ihram, and ends the pilgrimage, but before leaving Mecca he goes around the Kaba once more and throws more stones at the three pillars.
Mr. Wollaston has made a connected story out of mans' diverse books and articles. Burton, Bu^ckhardt, and many other old and new travelers are drawn upon. The result of his work we consider valuable, as being many riches in a little space.
