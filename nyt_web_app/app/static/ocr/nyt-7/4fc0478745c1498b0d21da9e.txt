Yet another volume about Booker Washington’s famous school lor the negToes is | ** Tuskegee and Its People: Their Ideals and Achievements," (The D. Appleton Company. $2.) Principal Washington Is the editor of the volume, 'which throughout bears his stamp and has, of course, an introduction from his pen. Really there Is nothing more for the Indefatigable man to say, but he believes that the lesson he has to teach can be learned only at the j price of infinite reiteration, and besides, he likes to talk.
" The book,*' s£.ys Principal Washington, “ is an accurate portrait of tho Tuskegee of to-day, and reasonably forecasts the hopes of the institution for to-morrow." It is made up of contributions by several hands, contributions explaining
the work of the school—these most appropriately written by officers and instructors at Tuskegee—and a sheaf of autobiographies of Tuskegee students who have made moderately successful showings in : life. The work of the school has already been so often and so fully described by Dr. Washington himself that readers of his books will gain little additional information from the first set of papers. Nev~ erthelcss, these papers make plain several things—as how the night classes are arranged for the students Who work every day, how even the day students work by j sections three days in the week, and how I the school is not intended to be by any ; means exclusively “ Industrial.’*
! The autobiographies of Tuskegeeans introduce some first hand matter—but even in that case Dr. Washington has already recited all the typical instances several times over. The Tuskegee graduates who write the stories of their lives include a college president, a school principal, a lawyer, a school treasurer, a farmer, a carpenter, a teacher of cooking, a dairyman, a wheelwright, a blacksmith, a druggist, a shoemaker, and others. Bach tells how he (or she) struggled up from the cabin and the cotton patch to his present eminence. If the stories are marked by a complacency pardonable under the circumstances, and if they fail to prove quite all their authors think they do prove for negro progress, yet they are not uninstructive. Dr. Washington’s editorship is assurance of discretion In the attitude toward the whites, and each colored autobiographer sings the Principal’s praises loudly at tbe end of his little piece.
