We have seen better translations than this, but we have never seen one that was more obviously a translation. The preface tolls us that it Is the work of Ii3. A. Andrews, aided by Dr. Felix Kruger, assisted by Dr. Max Lisncr, revised by
-	Prof. Dodd. Too many translators, like too many cooks, injure the product, which l in this case, from the variety of ingro-„ dlents, resembles a potpourri rather than the proverbial broth. For the abuse of the hyphen and a superabundance of isms ; we were prepared. " Soul-dlfferentia-tlon,” ’* time—style,” “ age— marks,” and . *' thought—process ” are hardly good English, but we overlook them in the pres- | once of such Latinisms, Hellenisms, and I Gallicisms as " nervosity,”	“ traumatic 1
psychosis,” and feuilleton,1' while hy- I brids like " ante-suggestion.” awaken no I protest at all. As an English translation 1 this volume is a huge joke, except when I you want to know what the author really I means. Then you are constantly in fear I lost Andrews, Kruger, Lisner, and Dodd I are opaque rather than translucent* and I wonder how many rays of Lamprecht get | through.
Dr. Lamprecht's view of history Is that
it is primarily a '* socio-psychological "
science. By this he means that society,
th*- subject-matter of history, is not
merely an aggregation of individual units.
but rather a unit of itself, with its own psychic character. History consists in a chain of " culture—epochs/' differing from each other, anu otcti with its peculiar psychic conditions. The student of German history, who does not happen to be R familiar with t,amprecht’s work on mat 8 subject will be impressed, if not instruct- I ed; when he is told that the course of Ger-	I
man history consists of tlu^.a " cultural "	I
epochs—Symbolism, Typism, Convention- 1 allsm. Individualism, and Subjectivism, I and he will unquestionably be awed by 8 learning that Germany is now in the sec- I ond period of Subjectivism. German his- § tory with Lamprecht Is the starting point Of scientific historical investigation. A scientific Wcltgeschichte remains a final aim of history. But It remains a distant goal. -It is only on the principle of -" divide ct impera,r that progress is possible. ITence the study of national cult- ' ure is the business of history in its pres* B ent stage. Those nations which offer the I longest unbroken series of "culture' I epochs *■ must first be studied, and here, I say a Dr. Lamprecht. the palm must be I awarded to Germany. Tho evolutions of I other nations, he believes, run natural I courses and manifest the presence of a universal law.
What Prof. Lamprecht does in these
•	lectures is to present his ideas on the
*	nature of history! -and on the correct methoa of writine-'it—ideas which he has carried out in ifTiF'* History of Germany,”
Of the five lectures, one, tho first, waa I delivered at St. Louts during tho prog- 8 ress of the World's Fair; the remaining . four were delivered at the exorcises of the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary Of.the founding of Columbia. It is a pity that the form in. which they now appear will consign them to oblivion in Amerliia; tor, If well translated; they would, con-atitute a very stimulating volume. - I
