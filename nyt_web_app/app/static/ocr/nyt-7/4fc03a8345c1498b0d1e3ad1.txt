SWINBURNE’S NOVEL,
A Few Excerpts from <he Dedication and the Story.*
agreeable kind of old-fashioned love story is involved in Algernon Charles Swinburne’s work of prose fiction, *' Love's Cross-Currents," of which something lias already been said in these columns.
In his dedication to Theodore Watts-Dunton, from which we quoted a phrase
or two last week, Mr. Swinburne expresses some doubt of the present utility of the epistolary form in fiction which even the giant genius of Balzac could not restore to the favor it enjoyed in the days of Richardson and Laclos.	'
I do not forget that the king of men to whose hand we owe the glorious history of “ Redgauntlet ” began it in epistolary form, and changed, the fashion of his tale to direct and forthright narrative when ihe story became too strong for him, and would no longer be confined within the limits of conceivable eorres>mdence; but his was in its ultimate upshot a historic and heroic story. And I have always regretted tjhat we have but one specimen of the uncompleted series of letters out of which an earlier novel, the admirable " Fortunes of Nigel," had grown up into immortality. The single sample which Lockhart saw fit to vouchsafe us is so groat a masterpiece of dramatic humor and living imagination that the remainder of a fragment which might well suffice for the fame of any lesser man ought surely to have been long since made public. We could not dispense with the doubtless more generally amusing and interesting narrative which superseded it; but the true and thankful and understanding lover of Scott must and will readily allow or affirm that ihere are signs of even rarer and finer genius in the canceled fragment of the rejected study.
Mr. Swinburne’s employment of the epistolary form is, of course, facile and entertaining. “ Love’s Cross-Currents" is not exciting reading, but it is good reading. We are permitted by the dedication to assume that it was written many years ago. We should hardly have expected to find Mr. Swinburne busying himself with the little foibles and vanities of society at this stage of his brilliant career. But two examples of the quality of the work will, we fancy, convince the discriminating reader of novels that this book is worth while.
The first letter from which we quote is written by Helena, Lady Midhurst, the epistolary protagonist of this drama in letters, a wise and witty old dowager:
SOME IDEAS OF LADY MIDHURST*
Lady Weils her name was; I had to give her up in the long run; but she was charming at one time, wonderfully bright in her ways, at once quick and soft, as :t were—just my idea of Madame de L£ry, In “ Un Caprice/* She was idolized by all sorts of people, authors particularly, for she used to hunt
*	them down with a splendid skill, and make great play with them when caught; but the things the woman used i to say! and then the people about her j went off and set them all down in their books. The men actually took her stories as samples of what went on dally in a certain circle, and wrote them down, altering the names, as if they j had been gospel. She told me some be- j fore they got Into print; there was nobody she would not mix up in them, and we had to break with her at last in a peaceable way. If you ever see an old novel called (I think) " Vingt-et- j Un/* or some such name—I know there j are cards in it—you will find a picture ! there of your aunt, painted by the auv thor (a Mr. Caddell) after a design by Lady Wells. I am the Lady Manhurst I of that nice book. I cheat at cards; I break the heart of a rising poet, (that is, I never would let Sir Thomas invite Mr. Caddell;) and I make two brothers , fight a duel, and one Is killed through ; my direct agency. I run away with a j Lord Avery; I am not certain that my husband dies a natural death. Indeed, 1 I fancy that I poison him in the last chapter. *	*	*	He was a detestable
man, and had a voice exactly like a. cat with a bad cold in the head. *	*	*
j I always bow when he speaks French in his fearful accent, and that stops him. * * * Our dear C. R. is one of the safest women alive. -Not for other people, mind; not safe for you; not safe by any means for her husband; but as safe for herself as I am, or as the Queen is, *	* * She is wonder-
fully sensible for a clever person* who is (I must maintain) naturally stupid, cr she would^have gone on a higher tack altogether and been one of the most noticeable people alive. It fs exquisite, channing to an old woman, to observe how thoroughly sho is up to all the points of all her games. She amuses herself in all sorts of the most ingenious ways; Vnakrs that wretch ErnesTs i life an Egyptian plague by constant friction of his inside skin and endless

needle probings of his sore mental places; enjoys all kinds of fun, sparingly and heartily at once, like a thoroughly initiated Epicurean, (that woman is an esoteric of the Garden): and never for an instant slips aside from the strait gate and narrow way, while she has all the flowers and smooth paving of the broad one—at least all the enjoyment of them; or perhaps something bettor. She is sublime; anything you like; but she is not wholesome.
FROM ANOTHER WOMAN.
I have had a preposterous letter from Aunt Midhurst; the woman is really getting past her work; her satire is vicious, stupid, pointless to a degree.
Somebody has been operating on her fangs, I suppose, and extracting the venom. It is curious to remember what one always heard about her wit and insight and power of reading character; she has fallen into a sort of hashed style, between a Friench portiSre and a Dickens nurse. It makes one quite sorry to read the sort of stuff she has i come to writing, and think that she ! was once great as a talker and letter- ; writer.
