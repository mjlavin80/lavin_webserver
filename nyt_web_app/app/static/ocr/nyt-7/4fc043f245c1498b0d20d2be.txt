TO JLDITH WHARTON.
After Reading the July Number of Scribner*5 Magazine.
IBYL, endowed with a magical vision* Critic and scribe of our social melee; Splendid the past ia your Vale of Decision,
Keen is the wit in your tales of today.
Under your spell we have sauntered in bowers ' Where Petrarch and Guido perhaps sang their lays.
Changing your mood, you have brightened the hours
With scintillant views of our own divorcees.
Now, in your guidance, we’re threading the mazes
That wind and bewilder beyond comely portals— Offended by Vanity’s ugliest phases,
Shamed by the weakness of poor fellow-mortals— Piercing recesses where scandal has birth.
In the halls of that House of so dubious Mirth.
