** London to the Nore '* Is the title ot a new book dealing with territory between the metropolis and the sea, and is included in the Beautiful Book Series, bearing the Imprint of the Macmillan Company. It is described by Mrs. Wyllie, and the many colored pictures and other sketches are by \V. L. WyUie, A. R. A. The party " does" London to the Nore, along the Thames, and the Medway to Rochester.
The book is made up of a series of traveler’s impressions with what might be called a partly historical and partly contemporaneous backgronnd. Both traveler snd artist ar.d their family, leaving the booming of the "Westminster bells In the distance, are towed in their barge .down the Thames, past Lambeth, to London Bridge, and under Tower Bridge to Mill-'wall; thence down to Greenwich, to Belvedere, and past " the oaken walls of Old England," which are now utilized as training ships or as storehouses for explosives; on to Gravesend, ICorthfleet, Tilbury Docks, Coney Island, to Sheerness, and at last to Rochester. The waters traversed with their contiguous lands are made by both writer and artist to form a gently turned panorama of varied incidents and colors such as the typical tourist has rarely experienced. Something of the author’s temperament in these “ backgrounds" to London's water approach may be gathered from the closing passage in the book:	-■
Our cruise Is over. It is with sadness we watch the barge sail away, taken over by our partner, under another flag. at> American would call this a ** mean moment.” It certainly is so as I watch the vessel disappearing on the horizon* Thinking over all we have seen, I feel I have not described one quarter of the life and movement that have been going on around us all these days. A question arises; Why do ve as a nation tfainfr so much of going abroad 7 Close to our doors lie wonderful scenes. Londoners know very little of the beautiful river on which, they depend. To artists It has always had a peculiar fascination, which we share in common with Turner. Consta.-hle, and Whistler.
