hibiting wonderfully tbe sense of propor- -

. In* subject matter- It • suggests another
remark&ble-poern, J‘ The City of Dreadful
Night,” by James Thomson; but it differs
from that poem In that the human spirit
is not overcome by. the -horrors' that it contemplates.. Thomson's poem,, which, is In Its way ii masterpiece, is the apotheosis ofpesslmism, while in " The ; Haunted -Temple the darkness'' is " riot without gleams of hope., The .blind poet sees life ^and the world with the inner" light that cannot pass away,” to quote from o'ne-.of the stanzas. .This Might is the spirit, of Christ, This spirit is manifested alike by the Divine One assuming all human suffering aiid by'His appeal to the Father:
Thou knowest, Lord, how for ail souls I

The chalice I would pass, were It Thy . will, .	-
Is the word to .any. soul, “Depart, accursed! ”	"

It might have been well, I think, if.. “ The Haunted Temple ’* had . been preceded. by an ** argument,’* after the manner of the earlier classics The poem Is logic ln solution, as can be proved by the proper test of scrutiny. But all readers have not the time or the insight to make such a test. The poem begins appropriately with the w'eird sounds of church bella on a Sabbath morn, dark with .drizzling rain. Ere long the poet's soul, wakened from Its hfeavy slumber spell, stands glaring “like a frozen waterfall,*’ for louder and deeper than the steeple bell, than organ, .choir, and anthem sung by all, is human anguish which, he hears reverberant from the temple’s every stone,
I	shook and had no thought but how to
flee	-	.	.	•
The place of horror. Suddenly a hand Laid gently on*my forehead, strengthened me
To hear the low, sweet Voice, that bade me stand,
Saying: "Behold the Truth! make thou It plain.	-	-
Speak, that the blood ot brother be atoned.	*
Tell those there that they are the kin of Cain.	*■
Speak’ boldly, tho* with scorn thou then
*	be storied.”
•‘What voice have I?” I gasped. ** Thy hate of wrong .
Is voice,” It answered. ** Truth will make*it strong."- .
Mistrusting his vision, he cries, 44 God, Thy light! ”	.
While I stood hesitant, a vivid flare Enveloped me. As soon as I could train My sight to grasp an object in the glare,
I saw blue _yapor where had been the Fane,
And, far below, a cavern, all a-swarm With writhing thingsl A zi&zag stairway, rent
By lightning for the darkness of the storm
And every foulness that, then,' found no vent	.
Led to the pit. A look down made me reel.
II	Descend,” the Voice said; ” one to see
must feel.”
He does' descend, and how vividly he describes. the conditions that made possible the .grand temple which, as Mr. Ri chard-sog points out, “is made of the lifeless dross of the heart and spirit," and constructed by a law ” antipodal,—not one with that of the ascending ' stars and sun! ”
Down was I lowered from daylight. Oh, how bright The clouds appeared then to my eyes astrain!
Oh, for a bud for my Spring-hungry sight!
No echo there relinked joy’s broken chain.
Down, down I sank. Oh. for a gulp of air Cupped by the Evening's bands from out the sea!
Down, down, still down! Can this be death? How bear This dissolution, and still conscious be?
I felt; the voice replied: "Descend thou where
The coal takes blackness from the Soul s despair.”
* * * * * • *
Broader and deeper grew the cavern dim. It was all toll, I saw, where Man must give
Heart, soul, and every gift ennobling him To the Few, more mighty, for the right to live.
*******
On them, and all, there blew a gust of rain.
A green-eyed, batlibe monster, flapping,
•	'brushed
By me and shrieked: “ Give coal a rich, red stain;
It matters not how many hearts are crusiiQcL
Then, torrents fetl. Ah! whence the awful flood?	,
Inquired my heart. “ It is the children, wives,	,
Mothers, and sisters, drained of all their blood—	.
Emptied of joy and hope throughout their lives,”	.	...
Replied my mentor. How I shook with dread.
Hearing dire Want, the Crusher, overhead !
The blood in the mine is seen to rise like fire, revealing on high the shadow of the Divine Form with extended arms. It looms above the desert swept by Conscience, and invokes justice by the Father’s law;
It was His echo that my soul heard groan For justice from the Temple’s every stone.
In glancing over this poem I cannot help smiling at Mr. Clow's contention that imagination ceases with the advance of civilization. Here is a singer who possesses it in its highest form as surely as did Shelley and Keats, and I have not come across any contemporary poet who Is Mr. Doyle’s peer in purely creative work. This, Is abundantly proved not only by “ The Haunted Temple," but by his sonnets, of which there are about thirty in the volume. With Mr. Doyle the sonnet is an epic in epitome, and I would like to quote from this part of his work did space permit.
What is most wonderful to me Is that a man in physical darkness for more than three decades sustains unfalteringly in his
