MR. LEVESON-GOWER’S newly puB-lisbed book of reminiscences. ** Bygone Years/* contains many passages of gossip about distinguished persons, from which Lhe following are selected:
LADY- BLESSING TON.—Lady Blessing-ton is de^ieribed by some modern writers as “the gorgeous Lady Blessington." She was handsome, and had some Irish wit; but her literary performances were poor, i and only got into notice through be- j ing puffed by penny-a-liners whom she entertained at her tabic. I was never in- i side Gore House, but I was told by others who knew it that with some few excep-Uons the company was inferior, and to compare it with that of Holland House, as has sometimes been done, is simply ridiculous.
DICKENS AND THACKERAY.—I once missed meeting Dickens at Chatsworth, who left on the day of iny arrival. Thackeray came that same afternoon, and was anxious to hear about Dickens's visit. He wondered whether he had toadied the Duke very much. My impression is that, though professing to be friends, these two great novelists did not care much for i one another.	j
RUSKIN WAS SNOBBISH.—Ruskin on j one occasion gave a large supper, to which he invited some of the leading un- 1 dergraduates whom he did not. know. His speech on this occasion did not make i a favorahje impression. He said he could 1 hardly express how much he felt hon- ! ored that so many young men who were i superior to him socially should have con- j descended to accent his invitation. This disinclined us to keep up the acquaintance, although we were the losers H thereby.
LOWELL DECLINES IN VERSE.—
How gladly would I, if I might,	'
My Wheaton*3 dreary tome bury,
And hasten with the lessening light To the warm arms of Hoimbury!
iJontcbury’s the spelling I prefer;	!
Oh, could I make a bee-line	!
Thither, to curl me up and purr	:
With comfort more than feline!	!
Alas, It cannot be. for I Am pinioned here in London,
A male Andromeda, to sigh That pledges can't be undone!
His view is Leveson’s chiefest boast. Unconscious that the part of it
His guests see gladliest is their host^ The sunshine at the heart of it;	■
The friendly voice, the manners bland, Tbe culture—not too much of it—
I must forego, the honest hand.
With welcome In the touch of It;
Across the void that hand I press.
And think, the surest rental man.
Mocking at Land Leagues, is the cess All true hearts pay a gentleman.
THE CARLYLES.—My recollection of the latter I Mrs. Carlyle] Is, fitting in a corner busy with her embroidery, with no one speaking to her. One can easily imagine how much so clever a woman must have resented this neglect. I never was converted to \Carlyle’s views, bat I could not help being fascinated by his eloquence, originality, and vehement abuse of everybody and everything, which in most people would be repellent, but in him was amusing. *	*	* One day
Louisa, Lord Ashburton's second wife, who continued to show Him the same kindness as her predecessor, asked Lady Marian Alford and me to meet him a.t dinner. We 'were therefore a party of four, and all through the repast the two ladies fervently worshipped the great man, which he did not take amiss. As I am not a hero worshipper, and disliked some of his opinions, I maliciously introduced the subject of slavery. Mr. Car-lvle rose to tho occasion, defended slavery, and vilified the abolitionists. The two ladies, who had tender hearts afid abhorred slavery irom the bottom of their , souls, wore much disturbed. “ Oh. Mr. Carlyle, do not say that! You cannot mean it. Have you ever read Mrs. Stowe? ” “A poor, foolish woman who wrote a book of wretched trash called
4	Unde Tom’s Cabin.* " My purpose was achieved, and for a short time the adoration abated. • * * Our hostess said to ; Mr. Carlyle, “I hope you will not mind j our leaving you; wo are going to the the- -atre to see Eechter act Hamlet." To her < astonishment he told her he would like to I accompany her. He had not been inside 1 a theatre for years, and his delight at the performance was great. " The fellow is J not so bad, after alL Dear met That Is j capital! " All this was said In so loud a . < voice that every moment I expected the j audience to call the philosopher to order, j
