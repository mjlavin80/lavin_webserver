In a very few pages Miss Bacon tells the history of the development of flying machines. It may be objected that that development is not very great. Grant that, yet Miss Bacon is to he commended for her moderation* nevertheless, for the history of such development as we have goes back to 1782—123 years, and Macaulay used three volumes in telling of the events of nineteen years. Balloons and their successors, airships and flying machines. date frcm Novfmber, 1782. when Etienne and Joseph Montgolfier wondered what made hot air rise, and it they could not n.ake use of hot air to make other things rise also. There had been attempts at flying before tfcat time; but they ha-3 no practical results. The Montgolfiers’ experiments had results, which have been of use to mankind.
The most interesting of these was the balloon and pigeon-post service carried on during the siege of- Paris, thirty-four years ago. Sixty balloons were made in the city, of which fifty-two got safely away, carrying 200 persons and 2.Fi00,000 letters, and sixty pigeons returned, with some 100,000 messages. Gambetta, as Miss Bacon reminds us, was a passenger in the first balloon; and Janssen, the astronomer, who later built an observatory
on Mont Bianc, left the city with hU precious’ telescope in order that, he might observe a -total eclipse of the sun* visible in Spain and Algeria. Ho escaped safely, but the sky was overclouded, and the eclipse invisible from his station.
-In war, balloons.have been useful, but otherwise aeronautics have been of little
Jiractical use as yet. There is more chance or the airship than for the balloon to-day, and Miss Bacon ^describes succinctly man's efforts to conquer the air as he has to some extent- conquered the land with railrctads~and pother means, of . transportation and. thosca with .ships. ..Her. story is .-well told, and, as .technical!-reties - are avoided* is interesting. a$ welU-~:\ I:
