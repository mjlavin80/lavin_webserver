New York.Times Book Review:
John Henry Gristle invites discussion ot Edwin. Markham's Virgilia,” and quotes two stanzas. In the first line, " Do you mind " is too commonplace to be poetical.
“ Divine '* in the second line cannot legitimately be made*to qualify “ alarms*” The rhyming of '* alarms with “ arms *’ is devoid of connection and appears labored and unnatural. The measure of the fourth line is awkward. In the next verse, “ swords "•***' rent with rust ” and " seas run dust ” are both inappropriate. The connection in both verses is so untrue to the reality as to cause a revulsion, and one wishes the poet had made better selections. The mind is jarred and shocked, instead of being, what one might expect from such a delightful subject, soothed by a song.
The greatest trial to the -reader who really endeavors to get Into the spirit of the subject by trying to interpret the mind of the author is that he has to give it up in despair. In other words, it is so difficult to catch the sense that he has to pass it over, out of respect to the poet, who has given the world so many good things.
Possibly tho two verses are not fair examples of the whole piece.	■
