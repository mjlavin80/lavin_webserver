In the Augrust Harper, John Kendrick Bangs sounds " A Call to Arms ” to the poets because ’* a New York department store offers * fifty-cent poets marked down to 10 cents ’ as an inducement to buyers at its present special Monday sale." *' Who,” he exclaims, ** are these fifty-cent bards', bearing the laurel and crown ? " He is shocked to-lenm that they are Browning, Bryant, Poe, Milton, Tennyson, Scott—all the great ones. This is too much for the author of " The Idiot at the Breakfast Table,” though Milton at 10 cents ought to ** make for culture.” Mr. Bangs sings:
Must Paradise Lost or Regained Be hitchcd to a lace collarette?
Must Lalla Kookh ever be chained To corset or silk pantalette?
Shall Arthur, Lucille, or Lenore, Hiawatha, or Harold the Childe,
Be used as an ambassador Of a n§glig£e shirt or a 44 biled”?
In the August Harper, also, Mary E. Wilkins Freeman, tlie author of “ Giles Corey ” and “ Jane Field,” drops into comic verse. She carols of Sadie, with peroxide hair, who works in a Broadway store, and talks alway with Gladys and Mae. A Queen, crowned and velvet gowned, comes ln timidly.
Then she said to the Queen, with an air
SGI*0I1G
And a tilt of her pompadour;
** Them samplcs’s too cheap; we don’t never keep
Them kinds in this first-class store.”
Mrs. Freeman has two nonsense stanzas about the ostrich:
The ostrich is a silly bird.
With scarcely any mind.
He often runs so very fast.
He leaves himself behind.
And when he gets there, has to stand And hang about till night.
Without a blessed thing to do Until he comes in sight.
