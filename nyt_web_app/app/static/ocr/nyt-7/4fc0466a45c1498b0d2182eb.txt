The publications of the Carnegie Inst!-tute at Washington, now issued, some in octavo and some in Quarto volumes, paper, include much valuable scientific matter on many heterogeneous, subjects. A mere recital of, the titles of these various volumes may well begin with ” The Guide to the Archives of the Government of the United States In Washington/* which will be of immense service to investigators of the National records and Is the work of Claude Halstead Van Tyne and Waldo Gifford Leland. To this may be added “ Report on the Diplomatic Archives of the Department of State, 1789-1S40,” by Andrew C. McLaughlin.
Taking the others as they come we have “ The Mythology of the Wichita,” a fat octavo, by George A. Dorsey, containing renderings of Indian legends of the tribe named, and “ Traditions of tho Arlkara,” a thinner volume, dealing siml-J larl.v with the tribe of that name. There are a number of treatises dealing with. Insects, microscopic organisms, and such matters; “Researches on North American Acridiidae,” by Albert Pitts Morse;
*' Contributions to the Study of the Behavior of Lower Organisms,” by Herbert S. Jennings; " Coloration In Polistes,” by Wilhelmino M. Enteman; similar scientific inquiries Into botanical matters, as ** Mutants and Hybrids of the Oenotheras,” by D. T. MacDougal; ** Desert Bo-tanioal Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution,” by Frederick Vernon Coville and Daniel Trembly MacDougal, and “ Fecundation ln Plante,” by David M. Mot- j tier, Ph. D. Still other titles are these:
** Heredity of Coat Characters in Guinea Pigs and Rabbits,” by W. E. Castle;

M. D„ and “ A Statistical Inquiry toto the Probability of Causes of the Produc- | tion of Sex in Human Offspring,** the 1 work of Simon Newcomb. Two other vol-uroes deal, one with ** The Influence of Grenville on Pitt's Foreign Policy, 17871708 "—this by Ephraim Douglass Adams —and ** A New ’Method for Determining , Compressibility,” by Theodore William Richards and Wilfred Newsome Stull. All these are octavos and all are elaborately illustrated with plates and dia-gTams, the first often In colors where color Is an advantag«-
A very hnndsome and elaborate 4to of 270 pages is “ Water Lilies:	A	Mono-
graph of the Genus Nymphara," by Henry S. Conard. This is richly furnished with colored and other plates which must i rejoice the heart of the botanist. Another 4to is a contribution to “ stellar statistics,” and being so is terrifically math-em at leal. The title is ** On the Position of the Galactic and Other Principal Planes Toward Whicb the Stars Tend to Crowd." Simon Newcomb Is the author. The third and last of the 4tos deals with corals}, and the title reads "The Coral Siderastrea Radians and Its Post-Larval Development.” This is the work of J. E. Duer-den. The whole is a valuable collection of the scientific results of some of that first-hand investigation of all sorts of 1 things which the Carnegie Institution was founded to encourage and make possible under th« advantageous condition of eni dowment.
