HAVE read the book of Capt.
' -Battine concerning which J
*	there has been so much dls-J,cussion !n your columns,' but * I have noticed the obvious I bias of- the commentators, and their frequent inaccura- j cles. Mr. Shrady, whose last long letter ■ I have just read, does not impress me as.! being1 a competent critic. His citations j from* alleged authorltlfes as£ not convlnc- j ing, and some of them are hardly worth noticing:. The " Memoirs " of Gen. Gmut have always been treated with great tenderness for reasons easily understood, but it is time to consider them on their merits alone. Gen. Grant’s rising military reputation was badly scorched at Shiloh. He was an interested party, and his views concerning his own acts are to be scrutinized carefully. Whether unconsciously or otherwise, his chapters upon Shiloh constitute an adroit piece of special pleading. He had been careless to a degree which he would have later denounced in another as gross and inexcusable, He was leisurely preparing to " hunt the tiger." whom he had confidently declared a few hours before he would have to go to Corinth to find. But the tiger was close upon him, and hunted him before h’e had time even to get on his elephant. He estimated (erroneously, it is true) the force opposed to him as double his own, and he—or rather his army—was on the wrong side nf a deep river, and in a position where, in case of an attack, concerted action bn the part of the various divisions would be difficult at best. He threw up no intrench men ts, and he made no attempt to hurry up reinforcements already at hand; he even discouraged haste on the part of the capable officer who commanded them, for he had no expectation of fighting a battle at Shiloh. The criticism which was showered on him shortly after was much of it just, for he was careless and he was surprised.
Fortunately for the country, he was permitted to remain in the service, to develop into a great commander.
The passage quoted triumphantly by Mr. Shrady as demonstrating that there was no surprise ought not to blind the eyes of the veriest tyro who Is looking for the truth. It is of little consequence who fired the first shot when the party sent out in the darkness by Gen. Prentiss unexpectedly encountered ihe corps of Gen. Hardee. The real question—thus artfully befogged—is this:	Did Gen. Grant or
either of his division commanders, when they rose that morning, know, or even suspect, that an army superior to their own was at that moment in line of battle within striking distance of their pickets, and had they made the necessary preparations for the terrible battle which opened a few minutes later? The inevitable answer is that they did not. and they had not. To say that Gen, Grant was “ momentarily expecting” an attack of the kina' is the veriest nortsense, for his words, his letters, and his acts emphatically contradict it. His Tame would be more perfect and complete to-day if he had tacitly admitted the fact of a surprise and let it go at that.
Mr. Shrady quotes what he seems to think are the words of William Cullen Bryant in support of a moribund theory. The history bearing that honored name is generally understood to be mostly the work of a journalistic hack, who was as far as possible from being a historian in
the proper sense. It is not an authority, and the passage he quotes has very little truth behind it. A very candid review of the charges against Secretary Floyd may be found by Mr. Shrady in Rhodes, Vol. TTT-. Pages 5lS and 233. It is not worth while to notice his other “ authority ** on the subject.	H.	E.	D.

[Our correspondent is mistaken in his impression that the so-callcd Bryant's History of the United States " was the work of a journalistic hack. The text of that book was written largely by the late Sydney Howard Gay. a man of broad culture, and a journalist of high standing in the middle of the last century and until well along in the seventies. ‘ Mr1. Gay had filled executive posts on The, New York Tribune and Chicago Tribune : before he became responsible editor of The Evening Post in this city. Mr. Bryant read the manuscript of the history, and, we believe, made many suggestions and emendations. Mr. Gay’s name appeared on the title page. Of course, these facts do not weaken our correspondent's arguments in the least. But the expression " journalistic hack," ap-
