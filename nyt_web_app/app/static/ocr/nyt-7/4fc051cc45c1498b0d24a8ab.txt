Vew York Times 'liooh Rcoicto:
The letter which H. R. sent to Thh 1 Times book Rkview last week with ref-i erence to. Channing Pollock’s story, “ The ‘ Patch of Sunshine,” published in the current Metropolitan, interests me very much. Obviously H. R.‘is complaint was based on the firm belief that-it could not be possible that there should-have been any except the material explanation of. the story. As a matter o£ fact, it seems to nje quite reasonable that 11 The Patch of Sunshine ” should have been the ghost of a real patch. There is a society in England, the London ’philosophical Society, which publishes regularly a pamphlet of actual occurrences, many of which are more remarkable than this piece of fiction. Not more than five years ago I myself had an experience which baffled my Intelligence exactly , as the” episode in ** The Patch of Sunshine ” baffled the Intelligence of H. k. 1 was livirig at the time Irt a small ho-use in the Bronx, and was continually pusxled by the appearance of what seemed ’to b6' the shadow .of a human being on a wall in the gavden.	1
This shadow was not I. for it remained	|
stationary when X moved. Careful explo-	I
ration failed to reveal any person in the	I
neighborhood Whose shadow it could have been. The mystery, was never solved;
! never traced either to a natural or supernatural cause. I am quite as practical as the hero of Mr.' Pollock's story, but I ‘ would take an oath that I saw the shadow.
Under the circumstances I may be pardoned for refusing to feel that a practical explanation of The Patch of Sunshine ” is necessary. CYRIL TYLER.
