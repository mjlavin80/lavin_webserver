It's moist s’rprisin*, 1 eddy—an* it's a i leddy we're thin kin’ ye'll be by yer name —that when the pioneers went aw a* frae Scotland tae Canady they tuk sic* a wheen "o' auld releegious notions wi’ them. An' it’s mair s’rprisln', when ye come tae gle the maitter conseederation, that the same releegious speerit should mak’ a buik in : Canady when Jeems Barrie an' ither lit'-rary chlels that howk their row in an* ! aroon’ Glesca should hae hammered it oot j sae often in Scotland,
We're no gainsayin’, leddy, that whaur ! twa or three Scots are gaithered the- j gither in His Name there’s mair girnln’ than worship, but—losh, freen', an’ it*a a dreary subject ye've chosen for a wumman o' your talents—as bleak as the hills whaur It was born, an* fegs, it must hae been a gey damp nicht when St. Columba landit an’ first preached it- For a* that, there’s a wheen o’ things in yer bit bulk, leddy, that’s true; but If ye was tae ask auld Wully McIntosh, that's aye baudin’ up the street corner, we hae nae doot he wad wag his held an’ say there’s mony a thing that can be gey true ’ithoot bein’ gey int’restin’. He might tell ye that Duncan Polite, yer auld hero, though a burnin' an’ shinin' light In the commew-nlty o’ Glenoro, was mebbe a wee bit hipped on the subject o’ that covenant he. had wi* the Lord. When his nephew didna come up tae his notions o’ propriety, an’ got drunk insteed o’ enterin’ the meenistry, o’ coorse auld Duncan tuk it salr. But they things happen every day, leddy, particularly wr the folks that ye’d look tae be settih’ a better example. We’re no eweer’t tae say, though, that yer last chapter but ane was fine, whaur auld Duncan loosens up the log-jam, frail as the puir decrippit body was at the time. There’s mony a scand’lous tongue—an’ we think we heard Mrs. McPherson, or mebbe It was Mrs. McDougal, say last' night that auld Duncan commeetit suicide; byt if he thocht it was a sacrifice, wha* can say him nae, noo that he's deid, puir man?	'
Well, that was bonnie. We maun but
say we sniffled a wee bit ower it. But how they wumman o’ the kirk did gabble!
If they'd gabbled in a learned, or mebbe a droll way, we'd hae forgi’en them—but they jist gabbled! Ay, that’s true tae the Scotch kirk wumman, but as Wully McIntosh used tae say, a thing can be gey true 'Ithoot—Anyhow, it wad hae made a bonnie, wee short story.
