ALILXIS Dt TOCQUE.VILLE.
I The French Student of Our Democra-|	cy Whose Centenary Is Cele-
brated To-Day.
HEN in 1830 Alexis de Tocqueville landed in the United States with the avowed and cherished purpose of making a study of democracy in America he was but twenty-five years of ag-e, and the Republic, even i£ we date its life from the Declaration of Independence, was hardly more than twice that age. He came with the alert curiosity of a very young man, somewhat precociously serious, but with the eagerness and the keenness and the M long thoughts ** of youth to study what was then a very great novelty. He found here an independent* energetic, progressive, prosperous democracy that had fought two wars with the most powerful of the monarchic nations, winning completely in one and substantially in the other, a democracy that had worked out a federal system under a written Constitution, the first in the history of the world, and was proceeding to attack the vast, complex, appalling problem of National life, with the organisation of a continent as the goal and disintegration and subjugation as the sure consequences of a failure which seemed not only possible but probable. To understand how difficult was the task the young Frenchman took in hand, we have but to compare it with
!
that of Mr. Bryce some fifty years later. The	con;	trast Is very impressive, and the writer whose	cen-
I
tenary Is celebrated to-day does not suffer in thtf comparison. Certainly as a Nation we may fairly acknowledge a greater debt to the French than to the English student, since he observed with equal impartiality and penetration conditions far more	con-
j	fused and gave the fruits of his observations	to a
world at once densely ignorant and, for the most part, if not hostile, either indifferent or prejudiced*
De Tocqueville was judicial by inheritance. On his father's side he was descended from a family of jurists, which in France at that time meant something quite different from a family of lawyers. On , his mother’s side the family were lawyers of the highest grade, and his grandfather was that Males-herbes who returned from his safe refuge in Switzerland to defend Louis XVX, not through loyalty to
the King, whom he neither loved nor trusted, but
i ■
j from loyalty to the cause of justice, and followed his royal client to the guillotine. The young De Tocqueville was educated for the bench, and very early won a considerable place under the Bourbon restoration, with its strange velleities toward experiments in constitutionalism. He was chief of a bureau in the Department of Justice when he came to America, primarily to study our prisons, on which he made a report widely noted at the time, which would have gained him more fame had it not been eclipsed by the “ Democracy.”

It is no wonder that the young Republic attracted j him. The terrible Revolution, the splendid despotism of the First Empire, were recent history to him, and ! he was himself engaged under a Government that was trying rather blindly and amid great dangers to ! reconcile liberty, with order through the monarchic system, and was sinking steadily to its fall. On this , side the ocean a tike problem was being worked out by a very different people in very different condi; tions. It was the patriot as well as the political phil' osopher who sought here light on the puzzling and difficult future, of which tho peril was far more ob-
*	vious and Impressive than its promise. The study ho _ t . . _ _ - - - -
made of democracy In America may still be read with' * interest and profit. In' its time it was themost .re-,
t. - ■
markable work of its kind ever undertaken- If it seems in some ways strikingly defective and, tn minor ways, mistaken, we have to recall the immense j changes that have taken place and think what the i student would have done with like gifts, say, two generations later. Last year the world celebrated at i St. Louis the centenary of the acquisition by the [ United States of a territory now as populous as France. When De Tocqueville visited St, Louis he walked twenty-five miles through a wilderness from a point on the river where he had been stranded and the boat frozen in. The wonder is that in those crude, wild, struggling times he saw with so much clearness the real tendencies of the forces at work. He went back to France to publish his “ Democracy in America," to write his “ Ancien Regime,” which was In Its way quite as remarkable, and to take an honorable though not conspicuous part in the public affairs of bis country. Though not one of the greatest of political philosophers, he was a man of peculiarly high aims to whom our Nation owes an especial debt.	E. C.
