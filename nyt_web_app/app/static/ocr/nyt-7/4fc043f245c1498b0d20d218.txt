Jessup’s ■* Charm of Youth.”
, .Vcm York Times Book Rcvicto:
i I am glnd to call attention in your columns to tlie work of a new American i poet who seems to me to be or much promise. The poet is Alexander Jessup, 1 j whose volume, ** The Charm of Youth,” has j«*,t been published in Boston. In ; many of his lyric lines I feel the pulse of j the true poetic life, and here and there my senses were caught with the freshness of his spirit, and tones that had the j
weather, (Stevenson's lme, " the fresh- ! ness of the weather clings"!) and the [ brightness of eyes, and the laughing out of youth in them—the best of the volume has the touches of the anthology.
In brier, the book is full of poetical 1 stuff, much of it very deftly handled, and full of originality, though the first poem in the volume, " First Love Remembered,’' seems to me too closely modeled on George Meredith'*? "Love in the Valley yet ft would be going too far to call it an imitation. Some of the epigrams interspersed among the longer poems are admirable,. For example, this suggests Landor, and is worthy of him:
w	MEMORY.
Who would to constant Youth belong, Love Memory's fond arrears;
She only of the maiden throng Fades not with passing years.
The poet has a genuine singing note, which is rare. Here, among many others) equally good or better, is a lyric worthy of preservation In the anthologies:
LOVE’S IMMORTALITY.
In youth, when stars were in the sky,
I waited for you, Sun;
Vain all night’s myriad pageantry,
I knew no light but One!
i
Now in my night that knows not day.
Far off faint planets shine;
No strange light lures me. on my way, Who knew no light but thine.
In view of tho agitation of Mr. Arthur Stringer and others in regard to the poet’s place in modern life, as recently voiced in your columns, this consolatory epigram by Mr. Jessup is commendable:
A HEAVEN OF SONG.
Sing, Poet! if you sing one song of worth,
Then you may count as naught all earthly ills;
Hcav'n lies about the poet here on earth—
Is not Parnassus one of heaven’s hills?
Among other Admirable poems is one caiied " How the Satyr Found Dian a Venus," which suggests Frangois Villon, and is not unworthy of him. The worlfcof this poet seems to me to be worth taking trouble about. I hope the book will be recognized at its full value.
