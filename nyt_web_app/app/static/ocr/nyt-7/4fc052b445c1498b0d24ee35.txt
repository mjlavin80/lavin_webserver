We are informed in the suggestive little leaflet which serves as a prospectus to this edition—tho lost six volumes of which are now before us—that Mr. Warner M is almost the last of the representative American men of letters to have his complete writings collected in a uniform library edition/’ We had pleasant, although somewhat vague recollections
of those novels* “That Fortune,” (Vol. XIII,;) “Golden House," (Vol. XII.:) "A Little Journey in the World,” (Vol. XI..) and '* Their- Pilgrimage,” (Vol. X.) Wo also remembered the wise and witty sayings concerning contemporary culture ex- I tracted from the Editor’s Drawer of Harper’s Magazine and published in little hoi-lday volumes in 1891 and 1893, under the respective titles of " As We Were Saying" and M As We Go," which, together with ,4 Fashion in Literature ” are in- | eluded in Vol. XIV. of tho definitive edi- ) tion. Moreover, the delightfully easy manner and precise taste of presenting j well-worn subjects in such addresses and I essays as " Simplicity," “ Equality,"
“ Thoughts Suggested by Froude’s Progress," “ What Is Culture to Me?" and I “ The People for Whom Shakespeare Wrote," (Vol. V.,) have remained to us a pleasant recollection of conversation and comment amid the enthusiastic female friends of our student days. The 1 first impressions of Washington Irving as a man of letters received by many men of reasonably mature years can also be I traced to Mr. Warner's,gentle, patient, and conscientious literary labors.
It was therefore with a keen desire to I revive youthful literary impressions I that we seized the opportunity presented 1 by the Backlog edition—TJ&iat new and I pleasurable emotions might not these pages bring forth now that some years of partly academic and partly desultory I reading had tempered our judgment and broadened the sense of appreciation. But. alas! Impressions would not be revived I and emotions of the anticipated kind
would not come forth. Of course, the I fault is all ours, but a rereading of Warner proved dull, unenthusiastic, unprofit- I able labor. His pretty little contrasts of character, his playful yet decorous jests J at men and maidens of the past generation, and his gentlemanly censure of the foibles and frailties of the society of that generation fell short of conviction* The dialogues and incidents of his stories, which we had once read under the conviction that, we were literary, no l<inger found a responsive chord where once the whole scale of innate and erudite artistic i appreciation would have vibrated with sweet, melodious sounds.
We trust that this dismal experience will prove to be no criterion of appreciation and taste, Cor Thomas R. Lounsbury has done his best to render it naught in the clever and appreciative sketch of Mr. Warner which accompanies the fifteenth volume. The publishers, too, have done their best to emphasize the importance and permanency of the author—the fine large type, the unglazed paper with uncut deckle edges, the sedate green cloth bindings, and tho paper labels on the backs , of the volumes all give a just and appreciative setting to the' Charles Dudley Warner of our youth. Nor should the endeavors of the artists to do poetic justice bo ignored when recording the steps in this apotheosis. W. Granville Smith, Louiso Rogers, C. Allen Gilbert, Helena E. Ogden, Seymour M. Stone, Peter Newell, and C. S. Reinhart, through their varied form3 of pictorial inspiration, have done their utmost In photogravure, half-tone, and pen and Ink to keep tho scenes of the novels before us as well as the face of the author.
After all. It is inconsiderate Of tho im-1 pressions and Influences of our youth and of the literary taste of those who Inspired and nurtured them, to attempt here to pronounce a final word on Warner. For What he did deserves, at least, grateful remembrance, and certainly - the Hazlltt in him deserves this complete and handsome edition of his works.
