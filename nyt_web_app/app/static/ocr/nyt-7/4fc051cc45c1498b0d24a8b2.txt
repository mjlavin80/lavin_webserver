j Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan has bought the library of text books and other school books collected for the late Dr. Henry Bernard of Hartford, Conn., and presented it to the Wadsworth Athenaeum of that city. There are more than 10,000 books In the collection. Of these 4,500 are of large value for their rarity. Mr. F.
B.	Gay, the Wadsworth’s librarian, has Just placed some of these rarer books on exhibition. Besides a complete collection of books used in American schools before 1850, including, of course, the New England Primer and the early Dutch A-B-C books, there are odd volumes that have nothing to do with schools. Among these, oddly enough, are a 1605 edition of "** Don Quixote," printed In Madrid, and a copy
of the 1729 forgery of the first edition of Boccaccio’s ** Decameron." The Hartford Courant says that Charles Hoole’s " Art of Teaching School,” a rare book, is one
of the acquisitions, only two other copies having been catalogued in other libraries, one in the British Museum and one in the Bodleian Library at Oxford.
