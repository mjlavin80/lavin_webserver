HE St Louts Exposition is responsible for the chief novelty in bookbinding of the past year. At that fair Cedric Chivers of Bath, England, exhibited specimens of his so-called M velluccnt’* bindings, and took a gold medal for them. When the fair had closed he established a branch of his bindery in this city, and had for a time a special exhibition of his goods.
Mr, Chivers's productions deserve attention both on account of their beauty and their utility. The latter may be considered first, for without his patented improvements it would be impossible to produce results permanent enough to be beautified with his bindings. Ur. Chivers* s improvements consist in sewing the pages to the ordinary binding tapes instead of merely passing the stitches over the tapes; in joining the sections at seven or more points instead of at two or three; in fastening the end papers to the book by linen hinges, which serve as joints to the covers, thus making the book more flexible and durable. If the cover of an ordinary book be torn off, the volume is ready to fall to pieces; the cover of a Chivers book must be cut off, and then the volume ca.n be rebound without resewing.
Mr. Chivers Is binding many books for public libraries, estng his patented style of sewirg. For the Brooklyn Public Library he Is binding upward of 5,000 volumes. As bound in pigskin these books may be opened at any page and will stay open; they may be doubled over backward without being injured. It is to be hoped that some of our American binders may become licensees of Mr. Chivers. for work as cheap and as good as his Js needed in this country sadly.
u Books should be bound once for all," is Mr. Chivers’s motto. On fine books Ihus assembled and sewed he puts a remarkably beautiful style of binding. Hs uses the regular	leather	bindings,	of
^course; but he has a special form, which he calls vellucent This, as he admits at once, is a new and improved form of ,nn old and discarded process. Briefly, it ennsists in covering books with vellum, made	transparent	by a process of	his
own.	Under this	vellum,	however,	he
places decorative designs. These ara applied in various ways, appropriate !o the volume to be bound: as panels in leather bindings, or as decorations covering the entire	book and	visible	through	the
vc-Jlum binding, without the use of leather. In England ho has applied his vellucent binding^ directly to manuscripts, covering each leaf find so protecting the writing as completely as if it were between glass plates, yet leaving the manusenn* quite as easy to handle as before the vellum was applied. Some very beautiful work has been done by Mr. Chivers, who has enlisted to his aid the services of many well-known English decorators. He hope3 to secure American decorators as well.
American binders have done little new. A book. ot> which an important bindery has been working for eighteen * months and will work for sfce months longer. Is practically a catalogue of the Bishop collection of jade in the Metropolitan Museum. The binding of this is conventional, however; six. sets, destined for European *' personages of high rank,*’ are decorated with designs drawn from the carved jade described and pictured in the volumes, and will represent when j finished the. highest type of American ! binding. :	-	,
A' noteworthy book, from : every point 1 of view. Is Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan's data! logue of his Chinese' porcelains. Mr. Morgan. has. given copies to various public libraries, where It:may be studied. It is. bound In yellow, in red« and.in green, the. copies- in -the last1 color being the most numerous - and the most beautiful. The binding is striking' because of its eim-' plicity, gold being applied coniparatively sparsely, the only'design being a Chinese double . curve repeated in the corners of the covers and on the panels of the back.. Distinction is gained by the simplicity of the whole, and' the richness of the ihateriais used. '	' '	'

An English book not yet exhibited Is John Parkinson’s *f Paradisi in sole Para-* disus Terrae,” reprinted 'in 1904 from tho first edition of 1029. This, is 'bound- hi a body of crushed green .levantr. with a heavy* Inlay ot byown -andiblue, in a.de-; sign showing- a trellised ^alk eova^
flowering vines, the colors of which are reproduced. A heavy border of vines and 'rosea surrounds this panel, which is rc-peated on the back cover. Some of the new English bindings have miniatures Inset—notably a copy of Lord Rosebery’s ** Napoleon, the Last Phase,” which has five miniatures on its front cover (Marie Louise, Josephine, Napoleon, and two of the King of Rome) and one, Napoleon, on its back cover; and a copy of James Boa-den’s “ Inquiry into the Portraiture of Shakespeare,” which has the Chandos portrait on its front cover and the Droes-hout on Its back. These miniatures are on ivory, protected by glass. The effect cannot be described as beautiful. Paintings concealed In the gilding of the edges are to be found in some new bindings—an old trick now being revived.
In “ edition bindings "—the cloth covers of modern novels and similar books, bound by the tens of thousands—improvements are to be noted. The inlaying on some of these is remarkably well don e-^astoni shingly so, when the low price of the books is considered. Decorations in type have been, tried with good effect, and though an important cheap edition of Stevenson’s works appears in a cover strikingly suggestive of the now happily discarded bindings of the Bohn libraries, the tendency of the year in " edition " work Is in the direction of dignified simplicity, at least among the better class of publishers. The covers of holiday editions, of course, are ln a class by themselves; but among those of last year there was an improvement over former years, and some excellent covers were produced.
