ATURALLY, on picking up the August number of The Century, an uncommonly rich number, by the way, one turns first to Mr. Kipling's new story. Its* place is not at the head of the table, (of contents,) aa might have been expected, but the twenty-third, immediately preceding the editorial departments. Yet we fancy that many mature readers, capable of feeling the comforting charm of a style both sound and wholly individual, and susceptible to the subtlest denotements of character, will esteem it highly. The story as a story Is of the simplest. The theme itself is essentially a Henry James theme, and the underlying idea (the principal one) is the contrast of character as developed on American soil with English character. There are a dozen or more stories In Mr, James's books which the well-informed reader may recall as having a certain recognizable yet remote likeness to this. On the other hand there is not another short story in the English language just like this. In weave and pattern it is unique. It is short and it involves a small host of personages each of whom is distinctly defined, a complex human personality. It involves both a death and a birth, each of which the narrator, without any display of effort, invests with the pathos that belongs to it. The incidental pictures of English rural scenery, architecture, interior decoration one mentally absorbs with delight. There is a rich abundance of detail, beautifully blended. The humor is all-pervasive. In these later years the author of M Plain Tales from the Hills ” has done nothing better.	I	.fg
