** Cunctator ” defends the use of the '* an ° form of the indefinite article before '* h *' sounded with such smug assertiveness that I would like to know what authority supports him. In Brown's Grammar of English Grammars, I find (Page 4S5} Obs. 13:
** Respecting the form of the indefinite article present practice differs a little from that of our ancient writers. * An ’ was formerly used before all words beginning with ' H,’ and before several other words which are now pronounced in such a manner as to require * a*’ Thus we read i in Lhe Bible ' An help.’ ‘ an house.' &c/’ I have looked at the Century Dictionary, th« Imperial, Worcester’s, Webster’s, and the Standard, and in all I find under | *' habit *’ and “ habitation ” quotations in ; which “ a" precedes the words.
