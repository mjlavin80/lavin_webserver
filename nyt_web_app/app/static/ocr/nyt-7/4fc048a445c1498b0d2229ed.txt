One of the strange features of the recent much-advertised revival of interest in the writings of Oscar WHv2e is the persistent circulation of a report that Wilde is not dead. This did not originate, we are confident, outside of thnt group of persons who profess to believe that Wilde was a great man of letters. The outside public was never enough interested in him to make him the subject of gossip.
Hitherto The New York Tjmes Book * Review has paid no attention to the report that the story of his death was false. It ia piven publicity, however, by otir sedate monthly contemporary, The Critic. A writer who signs himself George S. Vierck repeats the words of a woman who said Wilde was living in a Spanish monastery, and those of a clerk in an unidentified book shop in New York, who declared he had lately seen Wilde in New York and talked with him.
