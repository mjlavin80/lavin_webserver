Kcto Torh Times Booh Review:
Tour correspondent Cunctator, who has written so peremptorily about the asplra-tion or “ exasperation ” of H and the indefinite article ** an,” is scored in Thh New York Times book review of July 15, as I supposed he would be. I notice,
I however, that nothing is said in rejoinder 1 to his assertion that the improper use or disuse of the vexed letter is confined to [ the uneducated * classes. My experience prompts me to say that this blemish, in orthography is largely due to environment, and that it is found even among : the most highly educated- WhenM was young I knew a gentleman of the highest culture and refinement, a literary 'man, too, editor of one of the newspapers in London, who made sad havoc of the h. One day in traveling to London, with him and other gentlemen some one In the railroad carriage laughed at him tor wearing a straw hat, which was not a common article of headgear when I was young in England* He rejoined as follows: '* A 'at Is the most 'orrid part of a man's hattire. When your 'ead’s ’ot you I don’t know what to do with your *at; you I can’t carry it in your 'and, it .looks so I hodd.” I have carried this sentence about with me for over fifty years- The same i gentleman once upon a time in my hear--' ! ing gave the following quotation: *' And j give to hairy nothings a local 'abltatlon ! hand a name.’1	Q.
