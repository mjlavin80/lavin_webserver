Christianity is not a philosophy, but a Church; not a theory, but an Institution; not an intellectual idea, but a moral personality.

It leans more heavily upon the present than the past, and though it often borrows from the future, pince. to use the formula of eyo-

! Thus writes the Rev. Vincent McNabb. * O. P., in his paper on " Infallibility,” which was originally delivered before the Society of St. Thomas of Canterbury, and which Is shortly to appear in brochure form through Longmans, Green & Co., with an introduction by the Rev. Spencer Jones, .	A.,	President of the
society. Mr. McNabb defines the object, nature, subject of infallibility, the objections against it, and some antecedent probabilities. He says of the Bible ln the course of^the beginning of this paper:

If ever it is recognized that tho New Testament, like the Old Testament, Is not everywhere the work of one pen, even when It seems to. be. the ' theory * of a Teaching Church will nave nothing to Xeai*.	i:
