LIFE OP GEORGE U. SMITH, Pounder of Sedalia, Mo. In Its Relations to the Political, Economic, and Social Ufo of Southwestern Missouri. Before and During the Civtl War. Ety Samuel Bannister Harding. Ph. D., Junior Professor of History In Indiana University, Sedalia, Mo. Privately printed.
The present volume contains—along with much matter of rather narrow personal and family interest—a good deal that will serve as grist for the ultimate historian. George Rappeen Smith was a native of Powhatan County, Va., born in 1804. His father emigrated to Kentucky soon afterward, and there the lad grew up to manhood and married Melita Ann, daughter of Gen. David Thomson, a neighbor, also a Virginian by birth. In 1833 Smith and Thomson, his father-in-law, both moved' to Missouri with their slaves and household furniture. Smith was a Whig and active in his party. He was also a frequent, If generally unsuccessful, candidate for office, inclining as time went on more and more (in spite ot his slave holding) to a Northern view of the great question of the time. He became first a Know Nothing and then a Republican, and at the critical time when Missouri wavered In the. balance was active in keeping her in the Union.
During a part of the crisis G. R. Smith was Adjutant General of the State. Again he was instrumental in abolishing slavery in Missouri, seeing that step as a necessary consequence of the resolution to stand by the Union. Gen, Smith was not in field service at any time, but after the war he was an active and radical Republican, a hater of Andrew Johnson, and an eager adherent of the harsh policy toward the conquered States instituted by Thad-deus Stevens and his colleagues in Congress. Gen. Smith was also closely connected with the building of the Pacific Railway, and, as the sub-title of this book states, was founder of the Town of Sedalia, Mo. The name was made by adding the termination " alia ” to the pet name of one of his daughters.
The value of the book lies In two things. First, a number of letters, written by and to Gen. Smith In the period before the war, letters which amid a vast heap of chaff contatu useful grain, and afford sidelights on the politics of the period. Second, certain portions of the reminiscences of Gen. Smith’s daughters, especially those which deal with life in the West and slavery as practiced by a man somewhat anti-slavery In his notions. These two daughters, Mrs. M. E. Smith and Mrs. S. E. Cotton, seem chiefly responsible for the book, which they dedicate " To ttfe Union men of the South.”
