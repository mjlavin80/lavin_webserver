Mr. Thonm* l.awnon'1 t o n i s h i ng Memory	thing to me
about Mr. Lawson's articles on “ Frenzied Finance " Is not the disclosures that he makes, but his memory. It is one thing to give the gist of a conversation; - it is another thing to give the actual words. Mr, Lawson must have
a stenographic brain. Cor he seems to remember everything that Mr. Rogers and others of the Standard Oil group said word for word, letter for letter, with the expression of the face and the gesture of the hands as they spoke. I am wondering whether be surreptitiously made notes on the cuffs of his shirt as these frenzied financiers talked, or whether immediately after he left their presence he wrote out the conversation that hint taken place, with a view to ultimate publication. Macaulay used to be mentioned as an example of extraordinary memory, but the memory of Macaulay pales before that of I^awson.—The Lounger in The Critic*

FitzGerald was always the same from first to last. His prejudices were but the crust on a noble wine, and, however thick the crust, he remained supremely lovable.

He once said that “ when his brother John wrote * D. V/ in his letters with reference to a proposed arrangement it only me&rft * if I happen to be in the humor’ **; Edward left out the D.

seace tor the perfuming ot the bath- v-Th^e temptation is strong to say that one sometimes feels the need of a perfumed bath-after the perusal of his unexpurgated works: but it must be resisted. It is more interesting and profitable to note how authors of the most artistic reputation are beginning to make terms with the spirit of the commercial age in which they live. The example having been- set, imitations of it will suggest themselves to everybody. Mr. F. T, Sullen might very well give bis name to a new saline draught, and Mr. Homung his to a new set of burgling tools. To Mr. J- M. Barrie we shall look for a new go-cart or other toy for children.

give any specimens of Omar Khayyam's verses. There is, however, a manuscript in the British Museum of a work which was composed m the year 1000 H., or 1502 A. D., which *n*es many quotations from the quatrains. and also a qitfl. of sixteen lines which seems to have hitherto escaped notice. The manuscript is the Bazmarai of Sayyid -Ali b. Mahmud al Husaini. and is described in Rieu's Supplement to his Persian Catalogue, Page 73. No. 10G. Or. 3„*ig9. The entry is under the name Khayyam, and occurs at Page 77b.

They gave her credit for taking an interest In science, for being a traveler of uncommon penetration, for dramatic talent—though j her stage career was not a long one—and j for having large ideas on almost all prac-ticai subjects. They did not believe she could specialize in psychology, that she could write of love, or that she would dilate upon the complexities of modern ! society. When her fiction proved to be j both excellent and popular, these friends

And now that '* A Dark Lantern ’’ has appeared, which is as fervid and intense a study of passion as has been made during the last decade, they will, inevitably, confess to their mistaken summing up of Miss.

Controversy still rages in France over the question whether there shall or shall not be a monument to Stendhal, 'vyiiat Is interesting to remark is that the .need for such a memorial was first brpyght home to the French by an English admirer of the author. A .Cambridge professor, it is said, coming to Paris a few years, ago with an Introduction to the. late gtephane, Mallurm6, asked -to .be directed, to Stendhal's statue, in order that he might make a pilgrimage thereto, and had to be informed .that there ,was .none., The- story goes on to say that he expressed his disgust by returning to England by the next boat. Perhaps the story is not .truer-at all events in all .its.details; but the fact. remains that, though Stendhal Is enthusiastically admired by a coterie, the I,french public in general knows little about him and cares less.— London Academy.

As far as Great
Britain was con-
c e r n e d. however,
there was no real
reciprocity. It, Is,
perhaps, unnecessary to draw attention to
the fact that the authors of the United
States benefited to a much larger extent
than did British authors, as the former
were handicapped only by the comparatively harmless essential of simultaneous publication.
That such was the case soon became clear* for, after the law had been in force ten years, there was a large and increasing number of- writers in the United States whose works were read and copyrighted in Great Britain, whereas the number of British authors whose works were read in the United States, diminishing gradually from the days of piracy, resolved themselves Into that select band whose works were sure of a commercial success on the day of publication. It is evident, however, that the United States Government, owing to the pressure brought to bear by the printing and other trades at the time of the passing of tbe law, robbed many of their own citizens of property they would otherwise have acquired, and the United States trade did not obtain the advantage which it considered certain to accrue, as many of the works which are now shipped over fn sheets would, in the fullness of time, have been produced by United States printers and binders, if simultaneous publication had not been essential.—G. Herbert Thring in The North American Review.

Very few persons realize how many books were written and magazines established in the South during the reconstruction era, when poverty and political chaos seemed to be more blighting In their effects than the four years of actuaL warfare had been. Responding to the shock his mind and feelings had received, the Southerner expressed his thoughts and emotions tn a surprisingly large mass of immature poetry and fiction as well as In more solid books of a polemical, historical, and remi-niscential character. Then, as schools and colleges were slowly built up and as social and business life began to follow orderly lines, one by one new writers who had taught themselves to write and to observe began to attract the attention of a public already somewhat trained to appreciate realistic fiction and decidedly curious to know what sort of a new South was growing up on the ashes of the old.

Old Ireland.
_	**	The Land of oong *'-1
The Song's one 0f many poetic
and symbolic names ln which Ireland rejoices.
It is a title which ts well deserved. Ireland Is the one country which has a musical Instrument for fts national emblem. On her green nag gleams a golden harp. The system of law tn ancient Ireland was a poetic composition set to music. The Irish airs which are best known, those , adopted by Thomas Moore to his own graceful lyrics, expressing intensely
every phase of emotion, never fall tn their human appeal. Yet the history of this ; matchless possession of the Irish race has never been written till now. Hitherto the best account of the music and musical in- ■ strumcnts of Ireland was to* be found in the famous “ Lectures on the Manners and Customs of the Ancient Irish," which Eugen? O'Currv, the archaeologist, delivered to the' students of the short-lived Catholic University founded by voluntary subscription In Dublin in the fifties. Mr. Grattan Flood's work ("A History of Irish Music,*f just published in Dublin) Is a most exhaustive history of Irish music. But It Is more than that. It is a very valuable contribution to social history, to the history of manne>3 and customs' In Ireland from ancient times till the end of the nineteenth century, as illustrated by the songs and music of the people, in an- ~ clent Ireland the bard was a person of immense power and ‘influence. He had to undergo at leadt twelve years’ training before the coveted title of Ollamh was conferred upon him. At that time 'rank was designated' by color in dress. The bard had a dress of fine colors, including a white mantle and a blue cap ornamented with gold crescent- There were nino different musical instruments in use.' The . harp was the most appreciated, and after it in popularity came Lhe bagpipes, flute, and horn. The ancient music of Ireland, which is still extant, consists of battle marches, dance tunes, love melodies, religious .hymns, and chants. Right down the centuries the characteristic of Irish music has been Its vein .of melancholy or tenderness.—Pall Mall Gazette.
Finding: the Remalnx of Vlttorla Colon na.
Starting from the consideration that Vittorla expresses more than once in her poems the wish to be reunited to her beloved husband In their last resting place; that the husband had been burled in the Church of San Domenico Maggiore in the City of Naples, and that Naples was at the time of- her death a much safer place from the grip of the In- * quisition than .Rome or Marino' or Pall-ano, Dr. Amante began his investigations' In the sacristy of San Domenico, which contains not less than forty-five cbfflnA of Illustrious members of the Neapolitan aristocracy, mostly from the house of Aragona. These coffins are located all round the walls, above the screens and wardrobes containing the sacred vessels
and Induments, in a sort of-gallery or balcony of which ■ the top of the wardrobes forms the floor. Here he singled out. much to his surprise, not one but two coffins inscribed with the name of the hero of the battle of Pavia, There was only one way to solve the riddle—to examine the contents of eachs. Having obtained leave from the Archbishop, as well as from the Minister of Pubtfc Instruction, and secured the help of several men of science, he opened first the lower and smaller of the two. There" were the remains of an individual of the male sex. of* middle size and age, with traces of dark hair on the skull. Such characteristics led them to believe that the legend of the scroll spoke the truth, and that the coffin really contained the remains of Vittoria’s husband, who had died in 1525. , Inside the upper one they found the long-lost bier, coated with tar, with the skeleton of a woman about fifty years of age. The skeleton was still partially#enveloped in a shroud of coarse Unen. also besmeared with tar. A closer analysis of the contents revealed the fact that the body • had been laid to rest dressed in a shirt of the finest linen, with a lace collar fastened round the throat by three bands or lacings. The sleeves also were fringed with lace. The hair, unmistakably blonde, was covered by a silk hood. These particulars (and many others of lesser value) were registered In a legal deed, dated Dec. 9. ISM, and signed by Angelo Zuccarelll, Professor of Anthropology In the University of Naples; by Father Mai-ella. rector of San Domenico; by Signor d( Malo,' representative of tbe Minister of Public Instruction; by Dr. Almante, the discoverer, and other witnesses of repute. —Rodolfo Lanciani in Fox, Duffleld & Co/s international Quarterly.
