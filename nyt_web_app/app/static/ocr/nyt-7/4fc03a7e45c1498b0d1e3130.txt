A Perplexed Reader of History—Origin o± Swinburne’s Novel—The Late G. F. Watts.
IT have received from an alert reader of | The New York Times Book Review, ; residing seemingly in Nashville, Tenn., a complaint that ideas she early derived from reading history (our inquiring reader is of the female sex) have been shattered by subsequent reading. She had been led to be- ! lieve that Nero, Caligula, Tiberius, Domitian, Pope Alexander VI., Caesar Borgia. Robespierre, Dan-ton, Marat, Benedict Arnold, Richard III., and the Duke of Alva were had men. She has since read lives of each of these men characterizing each as a patriot, a man of many virtues, of austere morals, and excellent intentions. She wants us to tell her if these men were " really good.” If they were, she asks who were the '* really bad men ” of history. She declares that she cannot continue to read history unless she ** can find some background upon which the pictures of virtuous men may be projected.’* Well. She may as well give up trying to read history and confine her reading to dialetics and the novels of Charlotte M. Tonge. Men, since the fall of Adam, with the assistance of Eve, have been more or less bad. We are inclined to believe that the men she mentions were not quite as black as they have been painted. Danton was certainly not a bad man. Robespierre was a fanatic who believed he did right. The Caesars were doubtless maligned by the historians of the Antonlne epoch. The York and Lancaster sovereigns were rather roughly treated by the Tudor chroniclers. St. Chrysostom and Jeremy Collier were doubtless good men but tedious, Gus-tavus Adolphus was a ma-Ti of austere morals. Contemporary history is full of chronicles of virtue, which may be rewritten to-morrow into chronicles of misdoing. One must read history with an open mind to the bias of historians, the need in writing eloquently of a firmly established point of view, and the uncertainty of human evidence. We have heard often that Richard of Gloster had no hump, was of pleasing personality, not given to needless bloodshed. and a good husband. But let our inquiring reader, if she really inquires in a serious mood, avoid troubling her mind with such questions'. The weather is hot, and one may live without history, after all.
