Antiquaries— del vers Into the graves of ancient things—ought to have peculiar ojv-portunities to encounter ghosts. But It Is to bn doubted if antiquaries are the fittest men to ten ghost stories—to tell them, that is, In such fashion as to freeze tho spine and wet the eye and stand the hair stiffly on end. In this volume are related ghostly adventures of several antiquarians, collectors and investigative travelers.
One of them found an ancient volume— a canon's scrapbook it was, and oddly illumined—in a Pyrenean village, and waa ! near being- done to death by a hairy, j spidery fiend who seemed to belong to j the book, somewUSt- as the genio did to | Aladdin’s lamp. Another museum man bought of a dealer in such matters an old mezzotint representing an English manor house. And overnight a sinister figure crept across the face of the picture, entered the painted house, -and came j swiftly out again, bearing In Its arms a child. Half a dozen college dons saw the marvel and made affidavit to what they saw—but it all happened after dinner. 1 However, inquiry showed that there was a tragic legend of abduction connected with the house represented in the mezzo- |

A traveler in Denmark, in another story, has an inexplicable adventure tn a village Inn. He takes a large room numbered “ 14.” It has three windows,
At night he finds the room shrunken ln size and tho windows reduced to two. Next to his own door as he goes along the passageway to bed he has observed a door numbered ** 13,” and now he hears wild noises that way and sees grotesque shadows cast upon the blank wall opposite. But in tho morning his room has three windows again and there to no sign of a door numbered *' 13 " in tho passage. Also mine host declares there is no room No. 13 M in his house—his patrons being mostly German bagmen and superstitious. The author doesn* t attempt to solve the mystery of the ghostly chamber. He passes to another story of a certain Count Magnus of Sweden, (a local tyrant ln his day,) whose mausoleum was visited by another curious British traveler intent on writing a book. This worthy man, seeing three stout padlocks fall from the Count's sarcophagus and the lid slowly rising, turned tail and fled, only to be followed by mysterious shapes and In some weeks' time to perish miserably and inexplicably.
More gruesome than any of these Is a tale of a scholarly recluse whom much reading of ancient superstitious loro had led to the conclusion that the “ assiralla-
>	tion ’’ of the hearts of three young chll-\jren would lift him above mortality and make him wonderfully wise. Two waif children were sacrificed to the idea, and the ghosts of theso two haunted the coal cellar and a disused bathroom, scratched at doors with pitiful clawlike hands, were seen, too, in the moonlight And at last tha ambitious scholar was found dead with a horrid hole in his side.
Mr. James manages at times to give you a pretty well-defined creepy feeling— but his ghost stories are not quite the real thing in spite of the pains he takes to pile up detail in the setting and leave thi horror itself as undefined, shapeless, and elusive as may be.
