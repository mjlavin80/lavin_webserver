Wf. Swinbnme'i Dramaj).
N fact, his plays fall between two etools, they are somethin? between lyrical and dramatic poetry, and they lack the supreme virtues of either kind. They were written probably to work off his enormous energy of production at times when that energy was not accompanied by a very Instant Inspiration. Many poets—"Wordsworth, Browning, and Tennyson—have
written a good deal ^Deficiencies of Q* their poetry, not
because they had something urgent to say, but because it was the business of their lives; and when they wrote from habit they had to find a pretext for writing. Mr. Swinburne’s pretext has sometimes been an ode to Victor Hugo, sometimes a play. He has looked to the dramatic form to Inspire him; and often it has inspired him with splendid passages; but his inspiration never taken tho
dramatic form. That form has always been suggested to him by tho fact that great poets whom he admires have used it. No .one but a great lyrical poet could h ve written his plays; yet, if they survive, the lyrical poetry that will keep them alive will be read not in them but in '* Poems and Ballads ” and “ Songs Before Sunrise."—London Times.
There are many pe^W Tlie True Ap- pie, young people in prcciation particular, who with
Miulenrork-i ‘he bCSt wU1 *" tte of Literature, world, cannot understand why it is that men make such a fuss about literature, and who are honestly puzzled by the praises bestowed upon the great literary artists. They would like to join in sympathetic appreciation of the masters, and they have an abundant store of gratitude and reverence to lavish upon objects that approve themselves as worthy; but just what there is in Shakespeare and "Wordsworth and Tennyson to call for such seeming extravagance of eulogy remains a dark mystery. Such people are apt in their moments of revolt, to set it all down to a sort of critical conspiracy, and to consider those who voice the conventional literary estimates as chargeable with an irritating kind of hypocrisy. They cannot see for the life of them why the books of the hour, with tUeir timeliness, their cleverness, their sentimental or sensational interest, should bo held of no serious account by the real lovers of literature, while the dull babblers of a bygone age arc exalted to the skies by these same devotees of the art of letters.
Time alone can work the cure of this disorder, for time brings experience, and the more experience men get, the nearer they approach in their sympathies to the great writers, whose greatness is based in large measure upon the richness of the experience That has come to them with their ripened years. Some young people never recover from the condition or open revolt into which they are thrown by-the injudicious methods of our education. •	• • Still others assume an attitude of
proper humility in the presence of the great writers, admit that there must be more ln them than is presently apparent, and honestly endeavor to grow Into sympathy with them. These, and these alone of the three classes, have their reward In an ever-broadening understanding and appreciation of the meanihg of the masterpiece, of the significance of its essential message to the soul of man.
Yet even these, unless they are exceptionally endowed with sensitiveness to the artistic impression, may never penetrate into the arena of the aesthetic mystery. They may never come to know, as an intimate ecstasy rather than as a lesson learned by rote, why it Is, for example, that " Kubla Khan ” is a shade more wonderful than anything else In Coleridge. why it is that Hamlet’s ** Absent thee from felicity awhile,*' h?.s a beauty so supreme that it is the crowning verse of the entire tragedy. But they may com6 to know, very sympathetically and completely, the significance of those phrases in '* Hamlet ” or elsewhere, which contain the ultimate distillation of a rich experience, and to enter Into this kind of communion with a great poet Is no mean privilege. It Is, we are inclined to think, the largest reward that literature offers to the faithful many, although a	further	and	finer reward awaits	the
few whose	senses are rightly attuned	for
Its reception.—The Dial, Chicago.

Bat there arose a conscientious antiquary, whom no opposition or inertia could daunt, and by dint of indefatigable efforts he persuaded the City Fathers to have one of them taken down.—London' Academy.
You Slant Know Milton. Intimately To Know Him at All.
Take Milton alone; you must know him intimately or not at all—must, as Rus-• kin h-m pointed out, enter not only into his thoughts, but also into his heart, abiding with him till you share his passion. This outcome of prolonged and disciplined study comes to boys and girls essaying examination, comes to adult attendants on Extension lectures, wherever the teacher’s knowledge is creative and his enthusiasm contagious; rare, indeed, are the unguided
learners who can achieve It for thorns' ivcs. Foreigners know fcore of him than we do; Germans pore upon him till they pass within the veil and assimilate him; the modern Greek, we are told, who does not care for Shakespeare, annexes Byron greedily. Milton patiently. "We have already noted the very interesting fact that Mr. Maurice Baring found “ Paradise Lost" popular throughout Russia among peasantry and private soldiers. "When Jbhn Bright used to harangue half-educated audiences, atid spouted Milton, as was his wont, In reverent solemn tones, his hearers thought that he was quoting Ebenezer Elliott. Yet all who have Btoeped themselves in his immortal verse, and felt it pulsate through their intellectual and moral being, understand the cleansing influence which intimacy with him, as with all our greatest poets, must needs exert upon the meanness and the sordor of society,—London Times.

Those who re-The Author of gard authorship as u John Iasleimnt . n profession and
label themselves author os other people are styled barrister or merchant should study the career of John Henry Shorthouse. He was a vitriol merchant in Birmingham. He wrote ** John Ingle-sant " at his leisure over a period of ten years; when it was finished he had a hundred copies printed, and said that his ambition was quite satisfied if this number of clever people read it. The perfect book* he wrote later in his life, should
have no author. No doubt he enjoyed his sudden fame and was ingenuously pleased at the notice of known people: at the breakfast with Gladstone, the visit to Lambeth, the dinner with the Tennysons at Farrlngford—where Tennyson read " Maud *' and the •* Ode to the Duke " ln the moonlight^-but it all made no difference to his way of serene meditation or his independent judgment. The Society of Authors would hardly have deemed him qualified for membership. Much of his best actual work was spent In a private Quakerish essay society in Birmingham. One of his favorite amusements was a quiet drive “ to lunch at country vicarages " or "a few friends " to a tea party. —London Saturday Review.

ble, along the little twists and turns of women's moods and fancies.

The Personal Novel Is In Disrepute.
M. Merlant’s " Le Roman Personnel ’* and M. le Breton’s "Le Roman Francais avant Balzac ” have produced from M. Ren6 Doumic a study of What he calls the personal novel. By this, he is careful to explain, he means the sort of novel wherein the author identifies himself with the principal character, either by describing his personal advent' ures or by inventing imaginary ones in which he sees himself. Such was certainly not the case with the interminable stories of Le Grand Cyrus and his congeners of the classic school of Mme. de Scud6ri, and, according to M. Doumic, the personal novel only came in with Rousseau. His idea is that the need of giving expression to the personal feelings, or, as he puts it, the lyric cry of the Ego, became overmastering at about this period, and found no outlet save in the novel. It is at any rate certain that “ Gil Bias,** “ Manon Lescaut,” “ Clarissa Harlowe,” and " La Nouvelle HSloise M must have corresponded to what the 'advertisements call " a felt want,’* or they would not have attained their sudden and instant popularity. The same feature was to be noticed after the Revolution of 1830, when the gloomy and Byronic novel had Its vogue, although, as M. Doumic notes, novelists had even then begun to see that the public would no longer be content with the j description of their real or fancied goings-on, and demanded in addition something of the spirit of the age. Then came the uprising of the giants, such as Sir Walter Scott and Balzac, and the personal novel waned until it has become the form of novel used by writers who are not novelists.—Pall Mall Gazette.
Ambiguities
and
Phlogiston.
Then there is a class of ambiguities which arise from misconception and mistakes in the logic of an ignorant person, as when a woman was asked how she distinguished her twins. She replied that it was easy-enough, she put her finger Into Pat’s mouth, and if he bit real hard then she knew It was Mike. Or .-the emotional^ speaker who said, chamrinc the first letters of two words, ** Brethren, you all know how it feels to have a half-warmed fish in your hearts.” There is also a confusion of thought in the term " to eat humble pie,” the word " humble ’* having been put in the place of the original word 11 numble," which is a part of the carcase of a deer, and would make very poor pie. The words “ humble pie ” have the same original meaning as “ to eat crow,” a phrase common in political life. There is an enforced humility in this process, and the change from “ numble ” to " humble ’■ introduced a thought which harmonized with the Idea sought to be expressed, and the last form of the phrase has entirely supplanted the original.
One of tho most remarkable words In the history of science is u phlogiston.” It actually did not mean anything. The definitions of it used seriously by scientific men now provoke a laugh. And yet the
theory of phlogiston was taught in all tlie universities of Europe up to the time of the chemical revolution. Then It was discarded almost unanimously by all scientific men. When the scientific investigations of Lavoisier revealed the truth as regards the composition of water the confusion of thought in the word phlogiston became apparent,—The Open Court.
