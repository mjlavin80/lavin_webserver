GAY PARISIANS.

F. Berkeley Smith’s New Book About Their Life — “ Out-Doors M Means a Great Deal.*
R. F. BERKELEY SMITH’S third book about the daily life of Parisians is as bright and entertaining as either of its predecessors,
" The Real Latin Quarter ” and ** How Paris Amuses Itself.” Like those books, it is written alike for folks who know Paris well (and are willing to admit that another can know it, too) and for r.ll the others who know it a little or not at all, Mr. Smith’s theme now is the outing of Paris, which begins after the Grand Prix has been run at Longchamps, but he deals with other outings as veil, with the doings at Trouville and the other Channel watering places, . and goes as far afield as Nice and Monte Carlo.
The French are instinctively an out-of-doors-loving people. Life in the open air means to them nine-tenths of the joy of living. Every spare hour is by the majority of Parisians spent out of doors. The country is their cherished Mecca for a holiday, and the caf£ terrace in town a universal refuge from the average home of the masses, nine-tenths of whose domiciles are dark, ill-ventilated apartments, stuffed with furniture: or garret rooms tucked away beneath the leaden roofs and the chimney pots, insufferably hot in Summer, and as cold as the interior of a refrigerator in Winter. Parisians proverbially never sleep with their windows open; yet you will find them dining at the little tables in front of the restaurants throughout the four seasons of the year, often during days and rights blustering and chilly enough to m?ke us Anglo-Saxons turn our collars up and hurry home to a crackling fire.
Trouville is the earliest resort- In the Autumn is the brief hunting season.
Trouville is very much like a Prench Manhattan Beach. It is expensive, bizarre. and common: but, like everything French, it possesses a gayety, and that still rare quality—charm. With the crisp days of Autumn and the falling leaves, the chateaux of the nobility are i filled with guests for the shooting sea- j son, and the country seats of the i«ou-veaux riches with house parties. Few look forward to the hunting season ; with more enthusiasm than do Parisians.
i
But many Parisians cannot afford Trouville. They take their outings nearer home.
In the Bois de Boulogne, long after night has fallen, you will often pass whole families seated in some grassy nook picnicking, with perhaps a single . candle burning in the midst of the jolly party, to distinguish, by its flickering flame, the chicken from the sausage and the bottle of Graves from the Burgundy. And what a feast and an allday romp they have had, with no policeman to bellow at them and no signs to warn them to keep off the grass! j The feast itself (and you may be sure It was an ample and goodly one) was purchased that very morning out of the pushcarts in their quartier, after considerable baj-gaining on the part of the fat mamma and the wise discretion and good sense of the pretty fiancee of the thrice-happy young man in whose honor this long, jolly day in the Bois has been given.
Paris itself contains all the means of enjoyment, in and out of doors, that any one can want; and for good reasons. .
Paris does more for the enjoyment of the masses than any other city In the world. She not only provides them with a superb playground enobellished with the beauties of nature and the best that the arts can produce, but the Government keeps its people continually en fete, and with the utmost patience and generosity supplies gas, electricity, fireworks, music, and an intelligent police. This is not only an excellent policy on the part of the Government of a people such as the French, whose natureis somewhat like, the firecracker, harmless until lighted, but it has also resulted in a universal spirit of democracy and good feeling. Parisians, knowing that all Paris belongs to them, are the first to guard their city against vandalism and ill-usage. If you should doubt this, snip a rose for your buttonhole in any of the public gardens in plain view of the masses, or chip a souvenir from any of the public monuments, and. see what happens. Even the smallest gamin would rail at von in righteous indignation. The laws In France relative to the out-of-doors life of the masses are made in the interest of the people. Furthermore, they are enforced. There is no fixing things with a French policeman.
Though there is no public gambling tn Paris, all the French are fond of games of chance.
In Paris no public gambling is al- . lowed, the nearest licensed gaming, table being in'the Casino at Enghlen-

les-Bains, and yet gambling Is countenances by every class of society, and th« " petits chevaux ” are patronized by families and even by children at the seaside, a few sous won or lost being looked upon by their elders as .10 more harmful an amusement than expen-ling the same amount for a stick of sugar candy or a ride on the merry-go-vound.
There is a rare old inn at Dives, in Normandy, called the Hostellerie of William the Conqueror, which many knowing Parisians frequent. It has, loo, a rare old inmate.
The cockatoo, being in his eightieth year, (these birds live to an extraordinary age,) could tell you, if he could talk, of that legion of famous guests of bygone days, days when the present modern butterflies from Trouville and Cabourg had not yet been born. That generous, devil-me-care, brilliant Monsieur Honors de Balzac, up w'ith the dawn if the' mood took him. \?sed to call up to his perch in his jolly, ponderous voice; and Mademoiselle l-’ran-cine, resting from her tragic season at the Th&>tre Frangaise, used to feed him bonbons and scratch his yellow topknot. He knew, too, Gustave Flaubert and Alexandre Dumas pfere. Sometimes he climbed on the shoulders of Guy de Maupassant or dined with a kindly little old man with a shock of white hair, named Victor Hugo, who wrote all day in the courtyard and who often searched the kitchen for a cold leg of some tender chicken for him, a delicate attention which the venerable bird never forgot. Statesmen, men-seigneurs, painters, sculptors, actors, and men and women of letters, the rich product of whose wit is still relished, preserved in rare buildings and tucked away in the quiet libraries of connoisseurs, all came to the Hostellerie in those coaching days.
There is much in the new book about life at Barbizon and Fontainebleau. Here is a striking bit of description of the forest:
It is a kingly forest still, this great wood of Fontainebleau, this dry wilderness of towering pines, hemlocks, and giant beeches. A forest of white sandy roads, which dry instantly alter the heaviest downpour; and acr-is of fern-beds, golden brown in Autumn, with little valleys and dales of violet heather intervening. A silent forest! Rarely a sound beneath the whispering ‘pines, save for some garrulous band of crow flying over their tall fir-tops while out foraging for a dead hare, their pickets winging ahead of the sinister pack of vagabonds, alert to ** Caw-caw*! " at first glimpse of tbe enemy.
The forest is sunlight and shadow, its mossy bed strewrj with thousands upon thousands of boulders incrusted with delicate lichens. These great stones are piled one upon the other or strewn about at random, as if some crew of giants had left them thus after a game of bbwls. Nature never piles itself other than picturesquely. Pats of blue sky pierce the rich green of the fir-tops. A small gray woodpecker with a vermilion topknot flutters to a hollow trunk and begins tapping vigorously. Far below me, skirting the bottom of a mossy ravine, winds a white road. A fog horn blasts threateningly bejond the crest of a ravine, followed by a double report as savage as that of a six-shooter. Then a whining roar, and a big automobile swings in sight. It is rushing down the white road below me in the direction of Montigny. A glimpse of a fluffy green veil, silk hoods inflated like toy balloons, and a crouching chauffeur, and they are gone!
