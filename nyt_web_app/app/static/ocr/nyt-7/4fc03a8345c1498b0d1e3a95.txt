HIS exposition of what the French economist M. Levas-seur believes to be the fundamental principles of economic science owes its existence in English to the translator’s belief that it will help English-speaking students to understand better a difficult subject, and to make more discriminating: use of its data. M. Lei vasseur practically follows the old fourfold division of the science. The first two parts, production and distribution, he includes In the first phase; exchange constitutes the second phase and the third part, while consumption, the end of all economic activity, forms the third phase and fourth part. He sees that the old i division is not philosophical, but he has i not the courage to abandon it altogether.
! As a matter of fact* neither distribution . nor exchange is a phenomenon inherent in the science of wealth, as is the case with production and consumption. The former depend upon co-operation in production, but the latter exist wherever there is human life.
The endeavors to state scientific laws are crude. Here is a definition of value, Page 184: *' Value is a relation of quantity established between two products or services by exchange. It is regulated principally by the law of offer and demand.” We nowhere find that the author has adopted the Austrian theory of final utility, which may perhaps be called the cornerstone of modern science of economics.
The only effort to present the law of wages is on Page 122: " Labor tends to sell itself for what it is worth—L e., to obtain a remuneration equal to the utility it creates." This is *an inexact statement of the productivity theory of wages. The most scientific formulation of the law of wages has been made by Clask, who has 1 applied the Austrian method of obtaining the law of -value to the problem of wages. Equally t crude is the statement of the law of interest:	M Interest is regulated
principally—first, by the “general state Of social wealth, which tends to lower the rate as that wealth becomes greater; second, by the activity of enterprise and the productivity of capital which tend to raise interest according ~as they themselves are greater," Page 113.
A remark concerning interest on Page 114 is not to be accepted offhand. If Interest is '* too low, it ceases to encourage the formation of capital.” Eminent economists have held that - low interest encourages savings and the growth of capital. for the capitalist will strain every nerve to prevent the income of his family from decreasing and their social status from deteriorating. This means that the growth of capital is self-accelerating rather than self-retarding, and that a steady dccline in the rates of interest does not discourage the growth of capital. The Ricardian theory of rent as a differential is retained unmodified.
M. Levasgeur is always orthodox. " The theory of free trade,” he says, ** is based on sound economic principles," Page 253. Upon doctrines tainted with heresy, his animadversions are uniformly severe. “ Socialist doctrines substitute for natural distribution under a regime of liberty an artificial distribution by author-
-	ity, which, like all systems inconsistent with freedom of contract, would result in impairing the productive forces of society,”- Page 143. On the money question he says: ** The single standard Is a more logical system, because it furnishes a measure which is fixed—if not as to value, at least as to substance,” Page 201. The question of deferred payments, which agitated us so violently some years ago, receives no adequate attention. Whether the borrower pays his debt in an appreciated or depreciated currency, he says, Is of “minor Importance,” Page 103. He has evidently no sympathy, with the advocates of land nationalization. Speaking ot the. •* unearned increment ” in land values, which struck Henry George as so unjust, lie asks:	How	can we estimate
the added value, exactly and separate it .from tlie original value, and is it not just that he who must risk lower values should likewise get the benefit of added values7 ” Page 97. “The objections advanced to property in land do not bear* serious; ex-aminatiop,” Page 09.	........	'

this part; it Is apparently unconnected with production, distribution, exchange, or consumption. This, of course, is absurd. But, strangely enough, this last part, which has no logical reason for existence, contains a discussion of taxation, which is about the best thing in the whole book.
On the whole the work is disappointing. It Is decidedly Inferior to several good textbooks which already exist in English.
