Mr. Nevinson. in the book from which we have quoted, felicitates the literary world on a recent escape from the " danger that the biographical side of literature would be overdone/' It seems that his felicitations are premature. Indeed, we have haft too much of literary biography of a sort that has small relation, if any, to literature, ffhe world could have spared (to take great examples only) much of the information that has been thrust upon It about the every-day lives of Coleridge and Carlyle and Byron. We agree with Mr. Nevinson’s opinion that *' the personality which lies behind all great literature may be discovered almost as completely in Homer and Shakespeare, of whose outward lives we know next to nothing, as in Johnson, Goethe, or Carlyle; whose lives we can follow year by year, and sometimes day by day."
