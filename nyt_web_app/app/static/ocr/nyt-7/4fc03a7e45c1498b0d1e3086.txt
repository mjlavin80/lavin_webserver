THE JEWISH ENCYCLOPEDIA. A Descriptive Record oC the History. Rcllgton, Literature, and Customs of tho Jewish People from tho Earliest Times to the Present Day. Edited by Isidore Singer, Portraits, maps, and illustrations. In twelve volumes. Vol. X.. Philtpson to Samosce, pp. xlv.-G8G. Svo. Now York: The IFUtHc & Wagnaila Company.
Tho publication of the tenth volume of the Jewish Encyclopedia brings that great work within sight of its completion. Two more volumes remain to be pub-lislied; but It is hoped and expected that they will appear in time to mark the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of ! the arrival at Amsterdam in the New Netherlands of tho Jews, who came hero from Brazil In October, 1C55. The tenth volumo is as valuable as any of Its predecessors; its articles range from Phillpson to Samoscz, and though the articles on J David Pliilipson and David Samoscz are j not in themselves important, yet between them are others of note. Some of th<*s-3 | may ho named: Philistines, whose n&jne j is still preserved in "Palestine"; Philo Judaeus, Poetry, Psalms, Rome, Rothschild, Roumania, Russia, Sabbath, Samaritans.
In Rome, Roumania, and Russia the Jews have always been an important ele-.ment, in spite of the attempts to suppress them. More than 2,000 years ago a decree was issued expelling from Rome alt Jewa who were not Roman citizens, the existence ot a community there at that pe-
riod \Vsing shown thereby. Foppaea Sabina, Nero's wife, hiu* even been said— but nol by this cyclopedia—to be a Jewess. In Roumania the Jews arc believed to have lived for years before Trajan settled his Roman convicts theie; and in the eighth century of our ere. it is recorded that “ the Jewish religion reigned supreme in that country.” The recent persecution of the Jews in Roumania and Mr. Hay’s attempt to mitigate it are easily recalled.
Russia of late years has evoked a '* Jewish question,” but even from a very remote past there have been Jews in countries now under the Cr.ar's rule,. To Armenia many were sent by Nebuchadnezzar nearly 600 years B. C.. and Georgia had many other survivors of the destruction of the First Temple. It is not until within a century that the treatment of the Jews in Russia has been consistently harsh; how harsh the article in this tenth volume shows clearly. At the same time tho cyclopedia describes the actual condition of the Russian Jews—Ihcir charities, their public institutions, their educational system, their position in Russian literature. Tho Polish Jews are also treated In this article at some length.
Most encyclopaedias as they near their end show signs of compression, due to the fact that too much spacc has been allowed to the articles in the early volumes. Rose's Cyclopaedia Biographica Is perhaps the most striking example of this: six of its twelve volumes bring the alphabet down cnly to EJ; the other twenty-one letters are compressed into four volumes. Nothing of the sort is visible in the Jewish 1 Cyclopedia. Tho illustrations, diagrams,
I and plans in tho tenth volume are as valuable and illustrative as heretofore.
