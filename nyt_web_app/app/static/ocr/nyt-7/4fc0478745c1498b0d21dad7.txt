George McCall Theal, Utt. D.t LL. D.. Colonial historiographer and author of "History of South Africa," in seven volumes, has edited an Important book on " The Native Races of South Africa.” by
the late George W. Stow, F. G. S., F. Tt.
G.	S. The author died before the wo*k was completed, and the manuscript *ias bought of his widow by Miss l*ucy C. ]j!oyd, the well-known authority upon the j African Bushmen. She showed it to the ; present editor, who became interested 5n It, as he writes In his preface, becauso he saw the importance of the material and the accuracy of the author in his deserip' tions of the manners and customs and mode of life of the natives of South Africa. The manuscript was not even ready for the press—there was much material tn it which Mr. Theal thought superfluous and jsntirely too bulky, and : the paragraphs were very long. He rearranged all, dividing it into paragraphs and chapters, and cutting out what he thought was unnecessary, such as citations from reports and other extracts. He also added an index which will be useful for reference.
In his preface, dated Sept. 6, 1SS0, Mr.
I Stow tells how he came to write the book. On bis arrival ln Cape Colony in 1S4:{ he found the white settlers struggling for existence and the country in a state of chronic warfare. Under these conditions no interest seemed to have been taken in the native tribes; but the writer felt differently, and set out to question t'.e natives themselves. Each, of the chiefs asserted that his own special tribe was the true representative of the original possessors of the soil. For some years Mr. Stow believed that the Hottentots vere 1 he aboriginal race, but looking closer he at length came to the conclusion that the Bushmen g.Ione were the first ones in tho country, and he decided to write their history, getting his illustrativa material from finds In caves and elsewhere. Tae present book is the result of his studies and researches, and contains many Illustrations by Mr. Stow, and others of the natives provided by Miss Lloyd. It is issued by the Macmillan Company.
