Vetc York Times Book Revietoz
Permit me to say a word of appreciation. To read a review like that in the Book Review of July 22 of George Gls-sing*s “ Will Warburton '* is almost better than to read the book itself—at least to an old admirer of Gissine, who has read practically all his previous books, and can therefore appreciate every point made. If I single out this one review for excellence it is due merely to the limitation of my own interests; they are undoubtedly all good. And too much cannot be said in praise of the book Review as a whole. The last few numbers, Instead of showing traces of the lassitude of the season, have sparkled like the fountains which remain the one refreshing feature of the torrid days.	M.	U.	O.
