JVXr- May’s Kindness
New York Timea Book Rtvioo:
John Hay had one trait that also marked the late Charles Dudley Warner, and has ever marked the living friend of both, Edmund C. Stedman. it waa a certain graciousness and courtesy to young men of literary aspirations or tastes that at once enabled one to open his or her heart to the great man, fully assured that whatever advice was given would be sympathetic. When Mr. Hay was connected with The Tribune in the early years after the war I waa introduced, to him by my old chief, Isaac H. Bromley, and after a delightful chat he gave me at my request a copy of his poem, " The Advance Guard,” written for a reunion of the ** Army of the James,” which I have always thought second only to “ The Battle Hymn of the Republic ” of all the poetry occasioned by the civil war. It waa not my fate to again meet Mr. Hay till about March, 1905, just ere his breakdown in health, when I called upon him at the State Department on a little matter of business to which, in spite of his manifest ill-health, he gave courteous attention. As
I	rose to go I reminded him of his giving me his poem thirty-five years ago, and said: *' Mr. Hay, I know you have done gTeat work in your office, but I do wish you would write more poetry.” He smiled pleasantly and said: “ It would be useless. Dr. Osier would chloroform me if I attempted it."
Jt is to be hoped that in due time we may have a complete edition of Mr. Hay’s poems, including “ The Advance Guard,” which he never included tn any of his published volumes.
