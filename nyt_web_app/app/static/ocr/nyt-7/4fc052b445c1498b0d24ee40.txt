Fridtjof Nansen’s uttie book on
M Norway	the Union with
Sweden" haa been published here this week by the Macmillans. It is a statement of tlie case, historically and politically, from the Norwegian point of view. After a spirited “ historical introduction,” Dr. Nansen treats of The Treaty of Kiel and the Establishment of the Union*" the "Act of Union,” "Episodes from the History of the Union,”
” The Conduct.of Foreign Affairs,” ** The Question of the Consular Service,” and *“ The Political Situation Within the Union at the Moment,” the moment being in May of the present year. Dr. Nansen hopes that a foreigner having read his little book ** will have gained a sufficient knowledge of our history and aspirations to form a somewhat more just estimate regarding the difficulties which have arisen In the relations between the two northern countries.” Dr. Nansen points out that by the Treaty of Kiel, (Jan. 14, 1814,) Norway was ceded, not to the Kingdom of Sweden, but to the Swedish King. Norway has never been an Integral part of Sweden, or a dependent of that kingdom. The distinction is rather fine, of course, but it means a ; great deal to the Norwegians, who, since their old relations with Denmark were dissolved, have claimed to have their own laws, rights, and privileges. Though the -manner of the enforcement of the terms of the Kiel treaty never quite satisfied the Norwegians, the chief cause of dis-1 sensfon between the two kingdoms, ac-
cording to Dr. Nans6n, has always been the.method of conducting foreign affairs:
- ■ * * ' ' ' The Trustees o? Shakespeare’s Birthplace and the other buildings in or near Stratford-on-Avon held as memorials have been trying to get their parish taxes removed or t decreased. The house known as the Birthplace was taxed $425 last year. The cottage at Shottery and its adjoining orchard were taxed nearly $200. The Warwickshire Magistrates dir missed ths appeal on the ground that tht society is supported by annual voluntary subscriptions and that . such support should be real, and not insignificant. This is good enough law, perhaps, though the decision of the court has a Shakespearean flavor, reminiscent of Justice Shallow. But if there was any real feeling for Shakespeare's memory among the-people of Great Britain, and the preservation of the Warwickshire buildings as monuments expressed that feeling, the buildings would not be taxed. It seems like taxing the Albert Memorial.
We are inclined to sympathize with the Vienna people who have formed a society for tlie publication of wholesome fiction to offset the evil influence of the cheap pessimism and debased romance that is produced in such enormous quantities. In so far as the Vienna philanthropistsareready to go to extreme measures to lessen the output of this sort of stuff, they deserve hearty commendation. Evil literature debases the mind even when It. does not lead directly to outlawry and suicide. Merejkoffsky, whose *' Earthly Paradise ” we noticed last week, says that the higher education leads to suicide. But let that pass. The plan of the Vienna society to secure good, wholesome literature by offering prizes for it may or may not have the desired result. Prize competitions have not hitherto done much for the advancement of art. They may have some effect In the improvement of literary morals.
It is not surprising that the memorial reredos to Miss Charlotte Mary Yor.ge, unveiled in Winchester Cathedrui, England, 'his month was largely paid for by the subscriptions of Americans. She was long one of the most popular in this country of the English auuiurs of her epoch. ** The Heir of Redclyffe ” has passed through many editions here, and we believe it is still in demand at the libraries. Most of her books, and she published nearly every year from 1844 to the end of the century, were widely circulated here. The religious novel which contains a clear, simple, well-wrought story was for many years a safe Investment for American publishers. The leredos is a very handsome structure, of carved mahogany and oak, enriched with paintings and gilding.
M Metapsychic ” (not ” metaphysic ”) is a word invented or pressed into service by Dr. J. Maxwell and Prof. Charles Richet to apply to the mysterious phenomena they are investigating.
