! The interest which belonged to Mr. Brudno's *' The Fugitive ’* Is lacking in the present tale- of crude horrors and cruder sentimentalities. The earlier story was in some part an evident transcript from the young author's experience, and while It was raw it had the strong appeal of truth. This story Qay be true also— one is never sure that anything may not be true in Russia—but no .civilized person will be able to realize the incidents of the relation as facts.
The '* little conscript ** is a young Jewish boy whose years have been devoted to the story of th.e Talmud. In accordance with a cunning plan of the Imperial Nicholas I. this boy, with many other Jewish youths, is .kidnapped. and after unspeakably cruel treatment—knoutings and what not—forcibly baptized, a hole being cut In the ice for the purpose and a crucifix chained about his neck* Mr. Brudno (himself a Jew) dwells with com-; prehensible warmth upon the boy’s passionate faithfulness to his religion and |
his steadfast endurance of persecution. He describes in every detail of horror the cruelties of the Russian officers who are set to make Christian soldiers of the Czar out of,the kidnapped sons of Israel. He paints the feelings of p- loyal Jewish youth under the ugly, villainous process.
It seems that when a batch of these little conscripts was being marched across country and was being stabled one night in a barn, the savages who had them in charge actually set the barn on fire and roasted the most part of the Jewish material out of which Christian soldiers were to be made. Such boys as survived were given one each to Christian peasants to bring up and guard UV they attained military age. The hero, Tosselle. was served thus, and got a cruel master, but this cruel master had a Christian fosterdaughter, Olga, who was beautiful, and
Yosselle (as one should say, Joey) fell in
love with her and she with him. Also Yosselle's fervor and bravery and sweetness led in time to a change of heart ln the cruel master, and you read how the youth spoke to the man of the glory and goodness of God, wh/* is Lord alike of Jew and Gentile—and so made a better Christian of him and incidentally a fanatic of liberty.
Then comes Yoselle’s career In the army and the story of how the girl Olga followed after him to N^hni Novgorod and fell into the hands of the Governor there and was his wife's maid. After that, perfidy upon perfidy—a Nihilist plot—a bomb thrown at the Governor's carriage.
In which Olga sits with the Governor's wife—and Yosselle, (nrusting aside the bomb thrower, who happens to be Olga's brother. Yosselle is rewarded and promoted at Olga’s request, but refuses to accept bribes from " contractors of supplies," professors of iliat art by which, as Mr. Kipling says, ascertain other Joseph of old grew rich. The Governor poisons his wife, employing Olga as the unconscious agent; then he marries Olga* who consents only in order to save her brother, the bomb thrower. Finally Olga murders the Governor and Yosselle, accused of the crime, admits it for Olga's sake, and so makes a Sidney Cartonlike end. Plainly it's a plot plethoric of tragedy. There is no cunning of words and no gleam of any humor—merely a deal of religious hysteria pardonable in the persecuted Yosselle, but not good material in books for modern civilized readers. And actually the author uses " discreditably " for “unbelievingly," In other words, he is a Russian who has much English yet
