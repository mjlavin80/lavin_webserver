There are some 800 illustrations in the volume, derived. Air. Champlin says, ** chiefly from the drawings of men familiar with animals in a state of nature.’' The author does not approve of photo-eraphs of wild animals in real life, “ for the snapshot of a bLrd or mammal ln captivity gives an incorrect and misleading: idea of the same animal in its native habitat.”

Mr. Champlin has placed the young folks
under another obligation by his latest
book, " The Young Folks' Cyclopaedia of
Natural History." It is an attempt to fill
what seems to its author a vacant place
among books relating to natural history,
for It is within the reach of most young
-t»eople, while other cyclopaedias on the
same subject are not; It is comprehensive,
giving “ an outline of the entire animal
kingdom from the largest mammal down
to the tiniest insect that has to be studied
under a magnifying glass it is not
loaded with padding, and it does not pose as a manual of zoology, hy the study of which one may learn to dissect a beetle or a mammoth.
Mr. Lucas, formerly of the National Museum at Washington, has assisted Mr. Champlin, and the result of their co-operation is a convenient and comprehensive book. In each article the ordinary name 1 of the animal appears first; then are grouped the scientific facts relating to it, and then follow an account of it, with pertinent facts relating to its life, origin, and relationship to similar animals of the past and the present. For example, under Addax it is said that the animal ** was well known to the ancients and is often j depicted on the monuments of Egypt.
