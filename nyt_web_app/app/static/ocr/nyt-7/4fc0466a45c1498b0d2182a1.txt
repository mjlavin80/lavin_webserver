Lest all the labored and learned efforts of the bland but iconoclastic Mr. Stephen
G.	Clow go for naught, I beg your Indulgence till, on behalf of a host of the nonplused, I propound a few final queries:
Mr. Clow has been called to task by certain cynically, sentimentally, or emotionally constituted correspondents, but all seem to have religiously avoided everything " touchln' on or appertainin’ to" his original pessimistic declaration as to the inevitable, irrevocable decline of classic imaginative poetry.
