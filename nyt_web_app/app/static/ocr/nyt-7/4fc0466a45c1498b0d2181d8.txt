WOMAN’S CONFESSIONAL,” by Helen Woljeska, (New York: Life Publishing Company,) is printed in purple ink. It is made up of short, frequently pert extracts from an unusual diary* The reader cannot decide whether to accept Helen Woljeska as a real personage, or to set her down as fabulous, like the Unicorn and the King’s Arms
were in the estimation of the elder Mr. Weller. The anonymous editor declares that "the small, scattered leaves of her journal bear witness that she has lived and loved and erred.” According to this authority Helen was born in Austria, transplanted in America, and studied art in a large Western city. She died in misfortune.
Well, one remembers Arthur Stirling and others of that brand—and doubts.
But the smartness of the woman’s sayings is indisputable. We quote a few of them herewith:
The aim of living is to enjoy one’s self.

Don’t bother about the others. Be yourself. There will always be some to approve and some to disapprove, no matter what you do or don't do.
Ninety-nine people go out to join the wild hunt for happiness. And the hundredth stays comfortably at home and wins it.
I do not want to vote. The only woman's right I claim is the right of saying a pretty little fib whenever I feel like it,	.
Do not wait for a certain day of the week or date of the month. The time is now. The hour is here.
If you can feel satisfaction with yourself you have attained the only thing worth having.
People cannot expect me to like them for no other reason than that they happen to be my relatives. If they have not the qualities I would'admire in a stranger just as well, then I do not-care for them.

Every man fulfills his part in the work of the universe. The few who do it not blindly are called wise.
What we like best in some people is their idea of us.
