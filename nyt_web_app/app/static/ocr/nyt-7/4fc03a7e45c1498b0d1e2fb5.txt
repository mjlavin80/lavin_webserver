PENALTIES AJNTD PRIZES
HE very first essay In a new book by Henry W. Nevinson called '* Books and Personalities *'—a collection of his lighter literary papers which have appeared in various periodicals—deals with Heinrich Heine and the persistent * leeend that Goethe called him the poet ** who lacks love.” Matthew Arnold accepts the legend as fact in his lines on Heine—strangely harsh, prosaic lines to address to the most gifted of melodists:
But was it thou—I think Surely it was—that bard Unnamed, who. as Goethe said.
Had every other gift, but wanted love:
Love without which the tongue Even of angels sounds amiss?
Yet it was not Heine, but a much'mfeilor poet. Platen, to whom Goethe referred, as is sufficiently proved in “ Erckmann’s Conversations.*' The application to Heine, however, has persisted, in and out of Germany, almost to this day. Heine was the most conspicuous and most gifted young German poet of Goethe’s declining years. That is all the basis
i
there ever was for applying to him the old poet’s ! criticism. Heine was not without love—far from it. , But tt was an inevitable part of the penalty of his greatness in literature to be misjudged. The prizes of literature and art are often considerable, but the penalties are correspondingly large.-
