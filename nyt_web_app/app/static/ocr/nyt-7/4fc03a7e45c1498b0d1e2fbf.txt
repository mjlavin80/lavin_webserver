THE watchword of Marshall P. Wilder, the platform humorist, who haes just published a new book, Is " amiability." He^believes that he owes all his success In life to his Inborn tendency to look only on the bright side of things. To ' the critic of books and plays he says, in effect: ** Praise and you will be successful. '* To the man of affairs: " Be satisfied and you will be happy.” To everybody: "This Is the best year, the best month, the best day the world has ever ' known; make the best of it.” To quote the significant phrase of the old Corporal in Conan Doyle's little Waterloo play:
“ That wouldn't have done for the Dook.”
***
It was not the policy, for Instance, of Jeremiah (a man of mighty Influence) or Isaiah; of * Cromwell, or Washington or Jetferson; of Dr. Samuel Johnson, St. Chrysostom, or Thomas Babington Macaulay. There has always been plenty of amiability in the world. Twenty centuries of looking on the bright side of things has left the dark side as dark as ever. Probably Marshall Wilder owes his success to his ability to make folks who are not inherently amiable (and have enough day by daji to keep them, growling) temporarily forget theip* burdens. The brightness and vivacity of bis new book, " The Sunny Side of the Street,” (Funk Wagnalls Company,) will have a like effect.
Marshall’s new book has an oblong hole on the blue and gilt cover through which one looks on Madison Square In its Summer glory, with the St. Gaudens " Diana ’* dominating the scene. Marshall has dwelt In London, Shanghai, ^Jaris, Tokio, Budapest, Kandy. San
Francisco—but he still thinks Madison 1 Square the centre of the universe. His book—like American conversation—is made ' up of anecdotes. He talks Intimately of Bichard Croker, President McKinley, President Harrison, Joseph Jefferson, Senator Depew, Henry Watteraon, Gen.
. Horace Porter, Augustin Daly, Henry Irving, Buffalo B11L IOng Edward VII., Mrs. Langtry, and a host of other personages, large and small, and medium Bized:	He
tells many good stories. He nearly always lives up to his doctrine of amiabfl* tty. Wo can recommend his book as cheerful reading.
