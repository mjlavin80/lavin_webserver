A Worm Appreciation oi the 'W'rit— ~ ings of Charies Dudley Warner.
York Times Book Review:	'
a reader of the book Review
since its birth, 1 have been somewhat surprised at the meagre praise which it has found to bestow upon Charles Dudley Warner/ The editorial erticle at the time of his death was the coldest sort of an “ appreciation ’*; not that it needed to be a funeral eulogy, only it did seem that there might have been a juster and more generous recognition of those qualities in Warner’s work which hz&'e charmed a generation of readers. Following this official disapprobation, It Is, pernaps. not j surprising that in your recent review of the new Back-log edition of Warner there ; should run the same tone of condescending approbation of an author who did , very well In one’s sophomore days, hut J now *' that some years of reading had tempered our judgment and broadened our appreciation ** wa3~ hardly more than a genial reminiscence. How the rereading of his delightful essays, character sketches, and scenes of travel, could prove “ dull, unenthusiastlc, and unprofitable labor ** I cannot imagine. That the light, evanescent humor, the opportune phrase,
the deft suggest!veness, the genial moralising worthy of Lamb at his best, should have lost-their charm, must be the fault of the reader, as. Indeed, he has the grace to admit.
your reviewer is evidently not one of those wicked persons who do not read the books which they impale with their pens, and so. when he speaks of ** pleasant,^ although somewhat vague, recollections of those novels, ** That Fortune,” ‘‘Golden House," ** A Little Journey in the world, their appeal, as human documents, was presumably not very strong. And yet, outside of Howells’s incomparable Portraiture. I do not recall any other three books which more accurately depict that particular phase of gilded existence which is attendant upon Wall Street fortunes and billionaire prosperity.- Published In the inverse onder mentioned, and all within the decade, their charm for the casual novel reader is quite as great as the value which they must possess for the careful student of modern-age social and economic conditions.
“ For what he did deserves grateful remembrance,” as you very rightly say, ^^d might say concerning any other " gentle, patient, and conscientious literary laborer ’* only In his case these qualities were allied to artistic constructive power, which, when the final word Is pronounced and the best sellers no longer sell, °ugnt to place Charles Dudley Warner on the library' shelf by the side of the best of his contemporaries.
