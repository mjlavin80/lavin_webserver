A New Story by Kipling—The learnings of Authors—Maeterlinck’s
“ Joyzelle.”
HE pleasure we all derive from the promise of a new story by Rudyard Kipling is not to be diminished, surely, by the accompanying: promise of much dispute, in this country at least, about the peculiar wording of the title. Even the short stories of Mr. Kipling have been deplorably scarce lately, and too many of them have been Pyecroft stories. The mystical poetry of “ They" is, to our thinking, greatly preferable to the engineering mysteries and excess of human coarseness in the Pyecroft tales. It may be true that in these tales Mr. Kipling has been the first to put modern engineering in literature, but it is literature of a sort that must appeal most strongly to engineers, and, so far as we have heard, it has not yet aroused them to positive enthusiasm. We have reason to hope that the new story by Kipling in the August Century will not be a Pyecroft tale. It treats of the doings of Americans in an English environment, But its title is ** An Habitation Enforced,” and the form of the indefinite article will excite amusing discussion here where we sound the aspirate In “ habitation ** and use with it an “ a " in preference to ** an.** Wherefore, we congratulate The Century Magazine. Mr. Kipling's new story is sure to be talked about.
