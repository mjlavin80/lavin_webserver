OHIO VETERANS
The Story of the Fifty-fifth Ohio
Regiment During the Civil War.*
NFESSEDLY, this record of a gallant Ohio regiment does *' not assume to be history— rather a storehouse of facts which some future historian may use.” It is compiled by the " historical committee ” of the regiment, and chiefly written by Capt. Hartwell Osborn, whose name appears on the title page. The Fifty-fifth Ohio was recruited during: the season of Northern discouragement which followed, the first battle of Bull Run. The men were drawn from the Counties of Erie, Huron, Sandusky, Seneca, and Wyandotte, and went into active service in January, 3SG2, under command of Col. John C. Lee. The regiment was a part of the column under Gen. Fremont which invaded the Valley of Virginia, and had , a number of encounters with Stonewall Jackson's opposing Confederate force— encounters which are all a part of history, but are not always recognizable as they are told here from the point of view of the Fifty-fifth Ohio. Somehow the impression conveyed is that Jackson always had more men and was nearly always beaten—very little being said of those forced marches of his back and forth to support the army of Lee, However, ln this part, at least, the book deals little with matters of general strategy. The regiment was in forced marches of its own to Romney and Moorefleld. Of the return to the latter place we have this record* The command had on the advance passed a certain plantation and set a guard over it to protect master and property—chattel and human. Now;
We passed the McNeal plantation again. But how changed ■was the policy of war now! Before when here we had to guard and protect this man and his estate. This time the boys were turned loose, with the result that a cyclone . seemed to have been at work. Cellar, larder, and garret disgorged and paid tribute to the boys In blue. And what a sight! As this marching column moved On they strung the contents of that rich plantation for ten miles along the route. Hogsheads of molasses, barrels of sugar, casks of preserves, caddies of tea, coffee, spices, fruits, with loads of bacon, flour, and produce from the garden, all were melting away as if by magic, while everywhere could be seen men with all manner of vessels conveying away what they ' could take as their share of the spoils. Some had jars, pitchers, pails, vessels of every known and some unknown descriptions, filled with anything coming to hand—a washdlsh filled with honey, a sloppail dripping with molasses, a scoop shovel carrying pickles, a dipper witn flour, a cuspidor filled with peanuts. One fellow had tied up some onions in the misses' underwear, while another was carrying* stockings filled with sugar.
That’s merely war, of course; yet It is somewhat amusing later to come upon an address, to the regiment made by Col. Lee, (who was about to give up the command,) referring to this very campaign. Says the Colonel handsomely, at; the end of an enumeration of marches and encounters;
While others were marauding, you were In the ranks while, others straggled, rob; bing and disgracing the American Army,
•	you were distinguished for your order and exemplary conduct.
The Fifty-fifth Ohio was present at the second battle of Bull Run, where it was posted as a reserve behind a battery on the left of the Centrevllle turnpike, and later was part of a column which stood off a charge of -Hood's Texas Brigade. The author thinks this check to the Con-
•	federate advance did much to render eas-: ier the following retreat of the Union
•	Army under cover of rain and darkness.
In the campaign of Antietam the Fifty-fifth Ohio hP-d no part, but it appears again att Chancellorsvilie, when the command was a part of that right wing upon ■which Gen. Jackson fell so suddenly, and by that strategic movement won the bat-
*	tie. It was here that Capt. Osborn was captured, and so had a chance to observe the Confederate advance from behind as well' as from before. Here, as in the case of Second Bull Run, a pretty full story of . the battle Is given, with a map which shows the positions of the various corps of both armless This plan is continued through-the remainder of the volume.
The Fiftyrfif.th Ohio, now under a new. Colonel, Charles^B. Gambee, has Its -part also in the. battle of Gettysburg, where It was posted at the crossing of the Em-mettsburg and Taneytown roads. Capt. Osborn gives a very spirited account of Gettysburg-^especially of Pickett's charge, of which It seems he commanded an, exceptionally good view. It is, howr ever, hardly worth while to quote another description of that battle.
Soon afterward the Eleventh "Army CoiT9» of which the Fifty-fifth Ohio was a part; was' sent to East Tennessee, where It" was actively "engaged in the fighting.ground Chattanooga, and especially on Mission Ridge. . Capt. Osborn's story here is, however, largely a restatement of the history we have all read. Afterward the regiment'las a part of the Twentieth Corps) marched with. Sherman

through Georgia, and at the battle of Resaca, in that State, lost its Colonel, Gambee. From Atlanta again, where the Twentieth Corps was in garrison, the regiment " marched to tho sea.” and from Savannah moved northward to Goldsbor-ough. As to this Southern campaign, the present volume confines itself to tracing military movements. You read no more stories like that of the cyclone which struck the McNeal plantation, in the .Valley of Virginia. Though it is persistently reported by the other side that such things happened, during Gen. Sherman's famous marches. The Fifty-fifth Ohio was mustered out of service at Louisville July 4, 1S6H.
The volume has scattered through It a vast number of reproductions of photographs—no less than eighty of them—of the members of the regiment, those members including both officers and men, and as the pictures are some of the vintage and process of the sixties and some quite modern they present an Interesting study. There are pictures, too, of a number of general officers—as of Sherman, Grant, and Thomas, The battle maps have already been mentioned, and thnre are. some views of monuments at Gettysburg and elsewhere, in which the regiment has a peculiar interest. As for the narrative, it cannot be expected to have those qual-ties which make for easy reading. For the most part it lacks them conspicuously enough. But the authors have made It plain that they regard their work not as a finished product, but as material for-the artist to come.
The last li5Q pages of the volume are/ devoted to a number of matters not nar-: rative. There Is a chapter upon the work of relief which was done by the women of , the counties from which the regiment '• came. There are briefer or longer sketches of officers and men. There are -personal notes and recollections, rolls of” the killed and wounded, rolls of the sur- : vivors, a very complete diary of tho regi- ' ment's movements all through the war, • and a roster of the whole command. 1
It is a book of incomparable-interest to-the veterans of the old command, of' con-slderable value to historians, and not : without interest also for tlie general: I reader.	’I
