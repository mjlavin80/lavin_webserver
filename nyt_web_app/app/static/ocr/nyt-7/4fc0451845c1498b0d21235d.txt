Those who remember the riches of humor and pathos that made Mr. Joseph C. Lincoln's “ Cap'n Eri " so delightful as a study of New England character will not need much urging to induce them to read " Partners of the Tide " by the same author, and there is every reason to suppose' that they will find in “ Captain Ez Titcomb,” whose Quaint personality dominates its pages, an acquaintance as pleasing as was that other old Cape Cod salt. “ Partners of the Tide,” like all first-class stories of its kind, is a ** boy's book” that Is fully equal to the task of interesting all who sympathize with boys, as well as boys themselves, for, though Mr. Lincoln indulges in the simplest of plots, carried to a conventionally happy conclusion by the most everyday sort of people, both incident and people have the one necessary attribute of bearing a striking likeness to the daily realities of life as most of us see them. Moreover, he is master of a quaint philosophy of his own that, put into the mouth of the inimitable Captain Ezra, is calculated to call out an extensive and prolonged smile upon even the severest countenance.
Bradley Nickerson is the boyish hero whom the story carries to fame and fortune in the good old-fashioned way, but it is Captain Ezra who takes him there, and it is for Captain Ezra that 1 “ Partners of the Tide ** will be remembered. He was all that a sea Captain ought to be—bluff and masterful on the I deck of his ship, but possessed of a i»he-nomenal kindness of heart underneath, and certain to captivate the imagination of every boy who reads this story, as ho did that of the forlorn little Bradley when he rescued him from the awful fate of growing up in an '* old maids' ” household and turned him into a first-class sailor.
Miss Prissy and Miss Tempy Allen, the old maids in question, and described by the
Captain as “ pretty old-fashioned craft, but seaworthy, hoth of ’era," are as delightful as himself >n their way and quite as good examples of the author’s appreciation of the kind of characters that are hewed out on the Peninsula of Cape Cod. Perhaps their devotion to the Captain is a- little overdrawn, but Mr. Lincoln gots enough fun out of their horo-worship and its embarrassing effect upon the gallant but wily Ezra to reconcile one to the very transparent exaggeration.
The real excitement of the story is saved untif the middle is welt passed, when Captain Ezra and Bradley, who have lost ttuMr position on the Thomas Dome through iefusing to wreck her. at their employers* 3utf?cstion, for the sake of the Insurance, go into wrecking business of a better sort and fight their way to success against many powerful rivals. In such an enterprise Captain Ezra's one weakness-the love of taking chances— stocd him In good ste;id. The way in which he gambled on the finding cf !ost anchors and chains and the still morn dubious prospects of floating stranded coal barges, all witii (he machinery commensurate with a verjr small capital, makes txcelicnt reading. *He ?nd Bradley would have fared badly enough In their ambitious undertakings had they not bren able to take the treacherous ocean tides into their partnership. “ Anchors and cables r nd wait for the tide” was the motto of the Titcomb-Nlckcrson Wrecking Company. Curiously ?nnugh, the same tide that forces the vessels on the shoals is the wreckers' greatest aid in getting them afloat again.
Incidentally a very pretty little love story *s worked out tor Bradley in the intervals of the wrecking business, and the narrative is enlivened by many excellent bits of character study. It is all written in the best sort of sea talk,, and Is altogether about as good an example of a sea yarn as often gets into print.
