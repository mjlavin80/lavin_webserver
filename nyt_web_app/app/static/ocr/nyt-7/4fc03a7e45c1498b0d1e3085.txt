their traditions—yes, and the ®ood red" blood in their own veins-^wUl allow! No more. As well say that Chesterfields, are sporadic, or science sporadic, or some precious and delicate plant sporadic. Our poets must have their high genius bespoke for them. They are not military heroes, springing: up at. the blast of a bugle, easily .is great to-day as at Marathon; they are priests ot a higher calling, yet they are the absolute slaves of periods, the tools and fools of the calendar. Fire from heaven is not tempted hither in such other breakfast-food fashions, but has the logic of proper centuries and right races to Justify its stooping to earth. We shall never have again oh this earth great poetry; but what matter, if we cherish the stores of those who already have sung for us, and on which men must lean more and more in very proportion to their pitiful powerlessness to add or to take away a line from M tbe volume of the book/'	STEPHEN	G.

Kcw York Times iSook Review;
On the subject of the decline of poetry— yes, and on every other subject—why not avoid, if we can. those loose habits of reasoning, those looser habits of expression, which so easily do beset us? Let us learn revelant, clear-cut, and well-ordered expression; where better than from the master of it—and the one who has said the irrefutable word, first and final,
on this very subject of poetry which Is bothering us—Macaulay himself.
Your two otber-sex correspondents of last week see this profound subject but at angles or from hazy distances. J say imaginative poetry declines as civilization advances. And, saying this, what more do i need to prove my contention than the bare testimony of history? Lefc me emphasize again, I have no reference to the inferior forms of true poetry, the lyric, dramatic, evolutional—even though they too are declining; I am speaking of the h.gheo^ form of poetry, the imaginative, of which Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, and Milton are the exemplars—who have left us, m Matthew Arnold’s haunting phrase, that upon which men may lean now,*, that upon which men may lean always. ’
What nonsense, too, to imagine that hardship and lack of appreciation depress the true poet. Read Carlyle’s essay on Burns and see this theory fade into thin air before his long-resounding fury of logic. Hear him say that we might never have had our Burns except for his tempestuous life of weakness within and sorrows without. The true poet sings as a bird sings, because his throat is full; but the bird’s song mounts to Its true heart-notes only by the ravished nest or in the cage which confines it. Poverty, suffer-mg, neglect—these are only the irritants of genius.
The reasons why real poetry declines as civilization advances are the clearest, the most convincing in the world, and with the testimony of history behind them and the desert of science before them, make a case absolutely overwhelming. They are in short, these: in a rado age tiie human inind is infinitely more impressionable, the Imagination immeasurably more active— brieriv. men’s minds are then exactly like the minds of little children. Every sensation, (-very scene, every experience, 13 magnified as children magnify their playthings. Trevelyan, by the way, tells us Macaulay was never tired of repeating that children aJ*e our only poets. As civilization advances, however, a steady pathological readjustment occurs by which the imaginative faeulry gives way to the critical facuJtj\ The* comforts, th* necessities of life, competition, invention, research, discovery, science, all .combine to ^hariren men’s wits but to weaken their Imaginations, and to take away from them their tleiightful character of grownup children. Gradually the process ^es on; poets become scarcer and scarcer; the sifter imaginative arts of painting and sculpture are included in the dc-adly encroach*nen!; bit by bit, century by century, then a Homer, iator a Daiite, a Milton, next a Tenryeon. an Alfred Austin, an EM win Markham; last tho numberless brood of versifiers and poetasters springing up like the sickly aiter^rc-wth when ih'- precious wheat is harvested.
One of your lady correspondents says that poets are *• sporadic.’* How pretty» Itut only an eighth truth. They are sporadic jest as far as their age, their race,
