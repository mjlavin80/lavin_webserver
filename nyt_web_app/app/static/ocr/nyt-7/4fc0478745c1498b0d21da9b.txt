'Sfcw Tork Tunes Boob Review: air. Clow's definitions ot “verse” and " poetry " are a little vague. " Verso " and •* poetry ” have always meant to me something very like “ body *’ and '* soul,’* and I believe the dictionary would bo on my side. Verse is the cup, tbe outward form; poetry the wine, the inner life. Therefore poetry must have versification, although it is easy for versification to contain no poetry at all. I have always used the words in that sense. But our , difference ot opinion lies much deeper than a mere quibble; It lies in this: that Mr. Clow is full of despair, and that‘I am full of hope.
Truly, poetry does “vary with modern times and seasons and external* circumstances.” It changes and grows like every living thing; it is always modern. The names of Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, Goethe, call up a time, a country, a brilliant moment of life. The one world-mind, the poet-mind. of all time, turns Its flashlight upon ft certain common spot of wilderness, and makes it radiant, makes it forever our own and modem. Tho flashlight is always the same, but the country changes. Or, better still, the sun rises every day, but it shines on a changed worid, in different colors.
If the sun rises every day it also sets every night. Poetry has its day and night, its Summer and Winter, its life and death, repeated again and again with the rhythm of ail life. Should that alone stay with us, when all other things come and go and change and come again? It is not fitty years—scarcely twenty—since the last of a great age have died. As certainly as the sun sets every night and rises again every day, so certainly will we have great poetry again, whether tt come In the old form of verse or in some new form of surpassing beauty.
As for circumstances, the poet does not need heroic inspiration. The poet is a lover of common life. To him breathing is an inspiration, to him motion is heroic; he finds harmony and rhythm in the changes of day and night; he sees nature and reality in the artifices of men. He will see to-day as he saw yesterday. Our steam engines are* imprisoned geysers; our electricity is captured lightning. Out of stone quarries and forests we have built ourselves a wilderness of houses; our commcrce is the trading ot a savage mass. And in the deserts and pathless woods of a new country we have more and wider wilderness than England had a thousand years ago.
I do not believe we are more materialistic than other countries in prosperous times, such as that of Qu«en Elizabeth, ! for instance. We 'are less self-indulging. Automobiles are no more materialistic 1 than stage coaches, and cynics and glut- , tons have been common in all ages. If onjy soap and fly screens and bath tubs had been as common!	!
But perhaps I am a. materialist myself. 1 I love the whole of things, body and soul* I I love a clean, rich, full life, such as the * best of tis are living now. I love to-day, 1 ail of it, even the rottenness and pessl- ; mism and struggle and shackles, but I love to-morrow even more. The latest times are still the best. A new day is coming, soon, soon, a day of literature that will bo self-sufficient, noble, free, that wilt weave this age and this country into tho eternal harmony of all living things,
I hope Mr. Clow and I will live to glory in It. As a woman I must tiavo the last word in this, argument, but I hope It will be the first word of a great new promise.
