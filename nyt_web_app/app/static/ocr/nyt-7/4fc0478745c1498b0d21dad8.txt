New York Times Booh Review:
I have been reading with interest tho discussion in the columns of The book Review of the poetical outlook Ln America. One of your correspondents In the South expresses a high opinion of EM win Markham's books of verse. Now I am minded to call the attention of your many readers to " Virgilia," a new and notable poem by this poet in the Augxist Cosmopolitan. I am not easy to please in poetry,
but this poem pleases me Immensely. It is a four-page poem, and perhap3 it might be improved by the omission of two or three stanzas, especially the second stanza- The editor tells us that the poem Is something of a literary event, as it is Mr. Markham’s “ first love-poem to appear in print.” The theme of the poem is the theme of Tennyson’s “ Maud," and I was greatly interested in seeing the original treatment given the idea by the later poet. Taken all in all. Edwin Markham's 44 Virgilia ” is perhaps the noblest love-poem of any length yet produced in America- I wonder whether your readers will agree with me. I quote two of the stanzas:
Do you mind that hour in the soft sweet morning	_
When I held you fast in divine alarms, l When my soul stood up like a god adorn-i	Iris'
His body with bright arms?
Forget it not till the crowns are crumbled And the swords of the kings are rent with rust—
Forget it not till the hills lie humbled And the SDrinK3 of the seas run dust, JOHN HENRY CRISTIE.
