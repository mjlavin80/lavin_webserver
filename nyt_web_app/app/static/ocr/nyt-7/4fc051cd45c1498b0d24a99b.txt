It was some time, wc are told, uefore C. W. Whall consented to write the new volume in W. R. Lethaby's Artistic Crafts Series of Technical Handbooks, dealing with “ Stained Glass Work.” (12mo. Illustrated. Pp. xxvUi.-33l. Boards. Cloth back. New York:	D. Appleton & Co.
pl.no net.) His reason, he says, is that he has always held that no art can be taught
by books, and that an artist's best way of teaching Is directly and personally to his pupils. These views led him to write his book in th£ simplest manner, so that every student of stained-glass work may understand what he has to say. He writes in a gossipy style, using very few technical terms, and explaining every seemingly difficult passage, just as though he were giving oral instruction.
The first paragraph explains that stained Blass means “ pieces of colored glasses put i together with strips of lead into the form of windows; not a picture painted on glasu with colored paints/’ Church windows, one learns, are made of pieces ot blue, red, bluish-white, green, and other colored glass used for making all sorts of bottles.
Such colored glasses are cut into the shapes of faces, or figures, or robes, or canopies, or whatever you want, and whatever the subject demands; then features are painted on the faces, folds on the robes, and so forth—not with color, merely with brown shading; then, when this shading has been burned into the glass in. a kiln, the pieces are put together into a picture by means oC grooved strips of lead, into which they fit.
Mr. Whall, who is a well-known English stained-glass expert and teacher, attempts to set forth plainly how all these things are done for the benefit of those who do not know. For those who are acquainted wltl« the subject he examines and discusses the right principles on which windows shoulu be made, and the rules of good taste and of imagination, which makes such a difference between " beautiful and vulgar " art. In the two parts into which he has divided the volume the author, therefore, intends to promote and produce skillfulness of hand and to direct it to worthy ends.
The photographic reproductions of windows in English churches have been given in collotype and not in colors, because, according to the author, the design could never be reproduced in any way to resemble the original. Mr. -Whall describes each picture. The many diagrams in the book are the work of two of his apprentices.
