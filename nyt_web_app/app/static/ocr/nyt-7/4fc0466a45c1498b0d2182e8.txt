The text is by G. E. Mltton, who was ! associated with Sir Walter Besant in his " Survey of London/’ and is author of i several volumes in the Fascination of London series, also edited by Besant. Both ' pictures and descriptions are the work, writes Mr. Mltton in his preface, of two people who " love London in all her varying moods, with her wonder, her unexpectedness, her dear familiarity/’ The ! first chapter is on M London as a Piece of I Mosaic," and tbe author writes in his \ opening paragraph:	—.
London is not one homogeneous whole, alike in all her parts, but rather a guttering piece -of mosaic work, consisting of innumerable facets, each separate in itself yet united with the rest, and forming together a wondrous and intricat# pattern. There are mud-colored lines and dark patches as well as ruby points; seen from one angle the total result is gray confusion, seen from another the radiant points so scintillate as to conceal the darker parts. Both visions are true, both are equally London, yet neither is the Whole truth, for neither of mud nor of rubles is the great city made.
