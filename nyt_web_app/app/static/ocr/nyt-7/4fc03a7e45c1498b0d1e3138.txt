Hamlin Garland’s " Rose of Dult'hpr's Coolly," just published in a new edition (The Macmillan Company, $l.uu) make**; after several years of existence a much more interest ins story than any which have latterly come from Mr. Garland's pen. Those who read it when it wap new a few years ago will remember that its strength lies in the story of the child life and budding womanhood of a farmer's girl in a part of the West where the social machinery is still somewhat crude. The same adjective may be applied to the novel, but there are glimpses of unconventional truth in It which will no doubt commend it now to a new set of readers. To be sure^Mr. Garland is somewhat painfully self-conscious when he touches upon the matters Mrs. Grundy counts unmentionable—save in the whfsper of scandal—but you will find a deal of the real girl about his Rose, and in the earlier part of the story—the days of school and the coming of young love with the circus—the author Is not at all the same man who not long ago wrote " The Light of the Star." By 'the way, there’s a curiously feminine touch about many of the little things the author records about his heroine—especially when he touches upon the affairs of the wardrobe. The present edition is bound in brown and adorned with gilt.
