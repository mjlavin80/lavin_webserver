EORGE BURNHAM IVES, the 'well-known translator of the elder Dumas and of certain volumes by Alphonse Daudet, is at his home in Salem, Mass., finishing up some jwork drawn from: Sainte-Beuve and critically descriptive of the French writer of the seventeenth century. The work will be published by the Put- ■< -nnmq in two volumes as a sequel to Katharine Prescott Wormeley’s transla tlon of one volume made up of material drawn from the same source.
Miss Wormeley, who, by the way, probably more exact knowledge concerning pa]gnr» than anybody else in this country his entire works having been Englished by her pen—tells the following story of the great father of realism; Balzac at the age of thirty-two gave himself over to the study of chirograpby and of the character which might be read from the traces made by the pen. He applied his skill to mch an extent that his friends flooded with script, and he, usually to their amazement, told marvelous things* Among other specimens presented was the exercise book of a twelve-year-old schoolboy. Balzac on examining the handwriting inquired of the lady who brought the book whether the boy was her own. On receiving a negative reply he said, with his eyes still bent upon the book:
“ Madame, this child is thick-headed and frivolous. He will never come to any good. If he were my child I would take him from school and send him into the fields to work.*'
And then it was that the lady gently "broke to the amateur graphologist that the exercise book had been written twenty years before by a child called Honorfi de Balzac.
Mme.	zen aide ragozin. the
well-known Egyptologist and As-syriologist, author of “ The Story of Chaldea ” and “ The Story of Assyria,*' i will spend the Summer completing a book for the Putnams at her St. Petersburg home in Rue GogoL In recently writing ; to a friend who had asked for information concerning the internal affairs of Russia, Mme. Ragozin replied:
" I see too many sides at once to every ' fact, to every question; I feel too much ^ that everybody is right and everybody ia wrong. This is philosophy, not politics.
I wait and I grieve and I hope—wish, , of course—but it is all too confused, too 1 vacillating; besides I do not feel in me ! the strength to fight the mass of lie, prejudice, ignorance, and hatred which makes up the bulk of all the ‘ copy * ; about Russia that floods the presses of the world,”
Mme. Ragozin. although a Russian by birth, is an American citizen, and would probably be able to give much valuable information on the eternal Russian enigma which would be from an intelligent cosmopolitan point d view.

THE question. Will the autocracy ot* Russia be forced to yield? was put the ether day to A. Cahan. author of that interesting novel of Revolutionary Russia, *' The White Terror and the Red." Mr. Cahar. replied as follows:
“ I think it wilL The reactionary element is represented by Boulygin, Minister of the Interior, and Gen. Trepoff, Minister of Police. At present the reactionaries seem cowed. The press of Russia to-day is printing things which would have sent the editors to Siberia ten years ago. It is almost free. The ‘ underground press,* which is described in * The White Terror and the Red/ Is not much more radical than the regular papers. Even the conservative papers denounce the advisers of the Czar. What Is likely to happen Is that the Czar will yield, that the Zemstvo! representatives will be allowed io meet, and will practically dictate terms for a representative Government, free speech, and amnesty for political offenders. BouIygin*s Constitution will be discarded, and a more liberal Constitution adopted. The mob will be quieted by the Zemstvoi representatives, who are in touch with the peasants and the revolutionists, who can Influence the working people. But unless this is done promptly there will be an epidemic of bomb throwing and many violent deaths.*’
WHEN " The Dynamiter,*' which this week makes its appearance in the new biographical edition of Stevenson, was written at Lyeres, the author, besides other ills, was, according to his wife, threatened with total blindness.
Here.” she says, *' was a predicament for a literary mac! Condemned to lie helpless on his bed on account of the sciatica, his right arm bound to his side lest an inadvertent movement might bring on a recurrence of the hemorrhage, speech denied him for the same reason, and now a banda£* over his eyes that precluded any attempt to use them! **
It was-finally suggested that Sirs. Stevenson was to go for an hour's walk every afternoon, and on „ returning re-.peat, a story which had been invented in the meantime, a sort of Arabian Nights entertainment—she as Scheherazade and J he as the Sultan. "There had been several dynamite outrages in London about this time," continues Mrs. Stevenson, “ the most of them turning out fiascos. It occurred to me to take an important ; dynamite intrigue as the thread to string my stories on. I began with a Mormon tale, and followed it with innumerable i others, one for each afternoon.” It was these stories that were afterward developed into “ The Dynamiter,"
APROPOS of Stevenson, there is a story concerning him and Sir Don:	aid	Mackenzie	Wallace, whose
“ Russia" has just been brought out by the Holts In a new and revised ; edition. At the time of the Turco-I Russian war Stevenson was living : in Edinburgh, and had come into pos! session of a copy of the book, of which ! he had written an enthusiastic review for tbe paper with which he was then connected. For him, it was the book of the day, and, happening to find himself at a literary gathering among some gentlemen who were interested in Russian affairs, he expatiated upon the unequaled merits of the volume, not only reciting the author's facts, but speculating upon his opinions as well. One of his hearers took issue with him. Stevenson swept him aside with a gesture and the exclamation: *' But, my dear Sir, I know what I am talking about. I have just reviewed Sir Donald Wallace’s book on 'Russia'! What is tbe source of your information? " “ The same book," was the reply.
*' Tou have been reading it, too? " asked Stevenson.
“ I bad to,'* replied the other, 44 for I wrote it.”
AS autograph and photograph collectors probably know, F. Marion Crawford i	when in New York lives In an office
building not far from his publishers, The 1 Macmillan Company. From the outside,
| the suite he occupies gives every illusion of a commercial interior. At necessary : periods, the author of " Pietro Ghlsleri," &c., is here visited by a bootblack and a barber. No sooner is Mr. Crawford in town than he Informs these unattached retainers and they respond. It Is needless to say that both are Italians—the bootblack is a Genoese and the barber a Sorrentino. One day Mr. Crawford asked the -bootblack in his native dialect, 41 Where were you born?"
" In Genoa," was the reply.
“ And what Is your name? "
** Patrick Murphy."
** Magnifico! How in the world did you get that name? ”
" I took iL"
“ But why did you choose that particular name? **
" Ah, Excellency, it was because I wanted people to think I was an American."
The SorTcntino was much concerned one day because Mr. Crawford, who always keeps a book or pen in hand while the barber is at work, could not dissociate himself long enough to admire the work of the tonsorial artist. So the latter put the following interrogations, each ending with a respectful "Excellency”:
" You are very busy? You work all the time? You never go to hear the opera? Never to the theatre? *’
“ Yes," absently replied Crawford, “ I work like a dog."
14 Ah! ** sighed the Sorrentino, as he dreamily raised his eyes and placed one hand over his heart, “ I sympathize with you. We artists. Excellency, Indeed live a dog's life."

George E. Burton's recent book, “ The Boys of Bob's Hill," has been compared with Mark Twain’s Tom Sawyer.’* In this connection the unique criticism that pleased its author most came from a boy who is a stranger to him. After the little
fellow had finished the story he exclaimed, “This book'Is different from other books, isn’t it? " And upon^being asked in what -respect; he replied, " Why, somehow these : boys do things just as real boys would.’* Gustav Kobb£, author ot '‘ Wagner’s Life and Works,"- “Wagner’s Music Dramas Analyzed," &c., has provided an Introduction and descriptive text- to connect the letters comprising the volume,. ..**■ Wagner’ and His Isolde,*' which Dodd, Mead & Co. have in press.	:	J	V
