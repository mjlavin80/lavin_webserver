OW that Mr. Rudger Blecck-er Jewett has an administrative position in the publishing* house of the John Lane Company, It is possible that he may set before the public some manuscripts which came to him on the death of David Dwight Wells, whose literary executor he is. The fame which Mr. We Us won when as Secretary to Minister Bayard at the Court of St. James's he wrote *’ Her Ladyship’s Elephant ” is still undhnln-ished, as every year that humorous skit on an American official amid English society passes through at least two impressions. After " Her Ladyship’s Elephant ” came “ His Lordship’s Leopard/’ and then a novel of South American intrigue and British duplicity called “ In Parlous Times.” This last was a posthumous work, and was put into book form by Mr. Jewett.
During his short fiterary career, which was begun at Harvard University in 2890 to end with his death at Norwich. Conn., scarcely half a dozen years later, Mr. Wells wrote, besides the books mentioned above, about half a hundred short stories, only a few of which have been published, and a humorous mystical novel, the scene of which is laid in Spain and called by the author " The Figure Four ’’—after the Pythagorean symbol. - Of course the ten and fifteen cent magazines have made volumes of short stories, unless bearing the names of celebrated raconteurs, a drug in the market; but there is not the slightest doubt that the brief fiction that came from the pen of the author of " Her Ladyship’s Elephant '• was far above the average. Mr. Wells was always fertile in Imagination, and his incidents were always dramatic, whether leading up to tears or laughter. Then, too, he made a curious double use of hyperbole—first, ; as a bland statement of fact, the untruthfulness of which was always ap- 1 parent, and secondly, as an apparent perversion of truth, the verity of which he was sure to clinch in the next sentence.
BESIDES the novels and biographies in which John Paul Jones figures there may be found in the Catalogue of the Bibliot£que Nationale in Paris a numbe* of items which designate the founder of the American Navy as an author writing In French. The principal work was published by Jones under the pseudonym of “Prirce de Burllabled,” and is entitled ** The Life of Louis XVI.,’* thus expressed on the title page of the volume:
LA VIE DE LOUIS XVI.

The three distinguished ** personages ” mentioned, called *' Jnteriocuteurs des dialogues,” the Prince Polonois, Count Po-lonois, Bnron Russe, were in reality John Paul Jones, Count Richisbeanwish. and

Another item bears the following legend:

Therein Paul Jones, in energetic and amiable terms reproaches the good people of Lyons for the disorders in their municipality, and ends by giving them frank and wholos*omo advice. He sets forth tho abuses, donnuncos their faults, and, although a foreigner, he is carried away by the intrinsic fury of his harangues, which lack neither interest nor originality.
IT is a fact not generally known that the hero of John Hay's celebrated poem, “ Little Breeches,*’ which may be found in the Houghton-Mifflin collection. is a son of Solomon Van Scoy of Xcw Virginia. Ia.. and is now living near Letts, a husky farmer. Laren Talbott of Sioux City, a cousin, recalls the incident upon which tho poem was based, and tells about it as follows:
My cousin was about four years old when he broke into fame. Van Scoy was driving a spirited team near New Virginia one da5*, and when he got out of the wagon for a minute the team dashed away, with the boy in the wagon. The horses went over ditches, fences, and brush piles. Finally the wagon was overturned and the little fellow was thrown head first into a drove of sheep. The father and friends, running frantically in an effort to catch the runaways, saw the accident to the boy. The father rushed to the spot, fearing to find the little fellow . dead, but on the approach of his father : the boy sat up and said: “Dad* give me a chaw of ter backer.” That was the inci-
dent which prompted John Hay to write liLu famous verses.
MRS. RUTH KIMBALL GARDINER, the well-known writer of short stories, whose first novel, “The Heart of a Girl,” bears the A- S. Barnes & Co. imprint, has laid her scenes amid the places familiar to her own girlhood. She waa born in Carllnvllle, HL, educated at Fargo, N. D., Omaha, Neb., and St. Paul, Minn. She began newspaper work at eighteen, and was the first woman telegraphic correspondent when she became the Washington correspondent of The St. Paul Globe.
“ The Heart of a Girl ” is the story of a lonely child, acutely alive to the children about her, forming attachments, but making no confidants. Yet, when she is introduced, sitting on the gate post swinging her feet In the new way, while she looks after the children who are old enough to go to school, the quality of the child with a temperament may be distinctly felt.
Mrs. Gardiner’s story represents a phase in the psychology of childhood to the study of which such writers as Kenneth Grahame, George Madden Martin, and Marion Hill have contributed. Normal physical child life is predisposed against silent children, a prejudice shared almost as unreasonably by many of their elders. The silence of a child has been so long Interpreted as fear—to be rigorously bullied—that fear and cowardice have been implanted where there had existed only the silence of exquisite, over-fine perception and truth. Mrs. Gardiner is said to have presented in Margy a faithful picture of just such a child.
