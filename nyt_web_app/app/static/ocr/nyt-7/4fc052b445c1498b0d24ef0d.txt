VOLUME EL of Mr. Livingston's '* Auction Prices of Books" Is at hand, seemingly a little later than was hoped, but nevertheless in very gocd time. The flist volume approved Itself at once, and the second and succeeding volumes will receive a warm welcome. Their value is but slightly indicated by tlie price asked for the set. This second volume includes the entries from Dickens to La Peyr$re, and contains the records of
prices of tho books of an astonishingly large number of famous names. Dickens, Austin Dobson, Dry den, Erasmus, Eugene Field, Fielding, FitzGerald, (Omar's inventor,) Benjamin Franklin, Irving, Jefferson, Samuel Johnson,- Keats, Kipling, Lamb are some of those whose books have gained the honor of record here—-indeed, a goodly list, not easily to be beaten or excelled by the later volumes.
W irn tue reeortis of the sales of books of such writers between its covers, the volume offers a rich field for the book-lover who browses around; but to the bibliographer it will prove exceptionally valuable. Dickens takes up nearly seventeen pages with his books; the presentation copies command good prices, but there has been a good deal of variation In the prices which the writings have brought at different times.- Pierce Egan’s sporting books are pretty active tellers, and fill four pages, while Emerson’s works, ln two and a half pages, manage to keep Just within the limit of price that brings them into the volume. Eugene Field’s books are “ good sellers,'* and more than two pages are taken up with their records. John Fiske's books are appreciating on the auction block, his " Discovery of America, ” published in 1S92, two volumes in four, boards, rising from $13 in 1S95 to $88 in 1903. The famous or infamous Fortsas catalogue Is recorded twice in this volume, bringing, in paper covers, ?G in 1878, and in morocco. gilt top, $36 In 1800. Benjamin Franklin takes up nearly five pages,-and all his books sell well under the hammer. Goldsmith is another whose works are the cause of active bidding. Keats is a name to conjure with in this volume, and has been for some years, the original editions of his books commanding as a rule steadily rising prices; but Kipling holds the championship of the strenuous auction room. In this book the record of his prices covers nearly five pages. Very ^evidently It were wise to bug first editions of Keats and Kipling at low rates and sell them at high. If the activity In K and K continues we may expect to find their Issues listed on the Stock Exchange. They are active enough, tn aH conscience.	'
Why does the same book vary tn auo-tion value? is a question that arises conr tinually as one looks at the sal^ records. A Grolier dub book, “ Catalogue of an Exhibition of Engraved Portraits of English Writers,’' published in 1893, brought
