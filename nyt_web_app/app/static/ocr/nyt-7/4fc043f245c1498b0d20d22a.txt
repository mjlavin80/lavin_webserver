may be and hope to be our equals to-! morrow, or perhaps to rise a bit higher. It Is the’ unusual opportunities^ of American life that make it democratic, and the theoretic generalities which Mr. Jefferson worked up lii his plea In justification of the Revolution were valid and effective' only in the degree that the novel conditions of life in the new country made them so. Throughout M. Huret’s book he applies, this .idea, in a hundred ingenious and striking’ ways. It Is an Idea that Americans can study with advantage. In iiis book they , can study It, and many others, with much enjoyment. *

UR readers will recall a very bright little volume of observations on our country published last year by M. Jules Huret, the correspondent of the Paris Figaro. He was with us in all eight months, and he has now brought out a second volume, the fruit of his jonrneyings from New Orleans to the Pacific Coast and back again to Canada. It is somewhat more scrappy and disconnected than the first volume, but is not the less interesting on that account. That feature of the book rather serves to emphasize the modesty of its pretensions. The reader who takes it at its professed value, and seeks in it the impressions made on a keen and candid newspaper man in the course of a rapid but industrious series of stops and starts in a foreign land, will be well repaid for his time and would be for his trouble if any trouble were required in following the lively chat. Naturally M. Huret writes for the readers of the Figaro, and it is the custom of that unique journal to serve its readers with the material for conversation. as well as for thought, and the perusal of M. Huret’s notes is very much like sitting at table with that gentleman. It is sure to be agreeable, and It may, if one takes it rightly, be profitable.
Not that he does not note many things in our life, in our customs, in our manners—especially our manners— that fail to please him, and we are not to be expected to accept all his comments. Neither on the other hand need we resent them. Even though we find some of them extravagant and some seem a little perverse, we should do much better to reflect on them, sift out the truth in them, and take it to heart. For M. Huret Is essentially an honest and a kindly critic, and he does not spare comparison with his own countrymen which the latter are quite as likely to take offense at as we are to feel what-he says about us. At any rate, he has produced a book about America, whatever Its minor errors, fitted to give to his readers, whether French or American, a more vivid and, so to speak, a more workable, notion of our country than they probably had before. He is not a psychologist and
s
romancer, like M. Bourget, nor a historian and economist, like M. Leroy-Beaulieu, nor a professional critic like M. Brunetifere, all of whom have visited us and written of us. But he is a wideawake, busy, good-natured journalist with pockets and head stuffed with notes well worth talking about.
One shrewd inference M. Huret carries back with him to Paris. It is that a great deal in the manners of Americans, In their methods and standards, in what they like to call their ** institutions,” in their relations and bearing toward each other, a great deal of their '* democracy,” in short, has nothing to do with the theory of equality, but is due to the fact of practical equality. He finds us all as prone as people of another origin, with other professed principles, to assert Individual superiority, to assume special rights and privileges, to lord it over our inferiors, and to set up class distinctions, but he also finds that these things are not easy because our inferiors of to-day
