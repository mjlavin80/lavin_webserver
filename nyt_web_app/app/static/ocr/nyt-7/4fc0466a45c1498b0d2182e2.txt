Some Impressions of Famous Writers from Henry W- Nevinson*s New Book.
OMETHZTNG has already been said in The New Ydrs Times Book Review of Henry W. Nevinson's . new volume of collected literary Impressions and appreciations, “ Books and Personalities," (New York: The John Lane Company J The book contains studies and articles contributed to many periodicals by Mr. Nevineon, who is a -critic with the power of graphic expression, and brings a fresh and original mind to the treatment of old themes. We append a selection of his most striking appreciations of T^nglisTi and foreign authors:
HEINE’S LYRICS.
ENGLISHMEN demand two qualities chiefly from a lyric poet—the two qualities of reality and brevity. And if that is so, Heine should be especially dear to us. The poems of his maturity are always of present interest efcid unmistakable meaning. In all his works I only know one where the intention is not perfectly clear, (“ Nachtliche Fahrt/’) And as to brevity, the average length of his songs is not more than twelve or sixteen short lines; many of the best only run to eight; some to four.
This excellent gift of brevity and the self-restraint which relies so much on the understanding of the reader is at the root of a peculiar quality most characteristic of Heine, but hard to fix and define. I have heard it called lyrical irony. It is a sudden reserve at the very moment when femotion is at its height, a, refusal to do more than hint at the depth of feeling in the poet's mind- It comes quickly, generally at the end of a poem, sometimes almost with a shock, and it is -a sure defense against sentimentality and the boredom which a long rhapsody of personal and intimate feelings almost always produces.
GOETHE.
GOETHE is the bridge from another age to our own. Belonging to both, njifl equally set in the earlier and later times, he carries us, as it were, across a gulf of extraordinary change. In his career the whole thought of the age is reflected. From stage to stage he followed every movement of the world, where he did not h<msftlf lead it. Each of his works and every point of-his life is representative of an epoch such as is rarely witnessed among mankind. He grew with the rapid growth of years. " I have always been nfrp a snake,’* he used to say. “ I cast my slough and start afresh/*
As a creative artist perhaps he does not stand quite so high as when ail the world was reading ** 'Werther,” or when the fragments of “ Faust ” filled the poets of Europe with astonishment. Probably few Englishmen read him now with the enthusiastic hope which Carlyle’s early writings Inspired for at least one generation. It is true that in the most barren of his fifty volumes the literary scavenger may still 'light upon jewels of wisdom,, the brighter for their unexpectedness. But in the writings of a Hi an whose interests were so wide there is inevitably much of only temporary value. There is much, too, that is chilled by German pedantry and that stiff M privy-councillor ” style at which even Germans laugh, though
Law,” as it is understood In the Psalms, and to the principle of -eternity, which ha almost identifies with the same law, are proof of his lifelong occupation with conduct—and what he liked to call Hebraism. But there again comes in that characteristic we noticed above, i Keeping his eye always fixed on England, he found that in England there is a strong tendency to exaggerate his Hebraism (the word is not satisfactory, but he has made it familiar) to the exelusion of knowledge, to the exclusion of sweetness and light”; and so it blocked, the path of culture, which 1,3 “ the harmonious expansion of all the I powers which male** the beauty and j worth of our human nature." He saw 1 that the strictness of conscience incul- ; cated by “ Hebraism *’ was not preventing our aristocracy from becoming, i as he used to say, materialized barbarians, or our middle classes from be- * coming a brutalized populace. And it was for this Teason that he insisted upon the “ sweetness and light,” the "sweet reasonableness," for which the English as a race did not appear to be distinguished. For this reason he advocated the “free play of consciousness** around an abuse or proposal of reform rather than the far easier belief in “ machinery,” which is the besetting sin of English political thought- Greatness, he saw, has nothing to do with commerce or coal or iron or wealth In any form. Greatness has nothing to do with “ machinery,” whether political or social. “ Greatness is a spiritual condition worthy to -excite love, interest, and admiration,” and it was at that spiritual condition that he himself aimed throughout a life of rigorous endeavor and almost inhuman restraint. Inhuman ? Well, his books won for him interest, they won for him admiration; but has any one on their account given him “ the greatest of these I three ”7 x

STOICISM AND EMCTETUS.
WHEN we speak of Stoics, even of such an affable and benign type as Epictetus, we seem to see a procession of gray forms, enveloped in togas, stalking unmoved through this dirty puddle of a world and betraying their mental torture only by the fixity of their smile. We know they are good men and true, we know they follow virtue, and would be turned from their path by no anguish and no form of death. We know they alone stand for < righteousness when she is sorely beset. We should know all that, even If they were not continually mentioning the fact. We know also that they want to be nice to us and not to put themselves in any way above their fellow-men. We hear them imploring each other to try i to enjoy life with other people—as if > that were a mighty difficult task! When we meet them they manufacture a laugh, and set themselves with su, perhuman effort to "be pleasant, like philanthropists entertaining the poor ! with educational games tn the East End. For all this we are grateful, for [ we can imagine what effort must cost them. We recognize their virtue. In the slight chilliness and melancholy of 1 their demeanor we see the mood of , good men wandering between two worlds. We admire their positivism^ ; | the constancy with which they refuse to put off with any fond dream that the I laws of reason and arithmetic will not | allow. We admire their " passionate coldness." But as poor bedraggled and "bespattered mortals, we take leave to remark that it is a passionate warmth , rather than coldness that moves the sun and the other stars.

U NDERLYING his wildest visions and most paradoxical laments j	was	the	perfectly	solid	basis of
! practical truth. When all is said, the heath of all his long endeavor lay in the discovery—not so very startling or ecstatic, one would have thought—that the workman is of more importance I than the work, and that, as far as I beauty goes, it is no good painting pretty pictures and talking about art as j long as the life of most people is spent in dreary or disgusting ugliness, and i I the usual accompaniment* of growth ! and progress is the poisoning or disfig-i urement of nature. Those propositions i appear sane enough, and indeed it was the sanity of his work more even thnr> its imaginative charm Which gave him his power. Perhaps that is why the last words I ever heard him speak have always remained so clearly in my mind.
, It was during his last journey abroad, in the midst of the mountains he loved best. “ There are, of course, good people still,” he said to me with his half , smile, ” but they seem to spend all j their time in undoing the harm the oth- I ers have done—in nursing, reforming the East End, teaching idiots, and so on, while the healthy -and hopeful are neglected." But It is the sane, -and not the sick, who talk of Ruskin as an impracticable madman who wrote good prose. It is pleasant to remember such words. *	■	.

GEORGE MEREDiTH.
THERE are men of letters who wear a shut-up; Indoor look. Their faces are like "the windows of a sick chamber; we dimly divine-the invalid and delicately curtained soul within. But the very look of Meredith tellsof the open sky, where the sun, inarches/ and the winds pipe* and the thunderclouds mass their battalions. He might .have sailed with Drake; he would hove made a fine leader of forlomhopesand a fine hunter. He “ blows the horn of the wild old forest/’ .	,	.
.. His, is the head.-of an. orator, too^-a Greek orator, like Pericles, whose words , the historian might have unregistered as an everlasting possession. The great
*
mouth opens almost four square. It is an attic mask, a magician’s cave. A spirit seems to be speaking, not with it, but through it, and on a broad scale of sound comes the voice, full, unhesitating and distinct to the last letter, like the voice of one who has spoken much among the waves. We feel that, as Mendelssohn said of Goethe, he could shout like a hundred warriors. Perhaps his slowly increasing deafness had made his utterance even more remarkable when last I saw him: but in earlier days also his words fell rather in superb monologue than in conversation.
There is no effort about the language; the great sentences are thrown out with lavish opulence—the careless opulence of Nature at her kindest. There is no pausing for figures, wit. or epigrams; they come of themselves, as water follows water from a spring. It is the style of his books. There is the same concentration, the same fullness, and the same irony; but it is all simpler because more unstudied, and whereas some pages of the books have become difficult and dark, the effect of the spoken word when first it is uttered is wholly illumination and delight. He appears almost to think in pictures and symbols; a comely lady and mature becomes to him at once “ a calm Autumn day—and In the morn-fng/* In speaking of society conversation he at once sees a flock of sheep jumping a ditch in turn; a burst of laughter makes a gap; there is a pause; then the rest come hurrying over— “ some of them falling short, their hind feet struggling over the edge/*
