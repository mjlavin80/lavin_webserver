OLD NEWFOUNDLAND.
Theodore Roberts’s Stirring Tale of Fishers and Savages in the Sixteenth Century.
N SEARCH of a fresh field of interest and a plot unusual enough to please the jaded taste of those who pretend to keep up with %
the vast output of . the fiction makers, Mr. Theodore Roberts has put his " Brothers of Peril ” back in the Newfoundland of the sixteenth century, when the island was inhabited by the now extinct race of the Beothic Indians and utilized simply as a fishing station by the cod-seeking fleets of England, France, Spain, and Portugal. In the interior dwelt the savages, all of one' race, but
divided at this time into two nations or tribes that bitterly hated each other and were in constant strife for the mastery; while around the misty headlands of the coast the Old World fishermen, adventurers* and pirates strove and toiled together. With their usual foresight, English merchants had undertaken the guardianship of the prospective riches of the ** Newfounde Land," and their fishermen representatives, whose duty It was to see that no foreign settlements weTe made on the island, and that they themselves got the best of everything, ruled by right of might in all the harbors. Fishing, not colonizing, was the object of their efforts in this part of the Western Ocean, and they did not intend that any sturdy souls, even among their owt^numbers, still less among the •foreigners, should ever form settle- ! ments that would interfere with their greedy search for wealth.
Out of such promising material— bold fishermen, picturesque adventurers, threatening savages, and, . for background of it all, the primeval wil- i demess—has Mr. Roberts woven his romance of old Newfoundland. In his preface he frankly disclaims the attach-
*	ment o& any historical value to the story, admitting that practically nothing is recorded of the ancient Indian tribe which he has resurrected for the purposes of fiction; that he has drawn the wilderness of the sixteenth century in the likeness of tie wilderness as he knew it a few years ago; and that he has not tried to make the men and women in his story any different in their hearts from those of to-day. In short, instead of laboriously carrying ; his readers back to a rude age, he has adopted the simpler plan of translating scene and people into modern terms, with a due regard to the spirit, if not the letter, of history. The result is a rarely good tale of adventure in which the characters are vividly drawn and the interest is never allowed ‘to fall below the properly breathless point.
“ Brothers of Peril " tells the adventures of a young English cavalier who had left his father* s counting house and “taken passage on one of the Devon fishing boats in search of fresh expert- I ences in the New World. Left behind either through malice or chance, when the fleet sailed for England in the Fall, he would have got more than he bar-"* gained for when compelled to spend the Winter on the island’s inhospitable j shore, had not the kind fate that watches over story book cavaliers guided him to a little settlement where another Englishman, his daughter, and a few followers were hiding from the law. He throws in his fortunes with the little colony—an act that was any-‘ thing but a sacrifice, considering the absorbing interest which the daughter immediately acquired in his eyes—and then follows an exciting succession .of encounters with perils of every description known to sixteenth century wildernesses. There is a very troublesome French gentleman in the company, who persists In disputing the-hero’s claims to the only possible heroine in the book, and his dark plots, together with the .attacks of the hostile -- Beothlcs and some thrilling fights* at sea with pirates, give Mr; Roberts plenty of opportunity for stirring scenes. The lady of the fort has some of the willful char' *
