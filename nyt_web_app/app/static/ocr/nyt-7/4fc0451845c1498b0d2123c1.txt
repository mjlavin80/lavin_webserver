from town to town, attending to tho business details, and delivering an address, which she had '* procured to be written.” She made her first appearance in the Federal Street Theatre, Boston, and thereafter spoke in Providence, Worcester, Holden, Brookfield, Springfield, Northampton, Albany—two nights—Scht*- ! nectady, and Ballston Springs. Her own journal, quoted in the little book, is in- , teresting and well w*ritten; her lecture, on the other hand, Is pure twaddle. It waa not written by her, remember. It is apologetic to a degree, and tells nothing of her experiences, and only incidentally, among high-flown and stilted references to " the horrid delusion of war," " havoc, carnage, and death,” does it mention that Mistress Sampson was at White Plains (in 1770) and at York Town in 1781.
More interesting than the lecture is the introduction, written at the time of her tour. This describes how " under the superintendence of Messrs. Powell and Harper she was ushered on to the Stage in a very polite manner; where, before a crouded assembly, perfectly unabashed, she very audibly recitea Tier naration. Jn ________________

At her later lectures ** an attendant " introduced her by a *‘ prosjject-us " in rhyme, wherein it was declared that Mrs. Gannett did not speak for fame: Her boldest claim is simple, gen'ine truth; Her humblest plea is for her Sex and Youth,
The prospectus ends with these thrilling lines:

When Liberty’s at stake, a FEMALE storms the Throne!
