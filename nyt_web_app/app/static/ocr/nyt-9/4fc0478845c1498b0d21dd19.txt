The Actress -Who Is* Heroine-of .Ari-thohy Hope’s New Novel Considered as “A Man’s Woman.”*
OMETHING less than half a . dozen - years ago Mr. Frank Norris gave the public his conception of “ a man's woman." She was a logical, capable,' self-sufficing person; a professional nurse, and for no other reason, than a desire ** to count In the general economy of things." Having assisted her in a peculiarly harrowing operation and through several cases of desperate illness, we bade -her adieu with immense respect, admiration—and relief, our nerves sorely shaken, her own beautifully firm* A grand creature, surely. But " a man’s woman "— Heaven save the mark!
Mr. Norris’s misfit title might well have been given to “ A Servant of the Public/* that servant being “ a man’s woman,” If ever one there were. Beautiful, unrea.^ sonable, iridescent, kaleidoscopic, Ora Pinsent has the indefinable and man-enslaving quality of charm. She becomes a distinct value in every life which touches hers, and yet she is so made up of contradictions that her closest woman friend has to say of her: “ I admire and despise, love and most bitterly hate, Ora Pinsent.” The author makes her career as a star of the stage wholly subordinate to her personality. The actress is of use in the story simply to explain and extenuate the woman. Under any circumstances Ora Pinsent must have been of the opal type of femininity. Given the spark of genius, the adulation* and unreality of the theatre, it was inevitable that she should stand outside her own soul, translating into drama Its deepest things; that the need of excitement and of admiration should be Imperious; that the eternal stars should be blotted out by the glare of the footlights.
Holding her In safe perspective, one’s summing up must be that of Lady Kil-norton and of Alice Muddock, but her creator does not allow that safe perspective, and hig reprehensible and entirely adorable “ servant of the public " carries ..us oft our feet quite us surely 0&'sh& does 1 her hapless lovers. We agree, too, with 1 Lord Bowdon that, while ” she hasn’t , anything else," the instinct of morality she has:
If she sacrificed others, if her nature were shaped to that, was she not a sacrifice tierseif—sacrificed that beautiful ! things might be set before the eyes and in the hearts of men? Let judgment then be j gentle and love unashamed.
; One seldom meets in fiction a character i drawn with such sympathy, such insight, such delicate and decisive art as is this of Ora Pinsent. One cannot but perceive the unusual difficulties to be met in her portrayal and the triumphant case with which they have been surmounted.
She by no means overshadows her unusually excellent " sup'port.” The two women whose lives she most perturbs are

very human—each in her way Cine. The two men, if less interesting, are clear and manly figures, chary of sentiment and knowing how to save the face of a situation as English gentlemen should. The minor characters are drawn with a firm hand, and all combine to develop a plot of much originality, unflagging in Its hold upon its readers, the author’s keen wit and ripe wisdom apparent upon every page.
He is never Insistent upon a theory, but he has faith in the ultimate law of " like unto like," and not the least striking feature of the story Is the obedience with which each character fulfills this law of its being, wheeling eventually into its own orbit, no matter how many its aberrations. Thus the girl filled with youthful revolt from ** the shop,” finds that the business world Is, after all, her sphere; the actress, with her surpassing ** genius to be loved,” does the natural thing and marries her manager; the men of high
station and large affairs who have lost their heads and hearts no less than their footing, recover from the glamour and go on in the path appointed by inheritance—
, each is drawn by the call in the blood, though response may mean the adoption Of " the formula of the second best.’* Therifc is a sound as well as subtle philos-| ophy to be read between the lines of this unusual book.

^tical reader. One would thinkj for exam-pie, that divorce would have been the 'most delicate aa well as the .most direct ‘way of:.jeUeying^ a.-compromising situation, and one somewhat sympathizes with Ora Pinsent's point of view.

It is to be hoped that a novel of such human insight and of sucli fine* literary fibre will not be soon burled beneath th« great ruck of modern fiction/*
