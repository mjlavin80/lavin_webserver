A3 Capt. Macquoid admits, it is rather out of the ordinary run for an "in. dian cavalry tjfficer to write on
strategy. Yet there Is no reason why he should not do so. ’Tho Indian army Has produced about as many good men as the imperial army—many of the recent British Generals of repute were originally on the Indian^ establishment—and its officers are certainly the working officers in India, even though not the ranking offices ^here, They have a right to study and discuss strategy therefore, even if the regular officers, meaning those attached to white troops, are Inclined to look down on them. Capt. Macqu old’s book therefore has a right to exist, and deserves more than mere existence. It Is, on the whole, a good piece of work. ‘ The principles of tactics change with every change in armament, but as the geographical features of the earth do not changc, the principles of strategy remain the same, even though modified in greater or less degree by changes in the material -resources of countries, the development of steam, of electricity. Capt. Macquoid* considering this as a fact, discusses the strategy of British Generals, thinkffig that it will be as valuable as that of foreign leaders, which as yet has been the only strategy studied_by British officers. " British Generali leading troops of the British Empire,” he says, *’ have (ought in nearly every country of the five continents, and a glance at any atlas is a proof that the results of these campaigns have, been in the main successful.” A good point properly made. But he continues; " What foreign General who is now living or has ever lived can instruct tho British officer bettor than the leader of his own nation In the proper strategy of mountain warfare; in the best methods of forcing a passage through virgin forests; in the best way of leading a river column; in all that relates to desert marches and operations generally in deserts; in all that concerns the defense I of outlying posts and the relief of beleaguered garrisons; In the whole strategy connected with the sieges—both in attack and defense—of fortresses and fortified , towns? ”
'* Oh, well, we don’t know," as the expression is. " What foreign General *** * has ever lived ? '* We think Washington ^gavcr Gen. Braddock instruction about passing through virgin forests which that General rejected, -'somewhat to his own discomfiture, and that Napoleon’s strategy, not Wellington's. Is studied chiefly by indifferent connoisseurs of the art of war. “ Hard pounding, gentlemen, hard pounding," was the Duke’s explanation of his victory at Waterloo; not much talk of strategy there, but a good deal ^>f truth. Yet it is a pood thing to study the history of one's own country, and that is what Cat>t. Macquoid does
in his book- His diagrams are clear, and the dozen maps of the peninsular campaigns. really Wellington’s best, are excellent and contribute largely to make his book of value. The volume, by the way, is another instance ot the awakening of the British officer to the tact that soldiering isn't all beer and skittles. Lord Roberts's " introduction" is a friendly letter, nothing more; it Is of merely strategic value to the book—it may attract purchasers.
