[■AS *T A TESMANOF HAITI.
During the nineteenth century, the example of Haiti was the one crushing response met by any one who had the audacity to suggest -that the negro race was not congenitally doomed to Inferiority* humiliation, contempt, and oppression. Previous
to our civil war it was the pet theory
i ■ 1
of the apologists of slavery—the' apologists of that wretched institution were far more extreme and unscrupulous than the men who really administered the industry of the South—that in the I

turmoil and disorder of Haiti and San Domingo the true tendencies of the ! black race were demonstrated. And I in1 the later period, when the South, not without Justification, undertook a practical rebellion. In more peaceful i form, against the ** reconstruction ’* i regime, it was still urged that negro suffrage must reduce that section tb I

the dreaded condition of the negro island-in the Caribbean. For the most part our people have known very lit-tie about this island, and the little ! they have known has been that sort ■ of half truth which is the most deceptive form of ignorance. Hence, the appearance of a -Haitian writer worthy of attention and respect will naturally 1 be received among us with some astonishment
Such a writer, nevertheless, is Mr. A. Firmin, who has just published, in French, a volume entitled, “M. Roosevelt, President du Etats Unis et la Republique d'Haiti.” The author has held important places in the Government of his country—the Ministry of Finance, that of Foreign Affairs, Min-lst’&r to France—and is an Officer of ! the Legion of Honor. His portrait, the frontispiece of his work, presents him 1 as a full-blooded negro, with white hair and beard, with the marked char- ;
acteristic features of bis race, with a 1 finely formed head, and an expression ! at once of dignity and kindliness. We have not here to deal with the purpose or the political bearing of Mr. Firmin's book. Suffice it to say that it is a rather elaborate argument to show that Haiti has nothing to fear from the policy of the United States as it has slowly developed in former:

It does not follow.. that- the philosophy or the political economy or the history of—this well-equipped pamphleteer is sounder because; being a, negro and pleading' the cause of his

tijes we recognize in -Booker - Wash*., ington and which Frederick, Douglass., manifested. But these men had, or have, the blood of the writer in their veins. They had their schooling among 'whites, and their struggles, bitter enough, were largely with whites, and were an added schooling. Mr. Firmln is, in fact, as by avowal, the representative of his race, as passionately attached to its cause as Washington or Douglass. He is more nearly completely the typical negro of his class— an exceptional class, doubtless, but one that must continually exist. It is for this reason that his task^ extremely interesting and informing in Itself, invites attention in these columns. As an example of a unique literary output it will repay study.
