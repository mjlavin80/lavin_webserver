THERE is matter of more than local Interest In the second volume of the Proceedings of the Connecticut Valley Historical Society. That book covers a period of more than twenty years of the society’s existence and contains half a dozen papers on subjects that interest even those who do not hail from the Connecticut Valley. The first paper on the " Rev. Robert. Breck Controversy/* a church quarrel over the fitness of a younfjT minister to be installed pastor of the First Church In Springfield, has elements interesting even to-day. It occurred in 1734, when Mr. Breck was twenty-on© years old, and concerned his orthodoxy*
One of the four charges against Mr. Breck of more than personal importance | was ** that he had denied that the passage ■ ! In I. John, v., 7, concerning the ‘ three that ! bear record in heaven,' and also the pas- ; ! sage in John viii., concerning the woman taken In adultery, were of divine insplra- | 1 tion.** The chief Interest In the accusation lies In the fact that the Revised Version ! of the New Testament* made by stanch Trinitarians, omits the verse first in Question, and calls attention to the doubtful authenticity of the second reference! Richard Porson in 1789 pointed out the spurious character of the Trinitarian keystone; but more than fifty years earlier a youngster of twenty-one, in a distant town of Colonial Massachusetts, was accused of doubting its truth! Breck recanted, tt is true, but he seems to have said his say before he settled back into orthodoxy.	w
