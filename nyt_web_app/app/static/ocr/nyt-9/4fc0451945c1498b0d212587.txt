Tfetc York Times Saturday Review of Books:
Seeing the letter from " Chelsea Square *’ in your issue of Aug. 19 in reply to one from Mr. Arthur Thomas Dyson, I sincerely hope that “ Chelsea Square has read the article by Pendennis In The Sunday Times of Aug1. 20. If not, he will "benefit by reading it.
“ Chelsea Square '* raises a plea of sentiment against moving Poe's cottage, but the facts of the case are:
First—The cottage already has been moved, so is not in its original place.
Second—The grounds have been changed, filled in, and graded; also a street has been cut through, Briggs Avenue.
Taking these facts into consideration, I think it would be best to take advantage of the park and have the same finished, to make a fitting frame for the cottage.
I also beg to differ from “ Chelsea Square,” for E. A. Poe did move to Ford-ham and occupy the cottage in the Fall ot 1K44, and not in the Spring of 1840; though I will say I agree in reference to that " bird,” the raven.
" Chelsea Square ” further revives the controversy which, X think, may have defeated the realization of the acquiring of the cottage in 180G, when the bill for th« park was signed by Gov. Morton and come before Mayor Strong.
Now, I tbink this is the time that all lovers of Poe should unite on some definite line of action and push the same to an issue; in other words, let's bury the hatchet.	CHARLES	DYKEMAN.
