has nothing to do with the flowor; Benedicta and Venetla come from Beatrice; Ethel gives us Ada, Alice. Adelaide, Audrey, Ida, while Agnes provides Nessa, Nesta, Inez; Gladys is Claudia. These may all be true; contrariwise, some of them may not be.
Helena Swan has evidently spent ; much time and labor on her book, the ! subject of which is attractive enough; but she has as evidently brought more enthusiasm than judgment to her task. The book is pleasing in form, but typographical errors are numerous; Aurora Baby is declared to be one of Byron's characters.

H ELENA SWAN (Miss or Mrs., as the case may bo) has compiled a book of considerable interest, though of no great importance. £>he has undertaken to give the origin of the baptismal names of women common in English-speaking countries, and to each name to add references as to its associations and history. As a whole she I has succeeded, though most of the book is padding, a large part of It dealing with the masculine forms of the names bestowed on women. The author, too, has no sense of humor, and as a loyal Briton has an intense regard for the difference between the home life of Cleopatra and that of 4‘ our own dear Queen," and for the “ young persons ” of the British family. In her'collection of facts about-the name Florence, for example, she starts with the worship of Flora, introduced into Rome by Titus Tatius, a Sabine King, and apropos of the five-day festival in her honor re-' marks: ** Ip is to be feared that at this festival the merriment was boisterous enough to overstep the bounds of modest y."'

The author's method ot treating a name is to give what she declares are its derivatives, then its derivation in the form of a statement; then to tell of the distinguished women who have borne it, in the cases of saints and sovereigns at considerable length, and to give the titles of books wherein the name appears. She quotes from poets and writers at some length: and if no woman bore the name, she brings out a man who did. Her loyalty is shown in -the case of the name Alexandra, that of the present Queen of Great Britain and Ireland. Under this we are informed that various Scottish forms of Alexander are Hallack, Adair, and Scander-berg! Then we have part of a sonnet by Rossetti (the author spells the name j wrongly) on Alexander II., and Tennyson’s ode on the Grand Duchess Marie of Russia, who married the Duke of Edinburgh; then we get back to older history, and learn that the Greeks used Alexandra and Cassandra interchangeably—and, of course, learn about Priam’s daughter; after this we have tw<^and a half pages about masculine . saints named Alexander or Alexius; then Tennyson’s poem on the marriage of the Princess of Wales, the present Queen; and-most of Whittier’s poem cn Cassandra Southwick. That is a fair sample of the author's treatment of names. It mu$t be said to be ftieluslve and somewhat exhausting, even though
not exhaustive. _______
Some curious statements are made by Helena Swan.' For instance, Jessie is^ a derivative of Jane, and so is Jessica; Ltlton, Celia, and Rosalie are the same; Minnie Is not merely a gratuitous diminutive of Mary, but is a name by itself; Rosamond is older than foose, and
