THE whole world of American letters has been grieved to hear of the affliction which has befallen Mrs. Spencer Trask. A few weeks ago, as already briefly announced in the newspapers, she suffered a hemorrhage in one of her eyes, the result of a heart affection with which she has long been troubled, and which may lead to total blindness. There has been, as yet, no improvement in her condition, and she lies in a darkened room at Taddo, her country home near Saratoga.
Mrs. Trask had been ailing more than usual sincc the beginning of the Summer, and went with Mr. Trask to Watch Hill lately for a needed change of air. It was there that the hemorrhage occurred, the cause being the heavy strain on the artery of the eye resulting from the irregular action of the heart. She immediately returned to Saratoga, and has since been under constant medical attendance. She has been obliged to cancel all social engagements and all literary engagements as well. The physicians hope that, with careful treatment and perfect rest, the blood clot
i in the eye may be absorbed and sight restored.
j Katrina Trask is well known as the author of that admirable novel, “ Free, Not Bound,'* as well as “ Under King Constantine,” ** Sonnets and Lyrics," " White Satin and Homespun,” " Lessons in Love/’ and many contributions in prose and verse to the magazines. Besides their Summer home at Saratoga, Mr. and Mrs. Trask have a beautiful house at Tuxedo, in which they spend the Winter and early Spring months.
