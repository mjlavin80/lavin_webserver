R. ANDREW LANG la, obviously, much more
interested in Dickens’s unfinished posthumous
, work, “ The Mystery of Edwin Drood,*’ than he pretends to be. He has already contributed three ! piquant articles to the little controversy stirred up by the publication of Mr. J. Cuming Walters’3 *‘ Clue ’* to the “ mystery ”—Mr, Walters assuming that the mysterious Datch^ry (tvatching Jasper after Edwin's disappearance) is Helena Landless, Neville's sister. The third of Mr. Lang's articles ts in this ■week’s Independent. He still intimates that he thinks the story unworthy of Dickens, and the “ mystery ” not worth so much fuss. But most of the fuss is Mr. Langr's very own. Aiso the mystery of “ The Mystery of Edwin Drood" will remain a mystery till the end of time
