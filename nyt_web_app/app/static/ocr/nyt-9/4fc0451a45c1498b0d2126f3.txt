IF It were not for the stenographer, how . much of punctuation would there he | , to-day? It Is she who makes the f average letter intelligible; without her It L would be merely a mass of words. „ As the average woman does not employ a stenographer, so her letters are, almost undecipherable, quite apart from her.hand-wri tins. To seek and to find the lost art ■ ot punctuation, then, and to Install It again In power, Mr. T. F. Husband and Mr. M. F. A. Husband have prepared a very complete little book, which explains clearly why punctuation is needed and how it should be used. It is an interesting little book, and lures its reader along until, almost without knowing that he is studying a lesson, he finds himself possessed of knowledge he had lacked there- , tofore.	j
Taking the subject up historically, the authors give us a sentence from De 1 Qulncey, printed wholly in capitals, and without punctuation: ITISVERYDIFFI-CULT TOREAD. That Is the way theearli-i est writing was put together. The oldest i Phoenician inscription known, dating ! from about 1000 B. C., has no g©p_ aration of words or punctuation of any kind; the Moabite stone, however, about a century later, shows words separated , by dots, and sentences by vertical strokes. Early Greek inscriptions of. the sixth century B. C. show words separated by two dots and clauses by three; the Romans used single dots. But word separation In manuscripts is later than In Inscriptions, the authors suggesting " that while inscriptions existed mainly in and for the public eye> the reading of manuscripts was common oply among leisured and learned scholars." A paragraph mark came into use about the fourth century
B.	C. The comma, the inverted semicolon and the question mark appeared about the ninth century A. D. The authors say that punctuation marks came into use in English because “ learning and education were centred in the monastic schools, and closely connected with the religious life: it was meet that in the transcription of sacred works steps Should be taken to insure a correct rendering when they were read aloud." That is, the marks were more musical than grammatical. A comparison by the authors of several grammars of dates from 1617 to 1850 Show that in 1617 there were “ pauses," periods, commas, and semi-colons; a little, later the colon appeared, "two punctes, one under the other."	’
The second part of the book teaches the reader the proper use of the marks whose origin he has learned. The ex^ amples of the good and bad use of these points are modern, and entirely pertinent Some better cases could be found in this country than those the authors found In England: for example, the comma which cuts off the Bostonian’s whiskey at eleven o’clock; and the famous notice given out by a minister that "A man going to sea his wife, desires the prayers of the congregation.” But the examples offered are
good enough as they are* The book seems j us both widely useful and entertaining.
