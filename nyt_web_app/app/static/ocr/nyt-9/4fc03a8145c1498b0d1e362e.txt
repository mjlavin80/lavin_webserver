T has been the fortune of the writer to peruse within the past year, for purposes that may be nameless, if not the entire metrical production of the United States and Great Britain* at least no inconsiderable portion of the same. I have, to speak sadly
and precisely, read within that time between two and three thousand manuscript poems, and A Kindly Critic's more than two Glance	hundred volumes

* • • To the aesthetically pure lover of poetry for poetry’s sake, • * • there is but one sole spring of significance in verse;—beauty—beauty of thought, of phrase, of nfelodious cadence, and the bright beauty of perfect outline. Such a one is upon tlft side of the angels; yet his point of view commands but a segment of a large and crowded circle of poetic phenomena. • • * If we conceive Of the poetry that has been written in English in the last twelve months as a kind of Purgatory, a mountainous cone like Dante's, with a spiral pathway leading to its summit, we shall find among the one hundred and seventy-odd volumes on its lower rounds no ponderable significance; but midway in the ascent we come to a score or more of poets with something to say for themselves.
*The clever poetic thaumaturgy of Josephine* Dodge Daskam (now Mrs. Bacon) and Frederic Lawrence Knowles, the ripe and scholarly work of Dr. William C. Huntington and the late Dr. John W. Chadwick, the eerie crooning of the marvelous ten-year-olds, Julia Cooley and Enid Welsford; the polished, high-spirited wit of Harry Graham and Owen Seaman; the suave, melodious classicism of Lloyd Mifflin and Bliss Carman, the thoughtful versifying of Florence Earle Coates and Gamaliel Bradford. Jr., the ambitious, if superheated, tragic writings of George Cabot Lodge and Percy Mack-aye—all these are significant, if only as showing the number and variety of the poets who are writing effective verse. Nor would any account of recent poetry be complete which failed to make mention of the latest work of Mr. Riley, still overflowing with the old laughter and tears; of the richly picturesque poems of John Payne, the “ loud symphonious lays ” of C. E. Russell, the quaint, intellectual tenderness of “A.	E.”; the
crabbed, impressive pieces of Edith
Thomas, and the pleasing' pin pricks of
Robert Loi'oman's tiny poems. The year has seen, besides, two posthumous vol- i umes by young poets of a promise now pathetically frustrate, Guy Wetmore Car- i ryl and Edith Banfield. * * • As the inquiring student of contemporary poetry turns from the best English to the best American verse, ho is doomed to something of a disappointment. The robust American note which has been the dream of our literary prophets—and of which the tuning flourish has been sounded in the poetry of Lowell, of Whitman, and of some lesser men—is rarely heard now
save in poe try so crude as to be a provocation rather than a pleasure, The best and most significant American poetry of the past year partakes of that dcilcate retrospective refinement which since the days of Irving and Longfellow has been one of the prime marks of our literature. —Ferris Greenslct in The Atlantic Monthly.

The year opened with promises of books about
The Flood
Kelson Book..	the ehier raison
d'etre of which was of course the centenary. Nine Nelson books have been reserved for the Autumn. Mr.
Arnold White and Mr. E. Hallam have collaborated to produce *' Nelson and the Twentieth Century," which will be Issued by Messrs. Casseh We are told that the authors have enlisted the aid of four Admirals—each the highest authority on his special subject—the Chairman of th.e Navy League, and many naval officers. The author of the preface, whose identity is not given away, writes from a place where “ one can see nothing else but only the figure of Nelson on his column in Trafalgar Square, towering over the trees in St. James's Park."
The volume is, in part, an attempt to bridge the century that separates Nelson’s last command from that of Admiral Lord Cn^rles Beresford by applying Nelson’s spirit to some of the naval problems of to-^ay.
It is hoped that the sections on gunnery, tactics, naval discipline, and administration, dockyards, nnd so forth will appeal to all naval men. But the authors have avoided technicalities, and all such questions a discussed with constant reference to the practice and teachings of Nelson.
Lady Hamilton, of course, comes In for much discussion along with Nelson. Mr.
Walter SIchel has made a thorough reln-vestigatlon of the life drama of Emma, Lady Hamilton. Her early history will be retold from new and authentic material; the service which she claimed to have rendered to the British fleet in June. ITUS, will beJpresented in a light much more favorable than ever before; and the precise character of her influence upon Nelson reconsidered in the light of newly discovered letters and manuscripts of importance.
The " Life.'* which will be issued by Messrs. Constable early in October, will be illustrated from a hitherto unknown oil sketch by Romney, and by other portraits. all of which will be reproduced now for the first time. It has happened, too, not perhaps wholly by accident, that Nelson's great contemporary, Napoleon, has come In for a large share of discussion this year. Mr. A. M. Broadley has for some time been preparing *' Coilecta-nca Napoleonica M—" being a catalogue of the collection of autographs, historical documents, broadsides, caricatures, drawings, maps, music, portraits, military costumes and scenes, views, &c., relating to Napoleon iTand his times, 17G9-1S21." It has been compiled and is to be published by Mr. Walton V. Daniell—London Daily News.

The heather should be afire at the latest instance of a " printer's error" In the French press. M Robert Burns in | Other Tongues," Is a volume published some eight years ago, proving that Bums has found more or
less adequate translation into every European language. But there is still confusion as to his Christian name. For in Le Temps there is the usual literary article, with the well-known signature of Pierre Mllle at the foot, and two references to the poet Burns as “ John Burns**’—London Globe.

They Like Bad Literature, Too.
Even men of letters, it must be remembered, have moods in which they find more refreshment in literary rubbish than in the masterpieces. Macaulay declared that there was no such thing as a bad novel. Carlyle, when upset by the
loss of the manuscript of his ** French Revolution." retired into the country, and for a fortnight did nothing else but read the novels of Captain Marryat. Mr. Andrew Lang once wrote a ballade in praise of his favorite novelists. The authors whom he celebrated were not Balzac, or Flaubert, or Fielding, or Scott, or Dickens;, or Thackeray, They were Miss Brad-don and Gaboriau. How shall we expect the general reader to set hlmseir a higher
literary standard for the relaxation of Ills leisure hours?—London Academy.
The Umc of
Poetry
In
Conversn tlon.
One of those observant American
women who are now swarming in our streets and taking note of our ways recently pointed a curious difference between the American
and the Englishman. *' You seem to be quoting poetry all the time.*’ she said.
Then she proceeded to explain that the
average American man is never heard to
drop a line of poetry from his lips, while at an English dinner table where a dozen men and women of culture are gathered together the quotation ts flung to and fro, and everybody seems to know what everybody else is talking about. Publishers are fond of saying that there is no money in poetry; that no one reads it or cares twopence about it. This may be true enough in the sense that few people will buy a new poet and read him conscien' tiously from end to end. But the great p.oets filter and filter through many minds until at last they become part of the bone and fibre of common speech. All of us who are above the level of those who get their beer by the jug and their culture from the sporting tipster of halfpenny papers, talk poetry without knowing It, as M. Jourdain talked prose. Poetry and the Bible. It will make a pleasing exercise to pick those two strands from the texture of the next general conversation in which you take part.—London Globe.
\o Physical “ Poetic Type '• Kxists.
Temple Bar contains an amusing paper by Mr. Michael M:\cDonagh on ** The Poet’s Ringlets.” Mr. MacDonagh has been around the National Portrait Gallery and studied the famous heads of our bards. He draws the conclusion that there is no poetic type of face. You cannot even divide poets, as Mr. Grimwig divided boys, into “mealy faccd ” and ** beefy.’’ Poets are mostly thin; Byron had a terror of becomhig. fat—and Blron, a. poet in his way, declared himself “ too \
fat to be called a gobd student.’' Thompson was ** more fat than bard beseems,** Coleridge was *.* inclining to the corpulent/' Gay was very fat, and Dry den. grew tat; while neither Browning nor Landor was thin. The only outward sign of a poet Mr. MacDonagh holds to be his abundant hair. He stretches a point, we think, here and there, for those men, not poets, are few whose hair, if allowed to grow long, would not fall thick over the-shoulders, like Shakespeare’s or Goldsmith’s, though their heads might be as bald on top as Scott's or Rogers’s. There is only one poet in the gallery, says Mr. MacDonagh, who is palpably, unblush* ingly bald; and he, after all, i3 a very “ minor " poet, Capt. Charles Morris, who wrote " The Sweet Shady Side of Pall Mall." But Cowper was bald and wore a nightcap. 41 Draw the curtain close/* he sings (In the parody by Mr. Quiller-Couch):
“ While I resume the nightcap dear to all Familiar with my Illustrated Works”; and there are not a few others (not counting those like Butler, Waller, and Addison, who shirk the test by appearing only in wigs) for whom Mr. MacDonagh is driven back on the plea that they must once have had thick hair.—London Academy.
Books to Read in the Train.
Something to read in the train" almost always means something that the buyer at the bookstall would never think of reading under any other conditions. There are busy publishing firms which, clearly acting on some cynical Idea of human nature, rattle out early in August half a score and more of at-tractive-looking red-bound novels. Their quality Is such that, were the readers staying at home, they would return them at first slgh't to the library; but the cynical idea has some truth in It. The holiday public seems agreed to leave its intelligence behind In Its hat box. It wants " something to read in the train/' '* something to read on my holiday,” and It takes the trashiest it can find. Some people there may be who are compelled, In ordinary circumstances, to do most of their reading In the train—the underground train—in the cab, or on the omnibus; it is only the state of the London streets which prevents them from reading, like Macaulay, as they walk; and they look forward to their holidays, even to that part of them which Is spent in the train, as the opportunity to enjoy what they consider reading worth the name, to go through Shelley whole, or Molifire, or even Montaigne, every word of him. But they are exceptions. The publishers who shoot their rubbish in August show some commercial wisdom. They can afford to insult the Intelligence of their public, because their public asks to have its Intelligence insulted.—London Times.
Poor Quality of “ Art Paper ** in England.
There are said to be a great many fortunate people who find time nowadays to read books. And, to judge from the publishing output, one is inclined to believe the statement, for it certainly seems unlikely that, if books were not wanted, so enormous a number would be produced. The constant demand for novels, of
course. Is a matter that presents no very deep problem. But who, one may well wonder, are the people who yearn, every three months or so, to read a fresh work devoted to the life of Mary Queen Of SC0t3, Or Oliver Cromwell, or Charles Lamb? Perhaps the mystery is not so Impenetrable, after all. Of serious-minded bibliophiles the supply may be comparatively limited. But libraries increase and
multiply, and libraries must have books— books for the erudite as well as for the frivolous. There Is no dearth of either
class of literature. But librarians, it would seem, like most other people, have a grievance. Last week they held a conference at Cambridge. It lasted some days, and among the many subjects that came under discussion was the question of the paper used in the printing of books, and more especially that variety known as art paper. Complaints were numerous as to the inferiority of this paper, and not the least outspoken of the critics was Dr. Jenkirtson of the Cambridge University Library, who was the President of the conference, and who declared that ** good bindings were thrown away on bad books.” There ought, he added, to be “ some limit to the Inferiority of paper used for books.”
Similar views were expressed by other speakers, and since then the strictures have been Indorsed by Mr. Stndall, the well-known wood-pulp and paper trade export, who has recently been intrusted by the Indian Government with the task of investigating the possibilities of utilizing the various fibres to be found in India for the manufacture of paper. This authority explained that the inferiority of art paper was due to the mixture of minerals and glue, with which It is overloaded. The difficulty, it appears, arises mainly from the fact that mechanical means have to be employed for obtaining a smooth surface to the paper. A new treatment has been discovered in the use of a kind of starch preparation, differing very much in result irom the blend of glue and china clay, but, according to expert opinion, it is too early as yet to express a final verdict as to the value of this process. It may be explained that art paper, as it is called, is used chiefly for. books and periodicals of which half-tone illustrations are a feature.—London Standard.	.	.
