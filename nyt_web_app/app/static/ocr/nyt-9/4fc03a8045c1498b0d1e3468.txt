Countless grown-up boys and girls, as well as the children. of to-day, are mourning the death of one whose unfailing1 tenderness, mirth, and fancy were ever devoted to their happiness, arid made her dear^to one and all* For more than thirty" years Mrs. Mary Mapes Dodge has held her unrivaled place in the field of literature and in the hearts of her young people.* She has been our fairy godmother, to whose gifts we eagerly looked forward month by month, knowing that St. Nicholas was ours, no matter how many books the elders might possess, and feeling also that its editor was the one who best knew what we most liked. And what boy or girl has not read and reread ' Hans Brinker,” the favorite, I think, of all her charming tales? It seems to me that now, while her loss is very poignant in our hearts, it is a fitting time to suggest that the children of two generations show their appreciation of this beloved friend by a lasting tribute to her memory. Possibly the sons and daughters of some of her literary companions will undertake to organize a committee to obtain subscriptions for such a memorial, and to decide what form it shall take.- Learning that it is against Uie usage of The New York. Times Saturday Review to take charge of funds, I will only mention that I, for one, shall deem it a privilege to send my modest offering as soon as any committee to receive subscriptions can be arranged. Of course such a memorial ,will derive its chief beauty as representing the little contributions of the multitude of Mary Mapes Dodge’s readers, old and young.
