j jVnp York Timrn Saturday Review of Books:
RN The New York Times Saturday Review of Books last Saturday, (Sept. 1G,) Mr. Thomas A. Jappe quotes from Eckermann’s ” Conversations with Goethe" his curious and prophetic reference lo the project for a canal across the Isthmus at Panama, It is a curious coincidence that al-out two months ago I was struck with the same passage in rereading the ”Bohn'* translation of Eckermann’s book, and copied ft for my friend. Miss Gilder of The Critic, and she has printed it in the
Sipiember number of that magazine, (p,
21u.) Of course it was printed there at
1 U:ist three weeks before Mr. Jappe wrote
to you, (Sept. 14,) but it is evident that
he had not seen it, as he makes his own
translation from the German. My note
was sent to Miss Gilder in July, but did
not reach her in time for the August Critic.
While I am writing, let me say that I wa:; much amused by the discussion in youi* columns this past Summer concerning the use of the article " an " before words beginning with " h." Most, if not ail, of the writers appear to have assumed that the original form of tlie article was “ a," and that " an M is a later euphonic form. A lady who signed herself " Scho-lastica,” (New York Times Book Review Aug. 5,) says, for instance:	" The ‘ n *
Is added to the indefinite article for the express purpose of being pronounced.” The ordinary school grammars, with tho exception of a very few recent ones, make the same mistake. They refer to the article as “ a or an,** instead of "an or a.*’ Comparatively few teachers in the common schools Know that the article was originally ** an,” being etymologically Identical with ** one," and that the form ‘ a ’* did not come into use until the thirteenth century. It does not occur to them that there would be no more renson for adding “ n ” to the indefinite article before words beginning with a vowel than for making the same addition to- the definite article “ the.”
After " a " came into use, " an " continued to be generally used before the sounds of *- h ’* and initial long “ u ” and “ eu." ever in accented syllables, and (as the
best dictionaries and grammars state) it is still retained by some writers before tin se sounds in words not accented on the first syllable; that is, they use it before “ history," “ universe/’ &c., as well as before “ historical,” ** u#niven*al,” &c. Before the latter class of words it is still quite common, before the former quite r:;re. It is evident that the aspirate is less distinctly pronounced In the latter than in the former class of words.
in Shakespeare we find ** an hair," ” an Ht-brew,” "an hospital.” an hundred/’
’* an hypocrite,” M an eunuch,” ” an union,” "an usurer/' &c.; but “a hundred.” “a union,” &c., occasionally appear in the early quartos and folios.
** Such an one ” occurs twice in the first fclio, and " an wish ** is found in ** Pericles,” (iv. 4. 2,) which was first IncTuded in the third folio.
“ An ’* before “ h *’ is more common in England than here. In a London article in the September Critic, I notice “ an hotel ” several times, but the same writer has " a hundred,” apparently because the first syllable is accented.
The discussion about 41 nothing doing ” showed an ignorance of the-distinction between the participle and the “ verbal ” or “ gerund ” or “ infinitive in ing,” as It is variously called. ** Nothing doing *' Is a contraction or corruption of " nothing a-doing” or " nothing In_doing/’ It is like •* the house is building/* which has often been similarly discussed. Most of the grammars put “doing,” "building,*’ &c., when thus used under the head of “ participial -nouns that fs, participles used as nouns—as “ The loving are the daring," &c. In such cases the participle has Its usual sense of the agent or actor,
“ loving ” being equivalent to 41 lovers ” or those who love.” But the verbal or gerund is not a participle, but a different form of the verb, originally having a different ending, as it still has fn German, ajidjt never means the agent, but always Gio M action,” as in H the nature of loving.” "deeds ot daring/* &c. The two forms (ire to be distinguished not only In words used-singly, but also in compounds. Compare, for instance, a ** workingman ” (a man who works) and a M working day,"
(a iaay for wonting,) Cowper-s M church-going bell" (whlcf; Wordsworth was wrong In ridiculing) and “ a church-going ‘belle/' of "church-going people/’-" A schoolboy can readily distinguish the two by the sense, as in “ the dining room *' and “ the dining company,'* &c.
In early English the ending of the participle Tvas “ ond(e)” or “ end (e)/’ while that of the “verbaFor gerund was “ ing ” or -** ung/* ^Tn the" fourteenth 'century/ "tag ’^ .hE^ .feesa well . established as £ho endlng^ forV {ho participle, ^r.but fthe two endings were sometimes discriminated, as by Barbour (1357:)

when the verb ^precedes the subject, as in “ There's pansies,” ” There Is no more such musters,” *' Ts there not wars? ” &c.; also with two singular nouns as subject, as ” Despair and hope makes thee ridiculous/’ ” Hanging and wiving goes by destiny,” &c. In ** Time and the hour runs through the roughest day,” quoted by Mr. Stone, the two subjects are virtually one, and in such cases a singular verb is not unfiequently found in recent writers. In seme instances the singular verb is apparently used for the sake of rhyme, as in *' Venus and Adonis,” l.liiJS:
She lifts the coffer lids that close his eyes, "Where, lo! two lamps burnt out in darkness lies.
Some authorities regard certain of these singulars as " the old third person plural in s ” in early Northern English. —
