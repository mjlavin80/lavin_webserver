OCCUPATIONS IN LIFE.. A Fund of Practical Information and Business Advice for Boys and Young M«n. By Prank Mars land. New York: Chas, E. Fitchett.
TO assist young men to choose wisely and promptly the trade or profession which is to furnish them a livelihood is the purpose of the author of these pages. His method is to tell in general what the nature of a great number of occupations is, and to indicate in each case what seems to him the quickest practical method of getting an effective knowledge of them. Beginning with the trades, he passes to architecture, engineering, (of all kinds,) naval construction, navigation, and the various agricultural employments. He tells you something about advertising as a business— its aims and methods—about mercantile agencies, about the field of invention and the manner of getting patents, about office employment. He considers, also, the advantages and disadvantages of the law as a profession, points out the conditions for beginners there and in medicine, teaching—the ministry even—though, In the last case, h$ declines to make the proposition purely economic. To be sure he does advise the preacher to have some really economic employment as a second string to his bow. Dentistry, pharmacy, journalism, optics, telegraphy, undertaking, and Young Men's Christian Association work are ^othcr employments to which attention is called, and the author ventures some advice—sarticulpxly in the article of mastering English grammar— to intending authors. Generally he advises in the case of trades the school in preference to apprenticeship, and he indicates a confidence in the practical utility Of the M correspondence school,*’ which is certainly not shared by everybody.
A useful article gives a number of facts about the Government civil service and the openings it offers—the facts being the very ones which the inquiring young man would like to know.
