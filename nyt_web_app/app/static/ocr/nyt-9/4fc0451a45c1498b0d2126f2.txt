Jfctt) York Time# Saturday Review of Book#: Why is It that many gifted writers slip up so woefully on minor details of their |. stories? The case in view Is Julia Ma-ffruder^s “ The Thousandth Woman,” pub-
Yltehed in Llpplncott’s tor January, 190?,
. which I just have read. At tbe beg-inning1 . she says of her heroine: “When she was 25 * she' married a man ten years her senior. * * ♦ M A little further along she speaks of her husband as being 41. Two or three pages later she says of the
-	wife, “ She was now 36,” although the action of the story had occupied but ten days since the husband, was ten years her senior and waa 41, Later she speaks of the husband as now almost 40. This Is tho most glaring instance I have seen for some time, although : in Another story read recently the heroine’s father Is called Sir James and Sir Andrew impartially, so as to greatly confuse the reader. Many other instances could be quoted wiiich, while not material, detract very much from the smoothness of a story.
