ITALIAN BACKGROUNDS AND VIE,WS;
M s. Wharton’s ILpics of th- Incognita—Thayer’s Venicc —Improvement of Lucrezia Borgia’s Reputation.*
EIROBABLY more than any other country, Italy is nowadays subjected to that process of mental 'tilling, that refinement of critical observation and expression <5f all Uiat in her pertains to letters and ths plastic arts, which, according to its own new and strange terminology, is called “ culture.” And the persons who do the tilling and the observing and the expressing usually apply Xbeir superior talents to unfrequented and remote places and to objects which have hitherto eluded the toils of the academic investigator. Arthur Symons, Maurice Hewlett, Edward Hutton—to mention the most conspicuous-among them—have sufficient that is common in belief, erudition, point of view, and gtyle to give their thoughts and activities the dignity of a cult. They vie with each other in bringing to the surface bits of unsuspected and intimate information;
in discerning secret and hitherto hidden meanings in literary'and artistic monuments; in promoting the economy of the reader’s attention and reaching for the superfluities of verbal condensation. And they sneer at the tourist and the guidebook,	J
So far this cult has sadly needed a lit- i urgy and a priestess to formulate it* It has now gained both through its latest convert.
It was inevitable. The elusive yet none the less significant signs at the threshold of “ Italian Backgrounds " marked Mrs. Wharton as a convert to the cult of Symons, Hewlett & Co., while the exceptional character of her literary gifts and the strong personality which manipulates them warned y>e reader to be on the outlook for a revelation. This revelation is to he found in the last chapter and reads as follows:
The foreground is the property of the guidebook and of its product, tbe mechanical sightseer; the background that of the dawdler, the dreamer, and serious student of Italy.
Many byways are trodden, many mysterious places and objects uncovered, many images and traditions smashed before the revelation may be perused and enjoyed. And the approach thereto presents many and varied obstacles for tne uninitiated. Ruskhi must be accepted as an untrustworthy mystic, Italian Gothic as a myth, Correggio as shrunken *' to the limited immortality of the painter's painter," and ’* Bernini as the genius of the baroque movement." If these and things like them do not abash the reader from a further penetration of this Italia incognita, he may be assured of a certain amount of aesthetic glee in reading af>out it whether or not he is able to appreciate the extent of Italian indebtedness therein proclaimed. v.
Take for example the opening passage, and then try to find its equivalent In economy of words, and, at the same time, in prodigality of expression and suggestion:
To the mind curious in contrasts— surely one ot the chief pleasures of travel —there can be no better preparation for a descent into Italy than a sujourn among the upper Swiss valleys. To pass from the region of the obviously picturesque— the country contrived, it would seem, for the delectation of the " coeur H po€sle facile "—to that sophisticated landscape where the face of nature seems molded by the passions and imaginings of man, is one,of the most suggestive transitions in the rapidly diminishing range of such experiences.
Much may be read into those words. Then follows more of the same excellent material descriptive of the hot. idle, dusty life at Spliigen, only to be endured because the diligence—or the motor car— which goes South takes one " into the land where the church steeples turn into campanili, where the vine, breaking from perpendicular bondage, flings a liberated embrace about the mulberries. *	•	*”
And the final sentence of the chapter is at length dropped with fine dramatic forethought: “ In that diligence our seats are taken."
The question. “ Was it better to be cool and look at a waterfall, or lo be hot and

“A vague allusion (in an Impertinent Cerman guidebook) to an interesting church among these mountains (supposedly the Adam ell o range) ** marks the approach, and—"the dilettante will always allow for the heightening of emotion that attends any unexpected artistic 'find'; but setting this subjective imprest on aside/ the Via Crucis of Cerveno remains in my memory as among the best 'examples of its kind—excepting always the remarkable terra cottas ot San Vivaldo in Tuscany," and material Is presented for a footnote in the next edition of “ Baedeker’s Norther^ Italy.*' Others are soon revealed—almost on every page—at Oropa, Varallo, and San Vivaldo, where all that has gone before pales into insignificance before one gorgeous “ find," the intrinsic If not the artistic value of which is confirmed by Prof. Rldolfl, -who no sooner had he seen the photographs'of the groups carelessly attributed to Giovanni Gon-nelli than he declares that they were " undoubtedly a century earlier in date.*1
Then come more backgrounds in gentle, undulating, panoramic display—Parma, which " at first sight lacks the engaging individuality of some of the Smaller Italian towns,” (has the author so soon forgotten its excellent Duomo with its sculptures by da Bisone and Bianchina, and its Correggio’s “ Assumption,” the baroque facade of San Giovanni Evangelista, and the tower by Magnani?) Caprarola, Vi-torfib, Montefiascone. and finally Picturesque Milan/' where “ it is hard to say whether the stock phrase of the stock tourist—' there is so little to see in Milan '—redounds most to the derision of the speaker or the glory of Italy." We have never heard the phrase applied to this ancient capital of Lombardy, but we cordially agree with the author: “ Thac such a judgment should be possible, even to the least instructed traveler, Implies a surfeit of impressions procurable in no other land **; but—but we look in vain for a renaissance of the languid beauty ot diction, the rhetorical emphasis of trivialities, the stealthy snaring of the elusive which illuminated the approach to the iconoclasm of San Vivaldo.

The illustrations which accompany M^s. i Wharton's book are from the delicate pen j of E. C. Peixotto. Like the text, they i press the " culture " of elusive expression very near to the vanishing point.

THE TRUTH ABOUT VENICE.
ONE must not expect to find anything new or startling in the brief history . of Venice which Cavaliere William Roscoe Thayer has presented in about 350 pages. The beginnings of that curious amphibious community, which owed its Incipient development, if not its origin, to the invason of Attila, and tfce anti-climax of its decline and fall, as a political commodity of both France and Austria, are clearly and intelligently outlined, with | proper emphasis laid upon those points and circumstances which aro regarded as ** important “ by students of international politics. The Cavaliere has evidently read the ten volumes of Homan in's “ Storia Documentata di Venezia” and probably AbbG Langier's. " Histoire de la RGpub-lique de Venise ” and has examined with respectful attention what such prejudiced old fellows as Bembo, Morislni, 'Giustini-ani, et al. had to say concerning the internal life and development of the miniature empire in the lagoons. To be sure, all these authors do not figure in the attached bibliography; it Is at least significant that Romanin, whose monumental work is marked as "indispensable," includes all that the candid, unbiased student may worthily extract from the others. W. C. Hazlitt’s “ Venetian Republic,” in two volumes, has also doubtlessly „been perused by the author, for Hazlitt has some Interesting essays on Venetian society and the under side of Venetian in-stitutlons, which, while written with a careful discernment of data, are not always well proportioned.
In these days of original research and monograph writing, we scarcely know in what category belongs 14 A Short History of Venice; ” it combines certain elements which pertain to all. In fact, no pronounced historical school may claim it, and It stands quite isolated as the independent expression of a student who has read much and who has found some good
In about everything that he has read. The moral attitude of our author is most reassuring, and there is a delightful yet broad Puritanical touch given his historical counterpoise as he describes tbe conflicts between the Oligarchy of Venice and the Hierarchy of Rome. This is particularly pronounced in the pages which ho devotes to Sarpi, the Savonarola .of Venice. When the-Jesuits were called In by the Curia, which tlie Servite friar bad so roundly beaten diplomatically,.and resorted to a violent method of removing the dominatable Sarpi, tho author -rnaWva
no use of the subterfuges resorted to by . certain other American and English historians of Venice to cast the. blame upon the Spanish Court. As the.-xjld friar lay presumably dying, he asked to see the dagger with which he had been stabbed. Fingering its point, he said grimly:	*' 1
recognize the Roman style.” But if the Cavaliere makes use of contemporaneous anecdotes, he does so only when these anecdotes correctly color incontrovertible facts. In this respect his book differs from Mr. McClellan’s “ Oligarchy of Venice," where a'calculating yearning for the monographic method quite distorts the actual relations between Venice and the Vatican.
As w.e have said, there is.nothing new or surprising in this " Short History of Venice.” Those who have read ftazlitt’s work and the numerous volumes that have followed It—Thomas Okey’s “The Story of Venice ” and Horatio Brown's excellent little handbook, "The Venetian Republic "—will find no data, no episodes, no names or dates with which they are not already familiar. What they will find, however, is an unequaled, cautious yet spirited narrative, perfect in its pro-J portion, admirable for its coherence, and | extremely rational and modem in its point of view. For those who have but brief, time to acquire the essentials in the history of that remarkable State, It will prove adequate and sufficient. Moreover. ! we are acquainted with no other writing ! in the English language which is a better , introduction to a prolonged, serious study ;
I of the subject. From the incongruity and the contradictions of contemporaneous i material, from the prejudice and hyper-I bole of commentators thereon, the Cav~ aliere' has extracted and reconstructed a sketch which is both worthy in result and easy to remember.
FERRARA RECONSTRUCTED.
THE Ferrara of the Middle Ages, like the Ferrara of to-day, is a paradox.
No Italian State of similar power and magnificence ever exerted such disproportionate influence upon mediaeval Italy;
, no city In United Italy In which are combined the fascinating treasures of the past . and modern political and industrial enterprise Is so ignored by the casual traveler, Once the strongest post on the frontier of the Papal States, the seat of the House of Este, the abiding place of Torquato Tasso and Ludovico Ariosto, and the final marital home of Lucrezia Borgia, the golden period of its sixteenth century magnificence has consistently subsided Into an isolation unheeded by contingent development, and its inhabitants have shrunken from over 100.0004o a bare 30,000. It lies only twenty-nine miles by rail from the ancient university city of Bologna, and about twice that distance from Venice, and yet few travelers stop there to see the relics of those poets patronized by the Estensi, the scene of Byron's “ Parlslna," or the paintings by Garofalo and Dosso Dossi in the churches of Santa Maria in Vado. San Domenico, and the admirable but ill-preserved picture gallery. If Siena is proud of its well* conserved medlaevalism, Ferrara is humiliated for the same reason, and constantly exerts itself against the fate which has designated it as " unimportant.”
The same specious writers who once attempted to blast the Eternal City on account of its legendary Summer unhealth-iulne.<?5- have been suffered to write unrebuked about the river plain where lies the maligned community of the Formresi. The rehabilitation of the place Is the inspiring note in Ella Noyes’s book, the text of which is entertainingly Illustrated, architrcturaJJy as well as graphically, by the nen of Dora of the same name. The historical point of view maintained is thoroughly modern, and in such episodes as the love of Tasso for Eieanora d'Este and the personal character of Lucrezia Borgia the author shows a fitting, rational contempt for contemporary history as written by prejudiced partisans. On
these point's she forms a fitting confirmative commentary on Julia Cartwright’s '* Beatrice d'Este ” and " Isabella d’Este" and “The Chronicles of the House of Borgia,” by F. Baron Corvo. The historical development of the State as well as its decline are carefully described, while the detailed accounts of the historical monuments that remain, it. buildings, streets, and unreclaimed fields, are presented with a care and patience worthy of respect. But the style is somewhat spiritless. Prodigality of material has evidently been allowed to smother the enthusiasm with which the task was undertaken. At least, the book I is a well-merited rebuke to Baedeker’s ! Northern Italy." At best. It will prove an authoritative guide for the student
tourist wlio.has much time to spend in Ferrara. "	^	~	'	' ’ • ' ’
PERUGIA IN NATIVE EYES.
WRlTERS,^on the cities of Umbria have from time immemorial betrayed a conscienceless indebtedness to the. writings of Francesco Mata?. razzo, and extracts from this prejudiced; scribe of the* fifteenth century have been1;-presented where either, artistic or historir;, cal, context seemed to demand them. 'Now/.i at last, we have the chronicles of the old* ’ bigoted yet ever-fascinating Perugianolv presented In a careful'English, translation by Edward Strachan Morgan. The quaiht-ness.of styleas well as the pseudo-frankness of the original is well maintained^ AVe regret, however, that the translator's ■ introduction does not characterise Mata-rasxo’s prejudice and partisanship as they deserve; for no other writer has done more to blacken the character of Lucrezia Borgia and to keep it blade, in spite of the efforts of modern historians. This being said, Mr. Morgan’s volume may be read with genuine interest and benefit. Mata-razzo wrote well and cunningly. His lies are sublime, and in the delineation of epl-£ode he has all the natural simplicity of . Boccaccio.
IMPRESSIONS OF UMBRIA*
THIS is a volume of purely *• impressions de voyage ” by an Intelligent, observing woman inspired by the history and landscape of Umbria, and, although in these pages Matarazzo, with bis kind. Intrudes, he does so inoffensively and in an atmospheric manner which would not be reproved by even St. Francis himself. The author has a distinct liking'for showing the life of the people by describing their physical characteristics and relating their conversation, and by throwing these things in contrast with the characteristics of the ancient race. The pictorial part of " Pictures in Umbria ” consists of pen sketches by Thomas R. Macquoid, which are intelligent, although not especially artistic representations of things seen. The book will form an entertaining companion for the fireside tourist, for it Is intimately written In unadorned, direct narrative style.
