HE popular English composer. Sir
Edward Elgar, has written the pre-
face to the volume on ** The Singing of the Future,” by David Ffranggon-Davies, which the John Lane Company is about to issue from The BodJey Head. Sir Edward writes:
" The soul which has seen most of truth wbaJi come to the birth as a philosopher, or artist, or some musical ana loving nature.” • * • But musicians have not always shown to the world, when their works have cordo to tbe birth, that they-have seen the most of truth. The art easily lends Itself to make passing amusement for the frivolous and the unthinking; in this there is nothing to deplore: we should rather rejoice in knowing that music ran be an amusement, for It in itself Is never ignoble. * * * With the march of time, and with it the Improvement of musical education, a new desire hM possessed us—the desire to understand. • • * This book Is a serious appeal to the singer, -especially to the Eng-fish-speaking singer, and I welcome it »t\a hope for much real and lasting good from its dissemination. • Written with complete knowledge by a. singer who is *T«n an artist. It forms a worthy portion, or it may be at this date fa commencement, of long-desired new edifice of Eng- ; llsh iwnnfa which, will' some day be raised i by those, and by those only, who have' seen ‘Uhe most of truth."
The first six chapters in the book are a consideration of the meaning of staging; they are followed by discussions of breathing in elnglng, tone, style, oratorio, and Opera.
