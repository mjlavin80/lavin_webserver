The two volumes of " Orlgines Island-icae: A Collection of the More Important Sagas and Other Native Writings Relating to the Settlement and Early History of Iceland." edited and translated toy the late Gudbrand VIgfusson and F. York Powell, are ready for issue by Henry Frowde at the Clarendon Press. The authors, who are now dead, aimed at supplying for the English reader all the important texts relating to the colonization and early history of Iceland. Tho work has been divided into four principal parts. In Part I. are those texts giving a view of the early settlers, their original homes and family connections in Norway or the Western Isles, the reasons and manner of their departure for Iceland, their place of settlement, and their most notable descendants. Part II- shows under what customs and laws the new settlement started and continued to exist. The third part contains the story of the disappearance in Iceland of the old religion, most of which is founded on Are s " Cristne Saga.” And in Part IV- are given -the stories of famous Icelanders of the tenth century, particularly such parts of them as appear to have real historic basis, or are valuable as giving an idea of early customs. The sources include, besides Are, the special history of the colonization of Iceland, “ Landnama-boc,” " Hrafnkels Saga,” “ Vatzdoela,’* ” Sturlunga Saga,” &c. The work closes with the early history of Greenland and the eastern coast of North America.
