And, really, I have a very convenient Opportunity while I am writing this Paragraph, of making my Remarks on such Part ieulars: for I am now in a Place where Horses go, in a great measure, barefoot, anti yet are seldom troubled witli Corns; no more than the Wild Irish, that never knew the ITse of a Shoe. I suppose I need not tell the Reader that my Habitation ;it present is in the Isle of Man; altlio' I can assure him, it is not of choice, and that so soon as the Wind and 'Water will permit mo,

Farriers* Wisdom,
JTcic York Times Saturday Rcvictc of Hooks:
In a quaint old volume, *’ Farriery Improved; Or, A Comploat Treatise Upon The Art of Farriery,” by Henry Braekin, ML D., “ Printed for H. Hodges at the Looking-Glass, over-against St. Magnus Church, London-Bridge, 174IJ "—the "long s’s " befng used In the printing thereof, is the following, from the preface:
“ Ther&Js one Thing had almost escaped me, which is this, viz. No Person should look upon a Horse he is about to purchase in any other Light than what Ovid (a&.I remember) advises us to view a woman we are in love with, and can't obtain; which is, to consider and scan over her Imperfections rather than her Beauties, and by such Means we shall be cured of our Amour: But it is generally the contrary, for we frequently, nay, too frequently, view the Perfections of both Creatures through a Multlplylng-glass, Instead of regarding them with a sound Eye, and In the Manner they deserve.”
A little further, in speaking of riding horses, he says: •* It Is in this as in all other scenes of Life, via, Men as well as Horses, are generally misapplied: So that many a parson as is observed by the Spectator, runs his Head against, a Pulpit when his Shoulders should have saved it the Trouble of thinking; and, accordingly,
I say, many a Horse is put to the Hoad or Hunting that is fit for nothing but a Collar.”	'
Here Is an " Ointment for the Cure of Rat-Tails.” “ Take a Quarter of a pound of Flanders Oil of Bays, a quarter of an 3unce of Oil of Turpentine, and six Drachms of Quicksilver; mix the Quicksilver and Oil of Turpentine well together, and then add the 011 of Bays, and stir all about, till you cannot, even with ’ spectacles, discover any of the Particles of Quicksilver." (Tills recipe is Jn italics.)
At tho conclusion of some remarks about dishonest farriers, the author says:
" But I might own that after Truth and the Reason of Things is discovered by us, we find ourselves a sort of unfit Mortals for common Society, because we are obliged to hear so much Nonsense In relation to every Scene of Life: And I can’t say but I often reflect upon a good old Copy I have several times writ over when a Boy, which, because there is a great* deal of Truth in, [ imagine it will be as' authentic In the succeeding as the Present Age. It Is this, viz.:	'
Fond World adieu, Como _	*'
Death and close my eyes,	•
More Geese than Swans now Live, more Fools than Wise. •
