MRS. GARDINER’S story of ‘^Ohe I Heart ot a Girl” is rather difficult j to place. As a study of the psycholo- 1 gy of childhood and youth, it appeals to adult readers, and yet the minute details of playground and schoolroom are likel^ to become 'wearisome to even the most sympathetic “ grown-ups.” On the other hand, the career of Miss Margaret CarUn is scarcely one to be commended to Imitative girlhood. Unlike the wholesome little gentlewoman of 14 the Katy books ” and Miss Alcott’s less refined but frank and home-loving maidens, Mrs. Gardiner’s heroine finds her life outside her own four walls. Home and- its people are scarcely a value in her world; she stands aloof from family interests, nor Is Bhe much moved by their financial straits save as affecting herself* When a very llttljf girl s^e was ambitious to learn free thinking from a man whom she had heard called the only freethinker ot the village—she supposing that a freethinker, like a free-blooming plant, was one who put forth in lavish abundance blossoms of thought. Utterly secretive toward her mother and . sister, she made the kindly Old freethinker her only confidant, and that, although at an early age she left her native Illinois for Dakota* and saw her friend no more. Quite extraordinary are the extracts from' some of Wo letters. Of the ocean—" God, and me to see Him. it lies in my memory/' Of the love of applause—" And even Christ, I doubt if He would have made His work had it not been for His disciples who loved to hear His stories,"
We are afraid Margaret—or Margie— ^was not a ° nice ” girl, certainly not according to the standards to which Mr. Hopkinson Smith is calling us back* She was morbid in her friendships; the boys ” had a place in her life other than was supposed by her innocent mother, there was an unlovely defiance tn her attitude toward her teachers and school companions which reminds us somewhat of the piteous bitterness of Zitkala S&'s story, a defiance extending to her pro* testa against God Himself; worst of all, she seems to have been devoid of that bedrock of character, truth. That class of lies known as white ” seems to have been to her only an intellectual means of meeting a difficulty. It would be interesting to count the “ fibs *’ in which she indulged—and, apparently, without the author’s censure. Nor do we find that the beauty of goodness made any appeal to her, either as an ideal for herself or as | an attraction in others.	j
Perhaps Mrs. Gardiner has truly revealed the heart of a modern girl, and perhaps her elders ought to know it, but it must be a tragic unveiling to unsuspecting parents who fancy they have I some acquaintance with their daughters. !
The book is well written, with much sympathy for the little joys and sorrows l that loom so large in childhood, and for , the intense loves, ambitions, disappointments, triumphs of the older schoolgirl.
, Margie is carried from Illinois to Dakota, from Dakota to Nebraska, the people and j conditions of the three localities clearly portrayed and differentiated, with a touch
1	at once firm and light. Certain noble qualities belong to the girl herself, despite/the traits so disfiguring to her , character. As we leave her still In the unripeness of girlhood, we may fancy | her growing sweeter-aind mellower under maturing Summer suns.
Still we cannot help hoping that in real life there are not very many of her; and we are inclined to advise adult readers to keep her story to themselves, as a lamp to the bewildered feet that seek to reach the " true Inwardness *’ of their undiscovered daughters, rather than to add Margaret Carlin to the intimates of those young persons themselves.
