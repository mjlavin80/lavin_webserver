HIS book is to be studied more by its pictures than by its text. The ajtliors, one an American who has studied and practiced jiu-jitsu in Japan and the
other a native of that country and once an instructor of the art in Doshisha College, Kioto, have prepared a series of 500 illustrations, showing with great clearness nearly every detail in that branch of physical culture known as jiu-jitsu.	1
The name attained considerable popularity in this city last Winter, but there was a general misconception as to its true meaning. To many, jlu-jitsu meant nothing more than Japanese wrestling, and sportsmen condemned it as far inferior to the wrestling methods of America and Europe.
It was, perhaps, unfortunate for jiu-jitsu that it was forced to make its bid for favor under the guise of wrestling.
In the land of Us birth, it is, as Higashi says, " the art of the gentleman.” It is physical culture in its highest form and is taught to old and young alike, not for the purpose of making wrestlers of them, but to give them strong and supple bodies, the ability to attack and present an effective defense at an instant’s notice, in addition to the information of resuscitating persons injured by physical blows or in cases ot drowning or sunstroke.
The life-saving possibilities of jiu-jitsu are little less than remarkable. This branch of the science is termed kuatsu, and it deals entirely with the restoration of a person who has been rendered unconscious or apparently killed. Mr. Hancock strongly advises every layman and physician to study these methods, boldly claiming that many lives now lost by accident might thereby be saved. He himself, so he tells us, has been knocked out over a dozen times, yet the life insurance companies are still writing policies for him. He is careful to warn beginners not to try experimental knock-out blows, for the efficacy of the restoration methods lies in the presence of skilled kuatsu practitioners, and they are evid intly scarce in this country.
The dangerous blows, however, maj well be dispensed with, and yet one can obtain all of the physical culture benefits of jiu-jitsu. The Kano system of jiu-jitsu, of which this volume treats, has been adopted as the official jiu-jitsu of the Japanese Government in the army and navy and the Police Department. Prof. Jiguro Kano is recognized as the individual representative of the most perfect development of jiu-jitsu. When his system was adopted by the Government it consisted of forty-seven tricks of combat and fifteen serious tricks. Improvements have been made, and to-day the complete system comprises 160 tricks, divided into three sections. The first contains sixty tricks of combat in direct sequence. These are preparatory for the more advanced tricks of the second section, in which the pupil is taught how to apply advantages gained by the simpler tricks. The third section deals with the most advanced tricks, by which an opponent may be maimed, killed, and then resuscitated. Fatal blows are never struck with the clinched fist, but generally with the second knuckle of the second finger, the point of the elbow, or the point ol the foot. The places where fatal or painful blows may be struck are depicted on four charts of the humau frame, and a number of Illustrations follow, showing the methods of resuscitation.
When jiu-jitsu is relegated to a mere wrestling competition and an exhibition of it given in connection with an exponent of the wrestling methods as practiced in this country, differences of opinion are almost sure to' prevail, and particularly so because as yet there has been no serious attempt to bring tho i two codes of combat into any condition of harmony. As is well known, the victory in wrestling goes to the contest-
ant who throws his opponent so that the shoulders of the latter touch the ground. The authors of the present volume term this a mere constructive victory, for in jiu-jitsu a man may be thrown in this manner and yet not necessarily be regarded as the poorer competitor. It may be allowed purposely, with a view of giving the fallen foe an opportunity of employing one of the more difficult tricks upon his apparently superior opponent. The Japanese rules imply that the defeated man must signify his surrender—in other words cry “ Enough," as in the ferocious sport of gouging which delighted many of our sporting ancestors half a century or more ago in this country.
Mr. Hancock deprecates the decisions in some of the exhibitions given last Winter, in which the Japanese contestant, being thrown, was at once declared the loser, although it is claimed that he permitted himself to be thrown in order to employ his own methods of the game.
That jiu-jitsu is being appreciated on its merits of improving the physical system, outside of its native land, may be seen from the fact that a Japanese instructor is now teaching the art to the naval cadets at Annapolis, and a number of smaller schools have been established in various parts of our country.
Tlie volume is the most helpful and comprehensive treatise on jiu-jitsu that has yet been published, and even if one does not become a student of its principles, the book will well repay perusal by those who are anxious to ob-j Lain an inteliigent understandirfg of , Japan’s national system of physical culture*
