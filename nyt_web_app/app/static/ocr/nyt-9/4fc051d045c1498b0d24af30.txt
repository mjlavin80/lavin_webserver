O	RECENT historical worlc has been more read
able, and we fancy none has had more readers, than Justin McCarthy's “ History of Our Own : Times," of which two additional volumes, to conclude the work* will be-among the new Fall books. The record will now be brought down to the accession of King Edward VII. Among Mr. McCarthy's new chapters will be a retrospective survey of the " Victorian Age,** touching literature, art, and science, i and personal sketches of the celebrated men and women of later years. The personal ** note " sounds , clearly in Mr. McCarthy's informal history. He , writes of much that he has seen, and of not a little in which he has taken part vigorously.
