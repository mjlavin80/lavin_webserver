Veto York Times Saturday Review of Books:
Having spent many days and many nights in the wilderness, and having just returned from the trails and swift waters of Northern Maine, I venture to respond to the question contained in your book
Review of July 21): “ If you were to be in the wilderness a whole month with only one book what book would you choose? " The choice or the-book for a long term away from civilization is one' of the big questions in the tropics, especially in small expeditions where the pack must be limited to "going light.’* It is even a greater question in the equipment of him who takes to the hunting trail or the long light cruise in our own country.
1 have met travelers in Africa with everything from a clumsy English bank book to the Book of Psalms. Did not Kitchener saunter through the Boer war With a grand piano and the personal luggage of a circus? I have met other men, more nicely balanced in their adaptability to circumstances, who go through the wilderness and the jungle of foreign countries with a fly book and an Indian paper edition of Schopenhauer; others, with the omega of unliterary rubbish; others, again, with Bacon’s Essays or the thoughts of Marcus Aurelius, Plato's “ Phaedrus," or the incomparable monographs of Flaubert, Walt Whitman, Izaak Walton, Thoreau, Emerson, Jeffries, and a hundred other writers who contribute their
food for mind and heart to the " man in the woods." But to prescribe for that man is a speculation in which all of us are seldom successful. Indeed, the very choice of one book for a long communion with the sweet wild life is of itself more the sign than the sustenance of the traveler’s character and intellectual bias.
Men have various motives for the choice of their literature for the woods. Some wish to command at a moment of physical relaxation the opportunity to luxuriate over the candid thought of Montaigne or the delicate grade of de Musset, the concise beauty of de Maupassant; while others want some weapon—a paper bludgeon -with which to “kill time.” Time's assassin is all too numerous In the world. Personally I haven't had a minute to " kill" since I discovered this precious
olcmcnt—Timc. Without which the time
killers would dissolve into'an Attenuated nothing. Other men arm themselves—albeit indlfferencly—with a book for the woods because they are \afraid or have no thoughts of their own; or as a refuge from the gloom of a rainy day under canvas—the delicious music of the drip-drip pattering notwithstanding. Some are merely ho constitutionally lazy in the flesh that they drone over a book and the camp fire while the other fellow does the work 'before and after dinner.	'
Eut for tho man whose mind is in an attitude of communion with the srea,t minds
which have taught the world, a choice of the book for the woods is often a choice of the book that was never writ, a book we are all going to write some day; the book of the open air under the stars, the soporific scent of balsam blending every thought into Its dreaming neighbor, while half ideas flit across the brow and are lost in the ghouls of the flickering fire beyond the apron of the lodge; the pungent smell of blrchwood smoke, a distant howl, the plaintive Cry of a loon, the faint whisper of a dying breeze—all merged on the spirit page of this book that was never writ, the book we all shaU write— some day.
That is the lightest of all books for the woods, the only one that fits all men capable of pursuing the wilderness trail in the right spirit. It is not the book of the new nature theorist or of the man whose knowledge of wild life has been derived solely from the out-of-door literature so industriously commercialized at present. Much of that literature contains a ton of nonsense to a tint of truth. Yet the nature vogue is on. Who shall gainsay that it is wholesome, that the multitude of new nature books, however ridiculous they may appear to the experienced trall-
malter, are stimulating a desire to get out of town and to stay away from the market place as long as possible while the sun shines and tan and health can be acquired by a rational and Intelligent pursuit of tthe pine-cushioned trails of the
north woods?
1 But which shall be the one book to browse upon In the aromatic shade of balsam firs is a question even Lord Acton,
: accounted the best-read man of our time, could not have answered. The best com' bination of three would be the fly book,
| the sketch book, and the blank book wherein to-write that book which we tire , all going to write—some day.
