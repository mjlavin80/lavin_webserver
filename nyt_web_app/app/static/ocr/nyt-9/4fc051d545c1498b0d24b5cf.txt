EIHs and Spedding’s Edition Reproduced in a Cheaper Form, with an Able Introduction by a New Editor.* .
-----------pCOEPT for the type In which j
the single volume is print- | ed, no fault may be found with Mr. Robertson’s edition of the works of Bacon. Even with the type fault finding must be limited, for it is clear
and legible, though somewhat too small j to be thoroughly comfortable to the eyes. With it criticism ends. The volume is not too large; it is not heavy, and, despite its more than 900 pages, may easily be held in the hand. Even its type, however, should really attract praise, not censure; for this hook is an attempt to set the chief works of Bacon . within the reach of most readers—a successful attempt, too, as the price, even under the malign influence of our tariff, clearly shows. The volumes of Bacon in the Bohn Library do not approach it in cheapness.
Mr. Robertson’s edition is that of Ellis and Spedding, published first in 1S70. This he has amended somewhat, chiefly in tranferring Mr. Ellis's notes from the Latin original of some of j Bacon’s works to the corresponding English passages of the reprint; ho
has also added a few instances to those noted by Mr. Ellis. The prefaces to the various philosophical works pre- ; pared by Spedding and Ellis Mr. Robertson reproduces unchanged, as well as the " general preface ” to their edition; and he himself contributes, besides a preface, an introduction to the whole work. In this must be sought any new light on Bacon.	j

the verdict of history-; now, however, it j
is seen that Macaulay was not the

compelling prosecutor, and public
opinion is swinging around to the side
of the critic’s victim. A part of Mr. [
Robertson’s introduction is devoted to
an answer to Macaulay.
The main charges against Bacon as a man are two-treachery to his patron, Essex, and corruptness as a Judge. The argument on the first is that because Essex, for great services rendered him by Bacon, had given him a fairly adequate reward. Bacon’s duty, when Essex had not only long ceased to tako his counsel, but had grossly contravened it. was to refuse to take any action against him as a Crown lawyer. When it is remembered that Essex had received from the Queen a hundred times the benefits he had bestowed on Bacon, and was thus, on the principles assumed, guilty past all apology, the attack is seen to break down. Bacon
*	*	* acted on principles of public
fealty which then as now were as clearly of plenary force as his obligation to Essex was limited.
In regard to the charge of bribery, the case is different. Bacon did take somfi gifts from suitors; and therein he sinned against his own precepts for the management of judicial affairs,
*	*	* he conformed to the common
Judicial practice of the day, though ho heedlessly took one or two of them at dates which brought him under suspicion. instead of in the annual or otherwise usual way of official routine. His fault was laxity, not iniquity; r.ot one of his thirty-six thousand decrees as Lord Chancellor appears to have been overturned on the score of corruption.
]f, finally. Bacon be judged in the only fair way, by comparison with his leading contemporaries, he is found to be in essentials a much better man than most of them. His successor in the Chancellorship, Bj^hop Williams, was convicted of real corruption, and disgraced accordingly. Another of his tmreachers, Oranfield, was' found guilty of gross embezzlement as Lord Treasurer, and disgraced likewise.
*	*	* It is safe to say that had Ba-
con's life ended In undimmed official lustre, and not in technical disgrace, he would pass without challenge as one of the most sagacious and most upright public men of his day.

As to Bacon’s philosophy,	Mr. Robertson
quotes	William Harvey
as saying that he wrote of it “ like a Lord Chancellor,” and continues by quoting Mr. Spedding: " We no longer look for the discovery of any great treasure by following [in Bacon’s path.] His peculiar system of philosophy—that is to say, the peculiar method of investigation, the * organum/ the ‘ formula,’ the * clavis,' the * filum Labyrinth! ’—of this philosophy we can make	nothing.	*	*	* We regard it
as	a	curious	piece of	machinery, very
ingenious, but not worth constructing because all the work it could do may be done more easily another way.*' As Mr. Robertson admits, Bacon was not a leader; Copernicus, Leonardo da Vinci, Kepler, Galileo, Gilbert, Harvey, had preceded him as inductive philosophers: he was ignorant of Kepler’s discoveries in astronomy; he knew nothing of Napier’s logarithms, invented nine years earlier; and in many other ways he was aloof from the scientific world of his time.
As a matter of fact, Bacon seems to have been more under the influence of alchemy than the other philosophers of the time. The titles of many of his works have an alchemical ring to them; “Valerius Terminus,” "Filum Labyrinthi," “ Novum Organum," “ Parasceve,” “The New Atlantis”; there is -not so much difference between these titles and those of alchemists of his time, such as Basil Valentine’s " The Twelve Keys ” and " The Triumphal Chariot of Antimony,” M A Brief Guide to the Celestial Ruby,” cr Sendivogius's “ The New Chemical Light.” And as to his relations to other philosophers of his time, he may be compared to the Edison of twenty years or so ago—who made discoveries by roundabout ways with infinite pains which he had made sooner and more easily if he had known what other electricians had done. Edison is a genius not because but in spite of hieing self-taught; the same thing. In effect, might be said of Bacon as a philosopher.

*	ing Ellis’s conclusions: " It is neither to the technical part cf his method nor to the details of his view of the nature and progress of science that his fame is justly owing.
The concrete conclusions and the alleged potentialities of Bacon's methods of investigation must be disallowed; his precepts are for the most part admirable; and it is in the unique force and insight with which he urged them that his real triumph lies.’* To Bacon belonged in the highest degree Wo faculties—that of statement or utterance, and that of insight into human character. “ It is between his commanding and irrefutable censure of the vices of normal mental habit, and his thrilling prediction of the great things to be done when those vices are amended, that he still holds the admiration which he had conquered within a generation of his death.” In the intellectual as well as the social life, continues Bacon’s latest editor, " it is happily possible for men to show the way they do not tread. In Bacon’s day every important new Idea was arrested in the name of dogma, and as nearly strangled as was possible to those in authority. He himself, in the very books in which he is driven to protest against the procedure, gives it his countenance in the concrete as often
h^.her;cehsures;it in the abstract. Those^ who’' have 'come af ter ^ hiriv have "done the same, even >urito th£ tenth generation. Perhaps in our day, at least in the physical ^ sciences, there has emerged a new intellectual self-con- r sciousness, the result of the unceasing percussion of npvelty; but to the moral and historical sciences we stand very much as Bacon’s generation did to the physical. Whep all Is said, we j are listening to a man of genius, one of the great masters of English prose, and so great a master of the essentials of all diction that his Latin was to foreigners what his English was and is to his countrymen.'* Bacon, then, retains his reputation because he said wise tilings in an excellent way, and not because he did wise things—such is Mr. Robertson’s verdict, and it seems justified. Mr, Robertson himself is one of the most advanced of English i Radicals, but a student with a broad outlook.
