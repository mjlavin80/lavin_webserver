A READER of The New Touk Times Book Review, who modestly declines to appear in print on his own account, approaches us privately with a suggestion for “ another attractive feature.” He says that each month, on the day we print the tables of contents of the new magazines, he goes over the lists carefully, pencil ill hand, and marks the articles he wants to read—that is, those articles the
titles of which, or the authors* names, strike his fancy. His suggestion is that others among our readers might
*
do the same thing, and communicate the results to us each month, thus providing a guide, if not exactly to the best features of the magazines, at least to their “ drawing cards.” His own list, he says, is never long. A single article is all he generally finds in the contents of each magazine; but there were four articles in the September Harper he was anxious to read, one in The Century, one in Scribner’s, and three in The Atlantic. He has an idea that monthly communications in The New York Times Book Review might indicate what sells a magazine. Probably many things combine to give a magazine standing and success, but this is a good idea, as far as It goes, and we cheerfully and respectfully present it to our readers.
