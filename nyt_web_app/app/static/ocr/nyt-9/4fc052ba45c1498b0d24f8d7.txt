IMITED	editions,	hand-made
paper,	special	type, long
prices.'and little books—when a poet publishes bis work bo he offers his “ few but	select ” readers a certain	de-
gree of Intimacy. We are invited, not to join the crowd in the hall, where, wreath on head and harp in hand* he is	'holding poetic	state before all who
will	hear	him, but	to enter	his private
garden, where he walks singing to himself, to one other, or to a few. What he sings will be parerga, songs made for his love of themselves or of those to whom they are sung. They may be no better, not	even	any truer to himself, than	the
songs	he	sings in the hall; but they	will
have their extrinsic charm of intimacy to add to their intrinsic. That constant desire to know the man behind the work, which inspires equally the personal paragraph, such desires as that of a well-known writer on the drama to " grasp by the hand '* any one whose work he liked, and the most serious and reverent investigation into the lives of men of letters is heightened by this subtle flattery into a sentiment that cannot be neglected. It should be, .nothing to the readers and critics of Mr. Binyon and Mr. Sturge Moore that the one Is singing of his own courtship, his own blue tie, his u*n marriage and honeymoon, and the other making rhymes for real children In a real little school; but the sentiment remains. “ There are a few people," the poet seems to say, who are worthy of seeing me without my robe and crown; and you, my dear Sir, by the very fact of my book being in your hands, have proved yourself one of them.”
Mr.	Binyon	has
Lanrence	turned	from his	state
Binyon in	poems,	** Adam M and
a Lyric Vein.	“ Penthestlea,"	back
to the lyrics which were his first choice. The old qualities are present, with added depth and sweetness and more of the inspiring heat which makes a lyric something better than a choice arrangement of words enfolding a pleasant thought. It Is not the rapturous heat of the erotic poet; there Is no cataloguing of charms, sonnets to eyebrows, and what not. Equally, there is no attempt to formulate a creed of love, to philosophize, to force a way through the physical to the spiritual, (which is always, even In Rossetti, a suspicious and unconvincing argument,) nor to use the love in question as an introduction to some theological or ethical scheme. The poet, in gracious shyness, wonders at and joys in his own feelings of passion, peace, adoration, or tumult. The spiritual is there, because there it is; because nowadays, and with us. there can be no love worth the name that lacks it. It Is not to be strained after by transports; It resides in the peace of love as well as in its raptures. Mr. Binyon, indeed, has more to say of the peace of love than of any other of its characteristics;
Like a coral isle That long so silent grew From deepest deeps, the while Slept or stormed the blue.
Emerging to enfold Peace answering the skies,
And ringed with rock, where rolled All day the white surge cries..
Till from isles unknown Far on spicy air Seeds in secret blown ' Sprang to beauty there.
So Is the lover's life, ringing round an inner peace which the surges of the world, roaring without it, only enhance. His thoughts of love are snowflakes that bring a hush of beauty over rugged roads. At the marriage service:	‘
We give not to each other only now.
But both are given to one spirit that knows
Our hearts more deeply than we know, and lies A peace within our peace.
But the peace of love Is not idle acquiescence; it is “ no tame dove to be caught and caged In the breast.” The effort, the aspiration, are there, too.	"
O	Love of myLove,0 blue.
Blue sky that over one bends!
The height and the light are you*
And I the lark that ascends,	-	■
Trembling ascends and soars,
A heart that pants, a. throat

The fall of the last two lines shows the craftsman more obviously than anything In tlje volume; but the poem is, ih its different way, as full of lyric passion as " I arise from dreams of thee.” " Venice ’’ strikes one as, in sentiment, the least sincere of all these poems, and is at the same time one of the moat beautifully wrought; the vision it raises of the city is so vivid and complete that the thought, " ’Tis all in you, that have given it me," seems rather its excuse than its reason. ‘^Hicordi
Of a tower, of a tower, white In the warm Italian night,
Of a tower that shines and springs 1 dream, and of our delight.
We should like to quote in full; but it would take too long to examine all these i ! poems. They make a very fragrant posy ! to lay on the altar of love. Mr. Binyon’s mind is sensitive and delicate rather than strong or original. His poetry is like the little woodcut of his own doing on the frontispiecc—there Is nothing to mark It for all time as distinctively his own, but it is sweet and radiant.
V
Mr. Sturge Moore Stnvere Moore has, whether he will Singing or not, whether he to Children. is singing for chil-' dren or grown people, a more strongly marked personality in poetry, a way of seeing and of saying things that is less easily confused with any one else*s. He says of Joseph-^
Tea, every time his efforts failed He rose with stronger heart and wit; And every time he higher scaled Till he stood where, for dreaming It, They once had thrown him in the pit.
Yet he to love must change their hate, Not blaming them. • * •
The thought is quite simple in reality, but, unless the little scholars were already versed in Mr. Moore's poetry, it must have needed, we should imagine, some explanation from the lady to whom the book is dedicated and who ** brought home ” these poems to the little school because of the characteristic expression, the " closeness ” that may be found in all Mr. Moore’s work. But at least he has not-made the mistake of writing down to his public. He gives them not the obvious, not even their own thoughts, but such of his as will interest and strengthen them. He talks of the beauty of simple things; food (as Stevenson did) and a well-ordered table, washing, hands and foot, water, eyes, and wings; and, in doing so, he shows a tenderness and a humor that we see less of in his^ other work. There Is a frolic spirit about him. He laughs at the fjeese blown about by the wind, dances round the cook who makes plum puddings, romps in the hay and the sea, and is up and away with Peter Pan to the tree tops. Here Is a delightful thing—like the best of the modern nursery pictures:
The four sails of the mill Like stocks stand still;
Their lantern length is. white On blue more bright.
Unruffled is the mead.
Where lambkins feed And sheep and cattle browse And donkeys drowse.
Never the least breeze will The wet thumb chill That the anxious miller lifts.
Till the vane shifts. ' .
The breeze In the great flour bin Is snug tucked in The lubber, while rats thieve,
Laughs in his sleeve.
Mr. Moore, if he frolics sometimes a lit- , tie heavily, frolics always with dignity. Children no doubt find jingle easier to leam, jingle of the kind, for Instance, of *‘ Take a seat, said the cow, gently 'Waving her hand,*’ where the verses run #t like a wheelbarrow," but tjie very easiness of such poems makes It the more difficult to retain what meaning there may be. It . trips off with the meter. In such a poem aa Mr* Moore"5 ** Hands

Diana White of the seventh of the twelve Tablets of the Deluge series found in the library of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh. It relates how Ishtar, goddess of love and life, went down to the realms of Allat, queen of the underworld, asking in vain for the return of her husband, Tammuz. The Tammuz legend and its descendant, the Adonis legend, are too familiar to need retelling; this episode may be read to advantage in the present translation. In each of these books the author has designed the woodcut; Mr. Moore’s four and Mr. Blnyon’s one being engraved by the designers, while Miss White’s has been engraved by Mrs. Pissano. All three books are printed In the “ Brook ” type designed by Mr. and Mrs. Pissano, on hand-made paper, with decorations in wood cut designed and engraved in color by the same artists. In a book '* About the Eragny Press," to which he contributes, besides the bibliography, a note " On the Relation of the Printed Book as a Work of Art to Life," Mr, Sturge Moore tells us that the press began work in 1804, being named after the Normandy village where Mr. Lucien Pissano studied under his father, Camille Pissano. For some years it used Mr. C. S, Ricketts’s •* Vale ” type, (when, by the-way, is Mr. Ricketts going to continue his .interesting experiments along the lines of his " King’s Fount ” ?) _in. 1903 first appeared the " Brook" type. It is bold, clear, symmetrical, and well placed on the page, and the books, of which we have some few others before us, are all things of beauty. Till lately the Eragny Press has been content with reprints; the three books noticed above are practically its «m attempts at the production of original -matter. We can imagine no pleasanter or fitter poem for such bonnes bouches as these.
V
THE first thing to strike the reader of Mrs. Tennant's little volume will be ' its unusual punctuation. There are very few stops, and what' there are are
-	all wrong. Take as an
WindleatniTv	example, not only of
«-»d	the punctuation, but of
April Lilac.	Mrs. Tennant’s work at	I
Its best, this "Moon	|
Magic," which we point exactly as the 1 author does;	'
One day when father and I had been To sell our sheep at Berwick Green we reached the farm house late at night i A great moon rising round and bright.	!
Her strange beam shed on all around Bewitched the trees and 'streams and ground.
Changing the willows beyond the stacks
lo	little old men with crouching backs.
To-day the sun was shining plain They all were pollarded willows again. i But at night—do you believe they're trees?
They re little old men with twisted knees.
The vividness of that may be matched from several others of these poems. In impressions of the country, in the legends of plants and animals, and in the dialeat poems (though •* the chequered underflow” of flames Is a phrase not likely to be heard In a Wiltshire farm-kitchen,) wherever, in Tact, Mrs. Tennant is playing the pipe, she plays it very sweetly. Large and pompous instruments do not suit her gift. She quotes Herrick’s ** Ternary of LIttler" on her flyleaf, and then gWes I us a long poem on Cain In blank verse, and other heavy-commonplace things that | have none of the life and sweetness of her windlestraw. Miss Norton, too, has ' not learned to select her best. Her modest little bunch o£» lilac is well worth Its modest price, but it is not all Trugrancc. Of her inspiration she says;
As from the barSd bow is wrought A little flower that burns and blows.
So from my heart there breaks a thought That broadens to a living rose!
Some of the bare boughs have been left in the nosegay. But there is sweetness and charm In several of these poems, and the fourth of the “ Lyrics of Vain Love," short, significant verses of real insight, is all but worthy of Coventry Patmore. |
V
We should welcome a	^
Mr. Benson** little more of that In-Kv«n	equality in Mr. Arthur
Way,	Benson. The very un-	!
certainty of Mrs. Tennant	j
and Miss Norton' gives their hooks an I interest. With a plentiful lack .or judg-. raent, they show a power of creating some little thing of beauty, however faint and fragile. Mr. Benson’s level is higher than.
; theirs, and so challenges a more exacting criticism; but it is just the fact of the ! level that disappoints. He Is a scholar with a feeling.for language and acknowledge of poetry; but that Is not a poet's full equipment ' He'hds knoyn his aim; and tlie troubles, not that-he lms'missed it, but that he; has. hit it, unaware, apparently, that there was anything higher to aim at Where far less accomplished people stumble. lt may be by accident, into poetry,' Mr, 'Berisbn ‘ maintains a do? llberateiy chosen tSvel "of good verse/ He is always' correct,. always perfectly plain. The irreproachable- sentiment, the respectable ambition,'the phrase Which all cdn understand, 1 the .meter-, ^whlbir .has, .nqi secrets .and ho surprises—these are. his ' strerigfhT And his weakness.v We look in vain for the chiseled perfeetton ijt the. classlc. and for,'the romantic'svhintot
i
exulting beauty, the surprise, the constant suggestion, the force and character, some or all of ^vhich we ask of our poets.
Each d:iy that passes binds me close And closer to the world I love;
Kach day that wanes, the instinct grows '1 o look around, and not above;
Bright boys and girls, all ardent hearts, * women, wise and warlike men,
I watch them play their gracious parts— I wonder shall I watch them then?
That Is true and amiable, but is it all that lhe love of life has to say? Everything in the book speaks of a gentle nature,- a clean, clear mind, a just remembrance of Tennyson and Wordsworth, but we close It with a feeling (which we sincerely hope will prove unjustified) that we *hall look in vain to Mr. Benson for
anything more than the poetry of a Poet Laureate.
Utterances Porctfnl and Fierce.
enough, of
Yet we had rather'pack “Peace, and Other Poems” in our holiday bag than ** Indian Love.v	Here is
character and	force
surprise something, of beauty nothing, of suggestion, or (shall we say?) of the suggestive, too much. It is force misapplied, character muddied at the source. These fierce utterances, which are now and then almost the ravings of passion, are the work of a woman now dead. They touch on one side the love of women—the women of the Western East; on	the	other	the jungle lusts of	the tiger.
To	liken	these	raw and savage	verses to
‘ Poems and Ballads ** is to insult the art of a great poet. Their subject, so treated by u woman of Western origin, makes tUem remaikabJe; their heedless fluency shows at least an active brain. The effect of reading them is to send us back to that other Laurence, Mr. Binyon, thankful that there are more ways than one of making and of singing love.
