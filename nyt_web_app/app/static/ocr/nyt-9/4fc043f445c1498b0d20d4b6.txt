THE paper by Henn' Timrod on *' A Theory of Poetry," published in the current Atlantic, gives a new view of its author’s fine Intellectual powers. He has gained his long-delayed recognition as a poet. His prose writings have never been collected, for Timrod was a journalist and most of what he wrote is buried in the files of Southern newspapers. The critical essay that is now brought to light, however, is of a higher than journalistic quality. It was an address, delivered, strangely enough, in the midst of the civil war at Columbia, S. C., where attention was not likely to be long fixed on poetical theories or literary questions of any kind. Nor has it ever reached beyond the Columbian audience till now. though the subject has been debated before and since. For Timrod's attention is devoted to traversing the theory of poetry formulated by his fellow-Southcm-erF Poe, and to maintaining that truth as well as beauty Is the source of poetry; that the poem is not written for the poem’s sake alone. And Mr. 'fim-rod’s discussion is not yet outdated.
