We by no means use the phrase of our -'title in the connotation which makes it synonymous with the fashionable set We use it In the good old American' sense of what all cultivated. Americans would now call the “ clever set.” In the good old days when one called a clever man “ a smart fellow,” by ■ way of praise, one who had the quality of cleverness in conscious excess waslmQwn a? a a smarty.” There is a rising.set of smarties in the literature, especially in the periodical literature, of the British Islands.

Macaulay, who wrote on serious subjects, took much thought whether he bored his readers or not; so long as he freed his own mind, whereas French writers have always kept the French public well in mind and greatly feared to bore it, They even came to fear greatly not to startle it It is this apprehension, noticeable in the modem dread ‘of being overlooked, which led Goethe to call the current French literature' of his time “ the literature of desperation/’ as current French art might be called the art of desperation. A serious French economist once began a treatise' with the aphorism that “ Property is robbery.” On being taken to task, he answered that in order lo attract the notice of a crowd it was necessary to make a noise, say to fire off a pistol, and that this phrase was his pistol shot.
So Mr. Bernard Shaw and this disciple of his think. They are continually firing off paradoxes. Open Mr. Chesterton anywhere and you come upon one of them. Here, for example, is the beginning of his essay upon his chief, if we may call him so, the hierarch of his smart sect, Mr. Shaw:
In the glad old days, before the rise of modern morbidities, when genial old Ibsen filled the world with wholesome Joy, and the kindly tales of the forgotten Emile Zola kept our households merry and pure—
The rest of the sentence does not matter. Already one perceives the object of what we with some compunction continue to call the “smarty.” is achieved. The British writer has made the British reader " sit up.” The British reader, as Mr. Kipling reminded the American Journalist, does not sit up so readily, as readers of some other nationalities* There must be noisier and possibly more malodorous dynamite in the charge which, to use the French locution, makes him jump, than in the charge which will attract $he attention ot tbe Parisian reader. You must leave him In no doubt whatever whether you mean to be paradoxical or platitudin-
