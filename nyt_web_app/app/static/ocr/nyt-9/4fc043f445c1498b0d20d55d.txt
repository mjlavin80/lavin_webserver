HAMLIN GARLAND was the orator at the convocation of the University of Chicago last week. His address was devoted chiefly, and, as we might say, naturally, to the glorifica* tion of the woods and plains and mountains of our own land, and of the life of those privileged to inhabit them. He knows them through experience, and has done much to bring a realizing sense of them to the rest of us. But he took occasion also to say that he was no advocate of crude power, nor apologist for rough and reckless men. He finds in the genius of America something different from that of Europe—a difference which he thinks is explained by the plains and the mountains and the types of men educated thereon. The spirit of the trailmaker. already
evident in ihe practical achievements of our great men, will one day enter into the hearts	of	our artists	and our
novelists. To-dn.y	timid	and	boyish,
keeping to the beaten track, imitative and apologetic,	they will	then	be bold
and free.	1
