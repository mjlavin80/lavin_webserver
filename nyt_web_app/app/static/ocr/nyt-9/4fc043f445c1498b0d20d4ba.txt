MR. GRAY has devoted a great deal of work to his study of CarUell, and seems to feel himself repaid therefor. He has traced the life of the little-known playwright from the cradie to the grave, a task of some difficulty, for even the Dictionary of National biography has little information about him; he has discovered and corrected a discrepancy in the dates of a certain paper connected with his hero’s life, and has pretty well shown that Herbert and Robert were somewhat interchangeable names in the early seventeenth century. Furthermore, he has ' reprinted exactly Carliell’s best play, "The Deserving Favourite,” with the variations between the edition of 162fl and that of 1650, has prepared an essay on its sources, and annotated the play closely. In other words, he has shown a German thoroughness of work—somewhat, we are inclined to think, thrown away on the subject, but certainly promising well for the future. It is rather the fashion now to discover and exploit persons of tittle consequence; cases have been pointed out in these columns recently. But Mr. Gray is a student, and if he has merely followed the fashion, he at least has worked as a student, not as simply one who must be *' in the swim ” or out of the world.
It is interesting and amusing, however, lo note how completely Mr. Gray, in spite of a gentle disclaimer, is obsessed by a printed genealogy. Because Nicholas Carlisle, in 1&I2, compiled a genealogy of the
Ancient Family of Carlisle,”, Mr. Gray accepts it, and quotes from it repeatedly, quite on the principle of the Bellman in ** The Hunting of the Snark: *’ " What I tell you three times is true/' The pedigree, like all others, begins with a titled person and has Barons scattered through it. The object of the maker thereof, possibly Nicholas aforesaid, was to deduce his family from Robert Bruce. In spite of the short average length of life five centuries ago, Nicholas has one of the family dying fifty-four years after an uncle, another. an elder brother of this one, living ninety-five years after that uncle’s death! *' The traditional ancestor of the Carlisle family was Crinan, Abthane of Dunkeld, whose son Maldred married Bethoe, daughter of Malcolm II. of Scotland; and their son was the Duncan whom Macbeth slew in 1039. Needless to say, the descent Is not clearly established, although it has apparently been accepted by the family.” Why " apparently? ” The descent was invented to please the family, and of course it has been accepted. Having in mind the uncertainty as to the name of Lodowick Carliell’s father—sometimes he was Herbert, and again Robert—it would seem pretty clear, in spite of Nicholas Carlisle's carefully constructed pedigree, even if " accepted by the family,” that the family was not of importance—was merely of yeomrui rank. The matter, however, Is not of great Importance, except as a warning against accepting an English pedigree at its face value. Lodo-wick Carliell’s reputation to-day must £tand on its own merits, not on Nicholas’s genealogical table; and if he really has any merits, Mr. Gray’s volume will bring them to light.
