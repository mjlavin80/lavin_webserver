SAGACIOUS Charles Wagner has undoubtedly found a responsive echo In a wide constituency to his preaching: of the milder virtues that make .for peace and gentleness of living. These virtues are not a discovery of bis own and they have been preached by many before him,, preachers and philosophers, but he has brought his teachings into close relation to the actual facts of modern life and has put them In a persuasive and lumin-
-	ous way. The title of his boot tells the theme on which be speaks now, but he expands it to include many of the relations of life and extends bts doctrine consistently into every corner.
Mr. Wagner urges the conquest, the suppression of sel/r_ of self-interest, of selfstruggles. He says:
The too vivid consciousness of self is one of man's idiosyncrasies, but H has appeared in varying degrees at different times. In our day it seems to have reached its zenith. Why does this morbid hyper-aesthesia always follow In the train of a weakened moral Sense? As the greatness of things diminishes the importance of persons Increases; over the ruins of splendid interests poor egotism is always rampant.
The thirst for power shows itself in many different julses; an impulse that has a reasonable basis, the desire to rise, but the true way, as pointed out by Jesus, Is not the world's way—His way is voluntary service. “ Whoever seeks for dominIon is the least among men.” Life becomes a battle or hunt- Property becomes one of the gravest sources of hatred and dispute among men; but not among the rich alone Is the odious Spirit of rapacity to be found. Nor is it always property that Is the subject of the desire to gain; It is found in the selfish ness >of the sick, of the aged, of the man of science, of the religious man* Yet property is a right and a need; but to possess property but not brotherly love Is to pervert our right and turn use into abuse.
In such ways Mr. Wagner pursues the theme Into various ramifications, in which the literal meaning of it is often lost or merged in a broader, kindlier, huraaner significance. He turns aside to a discussion of science and f3ith, giving another warning to science that some of the real mysteries of life and the world she cannot fathom. Limited to the acquaintance of things within il.e range of the intellect, she is excluded from a whole world of realities that man encounters daify. The way for man is to search tor things eternal through things temporal, and it is for man to walk by faith. In the chapter ** The Love of Country,” Mr, Wagner examines the a.i*guments that the fatherland is opposed and hostile to whatever is exterior to it and would change the meaning of patriotism to a hunmner significance. He speaks against the intolerance of the Church, whose temptation, like man's, comcs from egotism, its sentiment of self-preservation taking the place of its true purpose. Intolerance is the safeguard of divers religions—to preserve their existence they must be intolerant. But, asks this preacher, is it important that this existence be preserved? and his answer is that it is not. To forget herself
is a Church’s duty, to De sacrificed, swallowed up, in order to be saved and born anew. Hence he preaches the widest tolerance and liberality.
In discussing " social justice " his posl-tion is in line with that indicated in his earlier chapters; it culls for the reform of many abuses. "It is a continual source of astonishment,” he writes, " to the student of the history of Christianity to find how little regard has been paid to the social conclusions to be drawn from It." As an outcome of this discussion is the last chapter, on the religious conception of work, which is *' the chief function, the consummate flower of man’s life, revealing Outwardly all that mysterious and unfathomable being called man.”	-
