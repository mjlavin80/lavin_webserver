Among the older stories was •• Ala-maDce," by the Rev. Dr. Calvin H. Wiley,

It really became a guide book in the hands of many In the seventies, who until then had scarcely known Western Carolina. .
I am not sure that some of Christian Reid's other stories do not have their scenes laid in North Carolina.
