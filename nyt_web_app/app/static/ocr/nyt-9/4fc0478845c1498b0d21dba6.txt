The justification of J. B. Bury's “ Life of St. Patrick anti His Place in History,’* which the Macmillan Company is bringing out, is that it rests upon a " methodical examination of the sources, and that the conclusions, whether right or wrong, were reached without any prepossession." The author points out that his interest In the
subject is “ purely intellectual," and so, unlike the work of Todd, (" which In learning and critical acumen stands out pre-eminent from the mass of historical literature which has gathered around St. Patrick,’’) it is impartial. Dr. Bury’a conclusions tend to show " that the Roman Catholic conception of St- Patrick’s
work is, generally, nearer to historical fact than the views of some antl-Papal
i	divines."
j Tlie volume is based on the writings of St. Patrick, which are nearly all In fragments, and it has not, the author says, been an easy matter to cast them into the literary shape of a biography—a choice which necessitated long appendices supplying the Justifications and groundwork. These appendices represent the work belonging to history; the text Is an “effort in the art of historiography.” Dr. Bury gives only a “ slight sketch ” of the political and social state of Ireland in St. Patrick's time, and of the religion of the Scots, confining himself to what it seemed to him possible to say with “ tolerable safety " on the chief points Immediately relevant to the scope of the book. However, he has attempted to throw some new light on the subject, and to supply ** a firmer basis for the life and work of Patrick."
In the appendices are given outlines of tho writings of St. Patrick, with documents of the fifth century, biographies
and memoirs of Ireland’s patron saint, and a number of other documents. There are also two maps.	.
