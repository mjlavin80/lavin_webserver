DE WITT & SNELLING.—1. Where can Mark Twain's poem entitled “ In Memoriam ” be found? It was written, we believe, on the death of his daughter. 2- Where can the following be found? It ts by Helen Hunt Jackson, we believe, and reads thus: -
" Dear absent love of mine! It did not need Thy absence to tell me thou wert dear.
And yet the absence maketh tt more* clear."
w. w., IClndei-hook. N. Y.—In ** The 1*05* Cause," by E. A. Pollard, Page 4S4, note. Is quoted some verse as follows:
*• Flaunting, and boasting, and brisk, and gay> The streets of the city shine to-day.
Forts without, our army within.
To think of surrender were deadly sin;
For the foe far over the wave abide.
And no guns can,reach o'er the riowingr tide."
Can yod‘ tell me who wrote thia, and give the whole [poem? It refers to the parrot pun ** Swamp Angel.*’
