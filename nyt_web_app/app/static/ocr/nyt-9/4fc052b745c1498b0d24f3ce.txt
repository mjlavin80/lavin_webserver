Tn The New York. Times Book review Katherine Barstow lias a, word to say in criticising Ned Ncwcome's animadversions on Shakespeare’s grammar, quoting: " There’s pansies—that’s for thoughts. ’ I quite agree with the writer that this is not error, but I wish to call attention to the fact that Shakespeare in some instances. where two substantives are apparently the subject of a verb, has the verb agree in number with the last one. For instance, in “ Macbeth ” we have *‘ Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.”
