THESE are Dartmoor sketches In sombre shades, and excellent of their kind. A thread of grim humor interwoven with a certain homely tragedy produces effects which are certainly artistic, and Mr. Phiilpotts's moor men and moor women seem to be made of real moorland flesh and blood. There is a suggestion of Hardy, too, without Mr, Hardy’s later morbidness..
The first tale, called “ The Mound by the Way,*’ gets a particularly strong hold on the imaginative reader. There’s a blacksmith’s handsome daughter in it and a big blond laborer and a farmer’s son somewhat lacking in the sterner moral qualities. Among these, of course, must lie a three-cornered love ! affair—but this is managed by no i means conventionally and brings out ! the natures, passions, and characters of the two men and the woman in sharp and tragic contrast. In another tale called " The Crossways " Mr. Phlllpotts employs in his plot almost the same three persons, though a quality or two is shifted. He seems to have a fancy for big brute men with more feeling (good or bad) than balance and for women Of the Intensely and primitively feminine type. The latter by their incorrigible indirections lead the men toward insanity, and the author does not shirk the issue. In the case of the two tales mentioned that tragic and'mad end is very different, In neither case, however, does it touch the woman.
" Corban ’’ is a story of two old men and a great tom cat and quaintly Involves also the fortunes of two young people. ** A Pickaxe and a Spade, a Spade '* is a variation—a very considerable variation—on the old plot of the highwayman who comes in disguise to woo a maid. ■* Benjamin’s Mess,'* another story, has to do with such English
matters as rights of way across proprietary meadows and what* is the proper course for landlords in such cases. Mr. Kipling has lately touched upon that key question in his "An Habitation Enforced," Here again there Is a three-cornered love affair, but here the man of more agile wit overreaches himself. The persons of all the tales are mostly not educated above the use of dialect, which therefore prevails in the text In the descriptive parts is to be observed at times a rather painful straining aft^r effects and a dislocated use of cruel and unusual words to obtain them. This fault is particularly noticeable in the first few pages of the first story. The real effects—which are often fine—are quite differently obtained. There the language is as plain and direct as could be desired.
