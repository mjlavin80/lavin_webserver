T IS the province of the useful “ Living Masters of Music ” series to keep us In touch with the liv-ipg men* whose biographies have not all or ful-iv got t'.eir. selves yet into the reference books. Mr. Buckley declares that a whole growth of apocryphal anecdotes has gathered around the English composer whose rise in the last five years has been so sudden and sensational. He assures us that all his own offerings are from the original source. His account of Elgar is vivacious, pitched in rather a high key of admiration, as is natural enough in writing of an admired contemporary, and gives a clearly defined impression of the man. That impression is of an Indomitable worker, tenaciously keeping to an end in view, and in the lack of Special advantages seizing every opportunity that would further his end, often at the cost of miach toil.
He was first meant for a lawyer, but found the law was not to his taste, and announced his preference for a piacc in his father's music shop in the sleeny town of Worcester and by his father's side in the organ loft of St- George’s Church. He plodded through many books of musical theory and practice; studied the violin, the bassoon, the trombone: played them in such orchestras as he could gain admittance to, conducted a glee club and a brass band, (for inmates of an insane asylum,) he-came organist himself of St. George’s, and with very little opportunity to hear much modern music, devoted his spare time to composing in his own fashion and according to his own ideas. Here was surely M infinite capacity for taking pains ” and an opportunity for an original talent to find its own expression. Not till 1S93, when he was thirty-six, did he hear one of his : wn greater choral works performed—his “ Black Knight,” given in Worcester. The “ Lux Christi/’ now known as ** Light and Life," was given at the Three Choirs festival in Worcester in lS9*j; his fame was finally established in 1900, when ** The Dream of Geron-tius ” was produced in Birmingham. A man of incessant intellectual activity, interested in many things besides music, and with unconventional opinions about his own art, is disclosed in these pages. His place, according to his biographer's unqualified judgment, is among the very greatest. No such judgment, of course, can be considered final; tut whatever place he may intimately be found in, his is certainly an interesting appearance, and his emergence in the field of nineteenth century British music has been a striking phenomenon.
A STIDY OP SCHIDEUT.
THE biography of Schubert has been strangely neglected. Kreissle von Ilellborn’s notes have the value of a contemporary’s record, but they are not much more than a contribution toward a biography. Sir George Grove made frome original researches toward clearing up and straightening out our ideas of Schubert's career in his Schubert article in his Dictionary. But that is about air that has ever been done. It may be tco laU* now for such patient investigation as Thayer devoted to Beethoven; but the musical world is waiting for somebody to try. In the meantime the knowledge already possessed is presented in various digests, of which

the latest and one of the best is Mr. Edmonstoune Duncan’s. It is a good addition to the Master Musicians' Series.
Mr. Duncan tells -the story of Schu- ' j bert’s life and work with enthusiasmi , appreciation, and sympathy, about Nas his sources have presented it; for noth-j ing new has come to light, and he himself is far from being an original investigator. In fact, even in utilizing i	the material of others, he is somewhat
handicapped by an imperfect knowledge of German, which leaves Its mark !	in some amusing blunders scattered
through the book. And occasionally his musical knowledge betrays him, as when he calls tho arpeggione, (for which, with piano accompaniment, Schubert wrote a sonata,) a ** small harp,” it being in reality an instrument of the guitar kind. He has an advantage over the previous writers on Schubert in that the complete edition of his works has appeared, and many which were by others spoken of only vaguely and from hearsay can now be discussed carefully.
Mr. Duncan does not agree with Grove in some points of technical criticism. He thinks Grove did not know ; what was what in counterpoint, and when he said that Schubert’s vocal I fugues are notoriously weak and that | his symphonies rarely show “ piquant i fugatos," and that he was deficient in I counterpoint, Grove gave currency to a , mischievous opinion. The truth is, re-j sponds Duncan, that Schubert was one ; of the greatest contrapuntists who ever I lived, who could " inspire" his coun-, terpoint as Bach used to do. The tech-| nical analyses that are given of some of Schubert's compositions are not strikingly illuminative, but there are some interesting comparisons of Schubert's work as a song writer with that ; of some of his predecessors who set the same texts to music; also an examination of the English verses that Schubert set. These were all, of course, in , German translation:	Scott, in verse
from " The Lady of the Lake,” and from other poems; Shakespeare, in three poems; Colley Cibber and Pope ! figure on the list. In some cases Schubert used translations in the original 1 meters, so that the English original may be sung to his music, as is the case with the Shakespearean lyrics. In ! others, the German version differed in meter, and we must either sing them in German or use a retranslation.
Mr. Duncan gives a full bibliography m his appendices, with brief critical remarks; a list of the composer’s works^ with their dates—but some 300 songs without opus numbers are omitted for lack of space!—a brief list of important dates in his life, and a brief biographical summary of people who touched Schuberth Ufe in significant ways. All are useful, and all are entitled to share in the praise that would characterize the book as an agreeable and generally trustworthy biography.
CLAVIER MUSIC.
THE manuscript now known as the “ Pitzwilliam Virginal Book," formerly as " Queen Elizabeth’s Virginal Book,” is a collection of about JiOO pieccs of clavier music, chiefly by English comjSbsers of the Elizabethan and earlier periods. Now, these C0m» posers were among the greatest of the time, and the time was one when England was prominent in music as she has never since been. The Importance of such a collection from a historical
and artistic point of view is obvious, Dr. Naylor has taken it as a kind of text for a historical discourse to illustrate some of the very many interesting topics that are suggested by it. He does this in much the same way as he did the task of discussing the musical allusions in Shakespeare in his little book published some years ago. He is a competent authority, but he is sometimes, perhaps, taken off his feet by his own enthusiasm—as when he declares that if all the other musical remains of the period were destroyed it would be possible to rewrite the history of music from 1350 to 1620 on the material which we have In the Fitz-william Book alone!
Nevertheless, there is so much that is interesting and important, so much
that yields copious results to analysis, that he might well be pardoned'. The origin of the suite-' and also of the sonata, the progress of the sense of tonality In the transition from the mediaeval system, the early development of the fugue, the influence of tlie romantic spirit, as shown in certain kinds of programme music, the significance of the numerous arrangements of vocal music, and various points connected with harmony and the modern way of tuning (known as “ equal temperament ”) are among the matters suggested by this collection.
The very numerous dance movements that occur in the manuscript first engage Dr. Naylor’s attention, and he takes up the galliards, almans, coran-tos, giggs, and others, analyzing their characteristics and quoting what contemporary writers say about them. More technical, but to the student scarcely less interesting, is the exposition of the “ fantazias ” that hi those days corresponded to the fugues of a century and more later, and the various technical devices employed in them. There are several transcriptions of songs, and the tracing of them (several occurring in Shakespeare) affords material for an Interesting chapter. Some of the most curious items in the collection are the fancy pieces: Munday’s ** Fantasia on the Weather,” In which he undertakes to represent ” Pal re Wether, Lightning, Thunder, Calm Wether," &c.; finally “ A Clears Day" and Byrdfs "Bells,*' imply a lively imagination for realistic effects.
The rudimentary elements of formal development that are to be traced here show that the Tudor composers were beginning to feel the need of a different method of ^procedure from the contrapuntal devices and the ornamental variations then universal, and Dr. Naylor's examination of them is interesting and suggestive. It was long before the initiative here indicated was carried through. The growing tendency to be freed from the influence of the modes, a struggling toward modern tonality, is carefully explained. The virginal and harpsichord, their characteristics and structure, and the playing and fingering of their music, so different from what piano students at the present time are accustomed to, are discussed. Dr, Naylor uses musical notation in his quotations very freely, and by his abundant references to the published volumes of the Virginal Book makes its use in connection With his discussion as easy as possible. It certainly is a stimulating and graphic method of studying musical history that he has, embodied in the book.
PROF. DICKIXSOX’S HISTORY. '
PROF. DICKINSON’S qualifications to write on musical history were amply shown In his " Music in the History of the Western Church." The present volume discloses the same ripe learning and judicious historical temper as that, and it will be more widely useful because of the wider scope of its subject. ‘ It is rather a guide to the study of musical history than itself a history, for Prof. Dickinson justly declares at the very outset that the time has gone by when the representations of a single book or a single author can meet the demands of intelligent curiosity on that subject. The material for study is found in musical compositions and the critical and historical work of recognized authorities. It is with this premise that the author starts upon his narrative of musical history.
It i?, necessarily, a brief and condensed narrative, but Prof. Dickinson has the gift of saying much in small compass and of pithy characterization, and his book is far from being the mere skeleton and scaffold ins of a
textbook. Ho docs not put down dog-
'fc.
matic statements on disputed points, such, for instance, as the place of Liszt as a composer, of which he says this:
The rank of Liszt as a composer cannot be considered settled; opinions greatly differ, and the controversy bids fair to last a long time yet. His disciples are confident that he will finally be reckoned among the greatest of composers. Those who doubt, assert that Liszt was deficient in melodic invention, that his power of framing and expanding an idea was greatly in excess of his power of origination, that his music lacks spontaneity, that he was constantly laboring for an effect, and fatally possessed by his musical theories.
His view of Wagner is definite as to the virtues and defects of the style and the dramas that embo^ it; it is
candidly expressed, hut it leaves the way open to the student to form his own opinions. A most ImportanE and characteristic feature of Prof. Dickinson^ work is his system of references, He assumes that his book will be used, wholly or in part, as a guide to further study in the books of authority. Consequently every chapter and every subdivision of the chapters contains a list of the books In English that treat of the subject in hand, accompanied by a brief estimate of the value and soundness of each one. He is prone to rather indulgent estimates of value, and he has, of course, greatly limited his field by admitting only books In English. There is a complete bibliography at the end of the volume, and an Index. There is nothing else in English that Is comparable In completeness and suggestiveness for students of musical history.
THE HAItr.
THE harp Is a picturesque instrument; it has a graceful outline, and “ there is something sui generis and ethereal In Its strains." It has a picturesque place In history and folk-lore and ancient literatures. This is what Mr. Grattan Flood points out In the very beginning of his little treatise, and this is what forms the keynote of it. The picturesque features are what he chiefly dwells upon, and the opportunity to range through the length and breadth of the romantic history of Ireland as It touches the harp and the ancient minstrelsy is too much for an Irishman to resist. It may be imagined that Mr. Grattan Flood has not tied himself down to a sober and serious discussion of the harp in its historical, musical, and technical aspects. Of his historical sense, his naive assumption of the intimate relations between ancient Egypt and pagan Ireland, and the alleged account of the green island and its harpers in the works of an Egyptian historian, and other romancings, we need not speak, but their mention will sufficiently indicate the claim of this historian to accuracy and critical acumon.
He conveys a great amount of information culled from ancient legends and annals. Numerous reproductions of old-time pictures and drawings, are given. It Is interesting and much of it illuminating as to the use of this most ancient instrument and the position held by its performers. It is to be regretted that Mr. Grattan Flood's style Is confused and fragmentary, and that he has little idea of a definite, consistent, and connected story. He sets out to speak of Egypt, Assyria, Wales, but he cannot stay away from Ireland very long, no matter what the immediate topic in hand may be. In the matter of the ancient history of the harp he contributes innumerable facts. As to the modern use of the harp In artistic music by the great composers, or as to its structural development and the principles upon which it is at present built, Mr. Grattan Flood * is less satisfactory. A more definite plan, a more skillful presentation, a more detailed and critical discussion and description would have made a book more valuable to the student and not less agreeable to the general reader.
PARRY’S SKETCHES.
THIS new edition of Sir Hubert Parry’s admirable series of studies is unchanged, save by the addition of a preface in which he says nothing in particular, lie does considerably more than to describe the works and lives of eleven srcit composers.
He has shown th:kir relations with one another and their dependence upon one another, the position they have severally held in the history of art. And to do this there was necessary the wide learning and critical judgment that have marked Sir Hubert as one of the most illuminating English
writers on music, as well as one of the best English composers.
A USEFUL HANDBOOK.
A REM ARK ABLE amount of information is compacted between these small covers. There is a sketch of the elements of notation, a list of abbreviations, rules for pronouncing German, French, and Italian; a comparative table of tempo marks; a collection o£ " brief biographies ” Of prominent musicians, the ** biographies ” consisting solely of a statement of their occupation and the dates of their birth and death. All this over and above the collection of musical terms explained, which occupies most of the volume; the pronunciation is also Indicated. And ail this will go without much trouble into the vest pocket.	R.	A*
