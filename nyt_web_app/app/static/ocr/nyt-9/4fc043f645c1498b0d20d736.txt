HERB arc two widely different stories, both addressed to young girls. Patty, who Is familiar to readers of Miss Wells's earlier story of H Patty fl.t Home " should be welcomed with* open arms In her new rfile of young New Yorker. Patty is pretty, vivacious, joyous, and infinitely charming—just such a little lady as every fourteen-year-old girl might like ~to be. She is the only daughter of Mr. Fairfield, a gentleman comfortably well off. and an ideal father. In the previous story of Patty’s adventures her life as mistress of her father's house in Ver-nondale, N. J., was the theme—now ensconced in a beautiful apartment hotel overlooking the Park, Patty's days pass In a round of pleasant and diverting duties. There is much of her school life given, her casual amusements, her new city friends, the society of Grigs, of which she was chief organizer and which was so called after the cheerful grig, which, according to Hilda Henderson— who was English—is a kind of English cricket or grasshopper. Theso young human Grigs lived as nearly as possible according to the standards set by their entomological cousins, and moreover made it a principle ot' their lives not only to be happy themselves, but to make others happy as well.
** St. Cecilia of the Court ’* is a sad story. In Flanery Court, where Cecilia (otherwise Angelina Sweeney) lives, poverty rules. Where no one* need dread the dangers of overeating, each resident gives generously of his little or nothing to his neighbor—even as the little girl in Mike Wolfe’s picture comforted her weeping and homeless friend by telling her: " Don't you cry, Mary. Come home with me; I ain't got no home neither."
Since all normal girls delight to cry over books quite as much if not more than they delight to laugh. Miss Hess will find many enthusiastic readers of her story. Besides, she really has told a pathetically pretty story of the life of a poor little red-haired saint—her struggles against the hardships of life, her drunken mother, her little brother Puddin', who, in spite of their poverty, was alluringly fat until he fell down the rickety stairway ana hurt his spine. There is Jim Bellway, who taught the make-believe saint, quite unconsciously, how to become a real one; and there is Mr. Daniels, whom Cecilia,
quite as unconsciously, brought back to the straight and narrow path—and so on; and though the story wades through tears, it nevertheless ends in a burst of sunshine.
