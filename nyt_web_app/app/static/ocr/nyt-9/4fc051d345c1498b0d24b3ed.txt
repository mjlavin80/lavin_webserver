CYRUS C. ADAMS.
Ft. DAWSON is already favorably known for his geographical and literary writings, His present volume Is a critical and scholarly study of the most fruitful era of early North American exploration. It was the most fruitful era bccause in Northeastern America there was no great barrier of mountain ranges, like the Appalachians, which so
long retarded discovery in our present domain. The
. i
valleys of the St. Lawrence basin were the pathways
■ i
leading to the heart of the continent and the solution of great geographical problems. The French pioneers who trod them brought home stories of dis-! covery that astonished Europe. The Old World ^ s(ow!y and reluctantly gave up its dream that here I was only a complex of great Islands through whose ; channels a short cut to the' spice islands of Cathay [
! would be found. -
! It was a vast continental mass that stood In the
1 way, bur the world would not believe it as long as
there was a thread on which to hang a hope. Those
big seas of which the Indians told, a little further west, must be arms of the great South Sea that , washed the shores of China. But no, they were only vast inland seas of fresh water. Surely the St. Law-i rence or some of its large northern tributaries must I rise not very far from the South Sea; but the men who threaded them to their sources found that the aborigines had never heard of salt water.
! Even in the closing days of this period of great discoveries Jolliet launched his canoes on the Missis; sippi in high hope that its broad stream would carry him to the South Sea, and he turned back »dlsap-pointed when convinced that it was the same river which De Soto had discovered and which flowed into the Gulf of Mexico. The suburb of Montreal, which still i bears the name Lachine, is a memorial of tho faith , that for a century and a half kept the French seeking for the waterway that would lead them to the j Western Ocean..
i No writer lacking in the critical acumen of the expert geographer could tell this story well. There is so much that is conflicting in the manifold narratives. so much that is vague, confusing, and erroneous in the cartographic output that he who is not skilled in the handling of such material would wander in a hopsless maze. Dr. Dawson has produced a superior book because he has special fitness for dealing with this great chapter in history. Trained geographic instinct marks the work throughout. The brief survey in eighteen pages of the physical features of the entire region explored by the men whose deeds he records Is certainly one of the best short geographical descriptions of Eastern Canada yet written. Hie vital fact is everywhere emphasized. We know the essence if not the details of the hydro-* graphic peculiarity of the Upper St. Lawrence basin when the author writes that *' it is not the magnitude but the number of - the streams which swells.the volume of'the‘St. Lawrence as it passes through* its. lake ; expansions.” Many persons .have observed on, their1 map the' peculiar V-shaped course of the main river valley. Dr. Dawson has no space-for detailed explanation of the cause of this, but he gives . the whole gist of the^matter when he says it is due to the fact that ‘*tfte primary Laurentian nucleus of the continent is of that shapei and along Its edge, in an alluvial'valley resting on Silurian rocks, the river flows and expands into broad lakes."

was not known to be an island and that
•	the Gulf of St Lawrence was not discovered until about the close of this half century of maritime endeavor* merely illustrates again that geographic knowledge usually advances only by ' slow and painful steps.
The ten chapters devoted to the discovery and exploration of the northeast coast are especially valuable for the Insight they give into the best mod- | ern methods of dealing with the mea- 1 gre, crude, and conflicting reports of I the early explorers, whose narrative and maps have been the despair of many a historian. Not a few of the early maps are almost incomprehensible to those who have not made a special study of them, and Dr. Dawson’s illuminative pages on early cartography are to be commended to all who may wish to acquire some proficiency in reading these documents. The methods of their construction, their strange pictorial allusions, the causes of their distorted outlines, distances, and directions have seldom been so clearly characterized. .
THE OLD CARTOGRAPHERS*
WE may follow Dr. Dawson far enough here to Indicate the quality of his discussion of these old maps. They are not to be treated with the minute seriousness which we give to the study of the careful map products of modern scientific research. Wide reading is required to understand the pictures with Which the cartographers filled the seas and the unknown interiors of the continents. They embodied the fable, the mythology, and legend of those times. We see Gog and Magog shut up in the Far North behind a chain of mount* ains, awaiting the appointed time for their irruption, as fixed in Ezekiel xxxix. The picture on an Important map of Jacques Cartier's time depict' ing pygmies armed with bows and arrows in fierce conflict with an army ot cranes in the region around Ottawa, Canada, shows that the cartographer believed he was portraying a part of Cathay. Among the strange mythical creatures in the sea, the remora, a fish six, inches long, which has the power to stop a ship under full Sail, is seldom forgotten. Such things are the incidentals of early cartography that have little to do with the real geographic importance of the maps.
But confusion is introduced by “ the fact that these old maps are drawn to magnetic meridians, while ours are always drawn to the true meridian.’' The early explorers did not understand the declination of the compass, but drew their meridians as the needle pointed, regardless of the true north; hence the numerous criss-cross lines on their maps. The erroneous principle they followed resulted in the distortion of coast lines and of the direction of sea voyages* and there Is always misunderstanding and controversy unless this principle is taken into account
Thus the course from Cape Race to Cape Breton is laid down on the oldest maps on a due west line, and in the contemporary description these points are plainly said to lie east and west. So they do by compass, but the true course is more neaHy west-southwest * * * and there is a drop of forty-two miles : to the south in that short stretch of coast The coast line on La Cosa's map thus explained becomes intelligible.
MISTAKES OF NAVIGATORS.
WITH the imperfect instruments j then in use the determinations for latitude from the deck of a vessel were not easily made, though they were often fairly accurate when made on land; but the Antilles on all ! the early maps are shown S degrees too | far north. Before the time of chro-
*	nometers it was seldom that longitudes were computed with the slightest ap- j proach to accuracy, and the subject I was further complicated by the differ- I ent estimates of the circumference of | the earth and the consequent lesigth of ■ a degree; but we know what these dif- , ferent estimates were, and we have to 1 translate them into our standard nau- i tical miles when we transfer distances from these early maps to our maps, made with degrees of sixty nautical miles on the equator.
Then there are other difficulties, such as those arising from erroneous ' spellings and from inaccurate transcription and translation, where the mapmaker followed the cotfy of a language he did not understand. In dealing with the various phases of these maps we must apply the necessary compensations and corrections before
they -will tell us the trifth as far as they can reveal it	1 " v -
The landfalls of the. early navigators on- the American coast were always south ot the latitudes they* mentioned; ' and It Is only by recognizing such facts ' as those mentioned here that the charts and courses of those famous sailors may-profitably be followed. In the first volume of "The History of’! the United States," by Mr. Channing, ' recently issued, the author does not at- j tempt to fix the -landfall of John Ca-hot on the western hemisphere, but says that “ it surely was north of Hall- 1 fax and south of Hudson Strait” In the first volume of another new book, Payne’s “History of the New World, Called America,” Hr. Payne takes the view that Cabot's landfall may safely be fixed on the shore of Labrador or Newfoundland. The keen analysis which Dr. Dawson makes of the testimony relating to this'question will interest all readers, and especially profit those students who may inquire into scientific methods of interpreting and sifting the early chronicles and maps; and the opinion may be ventured here that both the circumstantial evidence and the poaitive testimony presented
by Dr. Dawson eliminate both Labrador and Newfoundlar.d and point to Cape Bieton as to no other place on the Atlantic Coast as the landfall of the great sailer who so suddenly passed off the stage of history because he so bitterly disappointed the hopes of British merchants.
CABOT'S VOYAGES.
DR. DAWSON tells the story of John Cabot’s two voyages, the second of which would never have been perpetuated in history if it had been left to the English to hand it down. He felt certain that on his first voyage ho had reachedthe country of the Grand Cam," and England had no shadow of doubt that he had been to Asia. So divers merchants of London loaded his second expedition with "coarse cloth, caps, laces, points, and ' other trifles” to sell to the people whose wonderful wealth had exhausted Marco Polo's powers of description, j But there was no outlet for “points" and 14 laces ” among the fur-dad Eskimos and half-naked Indians whom Cabot discovered on his second trip. His voyage was voted a dismal failure and | the English did not think it worthy of the slightest publicity.
The story of these voyages by Gov-emment expeditions and private adventurers was well worth retelling, for its interest is enhanced by the author's comment, criticism, and explanation that tend to fix in memory the value Of each contribution to this piecemeal discovery of the New World. But in romantic interest it does not equal the story of the French officials, the missionaries, and woodsmen who revealed a wonderland in the scores of years they were seeking for a highway to the South Sea. Their exploits and the outcome of their pioneering fill more than half of the book. They were so many that some of them, even though they rendered service of importance, can cnly be named; and it seems hypercritl-cal to express regret that a few pages were not reserved for such a man as Lahontan, whose vivid descriptions of the life and ways of the redmen of America are said to have been perfectly accurate, while their simplicity and powar make them pleasurable reading to-day. This much may be said for the conspicuously useful phase of the work of Lahontan, and it should stand on its merits apart from the mistake that brought him into disrepute.
John Cabot discovered the Atlantic Coast of Canada; Cartier opened up the St. Lawrence Valley, piloting the way to the vast interior of whose possibilities of wealth and power he little dreamed, and then Champlain began his career “ as discoverer and colonizer, as the real father of Canada-the farsighted leader who, with a prophet’s Instinct, if not with clear vision, recognized the real pathway to the West and sought to seize for France the continent at its very heart.*’ These were the greatest names in the earliest chapters of the discovery and occupancy of Northeast America. Champlain had explored the present provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, and much of Ontario before the Pilgrim Fathers landed at Plymouth. He introduced the missionaries into Canada; and in 1625 he was commissioned by the French Government to follow up the river and “to seek out a direct
'passage to the kingdom of-China and the .Eastern Indies/*/ It was the same old story, and the discovery of the ss-tret of the Western Sea was'never out ■ of Champlain’s thought until his death-' in 1634.
f SCOPE OF 1*HE BOOK.
WE find in the hook the - essence and savor of the whole work of these pioneers, though thousands of pages would be required to tell the. story In detail.. The interest never flags; and ha would indeed be a poor literary craftsman who could spoil such a story in Jbe telling.
We see Nicollet guiding his baj-k canoe through the Strait of Michili-mackinac to begin the exploration of the great lakes; Brul$, the first white | man to stand bn the site of Toronto and to paddle on Lake Ontario, the daring adventurer who . loved life j among the Indians, but was finally ! murdered- by them; Radisson, who ; loved Wild life as few men do, who ^ wandered beyond the Mississippi fourteen years before Jolliet and Marquette Raw the great river, and whose narra-five, written 200 years ago; but only i recently discovered and published, “surpasses in interest the creations or | any writer of romances •»; Jolliet, who covered the largest area of any of the | eifplorers, his field extending from Labrador on the east to the Mississippi 1 on the west and Hu3Son Bay on the north; Father Marquette, “ the sweet-souled hero of Western discovery *’; Father Hennepin, who first saw and i described Niagara Falls; La Salle, the first to build a ship and sail the upper j lakes, and many others, some of whom 1 did very conspicuous work, though their names are comparatively obscure, i Many missionaries who gave their lives to uplift the red barbarians of the forest, suffering all things, even torture and martyrdom, were foremost i in the work of revealing the great continent The “ Jesuit Relations ’’ record | their achievements, but these volumes have one tantalizing peculiarity. It j was nothing to the missionaries who ' discovered this river or that lake. Too often they give the facts without the j names of the men who frequently imperiled their lives to bring them to light.
^Tbe Appendix gives the titles of 173 works that were consulted in the preparation of the volume. It is seldom that a geographical work, written in America, contains so fine a cartographic product as the physical map prepared by Bartholomew of Edinburgh for the volume. It is a first-class map, which, with the very full Index, supplies all the accessories to the letterpress required by the reader.
