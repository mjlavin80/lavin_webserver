The commercial traveler of this piece relates in a manner which a number of people will consider humorous various of his adventures upon the road. Of course he takes a hint from George Ado now and then, and strives generally after , what may tie called " billboard effects.”
, He tells you about his sweetheart-whom he names Mamo-and with whom he has frequently to “square himself." He tells you about misadventures in sleeping- cars full of women, about an infant which an unnatural parent left upon bis bands in a day coach, about a bride and bridegroom who once got In the seat ahead of him, about a fire in a country hotel, and a little girl that was Eva In an “ Uncle Tom's Cabin ” Company. Then he travels on a circus train and repeats a story told him by the elephant man (or some such) of how a certain wandering show out West once got the indorsement of the clergy in campmeeting: assembled. That story is not altogether without merit. In another place he dreams he plays for uncounted millions in a little game with Mr. Carnegie. Mr. Rockefeller. Mr. Morgan, and Mr. Gates—and cleans out ” the four financiers. The game which in the vision occurred in what the author calls the " smokehouse *’ of a Pullman car is related in detail. The less said about the quality of Mr. Ward’s humor the better—but it -is amusing. 4n. Its way -if tnArpn in small doses.
