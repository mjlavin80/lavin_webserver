JACK tOND.ON,
The Author of “ The Game ” Writes from Personal Knowledge
Based on Experience.	j
"Sesc York Timeb Saturday Rcvltto of Boots.*
S	one interested in the play of life and in the mental processes of his fellow-creatures,
I have been somewhat amused by a certain feature of the criticisms of my prizefighting story, *' The Game.” This feature is the impeachment of my realism, the challenging of the facts of life	as	put	down by me in that story. It
is rather	hard on a poor devil of a writer,
when he has written what he has seen with his own eyes or experienced in his own body, to have it charged that said sights and experiences are unreal and impossible.
But this is no new experience, after all.
I remember a review of " The Sea Wolf ”
“ by an Atlantic Coast critic who seemed very familiar with the sea. Said critic laughed hugely at me because I sent one of my characters aloft to shift over a gafftopsail. The critic said that no one ever went aloft to shift over a gafftopsail, and that he knew what he was talking about because he had seen many gaff-topsails shifted over from the deck. Yet
I.	on a seven-months’ cruise in a topmast schooner, had gone aloft, I suppose, a hundred times, and with my own hands shifted tacks and sheets of gafftopsails.
Now to come back to “ The Game*” As reviewed in The New York Times Review of Books, fault was found with my realism. I doubt if this reviewer has had as much experience in such matters as I have. I doubt if he knows what it is to be knocked out, or to knock out another man. I have had these experiences, and it was out of these experiences, plus a fairly intimate knowieCge or prizefighting in general, that I wrote " The Game.” I quote from your critic: "Still more one gently doubts in this particular case that a blow delivered by Ponta on the point of Fleming's chin could throw the latter upon the padded canvas floor of the ring with enough force to smash in the whole back of his skull, as Mr. London describes.*’
All I can say in reply is, that a young fighter in the very club described in my book had his head smashed in this manner. Incidentally, this young fighter worked in a sail loft and took remarkably good care of his mother, brothers, and
I sisters.
And—oh? one word more. I have just received a letter from Jimmy Britt, lightweight champion of the world, in which he tells me that he particularly enjoyed " The Game ” " on account of its trueness
I to life.”	JACK LONDON.
