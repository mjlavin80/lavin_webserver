This, from the preface to '* A Text Book in the History of Education/’ by Prof. Paul Monroe of Columbia University, gives an idea of the method of the author and the scope of the book. In order to help the student to grasp easily and immediately the great movements as they become manifest in thought and practice Prof. Monroe has selected only such men and facts as have to do with the typical movements in the history of education, and which consequently influence present thought and life. There are chapters on primitive education and its meaning; Oriental education, in which discussion the author uses China as a type; the different periods of Greek education; education as given and acquired by the Homans; education during the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Counter Reformation; " Realistic Education,'* " The Psychological Tendency," &c. For further study Prof. Monroe has supplied the book with a bibliography nhronoloeical tables, and a detailed analysis. There arfa also a number of illustrations. The Macmillan Company publishes the volume.
