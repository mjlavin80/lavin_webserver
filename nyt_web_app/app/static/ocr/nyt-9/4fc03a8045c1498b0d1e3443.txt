WHAT more should be needed for the success of Sir Womyss Reid’s autobiography than the I suggestion that the second volume of It cannot be issued at present, because of "the intimate character of the political revelations it contains "? The publishers have denied that they are keeping it back till after the next general election in England— not wishing to influence the nation’s choice—and also that Lord Rosebery desired to run a blue pencil through certain chapters. But scarcely less interesting Is the declaration that he “ expressly declines to look at the manuscript ’’—perhaps fearing that he might not be able to withhold the blue pencil—and acccpts no responsibility for its editing. Will not all j England be eager now for the second volume?
