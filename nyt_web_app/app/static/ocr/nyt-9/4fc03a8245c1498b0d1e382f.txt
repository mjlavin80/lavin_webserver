L H istbricalaridStatlstical ‘^Arguments' in its Fayor^ by au Canadian . i- ' Statesman.^'
ftXHARtTQ^;. the' author of . these* speeches and addresses, was for thirty-two years a member of the Canadian I House of Commons, representing the constituency of North Norfolk. The selections made by him in this volume represent a variety of topics, but the only portion of the work that calls for comment or that will much interest American readers is that entitled “ Fiscal Relations." As an intelligent Canadian, who by the circumstances of his life possesses an intimate knowledge of the United States; Mr. Charlton’s observations on trade relations between his country and this merit consideration.	*
From 1854 to 18G6 relations between the two countries were governed by the existence of a reciprocity treaty and forces were in play which would have caused the two peoples to have become practically one. " If the reciprocity treaty of 1854 had continued until 1002," says Mr. Charlton, ** I don’t know whether tbe Stars and Stripes would be floating over Canada or not, but I do know that you would not have known the two countries apart.*’
* * m
THE abrogation of tbe treaty In 18CG by the United States, considered from any point of view except that of the British imperialist, appears as a colossal blunder. In 1860 Canada exported to the United States $25,000,000 of farm products, and to Great Britain $3,1*40,000. In 1903 she sent to Great Britain $97,200,-
000	and to the United States only $0,200,000. That is, exportation to the United States had fallen off nearly two-thirds, while that to Great Britain had increased about twenty-eight fold. In 18T4 the Liberal Government of Canada, which had come Into power the year before, realizing’ the advisability of negotiating a new reciprocity treaty, sent the Hon. Georga Brown, for this purpose, as Commissioner, to Washington. The United States Senate, however, refused to ratify the draft treaty, and the Conservative .Opposition in the Dominion House of Commons attacked some of its terms; one of Mr. Charlton’s speeches printed here Is in defense of it^
It was mainly by his earnest and consistent advocacy of reciprocity that Mr. Charlton was stigmatized by his enemies as a *' Yankee," an “ annexationist," and an ** American representative in Parliament.’* He makes it clear how animosity has grown up In Canada toward the United States and how the hope and desire to gain American markets have gradually weakened in the minds of the Canadian farmers.
There was nothing for Canadians then, but to do the best we could without regard to the United States. We realized that an attempt to get trade relations with the United States would prove futile, and we proceeded to seek for other markets. We proceeded to develop our trade with Great Britain, and the result is that we have built up an enormous trade. The result Is that our sympathy and our loyalty reach out to and centre In Britain. The result is that three-quarters of our total farm exports are sent to Groat Britain, *	*	* and
our farmers are catering to the tastes of the British customer, and have forgotten all about Hie United States.
MR. CHARI/rON took a leaJ'ng part in the reciprocity propaganda in the United States beginning in IPOO.	spoke	many times and in many
places, but always to the same effect. He warns his American friends thru the course of their Government Is subversive of harmony and inimical to the cause of the welfare of North Amerien. '* Tlie first and most effective efforts of the political loaders of the United Stales for more than a generation have been of a character to promote discord, to destroy harmony and community of interest, and to sccure the establishment of two nations—one pressing to the utmost every advantage of position and ]>repoiU?rutins wealth and Influence, the other smarting under a sense of ungenerous ti t at~ ment." The result of the ’elections last Autumn, p:irlicul;uiy in Massachusetts, seem to warr.mt Mr. Char! ion in l'i.s belief that the American people nre at las: waking up to the importance of the (jues-tion of reciprocity wiLh Canada.
