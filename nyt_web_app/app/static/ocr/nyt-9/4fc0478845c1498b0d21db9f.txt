EVERY country under the sun has been so completely 41 described M by now that people who put a girdle about the earth really have small chance to bo informing. Whether they are entertaining or not depends upon the personal equation. This volume serves to convey the observations of an American who traveled recently to Hawaii. Japan, -China, the Philippines, Singapore, Ceylon, India, and so by the Red Sea, Suez, and the Mediterranean, with glimpses of Egypt, Palestine, Greece, Italy, and Spain, to the broad Atlantic and home again.
The American in the case is not a discoverer of the secrets of strange lands, his observations are certainly not profound, his book will have no value to the I student or the traveled man. But he has a rather direct fashion of saying what he | has to say and is not afraid to give his | own opinions—opinions whose value to the reader depends rather on the circumstance that they are the reflections ot foreign parts upon an average American j mind than upon any intrinsic merit of their own. In Hawaii you are told something about the hotels and the show places and something about the history of the islands as the author sees it. In Japan you read about the folly of wasting sympathy upon the jinrikfsha | man, upon the customs of the Japanese | with regard to marrying and giving in marriage, upon the Japanese manner of 1 ’ regulating the discreetly named " social evil/’ and so on. Judging from what other writers have said about these matters the author’s observations are too hasty to count. Japanese history is touched upon and Japan’s towns and temples are described, of course—then Shanghai and Hongkong and Canton, with indignant observations on the Chinese women and the custom of binding the feet.
In Manila the hotel people were rude, and in Ceylon one may not tell half-grown girls from Jjalf-grown boys, they dress so much alike. About India you read the usual things about Calcutta, Bombay, Delhi, Cawnpore, Agra, and the Taj-Mahal. Then you read of P. & O. steamers and the high tolls at the Suez Canal, about the Pyramids, Jerusalem, and the Alhambra. The author himself is Interested—any author who is has a chance of interesting his readers, but really the book belongs to the class of books which fail on their faces to establish a safe right to existence.
