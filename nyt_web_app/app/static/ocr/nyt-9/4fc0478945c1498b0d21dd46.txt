A CHILD of <he Shore/’, by Middleton Fox, Js a story of. Cornwall -■ In the days when Bonaparte was threatening to enter the island and when this *' wan, elemental land", of ore and granite” was .a place of "troubled dreams and spells and fables, where the powers of evil were in open conflict with the saints—boding no good for man or .beast—and yet the more fascinating because of that." Even to-day the Cornish men and women are curiously willing to believe in this disquieting nearness of an underworld whose happenings hover somewhere between the supernatural and the superstitious, so that it is no wonder that the old legends that in past centuries peopled the wild upland tors and rocky bays with unfriendly visitants are still listened to with delight by young and. old as they are rehearsed in front of the fire on Winter nights by the Droll Tellers. The elders shake their heads over the weirdest of them, but It is not from incredulity so much as a firm conviction that there was a time when things really happened so; when mermaids bewitched unwary fishermen who stayed to listen to their enchanting music, when Mother Nature had for some* of her children tongues that for us are dumb, and conferred on others unhallowed gifts whose use upon their fellow-men was prone to lead to
tragedies.
It is one of these " drolls " that Mr. Fox tells in “A Child of the Shore,” the creepy element, without which no “ droll ” was complete, being furnished in this case by the attempts off some “ merrymaids" to win back to her home in the sea one of their sisters, who, through some strange incantations, held on the shore, had become the changeling child of a farmer's wife. This girl's strangely enticing beauty, her craving for a kind of impossible physical freedom, and evasion of the ways to which humanity tended, especially her sympathy with all mood? of the sea, had long made her the mark of hostile comment in the gossiping little Cornish village of Helford, when the return from foreign wars of a certain Capt. Williams and his inevitable attraction by the village beauty crystal-ized hostility into more or less active hatred. A rejected suitor of her mother’s youthful days avenges his well-remembered humiliation by hatching for the daughter’s ruin a plot which depends for its success on the commonly accepted rule that an aristocrat may love a peasant maiden, but may not marry her. The story follows the girl’s sad fortunes, as she waits for the lover's letter that never comes and finally dies begging her father to bury her deep in the churchyard so that the sea that had always hungered for her ecu Id not claim her at the last. But it did claim her and the lotfer, too, and he dies, dragged down to the cool depths of the bay, as all Helford believes to this day, by his lost love and her sisters—the merrymaidens, for the sea folks never forget their wrongs.
Mr. Fox tells his story well, in a way to touch both the heart and thfe imagination, but in addition to the story there is the interest of the vivid picture of a quaint old village and a mode of life long past. As alien as the mermaids weaving their enchantments along the moonlit shore are the stealthy smugglers and wreckers who pretend to be honest fishermen and farmers.
