OUR new Volumes of the
14 History .. of Ali Na tions/*;
' the sixth, seventh, eighth,
, and. ninth, are now before '
u3; : The work Is in effect,
as we said in our first review, i
a .translation of the German u All- |
gemelne Weltgeschlchte," with revisions
and additions by American authors , * ■ ' * ' ' under the direction of Prof. Wright of |
Harvard. But it is/ not a mere trans- j
. ■ . 1 lation and- publication under, a new,
name of the work of authors on which the copyright “has expired. , As each volume is in the main the work of one person, there Is, a sense of completeness, of finish* about the book- not always to he found, in histories of the world.
The sixth and seventh volumes of the series are by Dr. Julius von Pflugk-Hartung, formerly Professot of History .at Basel, and now royal Prussian archivist, who edited a history of civilization not so long ago, and has written much on Papal history. In the sixth volume he takes up ** The Great Migra-_ tions ”—the irruptions of the Huns, the migrations of the Visigoths, the Vandals, the Ostrogoths, the fall of the Western Empire.
In Volume VII. Prof. von Pflugk-Hartung turns to the Early Middle Ages, His volume is In two parts, the 'first giving the history of the t»ango-bards, of the Pranks and their kingdom, of the Anglo-Saxons; then turning to the Papacy, and devoting two chapters to tbe people, State and law, and to civilization, art, and science, The second book of this volume takes up the subject of the Orient in the Early Middle Ages; its first chapter contains a vigorous defense of the Byzantine State from the customary accusation of decadence. “No Commonwealth ever defended itself so strenuously against such unexampled dangers ” as did the Byzantine; “ on its borders lowered Germans, Bulgarians, Avars, Slavs, and Turks, as well as the great powers, first ot Persia, and then of Islam; and yet against these, and amid the most frightful convulsion Of races, It maintained itself a thousand years- Not sickness, but lusty strength, is the characteristic of this imperial State/"
Dr. Hans Prutz, Professor of History in the_ University of Konigsberg, contributes Volumes VTII. and IX. to the series. The first of these, covering the Age of Charlemagne, is in two books, the first of which refers to the German-Roman empire of the Carolin-gians, the second book to the empire under the Saxon and Salic Emperors.
The same author, in Volume IX., writes or the Age of Feudalism and Tlieocracy. The first of the three books
into which he divides his subject deals with the age of the-conflict of the investiture; the seeond with the empire and the Papacy in the age of the Ho-henstaufens; the third with the. transformation of Western Europe through the decline of the Papacy and tbe empire. We are so much accustomed to getting our Wstory at English hands, and to seeing history as a whole through English glasses, that -It is somewhat of a shock to find both English and French affairs treated almost incidentally. But the-treatment, if brier, is adequate and Impartial, and after making us believe for years that Europe revolved around Britain and the British, no English writer can complain i? we.get a more correct view of events, and leam that the story of the world was spun elsewhere than on the little island in the North Sea.
The volumes of the history thus far published are remarkable for the beauty of their general appearance. Each of them has a special design on its
