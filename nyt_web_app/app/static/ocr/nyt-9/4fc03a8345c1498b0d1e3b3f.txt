ROMAN SOCIAL LITE,
Prof. Dill’s Fascinatirg Study of Alan. ners and Customs, Fashions and Beliefs, from Nero to the Antonines.*
OR those to whom one of the greatest delights of history Is in the full comprehension of the human and social side of bygone periods, Prof. Dill's book is most stimulating and suggestive. From the resources of great learning and wide acquaintance with all the writings and inscriptions that throw light on the most luxurious period of Roman society, he has reconstructed it so that its salient and characteristic features come vividly before us. There is an almost incredible richness and fullness of detail, and yet it is so presented that an Intelligible and well-proportioned picture is the resuit. The author begins by confessing that there something arbitrary in the choice and isolation of one period of social history for special study; but he well compares It with the artistic drama, where there must be a beginning and an end, although the action can only be ideally severed from what has preceded and what is to follow In actual life.
The period covered by the book is one of the most momentous in history, on account of the workings of the forces of decay and destruction that It contained within itself. The true character of those forces is aptly set forth by such a study as this, for they were social and were grounded in the conditions and tendencies that are to be seen in the social fabric. It is also a period most fully illustrated by the writings of brilliant	in	many walks of
literature and by the Inscriptions and remains. There is the material side and there is the spiritual side, both of which are here fully illustrated. As Prof. Dili points out:
The civic splendor and social charities of the Antonine Age can be reviewed by the imagination from the abundant remains and records of the period. Its materialism and social vices will also sadden the thoughtful student of its literature and inscriptions. But if that age had the faults of a luxurious and highly organized civilization, it was also dignified and elevated by a great effort for reform of conduct and a passion, often, it is true, sadly misguided, to rise to a higher spiritual life and to win the succor of unseen powers. To the writer of this book this seems to give the Antonine Age its greatest distinction and its deepest interest for the student of the life of humanity.
IN NERO'S DAY.
THE prospect at the outset is not a cheering one. Society in the time of Nero was full of a nameless, indefinite horror, a thick, stifling air, a dim terror closing In silently and stealthily, '* with sudden glimpses of unutterable torture, of cord and rack, and flaming tunic.” The great houses were miniature reproductions of the .empire, submitted to the unchecked power of the master, who, served in the most minute way to anticipate his every possi^ ble need or caprice, became a helpless dependent upon the enervating system of household slavery.
There is real truth, says Prof. Dill, in the tale ot the Roman noble who, taking his seat in his sedan after the bath, required the assurance of his slave that he was really seated. On -such lives an utter weariness, a disgust of oversated appetite settled, that even the most far-fetched luxuries of the Orient, the most devilish ingenuity of morbid vice, could scarcely arouse. The more energetic developed into a class of busybodies of whom the writers of that period have left us & portrait:	...

: ;	ROMAS EXTRAVAGANCE.
|07' the profuse extravagance of the ,	wealthy much has been said, and
"Prof. Dill gives some of the most conspicuous examples, and details some of the ruthless methods by which ^wealth was acquired. Little wealth in those days was free from “ taint ”! And few wealthy men were safe from the envy of those in the less fortunate /classes. But wealth had its duties, in those days, rigorously enforced by pub' lie opinion, and contributions to the amusements of the people, to the support of hordes of clients, to the building of gTeat public works, even in remote municipalities, put an enormous strain on the rich.
The milder and less suspicious age that ensued gave opportunity for some of the higher forms of literary and philosophical activity. There was a decadent spirit in literature, and a fe-
•	verish cultivation of style, for its own sake; a mania for “ recitation u before fashionable assemblies. Prof. Dill’s description of it is striking, often amusing, and of fascinating ihterest, full of illuminating details. From Pliny and other sources are to be culled delightful pictures of a cultivated^ man’s life. Characteristic features of plebeian life are abundantly recorded, especially the vast and varied organization of guilds, ■and of “ colleges ” with thdir patrons, which testified to the intense craving ■of the Latin lower classes for a highly ^organized social and industrial life.
PHILOSOPHIC TENDENCIES,
FULLY half of Prof. Dill’s book is de-T voted to an account of the philosophic movement and tendencies of ‘ the age. It possessed a great preacher In Seneca, who has been misrepresented ;-by Tacitus and Dion Cassius, and whom our author calls “ an immense and fascinating spiritual force,” an ideal director for the upper class of such an age, a pagan monk, a true idealist. We are given a brilliant and searching analysis of.his doctrine and its influence. His was the aristocratic creed.
At the other end of the scale was ^ the moral degradation of the masses without a philosophy or a religious provision for spiritual want. Into this state of affairs came a great movement which, in the name of philosophy or culture, called the masses to a higher standard of life. There was a great propaganda of pagan morality running parallel to the evangelism of the Church. The preachers of this propa-
tr
ganda were among the salient figures of the period. It was the day of superstitions, besetting all minds but those of the higher philosophers; and in the course of • the pagan revival there was an immense accretion of worships from conquered countries, as well as of belief in genii, dreams, omens, and oracles. The opinion that the period of the early empire was one of unbelief
*
or skepticism as to the future life is insufficiently based on exclusively literary testimony.
ORIENTAL INFLUENCES.
HATEVER views the philosophers held, the common men held largely to a belief In a life after death; and if there was no dogmatic ecclesiastical system deterring frequent frank expression of unbelief, the society of the time was apparently like our own in warm affection for kindred and friends, " clinging to ancestral pieties, ready to hope, if sometimes not* clear and confident in faith." Philosophy failed to touch the masses, and the old Roman theology with Its curiosities of superstition failed, to satisfy the, popular needs, to which came at last the
worships of Isis - and Serapis,■- teaching that the life to come wastHe tmellfe/ that future happiness could be secured only by a purification from the stains of time. In the last three centuries of the empire, the religion of Mithra, also from ihe East, became the most powerful; as Prof. Dill describes it, the highest example of the last efforts of paganism toward a purer conception of God, and of “ syncretism ” to absorb, without extinguishing, the gods.of the classic pantheon into an almost monotheistic cult. And with this last exposition of the intellectual movements of the empire is concluded a survey which, for thoroughness of information and | breadth and clearness of view, la a re-I markable contribution to the realities I of history.
