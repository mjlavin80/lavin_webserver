Marcus Whitman’s Efforts to- Win the Columbia Valley for the United States.*
HE part of Marcus Whitman in the saving of the Oregon country for tlie United States has furnished matter of bitter controversy on the Pacific Coast. The friends of Dr. Whitman have insisted that but for him the Honorable Hudson Bay Company would have secured ail that region for Bngland, the other side has declined to believe that Whitman's interest ■went beyond his own missionary field, and utterly refuse to credit him with any appreciable influence upon the political 1 fate of the Columbia yalley. This -volume Is a survey of the whole Oregon ques- , tion. from the beginning, with special ref-erencc, however, to the part actually , taken by Dr. Whitman, of whose famous midwinter ricJfe of three thousand miles or so and of whose tragic death so much has been-writen.
Dr. Mowry begins with a very fair and I serviceable account of the American claims to the Oregon country—the rights acquired by the discovery of the Columbia River in 1792 by Capt. Robert Gray, by the explorations of the Lewis and Clark expedition in 1804-5, and by the cession of Spanish claims at the time of the Florida treaty, aad adds a comparison of these rights with the claims set up by Great Britain. He describes also the circumstances of the first permanent i settlement (made by John Jacob Astor’B fur traders In 1811 and called Astoria) and the coming into the country shortly afterward of Scotsmen, also fur traders, in the service of the Hudson Bay Company. Likewise he tells of the manner In which the Hudson Bay Company bought out Mr. Astor’s company without Mr. Astor's consent—the agent, a canny Scot, making the bargain—and relates the story of the taking of the post in the war i of 1812 by the British sloop-of-war Raccoon and its formal restoration at the end of that struggle when the Cross of St. George was hauled down and the Stars and Stripes run up and saluted by his Majesty’s frigate Blossom. The author then devotes some chapters to the negotiations which resulted in the adoption of the parallel of 40 degrees north latitude as the boundary between Oregon and British Columbia. and adds another chapter to show that the Oregon country , was never a part of Louisiana, and that no serious claims to it were ever ad- 1 vanced (except by certain later map makers and historians) on the ground of that
purchase.
So much preliminary matter disposed of, Dr. Mowry'devotes his attention to the case of Dr. Whitman, whose going as a
■	missionary into the Western country was brought about (more or less directly) by the visit of certiiin four Indians to Gen. Clark (of the Lewis and Clark expedition) at St. Ijouis. According to pretty well authenticated reports, these Indians came to learn something about the white man's religion. Two of them died in St. Louis; the others returned not much enlightened.
However, in 1835, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (representing Presbyterians and Congre-gat*onalists) sent to Oregon Rev. Samuel Parker and Marcus Whitman, M. D , " to spy out the land.” Whitman returned at oncc for reinforcements. He was a native of Rushville, Yates County. N. Y.. and before going West agafn he married Miss Narr.issa Prentiss of Prattsburg, in the same State. The Rev. Henry H. Spalding and a lady whom the latter had just made his wife and Dr. and Mrs .Whitman made 1 a double wedding journey of the rough I march to the country of the sunset—by way of St. Louis, Fort J^aramie, and Fort Hall. Whitman persisted also in taking a wagon most of the way.	[
By J&42 the number of missionaries : had been increased to a dozen, perhaps, and there was a notion among them that the Indians were profiting fc>y their efforts. But there were bickerings among the good men and the Mission Board had resolved to cut off (tome of the stations. Moreover, Dr. Mowry presents ample evidence to show that Dr. Whitman appreciated the fatness of the land and feared the Hudson Bay Company might get It for England. Already interested persons had got the notion abrt)ad In the East that wagons would not be taken to Oregon. Therefore, in October, 1842, accompanied by a single companion, Whitman set out from his station at Waiilatpu for St. Louis, traveling on account of the season and the state of war between the Sioux and Pawnees southward through Utah and New Mexico, a distance of some 3,000 miles. This journey, in spite of fearful hardships, he accomplished In something under five months. In the Spring he visited Washington, and saw, it seems certain. President

Tyler, upon whom he urged the importance of holding the country—of the value of which both Mr. Tyler and Mr. Webster were then dubious.
Having persuaded his Mission Board also to a more favorable view, and having aided greatly in fretting abroad the Idea that Oregon was both a desirable country and accessible overland from the East, he ,took an Important part in guiding thither in 1843 ar. emigration of about 509 persons —an emigration which put the preponderance of the American influence there beyond question. The book, of course, dwells upon the details of that march, and especially upon Dr. Whitman's engineering feats with the wagons. Then follows the account of the massacre of December, 1847. in which Dr. Whitman and his wife perished.
The volume has copious appendices and is more Interesting to persons with missionary enthusiasm than to those without It.
