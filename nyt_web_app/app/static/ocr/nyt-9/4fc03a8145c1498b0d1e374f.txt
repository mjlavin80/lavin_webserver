Mr, Bettany <hai however, thought. , to smooth the way for reference to them by these -extracts, arranged andclassl-fled by subjects. Thus he’gives us collections of Byxpn's. observations upon himself; of his religious views: of his opinions ot the Hterary Ute; of his estimates of contemporary English poets; of his obiter dicta on the drama, and of his valuation of his friends, ^te has confined himself to making and collating the extracts, without comment, except for an introduction, dealing, with Byron's obligation to Johnson. -	■
This seems trifle far-fetched. Perhaps the real explanation of it Is in the fact mentioned on the title page, that Mr. Bettany is the . editor of *4 Johnson's Table Talk.” Byron filled his correspondence and diaries with more or less accurate citations and allusions from numerous sources—often as not less accurate because, as Mr. Bettany observes, he wrote generally remote from books of reference. The industrious editor has even counted the quotations from Shakespeare in the letters—they are 156 in number, of which 36 are from ** Macbeth.*' This scarcely seems worth the trouble of finding out or of Imparting, under the circumstances. No more does- the fact —14 even more extraordinary M—that the , letters contain excerpts from twenty-two other dramatic authors, Including popular playwrights of the time.
But being so, the several citations from Johnson, more or less point- j ed and more or less obviously cltaUons, are not important enough to merit the detailed consideration Mr. Bettany has ] given them. He has chronicled a good deal of small beer, taking much pains I in his hunt for trifles, as he repeatedly ! discloses with unconscious humor in ] this introduction. Byron wrote once of 1 something that ** Johnson or somebody said of Cleveland.” Mr. Bettany Is pained to confess that having searched the “Life," the “Tour/’ the essay.on j thcs Metaphysical School in “ The Lives | of the Poets,” and the two earliest editions of Cleveland's own poems, he can get no clue to this momentous allu- i sion. We are forced to draw the con- j elusion, which Mr. Bettany did not draw either for himself or his readers, that the remark in Byron’s mind must have been made by " somebody.”
BY HON* S SELF-REVELATION.
THE selections are full of interesting matter for those who wish to approach Byron’s personality in this way. He fully reveals himself; his disagreements with his mother, his own violent temper and the quarrelsome adventures it led him into, his discussions on religion, and, most of all, his frank discussion of his own character are among the most significant things he writes about, and, as is perhaps already well known, are pungent and incisive reading. He talks much of himself and of the popular misconceptions of himself. Thus on one occasion he had a visit from " a Mr. Coolidge of Boston, a very pretty lad, only somewhat too full of poetry and 1 entusy-musy ’
I was very civil to him during his few hours’ Stay, and talked with him much of Irving, whose writings are my delight. But I suspect he did not take quite so much to me, from his having expected to meet a misanthropical gentleman, in wolfskin breeches and answering in fierce monosyllables, instead of a man of this world. 1 can never get people to understand that poetry is the expression of excited passion, and that there is no such thing as a life of passion, any more than a continuous earthquake, or an eternal fever. Besides, who would ever shave themselves in such a state?
And again he writes of poetry:
I by no means rank poetry or poets high In the scale of intellect. This may look like affectation, but it is my real opinion- It fs the lava of the imagina-
