New York Times Saturday Rcvieto of Books:
Being especially interested in the correspondence of “ O. H.” In your issue of Aug. 2fi. and in reply to the inquiry, “ Of all the so-called * poems ’ which have filled space in magazines of late, how many have deserved the name—how many have touched the chord in hearts which ever respond to the touch of true poetry? ” permit me to allude to a poem entitled “ The City Sleeps.” by Charles Mulford Robinson, which appeared in The Outlook of May 6 of this year.
This exquisite gem complies with all the conditions of perfect poetry, according to my conception of what good poetry should be. In its seven stanzas of six lines each every verse is full of vivid imagination, and while the reader is startled by the newness of the thought, there is a suggestion of a soothing influence in almost every line, in complete unison with the subject.
As one gets into appreciative sentiment with the author, and reads and rereads the poem, a hush comes over one's own soul, as if it -v^ould be impossible to render it in the ordinary tones of voice. And in Its*brnate perfectness there is a most delightful simplicity that pervades the lines, leaving- the reader charmed, captivated, and satisfied.
Not having any acquaintance with the gifted poet, I shall not be accused of any personal partiality.
WILLIAM T. BROWNE.
