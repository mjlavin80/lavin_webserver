TOPICS OF T£IE WEEK-
R. MADISON CAWEIN, whose new volume of poems we review this week, is another of the Theodoran poets—honored with brief but favorable mention in that pronunciamento wherein the Pres. Ident of the United States directed th.fi attention of hi3 fellow-cltizens to certain writings in rhyme and blank verse which he admires and, presumably, in his official capacity, commends. Mr. Cawetn, who is a native of Louisville, Ky., and was christened Madison Jul-
-	ins, has now published twenty volume? of verse, beginning in 1887 with " Blooms ol the Berry/' He is 40 years old. It Is novel, refreshing, and, probably, salutary for a President of the. United States to take a hand in the game of literary criticism, and use his influence for the development of literary taste. We have had few literary Presidents. Jefferson had the writing, gift, and Lincoln had a homely fancy for hj'mns. John Quincy Adams, to be sure, set great store by his literary taste and judgment, and once wrote a critique of Shakespeare’s " Othello," in which he set down his idea that Des^e-mona must have been a person of no refinement or she would never have married a black man. But President Roosevelt is the first of all the Presidents to commend the American literature of his own day to his compatriots.
OF the many recent books about London the best to look at Is that called “ The Scenery of London," for which Miss G* E. Mitton, an expert in London lore, furnishes the text, while the pictures are reproductions of painting’s by Herbert Marshall. TKe Macmillan Company publishes this work here. No one painter of London we know of has painted just the London we know. The charm of London is Infinite and no one pair of eyes can ever catch it all There are gradations of tone in the commingling of fog and i mellow sunshine in some of Mr. Mari shall’s pictures that one who has rami
bled about London in all hours and all J seasons immediately recognizes. Doubtless all his pictures—there are seventy-five in all, capitally reproduced in colors—exactly record his own visual impression of the scenes portrayed* The views around St Stephen’s and the Abbey, St. James’s Street, and along , Knightbridge way seem to us partlcu-larly good. Few of us, we fancy, have ever noted the precise mirage effect Mr. Marshall caught one Autumn morning at Mlllbank, with the Victoria tower looming in the background like a giant's castle. Few of us have ever noted the dominating green tones Mr. Marshall sees in viewing Charing Cross * station from the river. All his river views from Limehouse Reach, in Battersea, seem to us unreal. On the other hand his street views, In Chelsea, particularly, strike a responsive note. Miss Mitton discourses agreeably, as is her

THE Plunkltt book. Just published by McClure, Phillips & Co., io a compilation by W. L. Riordan of a series of '* interviews ** with* ’ State Senator George : Washington. Plunkltt, which he has Contributed to various newspapers within the last^ six'years. Mr. Plunkitt is a Tammany district leader, who has grown rich Iii politics, and Is a typical Tammany man, a friend of the needy, and a ward politician of the most approved type* He is represented to these pages as a voluble talker, frank to an amazing degree. Yet there is no real frankness about it. Mr. Plunkitt tells neither Mr. Riordan nor any one else things pertaining to his calling that are not common property. Nor is Plunkitt fts-sentially voluble. Remember that this book (chiefly noteworthy as a speci- * men ot Irish-American humor, Plunkitt via Riordan,) represents the Dumpings of six years. Charles F. Murphy contributes a discreet and reticent introduction in the manner of one who has not read the book and does not intend to read it. M Plunkitt of Tammany Hall ” will do no harm to Tammany Hall.

A READER, struck by the reply In our Queries department last week to a question touching literature of the Egyptian Sphinx, that the monument had inspired no great body of writings* reminds us that, Indeed, it did inspire a wonderful chapter in Kinglake’s wonderful ** Eothen.” The passage In that record ot imprest sions of Oriental travel beginning with the sentence ** And near the pyramids,. more wondrous and more awful than all else in the land of Egypt, there sits, the Sphinx,” Is equal to the best In a book which was hailed with acclaim on its appearance in 1844 as the best of its kind ever written. Alexander William Kinglake wrote no other book save this and his monumental " Invasion of the Crimea,” which was almost as enthusiastically received, making allowances, of course, for political- bias. It Is said that he rewrote his " Eothen ” four times before he was willing to give it to the public. The result Justified the labor. Alison, in his " History of Europe," treats the publication of the book as a historical event. Probably no description of a battle In all literature surpasses ICinglake’s chapter on Inkermann in ’* The Invasion of the Crimea.”
THE often iterated theory that the English novel is on its last legs has Just found fresh expression In The Boston Herald. The writer of an editorial article in that journal considers that the form of the novel has been overworked and that a new hour of triumph for the drama is at hand. Being naturally fond of change, we should warmly welcome such an agreeable literary revolution. But we cannot see the signs of Its coming. The novel as a form seems more popular than ever. There is much talk of new vitality in the literary form of the drama, but it still seems to be all talk.

11/I R. CLEMENT SHORTER, writing IV' 1' In The Sphere of London, prophesies a'change In the relations of British and American publishers. HlUierto, or until recently, prominent ^American publishers visited London at least once every year, (or sent agents to represent them there,) to look over the field and negotiate for M American rights/' In the fact th^t neither Mr. Charles Scribner nor Mr. Frank Dodd saw fit to go to London this year Mr. Shorter sees an omen. The London publishers, hereafter, must go yearly to New York, he thinks, in order to keep abreast with the times. To be sure, Mr. Putnam, Col, Harvey, and some other American publishers of reasonable prominence went to London this year as usual, but how can one ever form a theory if he Is to be bothered by facts which do not support it? Moreover, Mr. Arthur Spurgeon, of Cassells, is coming to New York and Boston for two whole weeks this Autumn. That ought to prove something.
THE literature of the good game of golf, which was already rich and full of profitable reading, has been notably increased by the publication of Harry Vardon’s book, ” The Complete Golfer/’ (McClure, Phillips
&	Co.) Vardon’s manner of writing is as straightforward and interesting as
I
his manner of playing golf, and he is probably the best of living golfers. Cer- ! talnly he is the most conspicuous these ! days, and some of his most recent play has been extraordinary. Doubtless, in writing his book, he has had valuable 1 assistance from Mr. Henry Leach, to I whom he gives credit In a preface. Besides the chapters descriptive of the game there is a brief. Interesting blog- J raphy. Vardon was born on the Island of Jersey, and was seven years old when the Royal Jersey Golf Club established Its links over the moorlands near his father’s cottage. He was a
caddy, at first, and made rude clubs
i ‘
fpr himself, which he used over a course of four fifty-yard holes, laid out
,by-himself . and his fellows, with big
marbles for golf boils. ■ He never had a lesson In golf, but formed hia style by watching the'play ofothers. - But his style Is all hts^own. Vardon is a golf
■" - • genius. His bock Is reserved for extended .review.

Is “'Sonnets and Songs/’ hy Helen Hay Whitney, (Harpers.) A new and welcome volume of verse by Richard Watson Gilder, entitled ” In ‘ the Heights/* will |>e published by the Century Company week after next. Among the poems, hitherto unpublished, will be these three stanzas, called '* The Light That Lies on the Far flier Hills’*:
The clouds upon the mountains rest,
A gloom is on the Autumn day;
But down the valley, Irt the west;
1 The hidden sunlight breaks its'way—
A light lies on the farther hills.
Forget thy sorrow, heart of mine;
Though shadows fall and fades the . leaf,
Somewhere Is joy, though *t is not thine;	-
The power that sent can heal thy grief:
And light Ilea on the farther hills.
Thou wouldst not with the world be one	, - .
If ne’er thou knewest hurt and wrong;	.
Take comfort though the darkened sun
Never again bring gleam or song— , The light lies on tlie farther hills.
THAT Is surely a prodigious subject for a single book which, according to our cable, dispatches from London this week, Mr. T. H. S. Escott, author of ** Social Transformations of the Victorian Age/’ has Just taken up. The influence of ** the country house ’’ in England in national movements, including politics, In literature, philanthropy, and other fields, has from time immemorial been tremendously potent, because, from the beginning of England, the country house has been the typical English home, the seat of its comforts, the birthplace of its ideals. Conspiracies without number have been hatched. Governments have been doomed, great charitable movements planned, famous books inspired and written, famous pictures painted in English country houses. How can one readable book comprehend more than one small phase of the subject, say the present vital influence upon British politics and finance exerted In social “ week-end" gatherings In country houses? Rut Mr. Escott is fond of huge subjects. The title of one of his best known books is “England: Its People, Polity, and Pursuits.” Mr. Escott was long a leader writer for London’s chief Tory newspaper, The Standard, and he succeeded John Morley as editor of The Fortnightly Review.
