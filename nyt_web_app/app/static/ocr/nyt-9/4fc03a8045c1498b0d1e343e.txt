■	New York Times Saturday RevUtw of Books: t I would, like to say " in answer to the question of E. D. W*t Point Pleasant* N.
| Y., that I think the rendering " Christ of the seven wounds/’ as printed In the earlier editions of Mrs. Browning’, is probably the correct one, for undoubtedly Christ did receive seven wounds at the time of the Crucifixion—first, the scourging on the back, which, we are told, . was very severe, and, undoubtedly, drew „blood; the blow on the .head, where afterward the sharp thorns were set; the pierced side, and the wounds of the nails in hands and feet. Here are the seven wounds. As for the rendering seven ** words ” of Christ, it seems to my mind to controvert, or do away with, Mrs. Browning’s meaning completely, for the thought is, I suppose, that the wounded and insulted Christ could, because of His suffering, enter more larjgely and sympathetically into the sufferings and sorrows of humanity.
