John Hay as a Novelist—Timrod’s Us say—The Success of Sir Wemyss Reid's Autobiography.
HE CENTURY for September has an eloquent tribute to John Hay. It lauds his literary work. It speaks of his success in journalism, of his achieving “ true poetry,” of his joint authorship of " one of the most important biographies ever.written,” and quotes Clarence King’s glowing words about ** Castilian Days.’’ B«t about John Hay as a novelist it says never a word! Is not this silence illuminating? Everybody else in reviewing the late Secretary’s lit* J erary career has spoken of him either as the author j oi " The Breadwinners '* or as one to whom its authorship has been generally and plausibly attributed- It will be remembered that this remarkable novel first appeared as a serial story in The Century, whose editor haS been pledged ever since not to reveal its author. Is he still keeping that pledge.? It is hard to think of any other reason for avoiding “ The Breadwinners ” in touching, ever so briefly, von John Hay as a literary artist.
