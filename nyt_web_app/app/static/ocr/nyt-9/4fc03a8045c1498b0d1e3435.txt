London and Florence are. called. . Mr. Geddie lacks 'Hare's lightness of touch; but he knows Edinburgh from - the Grassmarket to. Holyrood, and ^rom the Water of Lelih to Caltoh Hill, and beyond, and his book Is, as he says, one which a reader 14 can conveniently take with hinv Vjij his walks or profitably pe-.w -ruse by the fireside.t -	.	..
Within a comparatively few years-Edinburgh has attained a new lease of life, and has spread out in all directions, ^ot only that but she has grown even within her former limits; old rookeries have been destroyed,* and new buildings put up in their stead; streets have been driven through* tumbledown buildings, and the . fitful ~ Scots^ sunlight allowed to enter where It had not .gone for centuries. la these Improvements, age and fame have ha^d to rn^ke way for the needs of to-day; , and It -is.- to rescue the' memory of the famous building*'Of Old Edinburgh that Mr. Geddie has made'his book.
V
He,has to be historical, but no one can thai; <rft£r? a man says “ yesterday ** he Is. relating hlstoqr.* Mr.* Geddie starts his /* waiks”■ on the North Bridge, thfc bridge whose construction is the date •point’ of • modem -Edinburgh, though it was erected as long ago tf-s 1772. It ‘wa* the - first ' permanent breach in the wall < * * * ^ - ‘ 1 ■ ’ ‘ . which had confined the city within narrow limits and caused it to have the first real skyscrapers of history—buildings fourteen stories high, until' our own time pointed out and lectured on as marvels of architecture. •	.
From the North Bridge we pass to the High Street. *' From its first beginnings -the heart of Edinburgh has beat In its High Street * * * It was not only the ’ centrc and chief part, It was Old Edinburgh Town itself. To this day the ground on which the High Street stands carries more houses and population, and perhaps more history and romance, than' any other Corresponding area in Europe. ** The High Street begins practically at the gate of Edinburgh Castle, and runs eastward down the hill to the Caoon-gate, and thence, under a different name, to.the palace of Holyrood House. On the High Street stands St. Gileses Church, the cathedral of Sftote Presbyteriahism; tack of that is the Parliament House, now the law courts, where many, if not most, of the great English lawyers practiced before they went over the border to get fame arocng the Southrons. On the High Street Cardinal Beaton nearly lost his life In a street fray 400 years ago. Mary Stuart and ‘ King ’ Darnley sought refuge in a High Street house; the Admirable Crichton lived in an alley off the street; Dr. Hugh Blair and * Bozzy * and his father lived in Burnet's Clode; the ' Sotemn-League and Covenant * was signed in Covenant Close, off the High; the street for its full length, and for the alleys, closes, and wynds on either side, is peopled by the memnry of more famous men than any similar spot in Europe.

The High Street stops legally at the Netherbow. because there Edinburgh legally ended. Bey.ond it lay the Borough of the Canongate, with its own parish church and Tolbooth. It Is the Tolbooth of the Canongate that is accepted now as the Tolbooth of Scott’s "Midlothian”; but the jail of his novel stood next to St. Giles, and was destroyed eighty years ago. It was the Heart of Midlothian; and an open square near the Parliament buildings marks its site. The Canongate was the Court quarter of Old Edinburgh, and enjoyed the right of sanctuary, so that courtiers and Cutthroats, nobles and' beggars, rubbed elbows In its narrow streets. Not until 1856 was the last vestige ct Canongate hoine rule abolished, and the borough, after sev*n centuries, made a ward of the city of Edwin^
In the Canongate lived James Ballan-tyije, Scott’s publisher; Lord Monboddo, Toby Smollett, Lord Chancellor Seafield, -tire Marquis of Huntly,- Kitty, Duchess

I of Buccleugh and Queensberry; Sir David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes, Lord Kamos: there is little choice between Canongate and Old Edinburgh when It comes to matching the worthies of one against those ol the other.
*•*
On both sides of the backbone formed by the High Street and the Canongate,
I Edinburgh has stretched itself out. The new town, beyond Princes Street, has a literary history as great as that of the old town, though it dates only from 17i2; but, of course, Its political history is not so long. It was in the new town, however, that the greatest event in modern Scottish history occurred, the disruption in the Established Church nearly sixty years ago. Scott, Brewster. Sydney Smith, Brougham, Jeffrey, lived in the New Town. All of Edinburgh, then, is alive with memories of soldiers and kings, of queens and fair ladies, of priests and wrfters; we think Mr. Geddie might extend his phrase and say that not merely the High Street, but Edinburgh “ carries perhaps more history and romance than any corresponding area in Europe.

The photographs for which Mr. Geddie is thankful are the commonest sort of pictures of the city. They are few and not particularly typical; better ones could have been bought for a shilling apiece. And why does Mr. Geddie do all he can to ruin an excellent book by leaving out a map? Not all his headers are Edinburgh men or women. Ttot everybody can recall the exact lay of the land, even if he has lived and moved and had his being in the city, lo! these many years ago. A map is needed—a map or plan, such as Baedeker prints in his guide books. That, and either no photographs or better ones, would make Mr. Geddie’s a well-nigh perfect hand book to Auld Reekie.
