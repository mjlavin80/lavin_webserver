LOST in a London fog—though the scene is chiefly Canada—the details of this story emerge but dimly and brokenly. However, there is a girl named Gretehen and a youth named Karl. ICarl's father is mad, (to all appearance,) keeps a shop where nails are sold, and is-continually saving up (in a gray sock) money ho owes to Gretchen’s grandfather, who is also mad, and a Colonel. Karl goes over seas to fight at Waterloo and falls into the company of a certain Capt. Jennings, in whom upon the instant you smell a villain. The whole course of his villainy it were hopeless to trace even with the author’s ^text before you—but he was a dazzler of women and came near getting lovely Gretehen for his wife. When Karl (who was studious) wrote a play Jennings stole it and was famous—till Karl wrote another play and won fame also. Poor Gretehen ^ets knocked over the head by cruel officers of the law, her grandfather behaves like the Bedlamite he'is, and there are swearings upon crossed swords and threats of a breach of promise suit, and readings of Goethe and gatherings of wild flowers in the fields. In short, it’s a maze without a clue. Perhaps the author enjoyed writing the nondescript thing, and perhaps he knows what it Is about. To the man who reads it’s all mad as a hatter.
