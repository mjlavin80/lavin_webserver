DST readers of " ^elixthat remarkable bookby Robert •Hichens dealing with an episode in the life of a typical, self-satisfied youth, and involving, a study of the effects of the morphine habit, have doubtless felt that one* of the few passages in it not convincingly veracious and u realistic ** was that relating to the School of Journalism on a side street off the Strand, in London. The eloquent, amiable preceptor seemed a creature out of one of the vague and artificial comedies of H.
J. Byron. The proceedings' in the classroom seemed to have been conceived in a mood of Irresponsible gayety. Yet we find in The London Academy a statement that the journalism school which Felix attended actually existed. Perhaps we ought to have known this
i before. The tone of The Academy's
i
writer indicates that the identification I is no new thing—in London literary clr-! cles. The original of Mr. Hichens's teacher of journalism was “ the late David Anderson of The Daily Tele-i graph/* and his school was in Outer Temple Chambers. His invariable fee was 100 guineas, payable in advance. The Academy declares that “ none of the pupils would admit that David Anderson ever did anything for them except smoke cigars in one room while
%
they smoked cigarettes in another/’ But some of them prospered in the field of journalism. Mr. Hichens was one of the pupils, and the prototype of his own Felix to that extent. Francis Gribble and Herbert Vivian, English journalists of distinction, were others. The Academy tells us that in the chapters of “Felix” relating to the school, "fact is very closely followed. Even ! ‘ the Babe * in the subterranean restaurant had a real corporeal existence. ' One of the pupils got engaged to her.*’
