TOJE BABONET BAGriCKEB. A Story of Love and Adventure. By Charles 8. Cootn. 12mo. Boston:	The C. M. Clark
Publishing Company.
EVERT now and then somebody writes another Enoch Arden story. Here is
one in which the woman plays tlie part of Enoch. Aa a curiosity in novel making as practiced in a commercial age the work of Mr. Charles S. Coom might furnish the material for an extended essay. The book represents an attempt to tell how a young man, son of a Baronet, married the rector's daughter against the parental will, and was spirited away by a jealous gypsy maid in such a fashion as to leave the wife under the impression that her husband was dead and the man under the impression that his wife was dead. She mourned at home. He
left the gypsy, went off to South America and married again:	then,	learning the
truth, came back disguised mysteriously as a ragpicker. The author arranges, too, for the ladies to meet and admire each other, and represents both as eager to be the sacrifice.
There is a fellow, too, who tries to drown two ladies in order to inherit their ! estates, and a page lost out of the parish register, as well as suits in chancery wfth a trial scene and a jury—and a procedure which would leave any gentleman learned in the laws and customs of the British realm aghast and pale.
