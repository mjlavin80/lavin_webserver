O	write in. a single volume the history of new France from its	beginning to	the
year 1H03, when France withdrew finally from the mainland of North America. Is a task of no ordinary difficulty. Francis Parkman devoted twelve volumes and many	years lo	the	f&bjecL,	and
critical investigation	has	brought	to	J
light much	unknown	even	to that great	!
historian. Prof. Thwaites is the first Uv- ! mg authority on New France; a glance at the final chapter on the bibliography will show the immense research on which he has based this volume. Besides covering Parkman's ground. Prof. Thwaites follows the fortunes of the French in Louisiana after it was ceded to Spain in 1762,
" The story of the rise and fall of New France,” he says, " is the most dramatic chapter in American history,** and his work is mainly from the narrative side. There is no very extended study of social institutions or tlie governmental system of New France. What little there is comes in chapter VTIL on “ The People of New France.** While this absence of much information concerning the French political system in America will disappoint the reader who consults the volume with this subject chiefly in view, It should be remembered that an extensive study of internal conditions in New France, which virtually collapsed in 17G3. would be out of place in a history of “ The American Nation." Prof. Thwaite*s purpose has been to write the history of New France from the standpoint of relationship with the British colonies.
The three fields of French colonizing activity on the mainland of North America were the Acadian Peninsula, the Valley of the St. Lawrence, and the Valley of the Mississippi. The result of their adventure was the settlement of Acadia. Canada, and Louisiana. “ Various motives,” says Prof. Thwaites. “ contributed to the establishment and maintenance of New France. The King naturally was moved by a passion for territorial expansion; the Church was eager to convert the heathen savages of the New World; the fur trade, although abounding in great risks, was at times sO profitable as to stimulate the cupidity of merchants; the hope of finding deposits of precious metals was predominant in the minds of speculators; the army and the navy were ambitious for gallant exploits; and the French people in general were in that eventful period imbued with a generous yearning for adventure in strange lands." The fascinating story of the Acadlans Is told In Chapter II- These people, neglected by France and constantly exposed to frontier attacks, were compelled to shift for themselves, and developed characteristics all their own. They were greatly annoyed by what Prof- Thwaites calls *■ fussy French, officialism." In Chapter
V.	the French settlements in Louisiana and the Illinois region are described. Having shown how the French power was set up in America, Prof. Thwaites has to re-lnte the rivalry between It and the English and explain how their claims conflicted. The Inevitable struggle, taking the form of the Intercolonial wars of the eighteenth century, was terminated in 1763 by the peace of Paris. The story of the seven years* war fills nearly one-half of Pror. Th waites* $ volume. Parkman’s delightful -narrative of the struggle between Montcalm and Wolfe is compressed into two brief chapters, in which, of
■	course, only the'Salient events can be no-tlced-
During the negotiations leading up to the treaty of Paris it was argued that it J would be poor policy for England to ucr ‘ quire Canada. Some of "her far-sighted statesmen realized that the -British colo-niea would be Ukely to revolt if the French menace were removed. Franklin’s assurance that inter-colonial jeal-
■	oiisies would prevent the colonies from “ uniting in any event had a decided effect : in causing the Knglish Commissioners to
require the cession of Canada*
The cession .of Louisiana by Louis XV.
■	to Charles m, of Spain was accepted- at’ Madrid with some reluctance. Notxklj*
j seemed to want the vast region west' of
the Mississippi. France was tired of it; it was offered to England, but she declined it, preferring Florida. Charles III. was not overanxious to assume control of Louisiana, and two years elapsed before his first Governor arrived. The boundaries of Louisiana remained vague throughout the period of Spanish occupation. The province was slowly .incorporated into the Spanish colonial system and governed by a Governor General. The number of Spaniards was never large, and they were almost wholly confined to the official and military classes. The volume closes with a very brief account of the retrocession of Louisiana by Charles EV. to Napoleon and the cession of it by the latter to the United States in 1S03.	✓
Prof. Thwaites, while hardly possessed of a fascinating- style, is always readable. His work is brief, clear, and always to the pofnt.	R* L. S.
