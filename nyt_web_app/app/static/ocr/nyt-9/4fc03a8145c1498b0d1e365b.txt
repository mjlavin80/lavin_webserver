Something: About the Real Joe Beef and Some Queer Montreal Epitaphs.
27ew Tori'ITImes Saturday Review of Books:
EADERS of your Book Review artd of Appletons* Booklovers* Magazine who saw in the August number of the latter ** The Passing of Joe Beef," and in i*our issue of Aug. 19 the protest oZ a. Montreal correspondent, may be interested to know something further of that unique character, Joe Beef. That he was
a very real live tnan is well proved to any
traveler looking over and going through
that most beautiful Canadian city. From the height of Mount Royal, reached by a broad, winding carriage road, and also by trolley cars, unless one chooses to take the little car up the steep incline of the mountainside, lies spread out the whole city, its masses of brick and granite half | concealed by the wealth of - foliage. Beyond spires and domes and wharves sweeps and circles the broad St. Lawrence. with hill and mountain and meadow against the horizon. Half way up the ascent, on one side is Mount Royal Cemetery, and there, if one turns a little aside from the broader paths, half hidden by a tangle of long grasses and untrimmed bushes, he will discover an old white marble stone, with an urn on top and the figure of a mother kneeling by^
the side of a sleeping babo.	!
This is the grave of Margaret McBae and child, the first wife of Joe Beef, who died in 1S71. There is also a Scotch granite slab marking the burial place of a little son. Frederick, some distance back of the larger red Scotch granite monument with cross on top. where lie the remains of eccentric Joe Beef. The three quaint epitaphs as verified by the writer three years ago, are as follows;

Sueli was the departed on* wo mourn.
Dear to us all, cherish*1-! he his name. Eternal pleasun- i oi«ns where he has gone; Our loss is great, but oh. how great Ills gain.
Full many a man of wealth and power H:is die! and pone before.
Who scorned to grive a poor man bread Wiien he stood at his door.
But .100 took in the great unwashed. Who shared his humble fare;
He n.ade thfir life a merry one Without a thought or carp.
Their eves arp dim for loss of him;
The ir piiff is quite sincr-n-;
He housed them from the Winter blast AmJ filled them wtih good cheer.
And when the day of reckoning comes.
As come ft docs to all.
Such si mere mourners they'll not have ilehind their fumral pall.
