OE worth the day, that any father presents his son with Mr. Arthur Stringer's "Lonely O'Malley **! The author's conception of boy is purely Spencerian, and he has given Lonely the ethical code of an Apache, minus re sped for his elders* With him stealing is meritorious in exact proportion to the care with which the stolen article is guarded; truth is precious and must be hoarded; fighting is an everpresent duty and joy; girls are the appointed satellites of boys and are to be kidnapped whensoever necessary to the perfection of a game; adults, male or female. kindred or alien, are obstacles to the proper conduct of life, preventing reversions to troglodyte condition, piracy, vivisection, and many another joy. Spencerian also is Mr. Stringer’s view of the boy In religious ecstasy, wildly desirous of pre-eminence in sin, and absolutely unaffected by his professed remorse, but what cares the real boy for Spencerian views? He will resent not only the text of the book, but Mr. Frank T. Merrill’s pen-an-ink drawings, In which his mock heroism and mock sanctimony appear in the absurdity so hateful to a boy, so pitiful to a man. There will be no difficulty In persuading hoys to leave the hook to adults, in spite of its place on the list of Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., and adults will enjoy it, both text and pictures. All the world loves a bad boy*
With “ Lonely O’Malley,” to-morrow will bring1 Miss Abbie Farwell Brown's " Star Jewels ” and Mrs. Persia Mather's "The Councils of a Worldly Godmother,"
from which It appears that Old Gorgon Graham has no monopoly of common sense among correspondents, and that, in spite of Elizabeth and her family, a worldling is not necessarily an unsuitable adviser for the young person.
Mr. C. William Beebe's Two Bird Lovers in Mexico " also comes to-morrow, and the six volumes of the limited large paper edition of ** The English Works of George Herbert ’* and Prof. Norton’s " The Love Poems of John Donne/* Only 150 copies of the former and 535 of the latter will be' printed. - Both 'ire -valuable in their matter, the former* having prefaces explanatory, critical, and biographical, and the latter including Improved new readings from manuscripts owned by Mr. Norton, but they arc. of course, especially prepared for the bibliophile.

A bird book innocent of science, and making no effort to dccide between Mr. Burroughs and Mr. Long, an utterly unprincipled bird book which does not even give a name to all its birds, is a pleasant novelty, and such Is Mrs. Caroline Crown-inshield Bascom’s " The Bird Hospital," published by Messrs, H. M. Caldwell & Co. It is illustrated by photographs of the author and her birds and by remarkable groups of birds and cats, and the author records some very interesting observations.
The second of tTiis firm’s " Value M gift books for the season is the late Frederic Lawrence Knowles’s “The Value of Courage," and it has a brief introductory essay from his pen. He complains of the lack of the note of courage in American literature, seeing a great opportunity for a new writer of power and originality, but he found it sounded by a sufficient number of authors to give him at least half the material for his book, and declared that he should be satisfied- if his readers gained half the stimulus from It that he received in its preparation.
Miss Amanda M. Douglas’s " Helen Grant at Aldred House," the third in the series, is less a story book than a reversion to the pleasant old English type in whlch^tnow ledge was imparted in conversations. The publishers are Messrs. Lee & Shepard.

The author or “ Broke of Covenden." Mr. J. C. Snaith, has completed another novel, his ninth. It will be published by Messrs. Herbert B. Turner & Co.

Messrs. Little. Brown & Co. have two novels ready for Monday—Mrs. Mary Farley Sanborn’s " Lynette and the Congressman," and Anne Warner’s " The Rejuvenation of Aunt Mary.*’ Lynette does not in the least resemble the original bearer of her name, the lady with the slender nose, ,£ip‘tllted, but is, thanks to the example of her gay, careless Southern father, somewhat impatient of the " soft, gentle,
creeping chlTl of respectability" emanating from her New England mother. She is a department clerk and meets.the’second personage of the story under uncommon: circumstances, leading to a series;of
** The Ballingtons ” by ** Frances Squire,” that is, Mrs, Frances Boardman Squire Potter, assistant professor of English at the University of Minnesota, and wife of Mr. W. Scott Potter, formerly of Brooklyn. She was born in Elmira, and educated in Elmira College, and is well known not only In Minneapolis, where she has lived since her marriage, but throughout the Northwest. She is now spending a year’s leave of absence in Cambridge, England, with her children. " The Iiallingtons " is her first book.
*♦*
Mrs. Sanborn is known in Boston, where she is now living, as the author of " Sweet and Twenty." " It Came to Pass," “ Paula Ferris," and " The Revelation of Herself." Her first book was completely rewritten before publication, for with uncommon docility, she accepted the opinion of a literary woman who told her that no alteration would make her book what she desired it to be, but added; "You make your characters real, not lay figures; that is a great power."
Messrs. Dana Estes & Co. have ready " The Music Lovers’ Treasury," by Mrs. Helen Philbrook Patten, a companion to " The Art Lovers* Treasury." It includes poems about musical instruments, poems addressed to composers, and poems describing the effect of music. Milton, Shakespeare, Dryden, and nearly all the lesser poets would be Included in a complete collection of this sort, to say nothing of translations and of the work of American poets, and Mrs, Patten was able to choose fastidiously in making the book, which is bound and boxed in holiday fashion.
Mr. Trowbridge has been in town this week, apparently not in the least dismayed by having celebrated his seventy-seventh birthday Sept. 17 and 18. It is good that a few of the literary men of the days before the war survive to fill
the places of those whom Lowell lamented, and really the old guard which has neither died nor surrendered is still
a noble body.

The new edition of " Ramona " was exhausted before publication, and seems to promise well for Mr. Seth K. Humphrey's -" The Indian Possessed,” also published by Messrs. Little, Brown & Co. This volume not only accuses the Governmcil of bad faith, describing- the treatment of the Umatillas, Nez Pereas, Poncas, and the Mission Indians, but shows the popular disposition by an eloquent description of the scenes at the opening of the Cherokee strip. Those are familiar to~ all magazine readers, but in fiction the prowess of the best rider has been the topic, regardless of the widespread greed actuating that mad race for the first choice of land. Mr. Humphrey adds a chapter on the Rosebud Reservation, and lastly offers an explanation of the persistence of viclousncps in the white man's treatment of the red man.
