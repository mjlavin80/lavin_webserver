MDCH space has been devoted in *' The Polariscope In the Chemical Laboratory: An Introduction to Polar-imetry and Its Applications,” by George 1 WUliam Rolfe of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to the methods in use In sugar manufacture, but also those used I in brewing, the starch Industries, und food and drug analysis as well. A sketch is given of the use of the polariscope in pure science, in view of the great possi* bill ties of the instrument in the field. The author’s chief aim is, however, to present the subject in such a way that the book might prove a material aid in extending the use of the polariscope in general laboratory practice.
Mr, Kolfe writes from an experience covering nearly twenty years as technJc^J chemist in the sugar houses ot the Weist Indies, in the glucose industry of the West, and as a teacher of polarimetrlc methods. He describes the- polariscope, the sacchari meter, the accuracy of the latter’s measurements, the methods of
sugar houses and refineries, chemical methods of determining sugars, and closes with a couple of chapters on the application of the polariscope in scientific research and to chemical analysis,
The book contains, besides many filu^ trations and diagrams, a list of tables, a bibliography, and a comprehensive index.
It bears the Imprint of the Macmillan Company.	'
