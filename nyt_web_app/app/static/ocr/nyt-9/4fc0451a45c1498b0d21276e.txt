THE record of the industrial progress of the United States, writes Prof. Katharine Coman of Wellesley College, in her prcface to '* The Industrial History of'the United States/’ bearing the Imprint of the Macmillan Company, may be rendered no less intelligible and Interesting to the average student than the development of political forms. Business methods are more familiar than military tactics, and a mechanical. invention is more readily comprehended than a constitutional revision." It is the aim of her book to bring the essential elements of the economic history of this country within the grasp of the average reader, and she has also adapted it for high school and college students. Prof. Coman writes in her preface:
The history of the United States, more than that of any Old World country, is the record of its physical achievements. The exploitation of virgin territory by a race of extraordinary intelligence, resource. and energy is the essential theme of our National history. Political events and social changes are conditioned on industrial evolution, and the story of America can be comprehended only in the light of her material aspirations and attainments. The advance of agriculture from the pioneer farm to the bonanza ranch, the expansion of manufactures consequent on the substitution of machinery and factory organization for the domestic handicrafts, the service rendered to commerce by steam, the telegraph, electricity—these are tbe really potent factors in the history of the united States.
There are many illustrations in halftone in the book, as well as a number of maps and diagrams, and, besides the authorities given in the margins, the boo* Is supplied with a list of books and their authors for the general reader.
