» THE FOURTH FOLIO.
Some Curious and Interesting Peculiarities of a Shakespearean Fac Simile.*
Published by Arrangement with The London
Times.
SS than two years ago the Clarendon Press Issued their admirably executed fac simile reprint of the first folio edition of Shakespeare's plays. Messrs, Methuen are now issuing fac simile editions of all fcrur, of which the last.^jjr 1G85, folio is the first to make its appearance. Tho remaining three, 1625,	1G32, and
16&4, are, we are told, '* In active preparation/' so that by an early date the spirited subscriber who is content to dedicate the price of a new bicycle (twelve
guineas) to Shakespearean textual appar-
i .
| atus may be the proud possessor of the
i four famous folio volumes, workmanly
i bound in gray boards and canvas, '* per-
feet ” in the bibliographer’s sense, and
j ** clean *’ beyond the avarice of the wild-
| est collector. That the complete series of seventeenth century issues of Shakespeare should be fac similled has for many years, we doubt not, been the dream of the ardent Shakespearean; many have expressed with the utmost earnestness their emphatic feeling that this was a thing that ought to be done If the country had any sense of obligation to the first of its authors.
But it was always regarded as a counsel of perfection, and when a counsel of perfection is suddenly carried into effect one is apt to experience a very curious return to one’s self. From repeating with a parrot-like iteration “ Of course it ought to be done ” one suddenly discovers one’s self In the act of Inquiring “ Cui bono? ”	“	Was	it	really	worth while? ” or
" Is not this kind of thing being a little overdone?" There is no doubt that these fac simile volumes are very handsome productions, and it is pleasant to think that such books should exist. It is hardly relevant, perhaps, to reflect in this place that the number of people qualified to use such elaborate apparatus for the textual study of Shakespeare is extraordinarily small, or that by the irony of fate such students as would find them invaluable in the work of collation to which they are habituated are almost invariably much too poor to possess them, or again, that there are very few libraries in England possesssing a Shakespearean section strong enough to make a work of this kind i indispensable; but one cannot refrain, ! one ought not, perhaps, to refrain from expressing a disquieting suspicion that these multiplied fac similes are but one symptom of many pointing to a determined attempt by a too exclusively pedantic , school of workers to capture and preserve 1 for their own particular use the great and i glorious field of English literature of the age of Shakespeare—a school of measurers, ^ collators, and bibliographers, who attach an undue weight of importance to the mint and anise and cummin of commas and stops, of colophons and headlines, of capitals and italics, who discover a profound meaning in a wrong pagination, are staggered by the substitution of an “e” for an apostrophe, and suffocated by the omission of a letter which has for upward of two centuries been voted redundant by acclamation.
THE difficulty of tlie ordinary reader's appreciation of this particular fac j simile of the Folio of 1CST* is increased I by the total absence of any foreword, preface, or introduction, however brief, to the handiwork of printer and photographer. Before attempting to scale such a hard mountain of text the prudent reviewer naturally looks around for an experienced guide. No such guide being forthcoming, he has to plod on alone with very little prospect, as far as we can discover, of any reward at all commensurate with his pains.
The Influence of the Fourth Folio has, we imagine, been greater than is ordinarily ,supposed. and for this reason—that Rowe, tlie first critical editor of Shakespeare, in 1700. from a very human and fallible supposition that tlie text being more recent than that of the previous issues would be less archaic, easier, and more correct, (eheu!) made it the basis of his text—the text which labor-saving editors ever since have preferred to the original. To this unfortunate folio, In consequence, we verily believe, are due at least a half of tho traditional errors in the eighteenth century texts of Shakespeare. Another peculiarity o[ the Fourth Folio is the greasy enhanced number of capital letters employed in the text. The use of capitals in the First Folio is an interesting point, and we have convinced ourselves thaC* to some slight extent at any rate, they represent a manuscript usage of the author himself, and were

The effect, of course, ^uld necessarily bo very much blurred by the casual methods of correcting copy which seem to have been employed in Jaggard’s printing house. However, this | may be, the formidable increase, of cap-i Itals in the Fourth Folio is a noteworthy^ factr though It Is quite clear to us that it represents ^merely the evolution of typographical rules with regard to large and smallvtype, and has no further significance, its Mr. Paton In his " Hamnet Shakespeare ” would have us believe.

A FURTHER examination of the Fourth Folio brings into prominence mainly the great gulf that exists between the First Folio and its successors in respect to authority. The three later folios were in no sense new editions, carefully overlooked by a competent scholar; they were merely what we should now call booksellers' reprints, and as far as we have been able to discern they represent the steady degeneration of a text which is-sure to ensue unless it be supervised with the diligence which scholarly training and love for the subject matter can alone supply.
The errors of the Fourth Folio commence <Sn the title page, where the author's name Is docked of its final "£/’ several of the capital “ s’s ’* are inverted, and to the originaLcomedies, histories, and tragedies are added “ seven plays never- before printed in folio, viz.: 'Pericles Prince of Tyre/ * The London Prodigal/ 4 The History of Thomas Lord Cromwel/ ‘ Sir John Oldcastle Lord Cobham/ 1 The Puritan Widow/ 1A Yorkshire Tragedy/
*	The Tragedy of Locrinc/ " As a mattef" of fact these plays had all been printed in folio previously—in the second impression of the Third Folio, (1CG4.) The only improvement th^t we can discover in the Fourth Folio as compared with its distinguished predecessor of 1025 is that the pagination is somewhat more regular, and that the " catalogue ” of contents has been amended so as to include “ Troylus and Cresslda " among the tragedies. The punctuation and spelling are to a certain extent modernized—thus, “ hee " becomes " he,'’	“ sodrtine ” becomes “ suddain/*
“ strook ” is altered to “ struck/’ " far-' wel ” to ** farewel," " peece " to " piece,"
“ adoe” to "ado/’ and so on; but no attempt is made to repair the omission of a proper division into acts and scenes.
WEiEN we come to detail, the variations of the Fourth Folio' will be found to be in almost every case nothing more nor less than imprints. In order to convince the reader of this we give, as an example of these variations, the main discrepancies between 1G25 and 1GS3 in two of the most familiar scenes in the plays— the first scene in "Hamlet" and “Actus Primus" of “ Much Ado/’ The Fourth Folio begins badly, for the very title of Hamlet is misprinted, thus *' Hamlet Rpinee of Denmark!’’ In the edition of 11RI3 Francisco says, " You come most carefully upon your hour." The Fourth Folio changes this to “ chearfully." Horatio, speaking of the ghost, says, ** Such was the very Armour he had on.” The I later imprint murders the line by omit! ting ‘‘very/* Three lines later Horatio says,
I “ He smot the sledded Pollax on tlie Ice.” Folio Four confused the meaning grievously by printing “ Poleaxe.” In the very next line Marcellus says, ** Thus twice before, and just at this dead lioure.” The Fourth Folio modernizes ^!) this to
11	same hour.” Turning now to " Much Ado.”_^ In line seven Leonato says, "A victorie Is twice itselfe when the atch-lever brings home full numbers/' In lCSo numbers becomes number." Later on Don Pedro, in thanking Leonato for his hospitality, remarks “ You embrace your charge too willingly.” The later edition confuses the meaning again by printing “ more willingly.” Toward tlie end of the scene Claudio breaks into blank verse in describing his love for Hero—
War thoughts Have left their places vacant: In their rooms Come thronging soft and delicate desires.
The 1CS3 reprint actually ruins this verse by printing “ thronged ” for thronging. This will serve as a climax, but as a matter of fact and to be complete, there remain three equally serious errors in this same short act. In Scene II., line 15, the omission of an ** ifM destroys the sense;
In Scene 111., line r>9, “ come ” is blunderingly substituted for " came and in the last line but two the substitution of M I subdued ” for *’ I am subdued ** makes utter nonsense of Don John’s Parthian shot at mankind. As far as we have been able to pursue this research this kind of blundering marks almost every page of the Fourth Folio.
