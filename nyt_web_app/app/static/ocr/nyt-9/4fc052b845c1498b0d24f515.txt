THE " Letters to * Ivy ’ from the First Earl of Dudley," John William Ward, 'who later "became insane, have been collected by S. H. Romilly into one volume, which is being sent out by Longmans, Green & Co., in an octavo volume, with four illustrations, including a portrait in colors of '* Ivy,” (Mrs. Dugald Stewart,) another of Earl Dudley, and a fac simile of one of his letters.
When Ward was sixteen years old he was sent to Edinburgh and put in the care of the Dugald Stewarts. The present biographer writes of Mrs. Stewart’s influence on him;
Ward was evidently a man who deeply needed sympathy, and especially a woman’s sympathy—one to whom he could pour out his heart and his thoughts, and to whom he could look for comfort and advice. Such a woman he found to perfection In Mrs. Stewart She was sufficiently his senior in point of years for him to be guided by her experience of the world, and yet not too much so for his intense admiration for her to be untinged with a certain element of romance. In his earliest letters from Oxford he writes to her as to one who had supplied the place of a mother to him! * * * later, the tinge of romance becomes more apparent in the pet name of ** Ivy." In his later letters this form of address also disappears, but his expressions of devotion, when they occur, show that his love for his divinity remained as strong as ever, though the tone is no longer that of a boyish lover, but of one writing to an old and very 4.ear friend. This love and respect (as the letters show) were unbounded. and continued to the end.
It Is tMg correspondence which W now made public for the first time. Where there is a gap, (for, os the compiler points out, some of the letters were lost or do-Btroyed.) Mr. Romilly has filled it by relating briefly the principal events in which Ward figured.	-
