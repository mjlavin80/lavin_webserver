" Nuremberg’ and Its Art to the End ot the Eighteenth Century,” by Dr. P. J. R6e, Librarian of the Bavarian Industrial Museum, appears In the Famous Art Cities Series, with many illust rat ions. It is translated by G. H. Palmer from the German of Dr. Rfie. (Imported by Charles Scribner’s Sons. $1.50.) Nuremberg Is not among the oldest of German cities; and, although the Romans and Charles the Great are connected with it by tradition, it owes its foundation to neither. The proper derivation of the town is not known even to-day, although it is said to be Norieus, after the son of Hercules. Prof. R6c writes of the effect of moderti times:
It is wonderful that, while centuries have built at Nuremberg, each in Its own fashion and each with distinctive forms and a character of its own, they have joined their work so harmonio“usly together and created every part with such spirit and full power that the whole gives an impression of unity. Generations have passed, and with them taste and artistic ability have varied, but the genius of Nuremberg's builders insured that the unity of its artistic character should not be overthrown until the nineteenth century came and put an--end to -the beautiful harmony that had reigned there.
The book Is embellished with 123 halftone photographic reproductions of edifices, scenery, pictures, statuary, &c. Like tlie other books in this series, “ Nuremberg 11 is printed in clear-cut type on cai-endered paper and bound in paper covers In imitation of limp leather.
