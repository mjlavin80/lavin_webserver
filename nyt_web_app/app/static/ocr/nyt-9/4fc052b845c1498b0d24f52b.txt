IE old romanoe-not the oldest romance or the greatest or the noblest romaricfe,~bUt the common or prairie romance of a generation ago —has a certain simplicity of mrealtty about it which is apt to itrlke sophisticated modern readers as at once refreshing and oddly provocative of smlleg where smiles were least thought of by the writer. And this Is pre-eminently the case with the wonderful tales of Capt Mayne Reid. Doubtless It ta the abandon of that engaging author to the most bo'yteh spirit of romance which has Induced the publishers to revive and republish him In a day of such different methods of story writing, but the contemporary cynic as well as the surviving sentimentalist should find ! pleasure In those adventurous and melodramatic pages.

THE two stories which furnish the excuse for this notice are in the ! £aptain*B most enthusiastic vein—
; each contains " Americanos/' Indians.
| beautiful women, wonderful horses, and villains of the deepest dye. •* The Whit* Chief,’’ as some of you older ones may recall, runs Its dramatic course In New Mexico, and relates the wonderful feats of horsemanship of blonde Carlos and the unnamable deeds oT certain Mexican officers who hated him for his skill and j his virtues. It tells how Donna Catalina,
1 daughter of a rich man. was loved by him and loved him In return, of the plots hatched against him and his old motfler and beautiful sister by the officers aforesaid, of captures and hairbreadth escapes, of brutal beatings In the market place,
| and of a terrible revenge wreaked by Carlos riding grimly af the head or a band of Indians who had elected him chlet in the most romantic and Impossible manner.

THE Other Is a story of Texas—of another wonderful horseman, this time a native of Ireland—and of the fam-j lly of a Mississippi planter who came to settle by the Rio Gra-nde with his slaves and all his household gods. In the narrative is a burning indignation against a peculiar institution and some of the proud and evil men who grew up under It. But the daughter of the planter is beautiful, brave, and nobly passionate beyond the power of-coldly printed words ( (or even italics) to describe. She loves the Irishman, and it is her cousin^also a pretender for her hand—who Is the villain, meanly jealous, rude, tactless, cowardly, and dishonorable in his contest with the hero. Capt. Mayne Reid's villains never have the suggestion of a virtue to make the gentlest reader’s heart grow soft with pity when the Inevitable moment comes^the moment when ; the evil creatures must pay the dreadfuf penalty of the deeds they have done or wished to do.
I As for the hero, he must have all the I more manly and savage virtues and bodily agilities—he may lack other esteemed j qualities—while the heroine must be (like j Douglas in the old song which belongs to j the same school) " tender and true more than that, a lover unashamed for the excellent reason that she never falls In love where, according to accepted moralities, she should not. It is all the very breath of the West of our boyhood dreams j —the West that never was. save as boys and girls or Capt. Mayne Reid imagined it, a West full of scraps of Spanish and ! Httlc lessons in history and geography I and the historical present tense and italics liberally distributed over the page to mark the places where the reader must take particular notice—a dreamland full | of the clatter of hoofs, the popping of Colts, the jingle of spurs, the hissing of words of the villain, and the eager kisses of fair maids.
