HE great age to which George Frederick
*
Watts attained, and his steady pursuit, during an era marked by realism In painting and sculpture, of the symbolical and ideal, have put him apart from other British artists of the last quarter century, and surrounded his name with a halo.
The light with which he shines in British art is not diminished by tfic lady whose reminiscences of the sculptor-painter have now appeared, at least not Intentionally diminished, for her admiration of his art is great and her affection for the man is sincere.
Jt may be that between the lines one sees characteristics that will modify some of the claims to greatness made by the admirers of Watts; it may be that the biographer has not chosen wisely, the illustrations of this work* thinking more of the pictures whu-h she herself owns, many of them far from representative of his best, than the pictures and sculi hirea that form his highest achievement. This is -hilly unfortunate for American readers, who have seen few if any pictures by Watts and are very curious to measure a man about whom we read the highest eulogies, such as are only given to the very greatest masters who remain as exemplars of the finest art of an epoch and a nation. It seems that Mra. Barrington has failed to realize the necessity of supplying the reader with specimens of Watts's masterpieces in order to justify the lotty rank to which she raises him as an artist.
Mrs. Barrington is herself an artist of sufficient merit to have been intrusted by the old .master with the task of copying some of his works on canvas. Her description of his methods is therefore doubly valuable, for during a quarter century she lived close ^ to Watts's house, and with her husband was one of the privileged friends who saw Watts continually while at work or at rest.
Before beginning a painting he would often cover the -canvas with some color opposed to the tone he intended the picture to have.	-
He dried the oil out of hie paints ,by putting them on blotting paper, so that when he used them hia colors were almost as dry as pastel. " When the • putty-llke pigment which he put on the canvas in distinct touches was nearly dry he would sometimes take a paper knife and, using the flat part, would rub it over the touches, smearing them together. He would not touch tlie painting again tin the smeared surface was quite dry; then he would work partially over it. • In this way he contrived to get a bloom of atmosphere into his painting, a quality which he Invariably aimed at. Watts possessed an extraordinary amount of ingenuity, and thoroughly enjoyed using it. the actual playing with paint being a source of gteat pleasure to him."
Mrs. Barrington niake3 much of the Keltic nature in Watts, and ascribes to it his idealism and preference for melabcholy subjects; perhaps she lays more fctress-. on this that* is-due. * Fret fulness and selfdeprecation are not especially Keltic traits, neither is shyness pushed to an extreme* nor a certain de-ficieneyr lrr hurnor^and wit:	. . , •	.

One great drawback for Watts In the tasks he set himself was a frail physique, which prevented him from working steadily at modeling, in clay and often, made his first attack on a' painting so much better than the later finishing that he often would sacrifice the finest points of the sketch In the closing stages. Be lacked power and vitality—yet he lived to eighty-seven !
SOMETIMES he lamented that he was born too early in the century, half of* his life having passed .before *a new era of appreciation began,with Rossetti, Bume Jones, Morris, and the rest of the little band of Pre-Raphaelites, The catalogue to Che exhibition of paintings by Watts made in 1885 at the Metropolitan Museum speaks of the avoidance of realism In his pictures. He tried to embody In art an echo of the essential interests of life, " something more complete In its suggestiveness to the whole of human nature than mere artistic completeness could ever be." Hence he avoided the kind of finish. possible In realistic work, as It would not harmonize with Imaginative art. "To keep a light balance and harmony between structural, scientific truth and poetical, ideal truth,” says the preface of the catalogue, v necessitates a treatment the contrary of realistic, one which shall carry the work Into a sphere congenial with subjects which appeal to the least material part of our nature,”
This catalogue, though it speaks of Watts in the third person, was evidently written at his request and under his dictation. Speaking of the portraits—it will be recalled that he painted a long list of famous men, now the property of the nation—Watts claimed the right to give an intellectual ^ conception of portraiture rather than a realistic likeness: ** He has not cared so much to render the physical aspect of his sitters at one given moment as to suggest the Impression their appearance wonld leave on the memory of interested and observant friends." Watts maintained that portraits were the best means for the study of ideal work, yet (rather at odds with his own practice) strongly disapproved of mixing portraiture into ideal work, on the ground that a piece of pure portraiture must always jar In a work ot sentiment, *' because what we see or could see any day would not harmonize with a purely Imaginative conception." Nor did he believe In the use of models as they are commonly employed. He might make studies from , the life, but he professed never to have Inserted an actual imitation either of face or form directly into an imaginative work. He did not often paint portraits at one sitting, as Frans Hals is said to have done, but usually followed Titian’s method of starting a portrait and allowing the first painting to be well dried in before returning to It. A kind of apologia pro opera sua is contained in the following passage:
The art which Mr. cWatts has cared for, which he has thought worthy of the immense labor which really good painting and sculpture involves, is the art which is profound, which appeals to the noblest and deepest sensibilities in human nature and to the imagination; the art which is consonant with great music and great poetry and which Implies an association with great ideas. He fee\B that 1 realistic art, as modern schools understand it, can never be this. Jt may amuse, interest, and cultivate the perceptive faculties, but it does not set the mind going OU further and higher lines, and awakens | in the mind no thoughts of its own. It I merely suggests the effect of a moment i seized by the artist with “ disinterested , curiosity ’'—the admirable expression used by Matthew Arnold with reference to the work of literary realists—and, finding no echo in the heart and imagination of future generations, It will not live."
THE aim thus professed by Watts was a very exalted one, and he always found listeners who sympathized with his point of view; but the question remains, how many are there among those listeners who were thoroughly satisfied that in his works he reached the high level he described? His portraits of eminent artists, writers, and public men are in the National Portrait Gallery; his other paintings, ideal and symbolical, are £n the Tate Gallery, all presented to the nation by the painter. The big equestrian group which began as a *' Joan of ArcM and ended as “ Vital Force" accompanies the tomb of Cecil Rhodes In South Africa. A mosaic after his design decorates St. Paul's. Watts passed the latter part of his life economizing. laboring to the top of his physical powers, and selling work only with reluctance, in order to leave as his own monument and as examples of Ideal painting to the glory of British art these galleries full of pictures. It recalls the gift that Turner made of his paintings and water colors. Was the game worth the candle? Would it not have been better for his art if he had painted to such demand from bts contemporaries as gradually made itself heard and left to the following generation the task of placing the best of his works in the public collec-

Judging by the Illustrations in this book the reader is likely to admire the early portraits more than those which were made after Watts determined to paint celebrities and give their likenesses to the nation. Those of Mrs. Nassau Senior and her mother, Mrs. Hughes, . mother also of the author of ** Tom Brown’s School Days,” and the early standing portrait of Miss .Mary K. Brunton are instances In point. At that time he was not ridden by his hobby and painted more from feeling than from theory. As an example of his inability to express a heroic character and the complex qualities of a being*In whom the warlike nature of a hero and the jealous, vindictive character of a Medea were combined, one has only to examine the head of '* Brynhilde," or the graceful but inexpressive group called “Humanity In the Lap of Earth *’ to see how far be fell short, very often, of the power to express one of those lofty ideas which he loved to portray. It may be said of Watts that he should be honored for attempting these high flights In an age that was discouraging, but It cannot truthfully be said that he realized his own limitations like Sir Frederick L*eighton and resolutely worked within them.
**•
WHILE at work on the heroic piece of sculpture finally named “ Vital -* Energy," a nude figure dominating a horse In tremendous action, Watts made a discovery which explained to him wherein the difference lies between a *' good ” and a " bad " Une in sculpture. The good Une In any work of art is composed of a series of flattened curves joined together, while a bad Une is an even section of a circle, and therefore more tightly curved. What he believed to have found was the reason for the superiority of the one over the other. The good line is good because each flattened curve is a section of a large circle which, If continued, would rind its completion far away out of the actual design. The bad line, which is part of a small circle, suggests a form contained weU within a limited space. In the one case the mind starts with a sense of spring and size; in the other It is restricted to the limits of the design which Is before the actual eye. According to Watts, the keynote of interest in all works of art was that which suggested growth in the imagination. The low curve carries the fancy far away from reality, the high curve brings it back and lames its flight. As examples in point he instanced the Fheidian figure called “ Theseus " and the lines in trees expressing Ufe, growth, spring, and onward movement.
Mrs. Barrington's is not a biography, but a personal work, which incidentally reveals a good deal of the writer’s personality, It throws much light on the sculptor-painter’s nature and will be of great value even after the complete Ufe and estimate of George Frederick Watts shall have found their expounder.
