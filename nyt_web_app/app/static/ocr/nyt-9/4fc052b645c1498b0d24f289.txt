THE volume in hand is one in which the author has assembled four lectures delivered in the Colonial Theatre, Boston, in January, 1003. The first lecture is a plea for the commonplace, and all of them illustrate that quality admirably. The author^ idea is that which so possesses a certain intellectual cult in these days—that which has informed so many advertisements of patent breakfast foods—tbe " return to nature.” And this nature is the common or garden nature—not that which dwells in far mountain scenery or arirbrosial isles aside; it is “ the cow in the field, the tree against the sky. the fields newly plowed, the crows flapping home at night, tho man at his work, the woman at her work, the child at its play." Of this nature the author declares we need a new literature,
" a literature that shall not be merely and plainly descriptive. We need short, sharp, quick, direct word pictures that shall place the object before us as vividly as the painter would outline some strong figure with a few bold strokes of his
brush.”	.
The reason for this greater scientific definition of detail is “that the race is coming nearer to the environment in which it lives." However, it is admitted that the best possible introduction to nature is that afforded by a sympathetic person who knows some aspect of nature weil *•—such a one is as a skilled and loving guide >n the woods.	_
Be It understood that *' nature in all this is sought as a corrective to the tendencies of life as it must be lived by most modern bread-winners. One somewhat conspicuous statement declares that the “ weather" is a type of " environment," and " as It is not a human institution it cannot be bad." Bad weather is mainly the fear of spoiling our clothes.” Modern clothes have therefore been largely Instrumental in leading us away from nature. Obviously £ress reform, enabling us to enjoy all weathers, would tend in the right direction. The author tails to observe In this connection the practice of the British (and Anglomaniacs) in providing garments of proper form for all weathers—but that is a detail.
Tlie second lecture dea.ls with country 3no city, and opposes the view that th.* urban community will ever swnllow up the whole country. For the country can exist without the city, but the city cannot exist without the country. The city must have country products. Incidentally are remarks on country and city uni-versitUs, and an inquiry into -why the country boy leaves the farm for the town. The third lecture Is concerned with the school of the future, but offers nothing very new or definite in that connection, and the final lecture discusses under the name of ** the quest of truth " the theory of evolution—apparently for tbe benefit of those whtv-are still inclined to baik at it. No doubt the .author has found that evolution is stiU to many as a batked Ids In the way t>f a shy horse.
