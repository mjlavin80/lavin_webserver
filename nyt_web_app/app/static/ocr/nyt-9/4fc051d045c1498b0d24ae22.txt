Henry francis william ganz
gives some practical hints on paint-1	ing, composition, landscape, and
I etching' in his boqk of that title, (Svo. Pp. j \‘2S. Cloth. Philadelphia:	J. B. Lippin-
I cott Company.) He shows the different methods of the masters of painting in Italy, l*Yance, Spain. Germany, and England, giving especial nttention to the art of figure painting. He also describes the different colors and from what and how they are produced. There are lessons on painting the sea and other moving objects, trees, flowers, &c.. portraits from life, and objects of art; how- to paint in water color, oils, &c. Examples are given of drawings, finished and unfinished, to illustrate more clearly what the author sets forth in the text. Although the title of the volume emphasizes " Rudiments,” we are not to accept this word as referring to primary elemental things unless the lessons set forth are to be explained and elaborated through the guidance of a cautious, sympathetic teacher. The student who has passed two or three years at an academy of design and who takes up the book with intelligence and sincerity will find Ganz’s work full of suggestion and wise counsel, which he would make a serious mistake in treating carelessly because of the author s insistence on technicalities and rules of form as well as of expression. An added feature of the material part of the book might have been blank interleaves on which the student could record his own experiments or set down formulae from other authorities. Doubtless many who possess copies of Mr. Ganz will have them so bound.
