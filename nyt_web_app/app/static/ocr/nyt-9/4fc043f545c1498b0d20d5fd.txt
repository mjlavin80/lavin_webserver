New York Times Saturday Rcvieio of Hooka:
In your issue of Aug1. 26 a correspondent gives a quotation from tlie medical lectures of ** the late Prof. Mabaffy of Dublin.” Possibly your correspondent meant to Quote the late Prof. Hauphton, who gave occasional lectures on medical literature and on the correlation of medicine with other branches of science. It.-is needless to say in & literary journal that J. P. Mahaffy is still alive.
