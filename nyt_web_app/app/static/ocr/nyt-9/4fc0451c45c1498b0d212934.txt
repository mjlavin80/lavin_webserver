HAT the Canterbury pilgrimage was, other than the cause and occasion of Chaucer’s delightful poem,
Is little known to the majority of readers. Mr. Snowden' Ward explains it at length, and, in explaining it, Imp&rts a deal of information, historical, social, and geographical, throwing light on the manners and customs of mediaeval England, as well as on the eTents that resulted	in	the slaughter of Thomas
Becket	In	Canterbury Cathedral. It
was this martyrdom of the Archbishop at the hands of King Henry U/s men that gave the shrine at Canterbury its sanctity and Jts miraculous efficacy. Becket, the * King’s Chancellor, the King's champion, made Archbishop of Canterbury, was no longer the King’s champion, but the upholder o£ the Church; and for the fidelity with which he maintained his new allegiance against his former master he suffered death. The story is a vivid and characteristically bloody chapter of mediaeval history, as Mr. Snowden Ward tells it.
Even before the death of this remarkable man, whose picturesque and resolute uprightness had strongly impressed itself upon the people, rumors of the miraculous interventions of God on his behalf had become rife. There •was great show of homage for Thomas the Martyr. His blood wrought great miracles according to the belief of the people who began to resort to the tomb in the cathedral. There were visions, wonderful cures of the sick. The blood, mixed, and again mixed and many times diluted with water, was furnished to the pilgrims in tiny phials, which soon came to be recognized as the special tokens of those who frequented the Canterbury shrine for several succeeding centuries. In 1173 Thomas was canonized, and tbe date of his death, Dec. 29, was made the feast of St. Thomas of Canterbury.
KrfG HENRY’S PILGRIMAGE.
THE King, touched with remorse, felt himself the object of divine wrath, and made a pilgrimage to Canterbury, where he submitted to rigorous fasting and to scourgings by the monks and Bishops. Thus was the cult of St. Thomas finally established and spread throughout England. To the popularity of the saint may be traced •. the frequency 'with which old and important bells were named “ Great Tom," and the fact that in England Thomas is the most frequent Christian name, with the single exception of John. Mr. Ward has followed up the
I
traces of the cult In different parts of England, still existing notwithstanding ! the tremendous rigor with which it was suppressed by Henry VIII. He describes pleasantly aiT imaginary pil- ; grimage of a farmer and his son; the preparations made, the route taken, the I places passed through, the sights seen, and the people met. The narrative is ^jased on contemporary accounts, he assures us, and gives an Interesting glimpse of the mediaeval English country.
CHAUCER,
NOW come Chaucer and his pilgrims. Mr. Ward gives the facts of the poet’s life as they are understood by modern investigators, who reject a number of traditional incidents as legendary. From the “ Canterbury Tales ” may be derived an image of the poet himself; or at least of the character In which he wished to appear. Thus, he implies that he was a lover of his fellowE, a born gossip; he was modest and unobtrusive, keeping near enough to hear the tales of the other pilgrims, but not forcing himself forward. An incidental reference shows that he was In the habit of telling the time by regarding himself as the gnomon of a sun dial six feet tall.

The other personages in the story are discussed as figures typical of the age; the Knight, a type of chivalry fighting for the Cross at a time when the purity of chivalry was much decayed; the merchant; the shipman, with a glimpse of what sea life was at that period; the wife of Bath and the sig-
nilicance .of her varied; experiences and. tte various churchly^pwsonage^; 'illustrate the vast Impprtancd^'of the ; Church in Chaucer’s time, the manners • and customs that particularly related ta their walks in life. The tales'pf the -.several pilgrims and the record otvtheir itinerary furnish roatter for discussion; and explanation in plenty/	,
„ END OF THE CULTlV
' „ .. ? * • *
H OW Henry VIII. gave "death blows
to the cult of St. Thomas and his memory as a part of his campaign against the Church is told. It culminates in a summons issued In 1538 against ** Thomas Becket, sometime Archbishop of Canterbury,” to appear to answer a charge of treason against Henry II. As this was some four hundred ^ears after his death he did not respond, and the Attorney General, appearing for-Henry II., had no difficulty in making out a case against Thomas’s attorney. The saint's bones were condemned to be publicly burned and the offerings of his shrine forfeited. Royal Commissioners found that all the miraculous images, pictures, and wells were fraudulent, and they were destroyed. Sainthood was denied to Thomas Becket; his festivals were erased from the calendar; throughout the country his images and windows w#*e broken, church dedications changed, frescoes scraped away, shrines pulled down. The place that St. Thomas once held in the minds of Englishmen was vacated, so far as the King’s ruthlessness could do it.
One of the most Important and interesting features of Mr. Ward’s agreeable volume is the copious illustration. Its pages are thickly interspersed with excellent half-tone pictures of churches and portions of churches., shrines, gateways, arches, relics, ruins, and stretches of the " pilgrims' way M now remaining in England that can be directly connected with the Canterbury pilgrimages, either of Chaucer’s immortal company, or of obscurer folk. There are also several maps showing routes of pilgrimage. Altogether, it is an interesting excursion through historical lore for the illustration of a significant feature of mediaeval English life that Chaucer has kept In permanent remembrance.
