New York Times Saturday Review of Books:
The announcement in The New York Times Saturday Review or? books of the recent publication of seven volumes of verse by seven American poets must be consoling to the lovers of poetry, who have been disturbed by prophetic wails over the supposed decadence of that beautiful art.
Perhaps the overpowering materialism of the country seems, by comparison, to lessen the quality and output of poetry. Every age has its periods of ebb and flow of things, but taken on the average things | keep on improving.
Fine poetry is a universal and permanent beauty, and “ a thing of beauty is a joy forever."
Bacon ranks poetry as one of the three chief branches of human knowledge, and Aristotle affirms that it is more than true ; history. Is it probable that such an im- 1 portant art should have in it the elements of decay?
Poets are born by a kind provision of nature. A few “ die with all their music | in them," but the majority struggle to express themselves, and are more or less happy in their efforts.
When the divine power is given them to find the soul of things and give expression to their find, they will keep on aing-inp, even as the birds will sing, lhougn nobody listens.
There is necessarily so much of the material, and strenuous and commonplace, in the building up of a new country that he 1 must be a brave poet who could work up Into attractive poetical form the everyday practicalities of life. It may be a question whether the ideal can be so combined with the material things of everyday life as to lift the latter out of its coarseness and unattractiveness.
But commonplace things wreathed about with poetic phrase lose much of their crudeness and uninvitingness. So I would say to the poets, get the keynote of the times and you cannot fail to touch the hearts and arcfUse the interest of mankind.
There is a wide and fruitful field for subject in this country for those who would write on a dignified and. heroic plane. And there is a rich harvest in the field of everyday affairs for the poets of comic vein. History can be written in verse as well as in prose.
As to the purely ideal poet, he was bom to create in the realms of ideality, and he should live up to his destiny.
Much adverse criticism has been hurled at the poets. Critics are mortal and fallible, and it is easier for some to find a blemish than to point out a hidden beauty. Those who are not always able to trace an author's meaning in word or metaphor should not condemn the poet. Critics are a necessary and stimulating and educating quantity if they are discriminating critics. But some would-be critics condemn and examine not at all. They go so far as to misquote and condemn their misquotations,	M.	E.	C.
