Volume I. of Prof. George Salntsbury’* j edition of the *• Minor Poets of the Caro- , line Period," which is being issued by ; Henry Frowde at the Clarendon Press, i contains William Chamberlayiie's ** Phar- I onnida ” and England's Jubilee,” Ed- | ward Benlo wes’s “Theophila,” **The Summary of Wisdom." and “A Poetic Des- | cant Upon a Private Music-Meeting; ” and ^ the poems of Katherine Philips and Patrick Hannay. In his introduction in this volume, Prof. Saiixtsbury points out that he has brought together the poets of this , period because their work, in his opinion, : jg “ worth " collecting1 and reprinting, and is " really great.*’ He classes the material under three heads:	Versification,
diction, and subject. He writes:
In versification/ the poems nere set before the reader, being mostly in rhyme, do not illustrate one of the main features of their period, that disintegration or dis-vertebration of blank verse which the contemporary plays display so remarkabIy. But their exposition of the rhymed couplet of the period comes very close to this; and indeed, as contrast-pendan^practi-cally forms part of the same subject. We give. In the forefront of the book, the Greatest poem. In bulk and merit alike, which was ever written in this particular form of heroic. • * * In point of diction the authors here given add a good deal to the word—and phrase-book of the period * * • Yet again, there is special Interest of subject about not a few of the noets and poems here given; and this has not, like the others, been in aDygreat part anticipated by previous collections and editions.
This is the first time, it is believed, that tbe poets in these volumes have been collected; and not one of them was included in even the Chalmers edition of early English verse writers.
