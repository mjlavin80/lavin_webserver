SPANISH INFLUENCE.
A Contribution to the Study of Com--parative Literature'-^
HE science of comparative literature is rapidly making its way, both within and without institutions of
' learning in Europe and in this country. The late M. Joseph Texte of the University of Lyons, critics and teachers of literature in Germany and England too numerous to mention, and such men as Profs.
Woodberry and Gayley in America—aii these have constantly dwelt upon the ’ value and fruitfulness of the new science, and from them and their pupils has come a distinguished and fruitful body of literature. Of some noteworthiness in this connection is the series of " Studies in Comparative Literature " issued by the Columbia University Press. These volumes have dealt, in the main, with the influence of the literatures of the Romance nations on the development of English prose and verse. A study similar to these, though less systematic* is the volume on “ Spanish Influence on English Literature." by Mr. Martin Hume of the University of London.
It may be said at the outset that Mr. Hume would have found difficulty in filling his portly volume had he confined himself strictly to his ostensible subject. For the influence of Castilian Jiterature on that of England, though potent enough, has always been, in a large measure, circuitously indirect. Therein it differs markedly from the constant, visible, and almost tangible interrelations and intercommunications between the literatures of England and of Italy, or of Germany and Prance. And so Mr. Hume writes five lengthy chapters before he arrives at the discussion of his two primary topics—the influence of Spain on the development of the English drama and, above all, the English novel of adventure.
It cannot be said that Mr. Hume’s introductory chapters on the history of Spanish literature or on Spain’s func- | tion as the disseminator of Oriental learning and letters in Northern and Western Europe are especially illuminating or novel. The passage of Ori- ■ entai apologues and moral dicta 1 through the medium of Mozarabic and 1 Hebrew writers to Spain, and thence j northward, is among the commonplaces j both of the history of mediaeval liter- 1 ature, and the science of comparative ; mythology.
It is. then, in connection with the history of the novel that Spanish literature is of profoundest interest to us. From Spain came the romances of •chivalry, especially “ Amadis of Gaul from Spain came that curious amplification of the traditions of the Vergilian pastoral life—the romance of silk-gowned shepherds and shepherdesses. The chief of this class, the “ Diana " of Montemayor, found imitators i.i every country of Europe and, in England, in 1 no less a man than Sir Philip Sidney. , It is well known that these old ro-rnances and imitations of them proved popular reading till far into the eighteenth century. But it xvas the Picaresque romance which helped most powerfully in shaping the course of English, and, indeed, of European literature.
The “ Lacarillo de Tormes '* appeared
-	in 1554; an English translation was issued fourteen years later. The "Guzman de Alfarache ” was translated within a few years of Its first printing, as were likewise the “ Exemplary Novels" of Cervantes. The. Influence of these works upon English fiction past and present it Is simply impossible to exaggerate. That typical Spanish rogue-hero, with his endless scries of complicated adventures, appeared as early as IfiiH in the “ Jack Wilton " of Thomas Nash, continued his triumphant progress ot trickery and humor in the minor novels of Defoe, and ‘eul-minated his career in the masterpieces of Fielding and Smollett. Nor did he stop there, but, passing to America, made another immortal appearance on the banks of the Mississippi in the new guise of a Tom Sawyer and a Huckleberry Finn* He is to be found in the 	 ‘ ‘ t ■ ' ■

works of Capts. Marryat and Mayne Keid. whence he parsed to the outpourings of Horatio Alger, Jr., and ot* the late G, A. Henty. And this same Spanish rogue has cut even queerer capers. He reappears not only as Gil Bias,” but at last in the figures of great au--thors themselves. He, in almost incredible transfiguration, is the protagonist of the *' Sentimental Journey **
and of the “ Reisebilder."
In regard to the drama the case Is far less plain. Certain Spanish stories and certain Spanish plays do, no doubt, lie at the basis of a few products of
Elizabethan literature. There may be mentioned Kyd*s " Spanish Tragedy/' " The Two Gentlemen of Verona," and Middleton’s *• Queen of Corinth.” Traces of Spanish influence appear in “ Love’s Labour's Lost" and (though tliis is far more doubtful) in “ The Merchant of Venice." But Mr. Hume is guilty of rather gross exaggeration when he says- that the plots of Elizabethan plays '* were almost as frequently taken from Spanish as from Italian sources.” j After the Restoration the case was, i indeed, different. For post-Restora-! tion dramatic literature from Dryden to Wycherly, and from Wycherly to Sheridan, was based, in greater or less degree, on the plays of French contetn-'' poraries. These in turn—the works of Corneille, Moli5re, and their lesser fel-low-play wrights—showed clearly, and at every turn, the influence of Spanish tragedy and of Latin comedy transmitted through Spanish sources.
These phenomena of European literary history Mr. Hume presents clearly and intelligently enough, but without that attention to detailed evidence which would have made his principal chapters somewhat more convincing,

A word may be added here on the ■danger, which now threatens all students of literature, of carrying researches such as these too far. In science the individual phenomenon is usually of small significance. It is the grouping and the classifying of phe- J nomena that is all important. In lit- 1 erature, on tho other hand, the work, and the individual behind It, are every- ! thing. And a tendency to classify and 1 label works of the imagination may j often lead to an obscuration of their ] aesthetic value, which, after all. forms j their only right to existence; and to a 1 loss of that disinterestedness which Matthew Arnold rightly esteemed the chief quality of every competent critic.
