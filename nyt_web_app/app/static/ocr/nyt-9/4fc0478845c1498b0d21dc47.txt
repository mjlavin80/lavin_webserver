Mrs. Bayard Taylor tells the following story of Thackeray in her volume of recollections “ On Two Continents," published toy Doubleday, Page & Co., and reviewed by us some weeks ago. Shortly after their marriage, the Taylors met the novelist in London;
I confirmed in his person the characteristics which' I had guessed at from his works—a warm heart under the mask of scathing satire. On the occasion of a I small dinner which he gave us he said to my husband, after the gentlemen had rejoined the ladies in the drawing room: ! “ By the bye, I must give you a wedding present. What shall it be? " Then, going to an etagfcre, he took down a silver inkstand and gave It to his friend, in spite i of the evident displeasure of his youngest daughter, usually so amiable, who exclaimed with all the naivete of her fifteen years:	'* Oh, not that one, papa! ” But
papa gave no heed, and a few days later I sent us the gift with the Inscription en-- ! graved upon it:	“ W. M, Thackeray, to ,
Bayard Taylor, Oct. 27, 1837.”
