i
Critical study has but deepened my own feense of .the potency and value of Bushido To the nation. <Japan.) He who would understand twentieth century Japan must know something of its-roots in the: soil «T the past. -Even-If now -as invlsiblevto the foresent generation In Nippon as to the alien, the pKIloaophic student reads the results of to-3ay in the stored energies, of ages-gone. The . sonbeains of unrecorded tinie have laid tbe strata out of WK3ch Japan how digs her foot-pounds of impact for war or peace. All the spiritual senses arc keen in those nursed by Bushido. The crystalline lump' has dissolved In the sweetened cup*, but the dell-pacy of the flavor remains to cheer. In a word, Bushido has obeyed the higher law enunciated by One whom Its, ®wn exponent salutes and confesses his Master— ** Except a grain of com die, it abideth alone; but if It die it bringetb forth much fruit.**	"
