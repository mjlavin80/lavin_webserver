WRITER In The Standard of London boldly as
serts that the Intellectual level of English women has been lowered in the last fifty or sixty years, and bases his rash conclusion (which we believe to be wholly unwarranted) on a statement that j English women nowadays read only the lighter forms j of literature. They read French novels and plays, and i sensational English fiction generally. Their grand-| mothers, he declares, used to read Scott's poems and romances, and they also read history for its own sake. Such girls now would regularly read Freeman, Froude, Carlyle, and Stubbs. We decline to follow further this pessimist's argument . To be sure, neither English nor American women in tho whirl of fashionable life have much time for serious reading nowadays. Yet they read more and know more than j their grandmothers, who worked samplers and stayed j Indoors for fear their faces would get tanned. No.
The intellectual level of English-speaking women has
i ■ •
, not been lowered. For every Englishwoman who had ! enough mental development to read Scott in the early Waverley days there are a hundred now-who-habitually read good books.
