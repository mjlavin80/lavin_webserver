0?JE PUiAD’^5 latest essay in fiction deals with nothing less than the life history of that centurion who commanded the Homan soldiers at the Crucifixion. According to a veracious biographer, this man, who bore the name of Eradmus—which somehow has, not quite un old Rortan sound—was the son \ of a swordmaker In the Imperil] city, a swordmaker who had been aforetime himself a soldier and ambitiouu, but had missed promotion.
With the lesions of his master Tiberius, young	Eradmus marched	into	Britain,
fought there valiantly with skin-clad natives, and was taken prisoner by a Briton chief. This chief gave the captive to his beautiful daughter for a slave—and the two young people fell in love. Also in that service Eradmus met a fellow-slave who was a Jew. These two, when their lives were in danger, the chief's daughter smuggled out of her father's village, and. fate led them afterward to Jerusalem, where	Eradmus saw	the	Son	of Man
preaching ir. the streets and in the Temple—saw and heard, and, though he did . not believe, marveled at the gentleness of the Man and the fierce hatred in which the Je^ts held Him. It was he also who captured Barrabas, and it was he who hardened hlsr Roman heart to place the crown	of thorns upon	the	captive Jesus’
head.	Even then he	had	been	tempted
to believe: after the Passion belief over* whelmed him. And what befell meantime the blue-eyed maid ia fa.r Britain whom he loved and who loved him? ¥ou will learn of that when you have read the story—that is, if yo*i do not stall in the midst of one ot the passages ot religious disputation which are strewn in the way of the reader like hurdles in the track of jumping horses.
