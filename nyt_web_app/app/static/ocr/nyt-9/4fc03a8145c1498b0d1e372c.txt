Mr. Livingston's magnup cpus: nears Its completion wtt?i very great speed. Only one more volume remains to be printed; an J that will be published within two or three months. „	^
Vol. III. of the work includes tit!es and authors frornLapham to JUchards; among them being Le Sage, Longfellow, Lowell, Cotton and Increase Mather, Gcorgo •Meredith; Milton,. Montaigne, Sir Thomas More, William Morris, the New Eng-land Primer, Omar Khayyam and his FitzGerald, ’William Penn, Poe, Pope, the Prayer Book, Punch, and Rabelais. New York affords a number of titles, and apropos of that fact, it may be' mentioned that 125 volumes of a daily paper, running from 1SG0 to	were	sold for $8.75!
This la an answer to persons who wonder what their copy of the paper of April 14, 1S03, is worth.
It appears that Punch sells for more in this country than ip England. Omar is still firm, the Grolier edition commanding high prices; a freak edition, three-eighths of an inch square, with magnifying lens in the cover, does not seem to be in general demand. In fact, freaks among books seem not to be favorites among book buyers: Lady Randolph Churchill s ** Anglo-Saxon Review/’ (it is noted in Volume I. of this work,) though published at $(i, was sold last for $2.90 a volume.
More and more, as it nears completion, does Mr. Livingston's work commend itself to those who have to do with books. Its compiler is indeed to bibliographers what Poole is to indexers*
