New York Times Saturday Hcvicw of Books:
It used to be said of a certain very substantial Boston newspaper that it was like a porous plaster, "because it was good for a week back," Now The New York Times Book Review certainly more than fulfills those conditions, for I find myself rereading with the greatest interest its pages of months gone by. Thus, in the issue of Dec. 3, 1904, occurs Hall Caine’s statement of his ideas on the problem of suffering tn this life. In this Mr. Caine concludes that suffering mUst be good for us, and necessary to the highest development. The radical may call this an attempt to apologize or condone a wrong state of affairs, but Mr. Caine Is right as far as he goes. The reason of suffering may be for development, but not primarily. The law back of the facts Is that payment must be made for every infraction
of the laws of life.
This payment is not always made by the guilty, but often by innocent parties, but the payment is made, just the same.
Touching on the same matter, Dr. Lyman Abbott says in The Outlook for Aug. 2G that natural law, far from being unmerciful or unforgiving, is constantly healing and repairing, warning us from self-destruction and correcting the mistakes and abuses.
Still, back or it all, this law is inexorable, that payment is made by one or another.	ALFRED	CLARK.
