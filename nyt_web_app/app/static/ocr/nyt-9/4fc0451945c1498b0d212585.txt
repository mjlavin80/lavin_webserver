THE fame of Admiral Winslow rests upon his victory over the Alabama off Cherbourg in June. 1S64. When he took command of the Kearsarge, in April, 1863, his immediate duty was to capture or destroy Confederate cruisers, of which two, the Florida and the Alabama* were then on the high seas, and others were being fitted out In British and French ports. Winslow was left virtually supreme and unhampered by orders from the Navy Department. Lieut. EUicott says that " his cruising ground was 1,300 miles long. It was bounded on the east by the coasts of Europe and Africa and on the west by his discretion. His plan of campaign, outlined in a letter to the Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles, is given by Lieut. EUicott on Page 105. His plan was to cruise about the Azores and Madeira, In which vicinity he believed the Alabama to he operating, when, in fact, she was near the coast of Brazil. His choice of the Azores as a cruising ground was an error, as the chance of intercepting the Confederate cruisers there was very slight. These were however, very likely to keep in touch with the agents in the British and French ports who had fitted them out. Information that tbe Florida wfts operating in the Irish Channel caused Winslow, about the middle of September, to chapge his base to Brest, where the Florida was undergoing repairs. She eluded Winslows
vigilance and escaped to sea.
Tn* n the Kearsarge tools her station in the Channol, where she remained several months. On June 11, 1SG4, the Alabama anchored at Cherbourg, and Winslow immediately headed for that port to blockade his enemy. He and Semmes the commander oi the Alabama, had be™ shipmates and knew each other well" Semraes knew,” says Lieut. Ellicoit, ** that he would be blockaded with ceaseless vigilance .Winslow felt sure that nis opponent would ultimately fight his r.-ay out rather than be smothered in a hole. SemtneVs Utters written at this time <<how 'hat he was eager to accept the kearsnrge’s challenge. He felt that the inevitable mon.ent had come.
On the morning pf June 10 the Alabama left her t.iccrlngs at Cherbourg and wu aocou.tn.nlcd to the three-mile limit by a French Ifonclad. The story ot the freat duel is graphically related by IJeut. EUicott. It lasted a little over an hour, ai d resulted In the sinking ot the Alai-ama. Semmes escaped on an Vn^liyh yacht in a manner creditable neither to himself nor to his rescuers. Aa „ result of the battle Willow was advanced to th« grade of Commodore, and in 1870 became Rear Admiral. The voi-ume closes with the remark of his great Hiiliigowst. Semmes, “He was :he riiris-Uqji gentleman.”
