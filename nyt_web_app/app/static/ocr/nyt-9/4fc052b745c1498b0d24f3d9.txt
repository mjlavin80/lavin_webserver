Legislature, ^nd cannot be amended by a more legislative act. The Constitution of the United States is the most famous document of this class. Rigid Constitutions, Mr. Bryce believes, arc adapted to democracies. “A Constitution set out in black and white, contained in a concise document which can be expounded and remembered more easily than a constitution growing out of a long series of controversies and compromises, seems specially fitted for a country where the multitude is called to rule.”	!
American readers will be most interested In the essay on “ The United States Constitution as Seen in the Past." This consists of a critical examination of the predictions of Hamilton and De Tocqucville. It Is especially instructive to read what Bryce, himself a great critic—a critic in the highest sense of the word—of our institutions, has to say about De Tocque-ville. The defects of his book a.re due to three causes, £ays Mr. Bryce. His specu-i?.ns are a PrIori and deductive, not sufficiently based upon facts* His point of view Is too French, and causes him to regard things un-French as abnormal. His knowledge of English institutions while great for a Continental European, was not great enough to show him how much in America is essentially English. H^
shows which .of De Tocaucvillc’s predictions have been realized, and how he would have to amend his criticisms were he writing to-day. Incidentally Mr. Bryce gives us in this essay a good many of his own ideas about the American system of government.

CONSTITUTIONS. "By James Bryce, D. C. TJ. New York:	Oxford	University	Press,	Henry
Frowde.
THIS volume includes six of the sixteen essays by Mr. Bryce, published in 3001 under the title “ Studies in History and Jurisprudence.” All of these six deal with the general subject of political constitutions.
The first essay is on the nature of constitutions, and it is here that Mr. Bryce's famous classification of constitutions is introduced. The old classification of written and unwritten is unscientific; he proposes the terms rigid and flexible. By flexible he means elastic, not unstable. “ They can be stretched or bent so as to meet emergencies without breaking their framework." The most famous constitutions of this class are those of Rome and of England. Of the Roman Constitution, Mr. Bryce says: “It w|js^a complicated piece of work, made of many pieces, firmly attached, yet each piece playing freely. It had to be bent, twisted, stretched in many ways, under the pressure of divers exigencies. But it stood the strain of being bent or stretched, and when the force that had bent it was withdrawn, could return su nearly to its original form as to seem to have never been disturbed." While the British Constitution has been subjected to fewer jars than the Roman, the same thing is true of it. Mr. Bryce concludes that there is a natural affinity between aristocracies and flexible • constitutions. A flexible constitution denotes merely those laws and customs of the country which determine its political system. These laws are not superior in the mode of their enactment to other laws, nor are they beyond repeal by .the regular letgi^tive-power."
