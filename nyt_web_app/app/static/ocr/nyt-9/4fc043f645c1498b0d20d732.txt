SHAKESPEARE’S CHRISTMAS/* by A. T. QuIIler-Coueh, (I^ngmans, Green & Co.,) Is as good a" collection of stories 04 its title promises, and as this vivacious, ingenious, and', voluminous ’writer always can be depended upon to furnish at wonderfully short intervals of time. The monotony which is the usual fault of such books is altogether lacking in this one, for the only similarities which can possibly be detected in these seven capital tales are that all but one of them have probably some slight historical basis, and that they all belong to a period considerably further back than any of their readers will be able to remember. It may be an old trick—this dressing up of some persons or events of a by-gone time in such clever accessories of speech and action as to give them all the semblance of reality—and it may have been frequently abused by the Incompetent and the unskillful, but, as employed by lir. Quiller-Coueh, it is a most delightful means of entering into | the spirit of some matters concerning which .the details are uncertain or even
!
j entirely missing.
The title story, M Shakespeare’s Christmas,” is the best possible - example of
**•
j what this author’s picturesque fancy, keen Imagination, and rollicking humor can accomplish in the way of giving form and substance to the veriest shadow of a man—John Shakespeare, father of the im! mortal Will. History itself, of the most
*
authentic and minute variety, could hardly place before us a figure more true to life and the times, or a parent better explanatory of an uncommon child, than | the portrait which ** Q." draws of John Shakespeare, come tb London on Christ-1 mas Eve to witness the production of a I new comedy by his famous Bon. The burly countryman, witty of speechr quick j of observation, and impulsive - of action, t
running over with high spirits ahd broad I
1 i
in humanity, is a man wonderful enough 1 [ to account for even his many-sided son.
Tlie most human and pathetic touch of all | is where he calls for Will to wait a mo, ment at the inn door, till he overtaka
I him:	..	,
i " Lad, lad,” he cries, ** let us go in to; gether. Though the world’s applau.se weary thee, *tis sweet to thine old father."
" Shakespeare’s Christmas " is the gem of the collection, the most artistically successful from every point of view, but	I
not far behind it Is " Ye Sexes, Give Ear,"	I
in which the old story of how the fish-	I
wives of Saltash outrowed the men at the	i
annual regatta and were afterward be-	j
trayed into the hands of a press gang by one of the discomfited husbands, is told in the author's most humorous and ingratiating style.
"Capt. Wyvem’s Adventures" is an historical novel in mininture., which proves to be a most acceptable manner of serving that delectable dish. ** The Rain of Dollars " and “ The Lamp and the Guitar " utilize the picturesque scenes and incidents of the Peninsular War.
“ Frenchman’s Creek ’’ tells with a relish the ridiculous bungle a British Admiral once made of charting Helfortl River, in Cornwall, and “The M:irj Behind tho Curtain " is a complicated extract from the Memoirs of CTabricl Foot, highwayman. in which a thief develops a conscience for the very human, if not commendable, ri-ason. that he wishes to outdo in virtue another gentleman of his own profession, whom he .had. " r.ever been able to stomach."
