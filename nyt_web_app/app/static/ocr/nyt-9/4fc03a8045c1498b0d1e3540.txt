THE history of a church is not always limited In interest to those within Its own denominational lines. That of “ The Old Pine Street *' Presbyterian Church of Philadelphia Is distinctly not so restricted. This is the only Presbyterian church in Philadelphia occupying its ante-revolutionary building—a fact of interest in itseir; furthermore the church was closely connected through Us members with the management of the Revolutionary War, JQhn Adams and Dr. Benjamin Rush, signers of the Declaration, being members of its congregation, and other less famous men being attendants at its services.
“The Old Pine Street" was organized in 17G8, and in its 147 years of existence has had but eight pastors. Its first minister was George Duffleld, who was chaplain “of all the Pennsylvania militia” and, with the Rev. William White, chaplain of Congress. Of him, Mr. Gibbons records this story: *' Upon a certain Sabbath be ascended the pulpit for the morning service, and looking over the congregation for a moment, exclaimed, ‘There are too many men here this morning. I am going to the front."
A reward of £50 had been offered for , Duffield’s head, and he had more than one narrow escape from capture. But it was only fitting that Duffield should be a ' fighting parson, for, as Mr. Gibbons notes, 07 of the 110 men who signed the ** callM to him in 17T1 afterward served during the Revolution. He was succeeded by John Blair Smithy who, while a theo-
logical student, had acted as Captain of a company of volunteers; he dhnl of yellow fever in 17!Kt. Then came Philip Millr-dollar, from the ColU*siate DuU'h Church in this city, wlio later became President of Rutgers. Archibald Alexander was the fourth minister of Old Pine Street. In his time, ISOii-ltSI-, communion tokens were still used,
i When he left, the church called Ezra
; Stiles Kly, but there was a bitter quarrel
| over his coming, a trial for heresy growing out of it. Mr. Ely. of course, was acquitted, and remained pastor for twenty-one years. Then came Dr. Thomas Bra'inerd, from ISIJ7 to 1SG7—a great Union man, like Beecher and Adams; Richard Howe Allen, to 18S0. and Dr. Gibbons, who writes the book before us. Five of the eight ministers have been Moderators#o£ the General Assembly.
The Old Pine Street^ias had some notable men in its congregation. John Adams and Dr. Rus\i have been named; others were Capt. Dawson of Tarleton’s Dragoons. Capt. Stephen Decatur, father of Commodore Decatur, GerT. John Steele, who served in the Revolution and in the war of 1812; Dr. McClellan, uncle of Gen. McClellan. A hundred and thirty men of the Old Pine Street congregation entered the Union Army during the rebellion, and eighteen of them died in the service. William Hurry, who rang the Independence Bell on July 4, 1776, is buried in the graveyard of the church.
The church stands far downtown )n Philadelphia, surrounded by Jewish families mostly, but still prospering. The changed conditions have " merely added duties and new phases of church work.**
