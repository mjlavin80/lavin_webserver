MR. CAWLIN’S POETRY.
A New Volume by One of the Amer. ican Poets Who Have Been Praised by President Roosevelt.
R. MADISON CAWEIN’S verse was mentioned favorably by the President of the United States in his recent manifesto commending to public notice the poems of Mr. Edward Arlington Robinson. Wherefore a new book of verse by Mr. Caweln has a “ news value" quite apart from its literary merit. The good opinion of the President, who is so essentially a man of this hour, is all the more striking when we reflect that Mr. ^Caweln is not always quite exempt from a charge of “ atavism." In spite of his modern accent, he always manages tn his poetry to awaken the spirit of old ideals, illusions, faiths, and superstitions. The quality which ho shows of respect for the past and sympathy with the mood of those who lived in it Is apt to give the effect of large work, even where the form is slight and the significance hardly more than the breath of suggestion. Those poets who still see in the lovely visible world the
Spirits and gods that used to share this earth
With man as with their friend,
have an advantage over those who shut themselves within the walls of the present, but there is no form of poetic feeling that more strictly exacts sincerity. The spell of antique beauty cannot be cast over the modern mind by the mere reiteration of the old immortal names of the deities by which to Grecian eyes the waves and woods were peopled. Fine taste, style, dignity, and. above all, sincerity, are needed to reproduce the richness of the classic impulse with the control of the classic art. It would be too much to say that Mr. Cawein always commands this ideal equipment, but at least he is never insincere, and at his best he is charming with the grave charm of a poet who sees life rather wistfully in the light that possibly never was on sea or land, but that rests on our vision of an early world in which was more physical and mental if not more moral beauty than in the present. These stanzas on “The Rue-Anemone,” in his new book, ** The Vale of Tempe,” (Duttons,) show the reality of his sentiment in turning away from the modern attitude toward nature:
Under an oak tree in a woodland, where
The dreaming Spring had dropped it from her hair,
I found a flower, through which I seemed to gaze ' Beyond the world and see what no man dare Behold and live—the myths of bygone days—	1
Diana and Endymion, and the bare Slim beauty of the boy whom Echo wooed;
And Hyacinthus whom Apollo dewed With love and death; and Daphne, ever fair;
And that reed-slender girl whom Pan pursued.
I stood and gazed, and through it seemed to see The Dryad dancing by the forest tree,
Her hair wild blown: the Faun with listening ear, Deep In the boscage, kneeling on one knee. Watching the wandered Oread draw near,
Her wild heart beating like a honey bee Within a ro3e.—All, all the myths of old.
All, all the bright shapes of the Age of Gold.
Peopling the wonder~worlds of Poetry,
Through it I seemed in fancy to behold.
The mossy cirque with neutral tints Of gray; and deep, with berries bowed,
The buckbush reddens 'mid the mints.
O’erhead the forest scarcely stirs;
The wind is laid; the sky Is blue;
Bush-elover, with its links of burs.
And some last blooms—few, pink of hue—
Makes wild the way; and everywhere Slim, white-ribbed cones of fungi strew The grass that’s like a wild man's hair.
The jewel'Weeds, whose pods bombard The hush with fairy batteries Of seeds, grow dense here; pattering hard Their sacs explode, persuade the eyes To search the heaven for show'rs. One seems To walk where old Enchantment plies Her shuttle of lost days and dreams.
THE chief attractiveness of these minor poems lies in their artlessness of phrase and in their suggestion of a leisurely method on the part of their author. The constant ruffling of leisure may be accountable for some of the loss of spontaneousness In our poetry. Spontaneity, like other qualities of art, is the product of slow time, in which sentiment and emotion have opportunity to gather weight and fervor, Mr. Cawein’s muse is neither languid nor distracted, but moves with a quaint and mild moderation characteristic of an earlier day. We can I very well spare thunderous passion and exalted transports for the sake of this simplicity and sensitiveness, What we cannot so well spare is the delicate ear th%t forbids rhymes like " storm" and
warm,
buzz.'
However we may sin in our pronunciation of common words, we find it difficult to forgive the enshrining of such pronunciation in the sacred precincts of poetry.
MR. CAWBIN’S poetry also shows an unmistakable familiarity with the present facts of nature. He obviously has found his inspiration in the fields and not in the library, and he uses his materials with regard for observed facts as well as for the inner sentiment of a scene. It is not easy to think that he would produce an impassioned poem as Rossetti did, on a flower which he had seen only in a botanical book, and from an Impulse supplied only by a promise made to himself to write a poem a day for a certain period. Rossetti’s little tour-de-force was delightful, but it lacked the pleasant objective honesty of vision that unites so graciously with a warm imagination in pf>ems like the follow* ihg on 11 Late October Woods ”:	:	*	-
