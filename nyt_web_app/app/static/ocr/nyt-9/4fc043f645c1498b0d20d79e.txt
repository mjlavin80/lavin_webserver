A RUSSO-AMERICAN.
The Story of the Son of an American Piowmaker and a Rus-sinn Princess,*
T seems to be a risky thing, even for a story teller as accomplished as Octave Thanet, to leave the special field in which she has won her fame and to try ! for laurels of anottier sort, for certain- ! ly no such perfection of matter and | manner resides in her novel “ The j Man of the Hour ’* as has Ion# been characteristic of her magazine work. One misses those clearly drawn types of the Middle West and the clever setting of landscape and events that made each one of her short stories of almost historical value, and one finds in their place some very interesting people, indeed, but they are not necessarily of any particular locality, and a tenuous plot that is made to order that some Socialistic elements with which the author has burdened it may be expounded in three parts. To be sure, the sociology is meant to play an important part in the development of the story's principal character, but it doesn't, and, in spite of the author’s unfailing1 wit and best endeavors, ner fine art is obscured by heaviness and one has an overweening desire to skip over the theorizing in order to follow the really bright and entertaining story .of the book.
The basis of the plot is the marriage of a Western piowmaker and a Russian Princess with inconveniently Nihilistic tendencies. The explanation of the incongruous mating is that the lady’s relatives were glad to be rid of a dangerous element in the family and that'she herself accepted her American suitor as an escape from a life whiih she hated, doing it with no sentimental illusions whatever. As the piowmaker, hard-headed, silent business man though he was, did have illusions concerning the Princess, the first jarring note in their union came soon. Even the birth of their son, Johnny-Ivan— named John by his father and Ivan by his mother—only increased the breach between their utterly irreconcilable natures and gave them a new and leep-er cause for hostility, since each wished to absorb the boy’s love and loyalty to the exclusion of the other.
Inevitably poor little '* Jo'nivan,” as his childish sweetheart Peggy called him, had a hard time of it between his adoration of his beautiful mother and his instinctive, though somewhat timid and represser7., affection for his.irfunt, honest father, and that portion of the story which is devoted to the course of events in the house of Winslow up to Mrs. Winslow's dramatic departure to her kindred spirits in Switzerland, is thoroughly enjoyable. Peggy and Johnny-Ivan are far and away the most charming little youngsters that have made their appearance in the world of fiction for a long time. They grow up into very beautiful examples of fine youth and maid, and the story of the chase Miss Peggy led her lover before capturing him is never lacking in interest or entertainment except when poor Johnny-Ivan's Russian-Socialistic inheritances obscure for a time his good, sensible American instincts. Then the rush of events has to yield to the moral and economic lessons to be inculcated, and one becomes just as disgusted with Johnny-Ivan's nonsense ss did dear-eyed Peggy,
It was only after his parents were both -dead and Johnny-Ivan had learned by his own bitter experience many unwelcome things about the brotherhood of man, that the Johnny in him altogether prevailed over what the Ivan represented in his name, and he was proud to become a worker in the Old Colony Plow Company. For that inevitable day his loving and far-seeing old father had made ample provision, and the stcry ends with Johnny recovering under Peggy's ministrations from the casualties incident to a batUe against his whilom friends among the strikers.
It is needless to assure the readers of “The Man of the Hour’’ that every one of the characters in it is interesting and well developed, and that its pages are full of evidences of the author*? keen and kindly stufty of men and things and of her aptitude for the
