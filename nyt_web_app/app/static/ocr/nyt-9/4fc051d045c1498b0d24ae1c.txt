The point In *'S. B/s/Metter about the ** seven wounds *’ of Christ seems to me somewhat concealed by a possible typographical error; but as I;discern it, his contention is that Mrs. Browning wrote “ seven words and not either “ five " or i “ seven wounds.” I think *' S. B.’* makes a good argument in support of his sug-! gestJon; and I' have placed his letter in ! my copy of the Cambridge edition. " Seven words,” which were spoken, is more intelligible than “ seven wounds,’*
which were really only five.	__B-
