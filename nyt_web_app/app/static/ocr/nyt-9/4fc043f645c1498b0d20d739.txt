NEDRA Is not the pretty girl adorning Mr. McCutcheon’s cover, but a fascinating: island provided for the reception of the shipwrecked, and, incidentally, as in Charles Reade’s " Foul Play,” for the resorting of mismated lovers.	"
The story begins conventionally enough in a Chicago -drawing room with a betrothed pair of millionaires planning an elopement to avoid a fashionable wedding, but the elopement itself is far from conventional. and leads to " a pretty kettle of fish." The story is full of needlessly absurd complications, but, as it is not to be taken seriously, the reader enters no demurrer pave at a single point. We have all laughed at the child's definition of a lie as “an abomination to the Lord, and a very present help In time Of trouble.” The novelist of the day—for Mr. McCuteh-'on is not the sole offender—seems to have forgotten altogether the first part of the definition, for his heroes and* heroines use the lie as a legitimate means of removing difficulties and attaining their ends. Truth Is a virtue so rare, and, at the same time, so essential to character, that even tho spinner of nn airy tale commits a wrong if he seems to hold it in light esteem. He is adding to the disintegrating Influences that too surely crumble the Ideals of youth.
Save for this disfigurement, ** Nedra *’ Is an amusing extravaganza, just what one would choose to while away a tedious hour. It belongs to the novels of recreation pure and simple, and well fulfills its purpose of robbing the reader of the sense of time.
