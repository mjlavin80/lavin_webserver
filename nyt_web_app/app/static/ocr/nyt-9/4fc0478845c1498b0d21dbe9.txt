IN the very beginning- of his hook on , '* The Essentials of Spirituality,” 'which Is published to-day by James Pott & Co., Dr^ Felix Adler, the 'well-known ethical culturist, *' hazards" a definition of the term ** spiritual,*' and writes;
In the region of mental activity, which Is called the spiritual life, vagueness is apt to prevail, the outlines of thought are apt to be blurred, the feelings aroused are apt to be indistinct and transitory. The •word " spiritual " becomes a synonym of muddy thought and misty emotionalfsm. If there were another word in the language to take its place ft would be well to use it. But there is not- We must use the word *' spiritual,” despite its associations and its abuse. We shall endeavor, however, to attach a distinct and definite meaning to the word.
And to make the meaning of " spiritual " clearer he describes some types of character, combined with definition— Savonarola. .Washington, John Howard, George Peabody, and some others.
