THE, SCOTTISH MARY.
Two More Books About the Unfortunate Stuart Queen and More to Come.
HE most fascinating character in all history is Mary Stuart, according to Hilda F. Skal, author of a new ** Life of Mary Queen of Scots," (Lippincott,) and from the number of the books that have been written about her, the variety of attempts that
v
have been made to elucidate her character and to disentangle the rights and wrongs that directed and determined her fate, it would seem that the characterization must be just- The fascination of the Scottish Queen for historical students is unceasing. The two newest contributions to the literature concerning her are not among the more critical. The authors have no new facts to produce, and the interpretations they put upon known ones offer little of striking originality. Mr. A- H. Millar, author of ** Mary Queen of Scots: Her Life Story,'* (Scribner's,) observes that the difficulty of analyzing Mary’s character rests not In its subtlety, but In that simplicity and trustfulness which—in the early portion of her career, at least—led her to perform acts of unpardonable weakness, fraught with disaster both to herself and her subjects: Nor is the difficulty decreased by the fact that the historians of her reign have presented accounts garbled by party feelings and religious prejudice—on the one side Catholic, on the other Protestant—that have “ made her life a riddle and her character an enigma.”
A BOOK OF FACTS.
Mr. MILLAR’S book is a careful presentation of facts, with a due regard for the bearing of the political questions of the time. It is, in truth, a well-writ ten piece of history. He is inclined to favor the Scottish'Queen, and to hold her innocent of at least many of the sins and crimes that are charged against her, Yet he'Is not her partisan through thick and thin. And there are places in which he corrects even recent historians, as Andrew Lang. Thus, he speaks of those treaties, " strange documents ” he calls them, that Mary signed as a girl twenty days before her marriage to the Dauphin of France, promising in one to give the kingdom of Scotland to the Tring of France should she die without issue; in another, in case she was childless, to make the kingdom over to the King of France, " until he was repaid a million of money.** Dr. Fleming believes she signed them without realizing their import Mr. Lang declares them merely Infamous on the part of her nodes the Guises, and thinks that she was intelligent enough to understand them, if she looked into them. Mr. MHlax, however, points out that these documents were canceled by the later declarations which she publicly signed binding herself to maintain the liber* ties of her kingdom; and It is ** absurd *• to accuse her of duplicity in the matter.
RICCIO AND DOTUWBLL,
AS to Ricclo, the present historian agrees with Mr. Lang in refusing to believe that Mary had any passion for Wwy and considers tbe likeliest cause of his condemnation to have been suspicion that he was a secret emissary of the Pope; while Damley’s folly 'could have been so worked upon by the Scottish lords as to make him believe anything. And what of Damiey's fate? The Scottish lords entered into an agreement that he should not be allowed to rule, and that they should all support whatever action should be taken against him. If Mary knew of this agreement, she must be held guilty of her husband’s murder. The most that her historian can say Is that “ the evidence Is by no means clear

has been made of Mary’s favor for him, shown in
many ways. The best that can be said of It is that
she had nobody to trust, and may have thought that
if she had him on her side she could defy the rest of
the band who blew up the Kirk o* Field and laid
Darnley's dead body upon the ground. Was Mary a
willing captive when Bothwell abducted her on her
subsequent journey to Edinburgh? . Mr. Lang thinks
she was, and that she was not proof against his
charms; Mr. Millar can only advance against this
the improbability of the circumstances accompanying
and following it, and the difficulty of reconciling
Mary’s words and acts with such a state of mind.
When Mary was tried by Elizabeth at Westminster
and the charge of murdering Darnley was brought
against her, the famous Casket letters were produced in evidence—letters supposed to have been written by her to Both well while she was nursing Darnley at Glasgow. About these a long historical controversy has raged. Mr. Miilar quotes Andrew Lang's conclu* sion that they are partly genuine, and sufficient to tell against Mary’s innocence. On the other hand, he gives prominence to the fact that they were considered unworthy of credence by both Elizabeth and her Commissioners. And as to this trial, it is certain that, guilty or not, she was foully wronged. Her career was checkered: but the errors she commited were more of the heart than of the head, and her ill-treatment throws a halo over it all. Such is the conclusion of this historian, who la on the whole her strong partisan.
A BOOK OP FANCIES.
VERY little concerned with disputed historical points and the weight of blame to be given to the hapless Queen is Hilda Bkal. A narrative bringing out into strong relief the sentimental and pathetic features is what she provides, yet not without ample quotation of original documents. For her, Mary was reconciled and all devotion to Darnley in his last illness and at the time of his death. Both-well was her captor, hated and feared; she no willing captive, and forced against her wish into the marriage with him. Such a thing as a passion for that unscrupulous schemer on her part is unthinkable. The judgment on the Casket letters is that they are in a style of composition entirely different from that of her authentic documents, and that the harsh and unpoetical sonnets they contain are in strange contrast with her acknowledged verse, musical and graceful- “ There still exist persons ** who are capable of believing in them; and though the discussion of them is beyond the scope of the author’s purpose, it is clear that she will not for a moment consider them. Quite aa little will she consider any of the other evidence that critical writers have had to consider as to the blamelessness of Mary Queen of Scots. And from this point of view she has written a vivid and interesting account of the ill-fated Queen.
