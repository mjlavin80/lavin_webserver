A'etr York Times Saturday Rcrzetc of Boohs:
A correspondent revives the often-slain story of Whalley's burial in New Haven, disputing, in your number of Aug. 26, your statement of his death in 1674. He says correctly that Dixwell’s grave on the green at New Haven was marked by a monument and surrounded by a railing at the expense of his descendants, and wonders why Whalley’s grave, with its head and foot stones marked " E. W.," has had no monument placed over it to his memory.
Blake’s " Chronicles of New Haven Green." Page 250, states that the committee which placed the Dixwell monument in 1849.	" after careful Inquiry,"
had come to the conclusion that the stones marked “ E. W." did not mark Whalley’s grave. He adds: "There is little doubt that Whalley died in Hadley about 1C74 or 1075." Each of the " E. W." stones is marked 1658*	t
It has been supposed that " E. W*" might have been Edward Wigglesworth, who died in 1653, No doubt the correct theory is that of R. P. WakPhian, author of the ** Wakeman Genealogy," who notes that Elizabeth Wakeman died after a certain time in 1656 and before 1660; wife of John Wakeman, Treasurer of the colony. and daughter of William Hopkins, “ a gentleman of rank and fortune," who was elected a member of the Long Parliament in -1647.	,
