THE CONQUERING WILL. By Silas K-Hocking. author of " When L.lfe Is ' His Father,” &c. With original tlons by Harold mriard. 1-mo. T»p. -E-*-Ncw York: Frederick Warne & Co.
HOW a selfish woman “ with nerves/' ruled her father’s bouse and made herself a nuisance in an otherwise amiable family circle, and how the same woman found a husband who was, to use her own words, a brute (thougrh a curate) and did not believe in nerves, Is a part of this story by Silas Hocking. The other part of It concerns a younger sister of the nervous lady and a rising painter man. The narration tells how Bazll Pen-darvis received from rich Peter Cleveland, an honest country gentleman, a commission to paint his beautiful daughter Dorothy, aged 20 years, and how Basil went down into the country to execute that commission.
In Squire Cleveland’s house the artist fell in love with his subject, and not only painted her portrait, but found in her inspiration for a masterpiece which was the talk of the town that year. Dorothy went to town to look at the masterpiece! and the young people were just beginning- to be ** perfectly happy ** when the
lady with nerves (called Elizabeth) flew
into convulsions and threatened to die if
her dear sister left her side to go to any wretch jd man. There the trouble begins. And for a time it promises to be very heavy trouble indeed, with despair and suicide. However, there was a self-sacrificing friend to prevent that extreme,
and presently appeared the curate to renew Elizabeth's interest in life. The way that lady kidnaps the curate and marries hfm—under the erroneous impression that tie is a tame sort of man—furnishes
the most amusing part xjf an otherwise
rather commonplace story.
