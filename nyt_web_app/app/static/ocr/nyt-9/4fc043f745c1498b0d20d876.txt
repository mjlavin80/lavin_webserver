differed from most of the rivers of the grlobe in this rcspect. Greeks. Romans, and Mohammedans, Jews, Christians, and Crusaders, knew every nook and cranny of Its winding course, but faih-d to realize that while its head and source rested high on noble Hermon's aide, its mouth in the Dead Sea was far below the surface of the habitable world and ail the surrounding oceans.
THE JORDAN VALLEY.
A Journey Along Its Eastern Side to Petra in the Land of Edom.*
the	conjunction	and	co-
operation of a Professor of Physical Geography and of a missionary we owe the present book. To the former we assume that we are indebted for the descriptions	it contains,	for	the
scientific data; to	the latter, for	the	conventional clerical	" appreciations	" of	the
various spots made familiar by sacred history. Apart from this unimportant drawback of mixing pulpit and physical
geography, however, the book is excellent, and gives a good description of*The present condition of the country through which the Israelites passed before they entered the Promised Land.

MESSRS. Libbey and Hoskin avoided the troubles which form the staples of most travelers' b.c- ! counts of Syria and the Holy Land* They had a letter from the Waly of Damascus to the Mutaserrif of Kerak, directing him to take them down to Petra, in Edom, and to bring them back; they contracted with a man to provide horses and mules and a complete outfit of tents, beds, cooking utensils, and the dally meals. Mrs. Hoskins told the contractor what they did not want, “ No cold boiled eggs for luncheon, no chickens except in cases of dire extremity, no indigestible pastries for show and remorse, a minimum of sardines, but plenty of good, plain, substantial food." The man carried out the contract. too—*' we ate warm luncheons every day in the wilderness." Further the travelers had rifles, and provided themselves with game, and—a tip to the next comers—they shot at a mark every afternoon when they halted, and thus instilled respect into the minds of the natives, so that they were not attacked by Bedouin robber or local sneak thief Their trip was from Joppa, by sea, to Sidon and eastward to Mount Lebanon, then south to the Sea of Galilee, along the eastern Side of the Jordan Valley to Petra, and then back to the Dead Sea, and west of it to Jerusalem and Joppa, “ the point or place of beginning." Dr. Libbey’s purpose was to study the valley of the Jordan from beginning to end; Dr. Hoskins, a former student, now a missionary, went with him to make his path pleasant. Both were successful.
Modern Sidon is a paradise for archaeologists. Forty feet under the founda- ; tion for the American boys' school clean sea sand was found, with charcoal from a fire that was cold before history began; 1 under a missionary’s house was found a j hall dating from the Crusades 9G feet long, 26 feet wide, and 21 feet to tho centre of Its arched root Within tho mouth of the Jordan, in the Sea of Galilee, where Peter and his brother Andrew were fishermen, the travelers found men roasting fish on fire of coals, as described In John xxl.; and they note that,
“ curiously enough, the present owner of the Government privilege to catch fish In the lake Is a Jew, and the man engaged j in cleaning the fish is also a Jew, but all the fishermen and owners of the boats are Moslems/'
At El Abadiyeh, below the Sea of Galilee, where the Jordan Is fordable, they found their first good specimens of a “ wood saint"
I
A couple of straggling trees mark the I resting place of some holy Moslem- The grave has made the trees sacred, has ; given them a new name, ‘ Fakireh' poor, and has rendered them safe from outrage I for ages to come. The grave of the holy man and. the sacred trees convert the spot Into a sort of sanctuary or ' safety do-posit' and here the superstitious people bring firewood, roof-timbers, old doors and windows, agricultural implements, wooden measures, and household vessels lor safe keeping. They are safer here than they couid possibly bo under lock and key in their wretched homes. So It 1 comes to pass that these Moslem ‘ wood- | saints' are a much more useful fraternity In preserving the firewood for tho community than certain other saints whose supposed powers save their devotees from the fires of another world.

TTTR authors were much Interested In ] the Jordan—Dr. Hoskins as a clergy- , man. Dr. Libbey as a man of science. : The latter suggests that the Jordan, after reaching a point below the level of the Mediterranean, finds its bed rising; this rising of the main surface to the south 1 would account for the meandering of the stream. He continues:
Perhaps the strangest thing about this famous river is that none of the ancients ever guessed [that its course was mostly below the level of the sea.] They journeyed up and down the valley since before the days of Abraham; they climbed down tho roads from Jerusalem to Jericho, and up into Moab and Edom; they built roads east and west of the Jordan; they built roads and bridges and cities far below the level of the Mediterranean, and yet never seem to have suspected that thiq stream

IT v.as only in 1SJ17	that	two	Englishmen proved this	fact;	and	only	in
1S74 was the depth of the Dead Sea level determined at 1,*J!V2 feet below that of the Mediterranean, while the bottom of the Dea Sea is 1,300 feet deeper yet. The cities of the Greek Decapolia wont down in the Mohammedan conquest 1/200 years ago; their people were exterminated, they themselves	were	left	and	remained empty, until	now	" we	have	in
many of them tho most porfeet illustration of a Grecian city that the modern world can ever hope to see.’* At El-Husn, in the land of Gilead, the travelers enjoyed a surprise. “ While in the act of dismounting on the threshing floors just at sunset we were startled by the sound of a steam whistle! There, not 2i>0 yards from our tents, was a small building in which a bustling little steam engine was running a smaJl grist mill, and this shrill note was a notice to itself and master that it was about time to quit work for the day! " At Madcba the travelers saw the remains of an ancient mosaic map, discovered before 18S4, and now covered by the Russian Church, one of the pillars of which was placed in its centre. This is. Dr. Libbey holds, the second great discovery beyond the .Jordan, the Moa~ bite stone being the first. It dates from the fifth century, is drawn from east to west, and possibly as M. Clermont Granneau suggests, is a geographical picture of the land on which Moses looked from Mount Plsgah before he died, (Ma-deba is in the shadow of Mount Nebo and Mount Pisgah,) a brilliant suggestion, says Dr. Libbey, " which by its peculiar fitness carries almost the weight of written testimony." At Madoba also was a great pool, covering some two acres, which held the rainfall of the wfdO slope, and must have been a great treasure In the dry plateau. "It is not many years since it was used by the Bedouins, who had frequent bloody encounters around it When the Turkish Government came into the country it put an end to these feuds by tearing out the wall, so that the tank no longer retains any water and hence the Bedouins do not fight over it! ’’
' At Petra, in Edom, the travelers remained several days, and most of the second volume is devoted to their explorations there. All along their route Messrs. Libbey and Hoskins took ph6tograpl\s, but nowhere were these so good as in the little known ruined city of Petra, where only twenty-five Europeans have been in a century. These photographs lend an added value to the account which is of
exceeding interest.
