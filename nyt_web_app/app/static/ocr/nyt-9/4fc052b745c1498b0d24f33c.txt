2	Fergus Hu mo, has devised another of * his hide-and-seek, jack-o*-lantern murder mysteries. It begins with a queer and rich Old woman found stubbed to death tn her chair and not a. clue to the mUT-
Utrer, Then so marvy clues turn up that even the story-book detective is bewildered. Then nearly everybody turns out to be somebody else under an alias, and all the clues lead nowhere, till at the last moment the only person who is unsuspected and above suspicion confesses to the crime. Meantime there is a young gentleman involved who is very much in love With a young lady, who is also Involved, and a dark beauty who runs a gambling house and looks very interesting upon a couch— being a cripple—and a sentimental maidservant and a weak-minded young scamp with a wicked and silly mother of a literary turn, and an Earl, and two very suspicious. lowering male characters, and a j suspicious lady who is their companion. Besides, of course, the detective, who has a love affair of his own.
The scenery includes a quaint cottage— that in vrhich the old woman is murdered—
; an old ruin next door with tangled shrubbery and a wall around it, a crooked lun«
1 leading to the cottage, the gambling house In Soho, the literary lady's ** salon *’ and, of course, the secret passage.
