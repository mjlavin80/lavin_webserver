A7ctc Torfc Times Saturday Revieto of Books:
Mr,. Edgar Saltus, in the first of his in- -teresting- articles: In Munsey's Magazine ‘ on Russian rtilers, says that the word
•	'* czar *' Is, according’ to Orientalists, of Hebrew origin. The offhand bit of information’does not seem of enough importance to' challenge, since these articles are to be taken for entertainment rather , than seriously, but, on the whole, even a little grain of truth I3 worth preserving.
I If the Hebrew word referred to is a very old one, its likeness to the word “ czar ” must be regarded as, a coincidence. It might, however, be a comparatively modern w^ord, Introduced into the Hebrew at 'a, time when the Oriental races came into contact with Roman civilization, after the removal of the seat of government to Constantinople, In the course of time, in the Latin language itself, the name of Caesar became the equivalent of the word “ imperator." and among the Greek writers of the Byzantine period it was so ' commonly used--to express the imperial office that Gibbon, in his history, adopts the practice. Thus the name of Caesar became the synonym of the idea of power. from which the word “ imperator ” was derived, and so It passed into other 1 tongues. The tribes of NorUieastem Europe, as they merged into States, derived their religious and civil polity from Constantinople, just as ‘Western Europe received it from Rome. The derivation of the word " kaiser" from the name of Caesar is so manifest that it does not call for argument. Charlemagne, the first of German Emperors, received his crown at Rome from the hands of the Pope, and assumed the title, as he believed he was ascending the throng of the Caesars. It is not to be supposed that we pronounce the word Caesar in English just as it was pronounced in the ancient Latin. It is very probable that the second syllable was accented, and pronounced about the same as In our English we might pronounce the word ** czar.’'
