Mother Goose Expurgated — New Volume by the Committee of Fifty—Other Books and New Editions.
1
>DERN Bostonians sometimes wonder why, considering the almost painful outspokenness of their philanthropic and speculative townsmen, and the really appalling frankness of some Boston women engaged in " reform," New York and Chicago should represent Boston with the aspect of a mincing spinster, the deportment of Mrs. General, and the delicacy of Mr. Podsnap. They will wonder no longer when they examine “ The Only True Mother Goose," published by Mun-roe & Francis in 1833, and now reproduced by Messrs. Lee & Shepard, with an introduction from Dr. Hale vouching for it as the Mother Goose on which the old Boston line was brought up.” The excruciating propriety of part of this collection would assuredly have its effect on those reared upon such intellectual diet, and would have amazed those whose tastes were formed on the frank Rhymes, Chimes, and Jingles ” of a later “ Mother Goose.” For instance, the painful coarseness of " Thirteen fourteen. Maids a-courting; Fifteen sixteen. Maids a-kissing," is changed by substituting Draw the curtain ” and " The Maid's in the Kitchen.” “ Charlie loves good brandy.” becomes ” Charley loves good candy." the dear child! The horseshoer’s ditty “ Is John Smith in? Tes, stripped to the skin." becomes " Is Master Smith Within? Yes, that he is! ” The reproduced proface. Itself a copy of an anonymous letter in The Boston Transcript, blu shingly refers to a small book published m London two centuries earlier and containing not only “ many of the Identical pieces in this book.” but also some that the American (Italicised) types of the present day would refuse I to give off [sic] an impression,” Notwithstanding which. the *‘ American types,'* in real Innocence retained an , Elizabethan ejaculation disused in Eng- ; land since Stuart days. The little book 1 Is sure to be much discussed.
The Committee of Fifty, organized in ; 893, closes its labors with " The Liquor Problem,” summarizing the contents of ! former volumes containing the work of ! -»ub-comraittees. The value of this series lies in. its entire freedom from prejudice of any species, and its five volumes present the matter from the point of view Of the physiologist, the economist, the legislator, and the moralist, ■with strict reference to experiments and statistics, and indulging in no speculation.
This book will appear tn a fortnight, when the publishing season will begin for Messrs. Houghton. Mifflin & Co.. and then will come also the “ Complete Poetic and Dramatic Works of George Gordon, Lord Byron,” the first “ Cambridge ” edition issued under Mr. Bliss Perry's general editorship. The notes and biographical introduction summarize the latest knowledge of Byron, and the poems have been so arranged as to clarify their relations to one another and to the poet’s life for readers coming- to them with no previous knowledge of either.

after a meal of beans, accidentally soaked in brandy, ran away between plucking and singeing and afterward faced the world in a red flannel coat. Colored pictures by Miss Ethel N. Farnsworth illustrate the book within and without. This book aiso comes from Park Street.
“ The Roses of Saint Elizabeth," by Mrs. Jane Scott Woodruff, is intensely 1 Protestant In spite of its title, and an agreeable presentation of the story of the royal saint. Its theme Is Warburg and Luther and his translation of the Bible. It has end papers in two colors, designed by Miss Blanche McManus, and four remarkably well-drawn colored pictures by Miss Adelaide Eberhart. Its publishers are Messrs. Ij. C. Page & Co.
Messrs. Little, Brown & Co. have a pretty story by Miss A. G. Plympton on their list, a school story so arranged as to convey lessons of kindness to animals and birds. It is to be illustrated by Miss Clara
E.	Atwood, and will be entitled " The Schooihouse in the Woods." Miss Helen Leah Reed, although she has dismissed^ her first heroine, “Brenda,'’ takes one of her friends for the chief character in a new series, which will open with “ Amy in Acadia."
An Instructive but agreeable book appears in a little collection of stories, entitled " Boys Who Became Famous Men," a volume by Miss Harriet Pearl Skinner. Canova’s butter lion; Chopin's musical story planned to quiet his school fellows; Cimabue's discoverey of Giotto; Byron's sudden passage from commoner to peer: Gainsborough's sketch of the pear thief In his father’s orchard; Coleridge’s " Blue Coat ” days; Handel’s appearance at the Grand Ducal Court when only his father was expected, and Bach's memorizing of the music that he was forbidden to play from his brother’s notes are the subjects.
The newsboy who became a millionaire was a joke among young readers long before he departed from fiction, but the newsboy whom Mrs. Grace Le Baron Up-ham brings forward in “ The Children of Bedford Court ” is not much richer at the end than at the beginning of the tale, but he has been thoroughly and consistently patriotic. He is perhaps a shade too good for a boy, but one or two of his species do no harm in a season. This book is issued by Messrs. Lee & Shepard, and so is Mrs. Emma Lee Benedict’s “ The Gregory Guards,” which, in spite of its military title, is a story of philanthropy and business, showing boys at work improving the new opportunities afforded by new conditions of living.

Hari'ard men will find a “ memoir ’’ much to their taste in a volume by Dr. James J. Putnam, add^d to the Fall list of Messrs. 'Houghton. Mifflin & Co. since the preparation of their Autumn bulletin. It recounts the life story of that good physician of whose cnaracter and speech one might form a fair idea from studying the doctors in Dr. Holmes’s novels, Dr. James Jackson. It might be called '* Memoirs of a Harvard Family,” for Dr. Jackson’s father. Jonathan, was graduated from Harvard in 1761; Dr. Jackson himself was both graduate and professor at the Medical School; his brother Charles, whose daughter Dr. Holmes married, was a graduate and a Judge of the Supreme Court, and this is only the beginning of the list of men of whom Dr. Putnam writes in detail. Dr. Jackson was one of the founders of the Massachusetts General Hospital and the McLean Asylum for the Insane, and was beloved by his patients as deeply as he was reverenced by his students.
