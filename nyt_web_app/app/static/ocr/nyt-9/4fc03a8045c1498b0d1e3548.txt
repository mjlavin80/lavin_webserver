WHILE it is Sir Walter Armstrong's purpose to describe the collection of paintings made by the second Sir Robert Peel, which was purchased in 1871 for the National Gallery from the third baronet, he incidentally has something to say concerning the origin of the characteristic Dutch school, the ideals of its best masters, and their success in carrying out those ideals. He also writes about the artists represented in the collection, examples of whose works illustrate the present volume (“ The Peel Collection nnd the Dutch School of Painting,” by Sir Walter Armstrong, Director of the National Gallery of Ireland. Long octavo. Pp. 82. Illustrated. Cloth. New York:
E.	P. Dutton & Co. $2.00)-Metsu, Ter-boroh. Vermeer, De Hooghe, Jan Steen, van Ostade, the van de Veldes, Wouver-mun, Hobbema. Ruisdael, Cuijp, de Koninck, Hals. Rubens. Netscher, Coques, Dou, Wynants, Karel du Jardin-—dividing them into groups representing painters of society, landscape, figures, animals, their own people; painters of still life, the city, and the sea. Besides all this, a chapter is devoted to the telling of how the Peel collection was made, in which are several letters written to Reginald Smith, the auctioneer, and Peel’s agent.
The illustrations number four photogravure plates of Terborch’s “ The Guitar Lesson,'* Rubens's ” The Chapeau de Poil,” de Hooghe's “ Court of a Dutch House." and Hobbema's ■* The Avenue, Middelharnis," and two dozen half-tone full pages, including examples by Rubens, Mieris. Steen, van Ostade, Jardin, and others, and presenting “ A Family Portrait,’* “ The Triumph of Silenus,” ** The I Music Lesson.” “ A Village Scene,” i “ Landscape with Figures," " A Gale,*1 i “ A Street in Cologne." &e.
It has been Sir Walter’s aim throughout his.book, he writes, to suggest that the Dutch painters were as elemental artists as those of any other country, speaking the same language as the great Italians I of the sixteenth century, or the great Athenians of twenty centuries before, and that their difference, so far as it existed, to ideas outside their art, should not, and, as a matter of fact, does not, affect their fame. The nature they chose to illustrate was inferior in beauty to that on which Titian and Giorgione embroidered their gorgeous decorations, but no art has ever yet been condemned for the humbleness Of Its materials. As artists they will be judged, anti as artists their one weak point is their incapacity to improve on those realities of external nature among which they sought their medium of expression.
