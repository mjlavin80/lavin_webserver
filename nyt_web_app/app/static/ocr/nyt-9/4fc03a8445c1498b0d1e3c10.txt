HANDBOOK of pictorial art that combines simplicity with real intelligence should always find a ready welcome both with public and reviewers, For there is perhap3 no subject on which, even among persons of more than average cultivation, so little knowledge and insight is to be found. We all have a decent appreciation of music and literature, but every one will have met scores of educated people, who, in their heart of hearts really preferred Guido Reni’s sentimental Mary Magdalene to the Manna Usa, and Raphael's Madonnas to the wistful beauty of Botticellfs women, or (of a later period) the Salome and Virgin of Luini.
Dr. Arthur Mahler has classified the Italian paintings in the Louvre according to the accepted periods, and discusses the works of each school In some detail. He assumes on the part of the reader little or no information, but points out elementary aspects of each picture, and shows progressively the evolution of art. The only charge to be brought against his text is the overstudious avoidance of anything like emphasis. A. single example of this extreme quiet of manner will suffice. The subject is the “Old Man and Child” of Ghirlandajo. Dr. Mahler says: “ The picture is a symphony in red. The old man, with all his ugliness, is carefully treated, and there is so much love in his eyes, and tuch affectionate confidence in the look of the child, that we must believe the little one to be his grandson." Here, surely, moderation defeats its own end. The ignorant reader will glance at the picture and pass on. Yet this picture of Ghirlandajo is a rare and beautiful masterpiece. True, the old man is ugly, but with no ignoble ugliness. The great sweep of his arched forehead and his firm though sensitive mouth, show thoughtfulness and character and rich emotion. Merely to say, furthermore, that there is love in his eyes is quite lame and Inadequate. There la tho concentratcd regret of old age in that downward glance, large hope for the future of the little boy, and sadness, too, In the foresight of those coming years. The child’s head, and his wonderful, clinging little hand ha^e a poignant and yearning beauty. Outside of the window beside which the two sit we catch a glimpse or spacious landscape, of winding stream, and terraced hill Into the distance. Still, Dr, Mahler is not at all times quite so un-cmphatlc as here, and the other extreme, so often found in books on art, of gush or strident admiration, would have done far more to Impair the usefulness of his work.
THE first chapter deals With the painters in the conventonal Byzan-tne manner, wth glmpses and hopes of gradual disenthrallment from Cimabue to Fra Angelico. Here Dr. Mahler is thoroughly intelligent and instructive* The next chapter deals with that extraordinarily fascinating group of artists from Fra Aii^ellco to Messina. Here came almost at astride the liberation of art with light, grace and. above all, imaginative power. The.very first masterpiece of the new school, M The. Beheading of St. John the Baptist," bj\ Fra Angelico, though still with traces Of conventional stiffness, has In the background a vision of rolling hill and radiant sky. From Angelico, Dr. Mahler passes on to Fra Filippo Lippi, and then to the greatest of these, Sandro BotticellL Those dreams of Ineffable spiritual beauty, M The Virgin Writing the Magnificat,” and '* The Virgin, the Infant Jesus, and St John” are exceedingly well reproduced and discussed with generous sympathy and appreciation. In the discussion of Perugtno’s. M St. Sebastian ” Dr. Mahler might again have profitably struck a fuller note.
The succeeding period from Messina to Llonardo offers fewer points of Interest. There was progress in technical accom-pllshxncnt, coincident, of course, with the Introduction Into Italy of painting In oils, but not, it seems, a proportionate advance In vision or beauty. Then came Llonardo. Dr. Mahler's treatment of him is broad and full. More stress might, however,, have been laid on the ** Portrait of Lu-crezia Crivelli," not as great, of cour&e, as the Monna Lisa, but magnificent and ot xzarre Immediate,appeal. In regard to t£e Monna Lisa, Dr. Mahler wisely quotes Pater at length, to whose golden sentences of interpretation it were hopeless
to attempt to add a syllable. Two tery
Interesting men come -next, Solario and LulnL The greatness of the latter, especially, shoilld never be overlooked. In the eyes of his Salome (" Salome. Re cel v. irig the Head of John the Baptist") the ’ fires of all strange passions lie adream.

stress on his excessive mildness. Here, naturally, one misses a discussion of Michael Angelo, but the arrangement of that book precluded criticism of pictures not in the Louvre.
Then come the great Venetian colorists, with their apotheosis in golden lustre of exquisite human forms, GioKione, and Titian, and Tintoretto, and lastly, Cor-regio. The great portraits of this group are also dealt with, but Dr. Mahler does not bring out quite clearly enough the difference of the Venetians from their predecessors, nor would one suspect from his pages the full greatness of Titian or Veronese—tho richness, boldness, and perfection of that art which mirrored so perfectly the pomp and splendor of the great age of the Venetian Republic.
On the painters of the decline of the Renaissance Dr. Mahler is severe. One can easily understand his impatience. The worst works of Guido Reni, false and sentimental, are the most popular, and are found in nearly every drawing room. That fact should not blind us to the very genuine beauty of his mythological pictures. There is also a good deal more to be said for the landscapes of Carracci than Dr. Mahler has seen fit to say.
The final chapter on Spanish paintings shares the merits of the others—clearness, simplicity, intelligence. It deals mainly, of course, with Velasquez and Murillo, their marvelous portraits, beggary, and Madonnas.	L. L.
