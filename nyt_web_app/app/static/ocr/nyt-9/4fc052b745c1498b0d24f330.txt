I W, D. Howells in The North American Review.
I must not do more than guess at his i authorship of '* The Breadwinners," or do other than passingly touch upon its traits, since he never would own it. It dealt with , the labor question in the old persuasion I concerning united labor, and it cannot be found a modern criticism of economic conditions. But it has great merit in its characterizations, especially those picturesque and eccentric embodiments of our life which seem always to have interested and amused Hay beyond others. The people in it apparently the most spontaneously and importantly treated are not the ** gentlemen," but the non-gentlemen, not because they were more to the author’s taste, but because they were more to his talent, and possibly more to his interest. The author, whether he was Hay or not. was like him in divining these as the more genuinely American, the more authentically Western, and what was always claiming Hay in his inventive work was the American and the Western. He felt it the material of the future. the stuff out of which a new manhood was to be fashioned into figures unseen before. 1 think the best things in “ The Breadwinners ” are the sketches of the local politicians, the leaders who can swing their wards; and, when the account is made up by the future literary historian. 1 believe the author, whoever he was, will be found to have first portrayed. If not first understood, the American boss, made or in the making. Toward our crude potentialities, his genius involuntarily turned from our provisional gentility, bearing the image and superscription of Europe, ineffectively graven or faintly stamped. It was his instinct for the value of the primitive -which enabled Hay to Know the greatness of Lincoln, though he long stood so close to it.
