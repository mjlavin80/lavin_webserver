DE WOLLANT has written
*
an interesting and" impartial book on Japan. Interesting almost any book on Jap~-n is as yet certain to be; but
the impartiality of this book is to be re-
i
marked, inasmuch a^ its author is a Russian.
The book opens with a short chapter descriptive of the Japanese islanis. This is followed by a historical sketch of the people^ who, M. de Wollant seems to believe, came from Korea. The Atnos, of course, are aborigines of the islands; the Japanese themselves, it seems certain, are not. The Japanese, like the Scythians, as
described by Herodotus, used to bury the retainers of royal persons along with their masters; M. de Wollant is to be congratulated on not assuming from this fact that the Japanese are descended from the Scythians of Herodotus. The custom lasted in Japan until A. D. G4C; then the Emperor expressed a wish that it should be abolished; and a courtier conceived the Idea of burying statues instead of living persons. It is often forgotten that until about tit)0 years ago Japan was open to outsiders; but M. de Wolhint remtads us of tho fact, and gives a brief history of the intercourse between that country and tho Western world.

RDM AN CATHOLIC priests made many converts during- the sixteenth cent-ur;> ; there war- :l dihedral in Nagasaki dedicated to the Virgin, and in liV&i there were three Catholic Princcs ruling in Japan—Kins Francis of Bungo, King BurtUolomy of Omura, and King Andrew of Arima. Tii^ Shoguns, who ruled from early in the seventeenth ccntury down to our own time, were responsible for the extirpation of t lie Christian and the closing of the doors against foreigners. "We Americans know how the doors were opened again.
A chapter on the future of Christianity in Japan is Interesting. The first Christians in the country were Catholics, and no Japanese suspected that Christianity had divisions. Then the religion was stamped out, to be brought back after two centuries, not by missionaries of one creed, but by those of a dozen creeds, each Of Which to its teachers was the only original. Among the stools of Christianity the Japanese belief is apt to fall to the ground. Still, Christianity is growing slowly, hut, as M. de Wollant says. " the Japanese, in assimilating Christianity, will give it their national color.*' At present they seem inclined to Unitarianism. Until the recent war the Russian Orthodox Church had a strong following.
Fart II. of the book deals with the author’s personal impressions of the country. derived from trips in Northern as well as in Southern Japan. In Posunai, in Northern Japan, the author stayed With a Japanese family, and describes his experiences in a house with nothing Kuro-pean about it.
The noise of removing the outer wooden sliding walls is terrific. The mistress of the house, before doing anything else in the morning, reaches for tobacco and Mnokes a small pipe. The pipe is pn tiny that sli * can take only 0110 Whiff. after which she emntics it On iifi 3£ll trfiy. Evtrv one who has slept in a Japanese house is familiar with the tap of the pipe against the ash tray. After this the Japanese lady goes to the bathroom to make her loilet, which consists in brushing her teeth with a wooden brush, during which time she coughs loudly and makes noises as if she were seasick. She does not wash her face, but wipes it with a soft brush, and powders herself and covers her lips with red salve. A Japanese lady's toilet ir not complicated, consisting only of a piece of stuff wrapped around her hips, the kimono, and a sash. While the mistress is dressing, the servant has dusted the room with a feather, placed a kettle wiili boiling water on the the water on the tea in a t warmed some fish, after w	_

THE ceremony of drinking tea Is decidedly a ‘‘function’’ among the Japanese. " The thing is not that you drink the tea but how you drink it, as there are three hundred movements of the hand in preparing the tea.” There are eight schools of tea-drinkers, each with secrets and mysteries. The architecture of the houses where* cha-no-yu or tea-meetings occur is distinguished by simplicity and elegance; the impression to be given is of separation from the world and solitude.
Invitations are sent a week ahead. It is customary for the guests to call on the host the day before the ceremony to thank him for the honor. At the appointed time (early hours are preferred) the guests enter the drawing room, and then the garden, which is arranged in a special man-
ner;, there they wash their mouths and' hanCs In a cistern, alter which they *rawt into the tea-room through a narrow entrance. As they enter they must admire the walls, pictures, flower arrangements. After a time the host brings tho utensils for making tea, and, saluting the guests, he commences to serve the tea, upon which the guests praise his exquisite manner and the beautiful tea things. Taking a cup, the host puts into it a few rpoonfuls of tea-powder, and pours upon it hot water, stirring it with a bamboo stirrer; then he hands it with great core-Miony io the guest of honor, who must take a seep forward and bend his knee to receive it. The guest returns to hia scat, drinks three sips, and passes the cup to his neighbors, who do the same until the cup has made the round. Complete silence is observed, except in answering the host, who inquires about the quality of the tea, or makes observations pertaining to the ceremony. After the ceremony the guests express their desire to see the utensils, and examine the tea cups, spoons, jar, trays, &c.	~
Finally a cup of tea is given to each guest, and the ceremonious part is ended; form Is laid aside, and every one talks with every one else.

IN Southern Japan M. de Wollant ascended Fusl Yuma. At Tarobo he left his horses, the rest of the way being through loose ashes. There the pilgrim generally buys a long staff, on which the priest puts the seal of the temple— presumably on the downard journey; the staff becomes a heirloom In his family. The road *s divided into ten stations, marked by shelters, which are practically eaves In the mountain side where pilgrims may rest. During three months of the year these stations have keepers, who provide tea and eggs, and some sort of meal. The author reached the sixth station. 10,000 feet high, before he stopped i for the night; when he waked he found the water frozen, so that washing was an unattainable luxury. From the eighth to the tenth station every step was a struggle.
Morning broke and the eastern horizon flamed with the coming day. Pink and gold rays of sunlight pierced the fog, illumined the height and penetrated the valleys. At our feet lay the beautiful Yam-anaka Lake, looking like molten steel; Oshima and the coast as far as Misashi, and on the right the heights of Hakone, green shores and the endless stretch of the sea.
At the top of the mountain is a temple the priest of which forbade the author to enter the crater on account of the gale; “and for my part," remarks M. de Wollant, “ I was very glad.” The descent was easy, ** especially sliding on the ashes,” and at Sedzi the author found a European house, built by the Englishman who had become a subject of the Alikado I and had a Japanese name. M. de Wollant does not give his name; was It Sir Edwin Arnold or Lafcadio Hearn?
The book ends with sections descriptive of the economical and financial situation in Japan and of the internal and foreign policy. From these it appears that the book dates from 1902, as 1901 is the latest date given. This being the case, in view of the publication date of the book, this paragraph might well have been omitted:
We know that capital is scarce in Japan and the percentage charged is more than ten on a good guarantee. Under these circumstances it would have been wiser for the Japanese financiers to refrain from unproductive militarism.
In spite of this outworn criticism, however—the American publishers are responsible for it rather than the author—the book is decidedly worth reading.
