HI IIRELL PROUDE. Memoranda and Comments. By Louise Imogene Guiney. With Illustrations. 8vo. Pp. xtx.-439. New York: E- P. Dutton & Co.
THE name of Richard Hurrell Froude fs less known to this generation fn connection with the Oxford movement than are some others^Newman’s and Pusey's and Keble's, for instance.. Yet he had much influence on the thought of the time and on several who were leaders. Newman calls him a pupil of Keble’s,
" formed by him and reacting on him a man of the highest gifts, gentle and tender of nature. He died prematurely, in 1S3G, the oldest of eight sons, of whojn James Anthony Froude was the youngest and destined to be the most famous. Miss Guiney’s book, which she does not call a biography, though In effect It is one, W a sympathetic account of his life, his character, and his work. It necessarily throw's much light on the intellectual and religious activities of the time in England, which are so important a part of the last century's intellectual history.
There is much in the book to illumine Froude’s strong and thoroughly manly spirit, his deep religious feeling, his ; “ fierce sincerity." There are copious : quotations from his letters and journals,
! some of the latter of an extremely intl-
i	mate character. He became a tutor in ! Oriel with Newman, and, with him, was dispossessed for his i\i.n90inPromlslnS' zeal in the Tractarian movement, which was repugnant to the Provost of the college.
I	But he never went over to Rome. His belief was, as his brother James Anthony has recorded, that the Church should be " unprotostantized." The Reformation was a " bad setting of a broken limb.” The limb needed breaking a second time, arjd then It would be equal to Its business. But Hurrell Froude's life was all too short to accomplish its work. He would have been taught the difference between fact and speculation, said his brother^ if he had lived. He did live long1 enough to make a deep impression, to reveal himself as a man of power, sometimes erratically expressed, but one whose influence on others lived after him through them.
Miss G-uiney’s first part tells the story of his life, with frequent autobiographic reinforcement from his own papers. The pccond part is given up to reprinting comments on him and his relation to the Oxford movement from the very considerable body of literature on the subject.
