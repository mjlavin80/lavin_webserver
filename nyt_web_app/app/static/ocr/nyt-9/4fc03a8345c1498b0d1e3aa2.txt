BRNARDIN DE SAINT-PIERRE. He made the acquaintance of Rousseau In 1771, seven years before the death cf that great Romantic. In the young colonial, unsuccessful but gifted, who sat at his feet, Rousseau recognized a spirit kindred to his own, and suggested that he should write a conclusion to “ Emile.*’ They were both naturalists, and. In >1 soil of way (not quite the same way) super-naturallsts. They botanized in the woods of Montmorency, and talked of Mauritius,
' and while examining a periwinkle with a passionate interest which a classic **ould never understand, they spoke of supernatural laws which feeding and Intuition may discover to the pure in heart. They had in common touching preference for the extremest simplicity of every day and a love of the rare, the singular, and the 5 extraordinary—the “ unsuspected isle in far-off seas": and each of them detested the customary artifice of civilized socict^. Though Bernardin ..refused to finish " Emile,” their friendship remained unimpaired, and When Rousseau died his disciples turned to his Norman rrlend from the Antilles as his probable successor, By that time Bernardin had given hostages to Fame in the shape of the " Voyage S. rile de France."
Bernardin de Saint Pierre is, in fact, the heir of Rousseau even as he is the immediate precursor of Chateaubriand, who owned himself his pup’l. And a Tier Rousseau’s death, Bernardin. remembering his long conversations with his dead friend, revived their vague religiosity, their «ense of a Paradise lost, but reattainable by a return to nature, r.nd his own intimate of a Providential Will hidden beyond i.p-pearar.ces. an J published tqohe nature studies whcse vague and fatuous optimism provokes a smile to-day, whi.h hit so accurately the :aste of 1784,
The last volume of tho “ Etu^O:-; de la Nature" ufj^rared in 17ft?, und r*int:iined “ Paul et Virginia," and here at last Bernardin shows irmseif a master—a small but exquisite genius in that chain of witnesses to the supremacy of nature, mystery, and feeling which we call the romantic movement- Much of the classic clings to him still, above all that delightful grace of temperance without which the greatest gifts fatigue even while they dazzle. A certain charm of serenity, which Chateaubriand was to compare to the pure and uniform beauty of moonlight, is (among the romantics) peculiar to Bernard in de Saint Pferre.
HIS TRIUMPHS CAME LATE.
FAME, influence, success ail came to Bernardin de Saint Pierre. But not when he was young. His ^e-lure Studies appeared in 1784, and Bernardin. who could not find a publisher, needed all his Norman patience^and tenacity in order to raise the necessary subscriptions. He Was 47 years old when his name a* SasJt ^found its wingsr he was over 50 when he J published " Paul et Virginle ’’ in 1788. ^ The long years of poverty, hope deferred, aod constant disappointment which had preceded this immense success had left their mark on his work. In any circumstances he would have been a man of melancholy, a dreamer of dreams, a builder of Utopias. But the misery of tin.1 world had entered into his soul and touched there the founts of hope and pity. The motto which "he chose for his ** Indian Cottage " might be written on the frontispiece of all his books—miser Is succuxrere disco.
No man had less sympathy for the ” in-diff£rents et riches volupteux "—Arthur Young's “ glittering beings ’—who formed so great a part of the society *«? Versailles. In his bland, cool, smiling way Bernardin fancied himself a reformer. He wrote a letter to tlie King and begged his Majesty to live no longer shut in by a close ring of privileged nobles, formea by a thousand families surfeited at the expense of the starving poor—4* car dies ont S. elles seules plus que tout le royauino ensemble **—but to establish a contact
those, thousand families,^^quisite,’;iIberal, :* sensible as they so oft'en ■frere toward’ 1790, lay the natural public-of a^Bernar-din de Saint Pierre, When the Revolution . came it brought in Its handnot peace but a sword; it said to LavolBler, 14 the Republic‘can do without men of science it said to Chfinier, the^tepubllc needs no poets." Bernardin was happier than they, for no patriotic tribunal Bent hlmto the guillotine; but the Revolution showed him clearly that he was but anvagreeable^u-perfluity.
The temper of the man comes'out in his attitude during that season of fetorm and stress. Amiable, dreamy, almost noncha--lant, Bernardin lost nothing of his serenity; cKsarly that prominent feminine brow of his has been kissed by a fairy in the hour of his birth, and the fairy protects him still, hides him in a fold of her mantle, waves ht*r wand, and abolishes before him such sounds and sights as were too coarse and dreadful for so delicate a nature. He was absent from Paris for a week during the September massacres. In 171)3. while the guillotine was decimat-i ing the intellect of France, Bernardin, unharmed in Paris, was going a-courting.

BERXARDIN'S WIFE.
HE was 56 years old, and, despite Innumerable love affairs, had never found a wife (he looked at least for a tocher, a beautiful soul and a pall* of fine eyes) when his publisher’s daughter fell head over ears in love with him. pgiicite Didot was sweet and 20, enthusiastic. naive, a little “ b6b£te,” with no force of character. In the letters before us she appears a sort of Rosie Newcome. But, in addition, she was one of those girls (and surely it is natural in a publisher's daughter) of whom Keats de- j clared that they would wish to marry a i poem and he given away by a novel;* She ! fell in love with ” Paul and Virginia,” and tcolc the author into the bargain. Bernardin. In his amiable fatuity, had always said that. like Senecn, he should li'Tiit upon *■ une Pauline pear mes vieux jours." He was quite the aTfable archangel. Th‘\v v/ore to play at Paul and Virginia, to live in an enchanted cottage on an Island fur from the haunts of men, and K£lieit£ (who had grown up in all the gossip and cheerful hubbub of an eighteenth century bookseller’s shop) thought that here was paradise indeed. Need w^ add that it was a fools’ paradise? The cottage, built on an island of the Essonne. near Corbeil, was damp and dreary: F£licit6 was often left alone, while her husband stayed in Paris for bis lectures al the newly founded Ecole Nor-male. The birth of two children—Virginia. in 17tH. Paul in 1798—did not prevent the poor child from feeling herself (as she often complains) very dull and stupid; " d’une Strange imbftcillitG,” she says, and quite unfit to live in the society of so great a man as her elderly husband. Bernardin. like many idealists, was an— uncommonly keen man of business and an economical Norman at heart; and quarrels about money soon embittered the philosopher's relations with the house of Didot. A publisher-in-law is a difficult man to .deal with; and yet his death drove affairs from bad to worse, for Bernardin and his brothers-in-law came to an open feud over the winding up of Didot’s affairs. Day by day F61icitG grew paler, more nervous, more dissatisfied. " Les vapeurs de ma femme ne font qu’aug-menter," writes Bernardin to his mother-in-law, “ elle s'est mlse dans ia tete d’avoir la disposition de mon argent, ou une pension particuHSre, ou de divorcer. Elle iim: laisse le choix.” But a fourth course was open to F6UcIt.fi, and a few months later, in her twenty-seventh year, she died of consumption in her damp lit-tie Eden of Essonne.
Ffilicitfi DIdot had not been a happy wife, and yet it would not be fair to rate i Bernardin a cruel husband. Silch was the legend that the Didots spread abroad. Didot Saint-L£ger hinted darkly at a special knowledge of the seamy side of genius, giving it to be understood that their families (and publishers) know but too well how all is not gold that glitters;
“ ils sont, dans leur vie prlv6e, exlgeans, tracassiers, d’une avarice sordide jusqu'au ridicule, souvent mSrae d‘un Ggoisme rfi-voltant." Napoleon, who admired M Paul et Virglnie '* only less than *' Werther,” deplored having made the acquaintance of the author, and wrote (in the Memorial de Sainte H6l6ne) “ c*6tait un m^chant
*
homme, maltraltant fort sa femme, fille de rimprtmeur Didot, tet toujours pm a demander 1’aumOne sans honte." But I the letters before us attenuate this im*

HIS SECOND MARRIAGE^
BUT the best vindication of Bernardin was his second marriage. He was 03 when F6liclt£ left him a widower ! W,lth two small children. That was In September, 1700, A few months later, the mistress of a ladles' school in Paris, Rue de Seine, Invited the eminent Academician to Inspect her establishment, Bernardin inspected It so well that he distinguished at first sight, among the “ grandes," a pearl of great price, Mile. Deslrfee de Pelleporc, daughter of the Count Anne-G€d£on de la Fite de Felle-porc. She was 20 years old. handsome, j gifted, ardent, decided, and generous. We have compared poor F€licit6 to Rosie | Newcbme. Mile, de Pelleporc reminds us more than once of Dorothea Brootre. But that marriage was infinitely happier than Dorothea's, Passionate and gay, Mme. de Saint-Pierre, animated all her surroundings, awoke her old husband to a better, happier youth than ever he had known, and lived herself perfectly content In the little paradise which her warm heart created. It is she who should have • been named FGlicit6.
Like most good women, the second Mme. de Saint-Pierre know what she wanted and meant to get it. She wanted her hus-bnnd to onter the fold of the Church. Bernardin, the most convinced of Deists, was not a Christian, certainly not a Catholic, when he married her, but the religious temper of his writings had made him (like Pasteur in recent years) a persona
/gtata.-;Ih^ the^

dcrness, the ^dent piety:; the’ passionate :

him, as _it' were, out 'of his old positions' and / carried him':, across tne barrier with a mighty sweep of wlngs^ Slit.'years after hifl union in 1606, Bernardin ds , an assiduous , cburch-goer. . The death ,pf his little Bernardin (the'son of Desiree) confirmed him:In the Catholic faith, and the last .chapters of hi?f *' Harmonies de la. Nature ” are absolutely Orthodox. The heir of Rousseau has become the precursor of Chfiteaubrland.
Bernardin de Sainte-Pierre died in 1S14. at 77 years of age, passionately regretted by a widow some three-and-forty years vounger than himseir. We may say that Desiree de Pelleporc remained faithful to his' memory* for, though she married again, she chose for her second husband the devoted secretary of Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, Airofi -Martin. They bpent the rest of theic. lives in editing the remains of their gfeat man. How badly they did it may be learned (not Without amusement) by the reader who profits by M. Sour Ian’s researches.
