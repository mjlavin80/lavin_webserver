WILLIAHt BODHAM DONNE AND HIS FRIKNDS. Edited by Catharine B. Johnson. With illustrations. 8vo. Pp: xvl.-3G2. New York: E. P. Dutton & Co. $3.
N' OT a biography; but a selection of the letters of Donne that may give a connected idea of the events of his Ufe, It has been the editor’s intention to produce. His correspondence was pro-fuse,/and his friends were among the most distinguished men and women of the time in England. He was, as the editor aptly says, one of those men who are best made known by their friendships. A cousin ’ of the poet Cowper, a Cambridge man, a student of English literature, especially of the drama, and at one time librarian of the London Library, then examiner of plays, he was brought actively into contact with the literary, dramatic, and official life of England. How he took the somewhat preposterous task of dramatic censorship in the latter half of the nineteenth century appears amusingly in some of his letters. He writes in 1858 to Mrs. Fanny Kemble:	*
Mme. Ristori is to play Jiuditta tn nr few evenings; but to please the thick-skulled, superstitious British public I have been obliged to find her a new name for the tragedy and new titles for the characters, and all because the book of Judith happens to be bound up with the Bible, being all the while as. inspired as “ Tom Jones." When shall we be a wiser people?
His correspondence with Mrs. Kemble extended over many years, and fs full of interesting matter, and many references to contemporary dramatic occurrences. He is a candid correspondent and an ln-dependent thinker, and writes frequently I with touches of delightful humor and caustic comment. His experience of the social qualities of actors “ coincides very nearly with your own/' he writes Mrs. Kemble. ** I have rarely found them good company except In the way of profss-sional anccdotes, which -soon pall on the taste. * * * 1 fancy musicians are little ^better; and- there seerns' a common cauS6 for the general dullness of both out of T their respective callings."
Edward FitzGerald was one of his Tre- * quently mentioned friends. lie was tn 1SG0 " in the easternmost parts of England, companying with boatmen* and carrying in his pocket, to insure welcome, a bottle of rum and rolls of tobacco. So armed he spends his evenings under the lee side of fishing boats hearing and telling yarns.” Some of the letters from FitzGerald given are delightfully characteristic. Of Tom Taylor Donne writes in . 1SC1 that he is " the presiding genius of the stage/’ but he has come to grief lately In the failure of some of his plays—“ the fact is", Tom has bought him a house and therewith a garden at Wandsworth, and he has been writing ,piays by the dozen to pay. for them.'’ The success of the French actor Fechter is *' the most te-marlcable'event in current history,” while poor Charles Kean and his wife were playing at the Standard to empty houses, £ “ having outlived all his fame, such as it ” was."
The correspondence here so lavishly given—connected with a thread of biographical comment at times hardly suffl-cient—does, indeed, give an unconscious portrait of William Bodham Donne as “ an accomplished scholar, faith fir J fri«*n>l. and conscientious public servant/' They are the letters of a true literary man, letters that are worth the p^rma'i^nt form in which they are now embotlit'd
