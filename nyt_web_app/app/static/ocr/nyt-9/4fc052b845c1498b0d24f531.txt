CAPT, J. H, THOMSON has edited the “ Primer of Explosives: For the Use of Local Inspectors and Dealers," .by Major A. Cooper-Key. As the title shows, the little book, which the Macmillan Company brings out In this country, has been written simply to provide information which will help an In~ i spector In carrying out his duties with judgment, and a trader in applying precautions suitable to the particular eyplo-i sives with which he is concerned. An Idea I of the scope of the little book is given in the opening paragraph of the preface.
A desire has been frequently expressed bv officers appointed by local authorities under the Explosives act (of Great Britain). for some means of obtaining an elementary knowledge of the composition, methods of manufacture, and appearance of the various blasting explosive^ in common use, together with an authoritative pronouncement respecting any special risks attaching to the handling of particular Kinds, in order that they may be In a rosiUon to deal intelligently with questions of storage and conveyance, which not only may require prompt decision, but in regard to which they are possibly compelled to call in question the conduct of traders who have spent their lives In the explosives industry, and may consequently bo somewhat inclined to resent interference by non-experts, * * * the present little volume * * * may supply a want.
