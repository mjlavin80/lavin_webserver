TOPICS OF THE WEEK.
ITH no biographical work in press, or even so near to its being as a publisher’s early announcement, that is likely to compare In actual " importance ” with Morley’s “ Gladstone ” or Herbert Spencer's record ot his own ideas and experiences, it is already certain that English literature will, nevertheless, be enriched this Fail and Winter by many good boots of a biographical character. The works classified as biographical in the carefully compiled lists of tbe Autumn Book Number of The New York Times Book Review (to be published Oct. 14) will include many of large interest, such as the Ibsen letters, the translation of Bielscbowsky’s “Life of Goethe,” Mrs. Bayard Taylor's book about her husband. '* On Two Continents Col. Thomas Wentworth Higginson’s “ Parts of a Man’s Life,” new volumes of the English Men of Letters and American Men of Letters series, and volumes m the new French Men of Letters, well begun with Edward Dowden’s “ Montaigne," and the series called Contemporary Men of Letters. We shall have, also, Mrs. Joseph Pennell's biography of her uncle, Charles G. Leland, " Hans Breit-mann,” chapters of which have already appeared in The Atlantic Monthly, and, later on, a new “ Life of Charles Dickens ” by that young British Juggler with '* paradoxes," Gilbert Chesterton, who would be held in higher esteem if he could check some of his own admiration for his own humor. Anna Benson McMahan’s book called *' With Shelley in Italy M is not likely to be a valuable contribution to biography, though it may serve its purpose well, but Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace's ” My Life: A Record of Events and Opinions ” will disappoint us greatly if it lack either vital interest or literary charm. Finally, there will be Mr. E. V. Lucas’s new M Life of Charles Lamb,”
MR. LUCAS’S recent work as an editor of Lamb's writings has been so judicious and sympathetic that we are justified in entertaining high expectations of the worth of his biography, for which there is plenty of room. Bo long as a love of Eng-
j v t '
lish letters survives, Lamb’s influence will prevail. Canon Ainger, though we have notj honestly, a word to say against him as editor or biographer of his belovfed Elia, did not exhaust the subject. JfVmong recent English critics there has j been a marked disposition to belittle the work of the late Master of the Temple with which we have no sort of sjjbapathy. But we are willing to believe;that Mr. Lucas, who has industry, knowledge, taste, tact, and a
command, ot good English, has produced a book which will outrank not only Ainger, but Talfourd’s " Final
Memorials
(Which were a century or
more from finality,) and all that we have been told about Lamb by Hazlitt. Crabb Robinson, Leigh Hunt, Patmore, Mary Cowden Clarke, and Brander Matthews. Mr. Lucas’s biography, in two volumes, has already been published in London, and tho American reviewers I will- soon have tt in hand

Is deathless and capable of endless development, will inevitably take to air-shipping to IJie future, and Mr. Kipling’s new story is to deal exclusively with the future. His power of controllingthe reader’s imagination, that makes his most fantastic dreams seem so real, will have ample room for play in a description of the passage across (and over) the Atlantic Ocean ot the “ Night Mail ” from London to New York. Of scarcely less interest to students of literature in the announcements of McClure’s win be the continuation of Prof. Woodberry’s critical essays, which are among the best things of their kind in contemporary periodical literature. He has written thus far of Cervantes and Scott, with freshness and clarity of thought and utterance not often found in the moBero treatment of ancient, much discussed literary topics. Forthcoming papers will deal with Milton, Montaigne, Shakespeare, and Virgil. The memoirs of Carl Schurz, destined eventually to be collected in a book of vital interest to all good American citizens, will be published serially in McClure's, beginning next month.
THE October McClure’s has an appropriate cover by Arthur Hoe-ber, one of those Autumnal American landscapes so characteristic of this artist in his best mood, very happily reproduced, This number contains, with many other good things, Pastor Wagner's frank and enthusiastic account f
of his visit to the President, who “ boomed ” his book for him, and this article, together with Mr. Roosevelt's own spirited account (In Scribner's) of his recent acts of sportsmanship in the Far West, should sufficiently satisfy one month's demands for periodical literature of the simple life strenuously pursued. Eugene Wood, who habitually writes of American rural life, In a humorous vein, relieved by an undercurrent of honest sentiment, has a piece about " The County Fair,” which A. B. Frost Illustrates in the true spirit. Mr. Wood has just brought out a whole book of this sort of thing, (McClure,) in which his memories of a happy, boisterous, vociferous boyhood on the farm, and a well-spent youth in a country village, are all plctorially embellished by the same artist. M The County Fair M Is one of its later chapters, preceding an account of rural American Christmas far from cathedral chimes and waits, and Germanic Kris Kringle spectacles. ** The Old Red Schoothouse,” " The Swimming Hole,’* M The Firemen’s Tournament,” and ” Circus Day ” are subjects of various chapters, all of which have appeared hitherto as magazine contributions.
THE October Century, with the article on the Brownings by Mr. Richard Watson Gilder, whose complete restoration to health and resumption of his routine of work are matters for general congratulation, and the two articles touching Shelley, by Margaret L. Croft and N. P. I>unn, respectively, gives more attention to literature tban lately has been the practice of this popular monthly magazine. To be sure, neither of the Shelley articles deals directly with the production of poetry, but the first throws new light upon one striking incident in a great poet’s life and clears up certain Imputations on Us

William Edward West, tho Kentucky artist, whov also painted a portrait of -Byron. These pictures, now reproduced,
, were long in the possession of West's heirs, and have only lately come to light
MR* GILDER’S article, he tells us, "grew out of an inquiry as to the direct references by the Brown ings to each other in their poetry," and treats of ** one of the most exquisite love histories of which the world has knowledge,” which, as he expresses
it, was “ immortally sung.” His paper,
’ we take It, was designed as an intro-l Auction to a book containing tbe poeibs
| of husband and wife which, in addition to " Sonnets from the Portuguese," bc-; long directly to that love history. Mrs.
Browning’s part, he assumes, includes besides the famous sonnets, " Life and love," “A Denial,’* "Proof and Disproof,” 14 Question and Answer," “ Inclusion," and "Insufficiency.” Mr. Browning’s contributions were “ One World More,” “ Prospice,” and the “ O Lyric Love" in “The Ring and the Book."
THE BOOKMAN of this city Is justly indignant about the " sarcasms " caused by President Roosevelt's praise of Mr. Arlington Robinson's poetry. We quite agree with The Bookman that a man who thtnkg he
discovered genuine poetry, while " foraging in the underbrush of current verse,” may properly proclaim his discovery to the world, no matter how high his official position may be. Tes, indeed. There was no " sarcasm ” In our remarks on the subject We quite agree with The Bookman, too, In Its belief that the President is not to blame for having discovered only one of the many poets of the Robinson degree. The Bookman’s editor declares that his poetry reviewer disposes of (unhappy phrase!) twelve linear feet of minor poetry every year, and that three-fourths of it is " tinged with the ' certain, sad mysticism’ detected by the President in Mr. Robinson's verse.” Moreover, u one-half of it is almost If not quite Robinsonian in merit” These exact mathematical terms—twelve feet three-quarters, one-half—testify alike to the sincerity and the accuracy of The Bookman’s observations. Our own poetry reviewers last year paid their respects to ("disposed of" Is a vile term) 19 2-3 linear feet of minor poetry, but we have not yet had computations made of the exact percentage of M sad mysticism” (certain or uncertain) in this verse, or definitely ascertained how large a proportion of it was of “ Robinsonian merit.” Still we quite aferee with The Bookman; and, by all means, let us have no more " sarcasms.”
SECRETARY BONAPARTE has consented to undertake the auctioneer’s r61e in the Baltimore sale of autograph editions of books which we mentioned some time ago. The sale will be held tn Arundell Hall, Baltimore. on the evenings of Nov. 28 jid 29. The Quarter Club of Baltimore, managed by twelve young women of that city, has arranged the sale for the benefit of a fund to build a sanitarium for consumptives at Mount Airy. Books of verse, biography, fiction, Bhort sto-, ries, and essays, all bearing their authors* signatures, will be sold. Every prominent American author and many distinguished English writers have signed books for this purpose. Catalogues may be obtained by applying

We shall all be glad to have Mr. Lang's book, of course. He Is nearly always interesting, and never more so than when he is dealing empirically with un-solvable mysteries. The late Richard
A. Proctor dealt with “ The Mystery of Edwin Drood ” in his book called •* Watched by the Dead," published in 1S8T, and now out of print The impenetrable mystery was also well treated of by our own humorist, R N. Newell, who signed himself M Orpheus C. Kerr.” In one of the best, and least fortunate, of all American comic weeklies, Punchinello, Newell published serially in 1870 his burlesque of the then new serial of Dickens, to which he gave the rather juvenile title of “ The Mystery of Mr. E. Drood.” After this weekly travesty had been stopped by the sudden death of Dickens, before his novel was finished, Orpheus C. Kerr completed his own humorous story, with his accustomed drollery, but not without reverence, and published It in book form as *' The Cloven Foot”
AS Edinburgh is one of the most beautiful of all the cities of the earth, is rich in history, and teems with traditions, romantic and literary, there is no wonder that many books ■are written to describe its attractive features and celebrate its glories. Only the other day, It seems, we were pointing out the merits of John Geddie*s “ Romantic Edinburgh.” A new edition (in the Mediaeval Town Series) Is now at hand of OHphant Smeaton’s "The Story of Edinburgh,” which we reviewed about a year ago, (Macmillans.) Mr. Sxneaton tells everything there is to tell of the history and topography of Edinburgh, and much of its tradition and romance. The original illustrations by Herbert Rail ton and J. Ayton Symington are preserved. Another delightful book about En'bra, toon is Robert Louis Stevenson’s, which is now reprinted in tt neat little leather-covered volume. (LIpplncotts.) The book comprises the chapters on the “ Old Town," Parliament Close, the " New Town,” Calton Hill, and the Pentland Hills, with others on the legends of Edinburgh and other topics. We are not sure that a better book on Edinburgh is obtainable anywhere.
ART books and gift books, chiefly in demand for the holiday trade, are already coming In unusual supply from both English and American publishers. There have been great improvements lately In the art of color printing, and richly illustrated books, dealing with the lives of artists, and critical studies of their works, can be produced now at a comparatively small cost A book which is sold at retail nowadays at as high a price as $5 ought to be positively a thing of beauty and of permanent worth. Such a book Is the new edition of Washington Irving's " Rip Van Winkle,” (published here by Doubleday, Page & Co.) The pictures are by Arthur Hackham, an English artist who has poetic fancy and technical skill in plenty, and a good enough comprehension of his subject, derived largely, probably, from studies In old Holland rather than the neighborhood of the New Netherlands and the Kaatskill Mountains. But the spirit of the mountains he has caught from Irving. The forty-odd colored plates, mounted loosely on dark green boards, are charming In tone^and excellent as illustrations. Perhaps some of the housewives are a bit too young and comely, but that is a small fault The humor and the poetry of Irving are all in the pictures, without a hint of the theatrical quality. The type and paper are all that they should be.
