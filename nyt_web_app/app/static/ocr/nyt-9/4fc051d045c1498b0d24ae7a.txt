DOUBTIjESS AJr. Garland spoke true
when he said that our life is so
crass, so material, and so shallow, so “ smit with the sun,” so lacking in suggestion, that we cannot afford to let any poetry pass from it. But we have a native poetry of our own; all that is needed is that we shall have the clear vision and the skilled hands to lay hold and seize it. The literature of our country may well conceive it a high duty to preserve and hand down to those who are to follow us as much as we may of what remains unspoiled. Fortunately the sense of this duty has already been felt; and there has at least been a beginning made in the direction in which Mr. Garland points.
