THIS time Baroness von Hutten gives us instead of the story of a little girl who was not quite properly brought up a drama which involves prto-cipally a clergyman and a beautiful woman with no morals to speak of. The juxtaposition la somewhat piquant and there are parts of the book which, take sordid realism very frankly by the hand and make it and tbe reader intimately acquainted. There are other parts which deal, of course, with the author’s private brand of feminine self-sufficiency and passion and revel in her taste (or- *ich colors and the ragged edges of propriety.
According to the plot, a certain King Hardy, rector of a poor parish in England, the husband of a faded wife and father of numerous neglected children, has burled a passionate past, and set himself to make atonement. So he slaves for hi« flock, begs for them, starves for them, even lets his own family go half clothed and half fed. Then comes to those parts Rosalba Perez, a South American ot opulent beauty. She Is not wicked, but she Is idle. She amuses herself by sitting as model to an invalid Earl with a wife beautiful after the best English pattern— and by trying to wake the man chained in the parson. As for Hardy, the very sight of the Southern woman recalls his youth and the joy and sin of it, without leading him into any particular temptation. But the faded wife sees and grieves. So one night, as he dreams of his youth, the parson falls to writing—and writes the story of that youth, not as a parson, but ad a man, and publishes it anonymously as a noveL Being the real story of a real man—torn from the book of his life still bleeding—it sells many copies, makes much talk, and wins the author much money. Also, Rosalba reads the book and guesses who wrote it, and tiien the trouble begins.
You presently learn, of course, that she is not what she seems, but something else, and her fate links Itself curiously with that of the crippled painter Earl and hta wife, A missing husband ccmea from across the seas and sickness and death takes a hand in the castle and in. the parsonage. The * morbid consciences of the English clergyman, the unschooled passions of the woman of the South, the broken spirit of the other woman, the clergyman's wife—these, of course, are the real elements of the tragedy. One cannot help regretting that the author has dragged, in diphtheria to complicate matters.. She mars her effects by excess of horrors. She mars, too, • by faults of taste which belong to the current school of fashionable fiction a story which In Its elements 4s true and strongly human and~ developed with no little skill and cleverness. .	•	;
