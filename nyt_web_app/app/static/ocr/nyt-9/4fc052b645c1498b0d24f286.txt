Witfa Fort Mackinac crowning the cedar bluffs 300 feet above the i water, should be held in special remem- I brance by all patriotic bodies, and par- j ticularly the writers and readers of books j Of science, travel, and romance. This in- j terest should be enough to awaken a united movement to right a wrong .committed by the United States Government ten years ago, when Daniel Lamont, Secretary of War, issued an order abandoning the fort and offering the 1,100 sur- ! rounding acres to private purchasers.
With a larger sense of civic duty the , State of Michigan, through her Representatives in Congress, secured the passage of an ret turning over the National property to the State of Michigan, and since then a State commission has done its best to develop a State park, with small resources at command. Recognizing the propriety of the United States Government continuing in coctrol of the fort and adjacent grounds, the Michigan
Legislature of 1S07 voted their recession to the National Government, the transfer to take place whenever the War Department should signify to the commission its readiness to resume the trust. Judge William R- Day of the United States Supreme Court, who has a cottage on the bluff, will bring the subject to the attention of Secretary of War Taft on his return from the Philippines. The voice oi the statesman or the pen of the ready writer may do something now to bring the National Government to a sense of its obligations.
Scores of standard works deal witn Mackinac and the old fort, among them Washington Irving’s "Astoria”; and Hennepin, Henry, Carver, Weld, Drake, Parkman, Mackenzie, Adams, Rogers, Holmes. Marry at, Lossing, Morse, and other writers, French and English, have left an unbroken chain of narrative and history, extending over 200 years of alter-rvate occupancy by French, British, and Americans. Harriet Martineau wrote with enthusiasm in her *' Society in America,” Mrs. Jameson found inspiration for “ Winter Studies and Summer Rambles,” and Margaret Fuller in her *' Summer on the Lakes.” Constance Fennimore Woolson founded her romance ** Anne ” upon the scenes and characters of the island, and a few years since Mary Hartwell Catherwood gave the inhabitants their first literary sensation in her realistic stories, first published in Harper’s, and afterward printed in a volume with the title " A British Islander.”
Henry R. Schoolcraft, the great linguist and exploring scientist, resided here with his French-1 nriian wife for years, conducting the important archaeological and ethnological researches which have formed the basis of all the scientific data, ever brought together in connection with the American Indian, as Sir Humphrey , Davy, Charles Darwin, and Prof. Silli-man attest. Bancroft secured from him important data for his ” History of the United States,” and Longfellow turned to him for local coloring when writing “ Hiawatha.” The National Institute of France conferred "honors upon him; and of thirty scientific works, the greatest of all, " Ethnological	arches	Among the
Red Men,” six volumes, with 300 colored engravings, was issued by the United States and may be found in the Congressional Library at Washington.
Medical science is no less concerned in Mackinac Island, since within the confines of the old fort Dr. William Beaumont. Post Surgeon, fourscore years ago conducted that series, of experiments on St. Martin, a young French Canadian, whose stomach was tom by gunshot, leaving an open cavity through which, for a series of years, he studied the process of (hgestien and the nature of the gastric juice, making a contribution to exact science which changed the textbooks of Europe and America.
When the United States resumes control, their first duty should be the erection of properly inscribed monuments of Schoolcraft and Beaumont. The medical associations of Michigan have placed a granite block within the fort, recording the achievements of Beaumont; and in the garden at the foot a monument to P£re Marquette, founder of the Mackinac missions, and whose remains rest at St. Ignace, on the mainland just beyond, is to be erected by private subscription.
To historians and antiquarians the old fort is replete with Interest- It Is a strange mixture of the feudal castle and the frontier post, and with the exception perhaps of Fort Marion, the old Spanish fortification at St. Augustine, Fla., it is the most venerable military structure on the continent. Along and above the deeply buttressed walls, fitting into the overhanging rock, axe the square-set buildings of log and stone, with their drooping red roofs and broad piazzas, flanked by the grim blockhouses, loop-holed for musketry; the sullen guardhouse, -with iron-grated doors and windows; the sally ports, bastions, and ditch, all carrying one back to many ages behind our own. Not even the fact that Confederate prisoners were confined here during our civil war can invest it with modern interest. But the doors are
[closed, disuse is inviting decay. Tens of thousands of visitors come here annually, American, English, . French, and among them Turk; Syrian, ’ Armenian, and. now
and then a Chin*ese traveler.; more than visit the Yellowstone Park, for which the Government makes generous.. appropriations; yet the Government has left'no* tablet, monument, or marker to tell the tale.	’
** He who careth not for his own household is worse than an infidel,** axe the words of Holy Writ. It is the worst kind of National Infidelity for the United ( States Government to abandon Fort Mackinac.	_
