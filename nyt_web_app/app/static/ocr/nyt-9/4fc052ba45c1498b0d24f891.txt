AUSTIN DOBSON'S VERSE*
A Graceful Poet and Man of the World Who Is Not Worldly.*
Published by Arrangement with The London
Times.
O	select from Mr. Austin Dobson’s poems seems as unnecessary as it is impossible. Indeed, this volume is not^a selection, but simply an omission. AJI but the first and last pieces in it and one or ■ two others are taken from “ Old World Idylls *’ and “ At tbe Sign of the Lyre,” and those books themselves were selections made almost too fastidiously, so that a further choice from them could only mean the omission of poems that no one would wish to be omitted. But Mr. Dobson tells us that this volume has been prepared in response to a suggestion that a selection in a popular and i inexpensive form might be welcome to . many readers. We presume, therefore,
i
that he has chosen what he takes to be
I
the most popular of his poems, and, that being so, it is no use to quarrel with him over the omission of all the " Proverbs in Porcelain," of " Ars Victrix,'* of "In the Belfry," in fact, of nearly all the pieces left out.
In the last poem in tlie book Mr. Dobson
says of himself and of the friend to whom
the poem is addressed that—
They knew not, nor cared greatly, if they were spark or star;
They knew to move is somewhat; although the goal be far;
And larger light or lesser, this thing at least is clear.
They served the masses truly—their service was sincere.
This kind of deprecatory spirit is expressed or implied in nearly all Mr. Dob-
son*sv poems. Indeed, he seldom speaks so seriously of his art as here. His way is to write like a poet addressing an age of prose and careful to conciliate unwilling readers by the modesty of his pretensions. Light verse is usually light verse because in some way or other it makes concessions to prosaic weaknesses, and most of it has been written in periods unfavorable to poetry. The poet of light verse is too well bred to force sublimities upon readers not in the mood for them. This convention is that of drawing-room conversation in whlclPse-rious subjects become tiresome if treated seriously. Most of such poets in the past have carried the convention so. far as to pretend to see nothing serious in life. They are always paying compliments
which they do not expect to be believed and affecting grand passions only lor the purpose of raising: a smile at them. They make a virtue of renouncing the higher glories of poetry. Art for them, like everything else in Ufe, is a game to be played dexterously and coolly.. They are skeptics who amuse a skeptical audience with the forms and ceremonies of a past age of belief, and so well content to make sport for the Philistines that they become Philistines themselves in the process.
BUT Mr. Austin Dobson, though he is as light of hand as any of these* makes no pretense ;>f being a Philistine or a skeptic, -He renounces the higher glories of poetry, not from modesty or discouragement: not because he affects to despis? them. His manners in society are as fine as those of any society versifier. He kno\Vs that it is out of place to talk of Time, Death, and Judgment in a drawing room. Yet by talking oJJ other things he does not Imply that Time, Death, and Judgment are nothing to him. We may pay our homage to these great matters, even I in a drawing room, by our reticence, 01 by a slight change in the tone of our voices If we chance to approach them, as . a Roman Catholic crosses himself when he passes a crucifix In the street. Mr. Dobson knows that It is worse manners to jest at serious things tn a* drawing room than to preach about them. He himself writes like a man of the world who ■is not .worldly, and he pays his own quiet homage to the eternal verities with perfect tact- He lets ajs know that he has a
heart, though he may not wear It on his sleeve. He jests, not like a t>aby crowing at a funeral, but like a man wha takes a kindly pleasure in trifles, and knows when to take it. In this-respect he is as remote as Milton himself from the jesting poets of the Restoration, who trifled with a kind of disappointed savagery and laughed hard, because ft was the main business of their lives to^laugh.
Let’s eat, drink, and play till the worm doth corrupt us.
For we know that post-mortem "est nulla voluptas. .	.
Mr. Pohson knows nothing of the kind. He does not “trifle to kill- time before an- -nihllatlon comes, nor because he ithinks * there is nothing, better worth doing, Uut ; ■ • •

because he likes to do everything well. There is room for some play in life, and there ts room for him among the poets.
Till the coming of the crows' feet And the backward turn of beaux feet.
Any one who ran hit upon a rhyme as appropriate yet as surprising as that is at liberty to make verges.
Yet, though no one can trifle more deli' cately than Mr. Dobson—and, Indeed, in some of his trifles he seems to have transformed the rich and heavy fabric of our language into silver gauze—there is still a touch of the melancholy of renunciation in much of his verse. You cannot but feel that he would like to be a great poet, to write of .Tim e^ Death, and Judgment, like Shakespeare, and he Is apt to approach these great themes with a kind of wistful shyness, as if he would like to talk seriously about them, but will not presume upon a casual acquaintanceship so far as to do so.
We shut our hearl up nowadays,
Like some old music box that plays Unfashionable airs that raise Derisive pity.
He would like to play those unfashionable airs of the graver lyre, but meanwhile he consoles himself as best he can lcviore plectio; and he is scrupulous, for all his tender- emotions, not to trangress his I drawing-room convention. He has made it his business to write poetr^ that you could read aloud to a crowd of mere acquaintances without embarrassing either them or yourself; to express moods so little removed from ordinary prose that it needs no training of the sympathies, no rare exaltation of spirit, to share them. He tempts us rather than constrains us into his own poetic state of mind. If he feels the pity of things too hardly to trifle, he does not command us to be sad with him.
***
E does not, like Wordsworth in " The Affliction of Margaret,” employ words and images refined and dignified by the high uses of poetry. Rather he speaks to us in our own prosaic vernacular, drawing us on with graceful concessions and insidious little appeals, until we find ourselves reading poetry unawares. He seems to assume that we are preoccupied and not inclined to accept him for a poet, nor will he set up to be one. Still he lias something pretty and sad to tell us, and he will do his best to tell It In the least tiresome manner possible. You could not have a better instance of his art in this insinuating poetry than the little piece called Good Night, Babette," which is omitted from this selection. M. Vieux-bois, the dying old man in that poem, makes no appeal to our compassion, and tells us no set story of the happy past which he still remembers in his senile forgetfulness. The allusions he makes to It are all incidental to the business of his life, which is to take his medicine and to sleep, and his nurse, Babette. sings him to sleep like a child with a song that be* gins as a lullaby, and only takes on the gravity and passion of poetry when the reader, as well as M. Vieuxbois, has been soothed into the mood for it.
•	One was the friend I left Stark In the snow;
One was the wife that died Long, long ago;
One was the love I lost • * *
How could she know?
We conseut to poetry even In the draw-| ing room when it is mitigated by music; so Mr, Dotson makes Babette sing his poetry to us; and It seems only a coincidence which we cannot resent that her song should comc like a memory of his j own past to M. Vieuxbois,
OST of the light versifiers of the past. If they ever displayed enthusiasm for anything, always displayed it for the most artificial things; and they made no secret, indeed they boasted, of the fact that their own verse was all artifice. There is a curious Instance of this, in the most beautiful and the most natural verse that Prior ever wrote.
; What I speak, my dear Chioerand what I i	write shows
I The difference there is betwixt nature and art.
I court others in verse, but I love thee Jo prose;
And they have my whimsies, but thou |	hast my heart.
| Verse, like music, is the natural language of passion. Yet for Prior it Is so tainted with artifice that he has to fall back on prose as the language of his j heart. He is so used to saying what he does not mean in rhyme that he must renounce it to prove his sincerity. But Mr. t)obson says what he means even in his lightest trifles, and smiles not at slmplic* ity but at artifice.	_

Y^JT Mr. Dobson, enjoys artificial things, though not as most of the light versifiers of the past enjoyed them. They took pleasure in the . 1 artlfide of their own time, because na-
I	ture and the simple facts of life wearied their skeptical minds, because all life seemed to them an arbitrary game ! and they wished to refine that game with ail the rules they could devise. But Mr. Dobson takes his pleasure In the artifices and sophistications of men and women long dead, much as the middle-aged like to watch the games of children. He does not dispute the seriousness of life, but he likes to give his mind a little respite from It, to retreat into the eighteenth century, as townsmen like to retreat Into the country. He can escape for a .while from-all sense of the responsibilities of reality among those little norcelain figures which his fancy brings to Ufe so that they bow and curtsy and wave their fans and pay their compliments with the most living grace. He shows us a kind of Dolls’ House fairyland in which the dolls play their Uttle parts like real men and wrtipen, yet do nothing too serious for their dolls’ nature. And at the end of the play he says:
Heigho! how chill the evenings get!
Good night, Ninon—Good night. Ninette.
Your little play is played and finished; Go back, then, to your cabinet.
All the while they are performing their pretty antics you feel that the master of the show watches over them with a kind of pitying tenderness, as if they were too like real men and women to be treated as mere cunning pieces of mechanism. Indeed, In all his fStes galantes the^e is a touch of tli'j melancholy of Watteau, of the artist who makes a picture of figures quivering like brigiH-colored insects in th«a sunshine, yet cannot, while he makes It. iorget that lie misrepresents that ephemeral scene by fixing it on the canvas, and giving to it the ’ong unchanging life of art.
Loyal. L’Etoile, no more to-day.
Alas! they heed not what we say:
They smile with ardor undiminished;
But we—we are not always gay. ’
Yet there is only enough of melancholy about these pretty pieces to give som-> subtlety to their charm. They were writ* ten for our delight, and a death's head is not the centre of that delicate feast to which Mr. Dobson invites us.
