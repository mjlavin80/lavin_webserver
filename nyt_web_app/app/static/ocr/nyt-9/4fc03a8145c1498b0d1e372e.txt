EOKGE CRABBE was bom at A1 deburgh Christmas Eve, 1754. He wasat first bred a surgeon* but that was not his taste or destiny, and be took ship for London in 17S0, with £3 in his pocket and a literary career in his dreams. There he was fortunate enough, after some miserable months, .to address himself for help to Burke, who read his letter and the verses he sent with it, and at once, with ever* memorable generosity, granted him an interview and relieved his necessities; and before very long had Invited him to his country house. Introduced him" to some of the first men of the time, and found hltn a publisher for his poem, ** The Library." That is the jnly crisis in his uneventful life. When the unwearying good genius to whom he owed everything had smoothed away the difficulties that stood in the way of his wish to take orders, all the rest went as peacefully as the life of a well-to-do clergyman commonly does. On being ordained he went back in triumph to be curate at Aideburgh, but Aldeburgh, as was natural enough, was the very last place where he was likely to be accepted at the new valuation, and the unhonored prophet left his birthplace after a few months to become Chaplain to the Duke of Rutland at Bel voir.	.
It was Burke once more who had been the fairy godmother of this new piece of good fortune. Crabbe went to Belvoir in 1782, married in 1783, removed to a curacy near Belvoir in 1785, and from that year till his death in 1S32 lived the life of a country clergyman, first as rector of Mus(.on, in Leicestershire, from 37S7 to	then	in Suffolk as curate of
Swelling and Great Glemham from 1792 to 1805; again at Muston from 1805 to 3814, and finally at Trowbridge from 1S14 till his death. He owed all his preferments, directly or indirectly, to the Rutland connection, and so in this, as in all the rest, ultimately to the original friendship of Burke. The authorities of the Church did nothing for one of the two or three most distinguished men they had in their ranks. * * *
CRABBE'S POETRY,
BUT it is after all the poet whom Aldeburgh is celebrating this week.
What we remember about Crabbe now is that he wrote " The Village," “ The Parish Register,” and, above all, the great Tales. It was, indeed, his own fault if his parishes hardly knew he was a poet. The eccentricities of practical men are always past explaining, and Crabbe's are no exception. He had an early passion for writing verse; he had the good fortune to get his verses soon and successfully printed, and he then proceeded to bury his fame and prospects by a silcnce of twenty-four years! ** The Library" was published in 1781, “The Village " followed it in 1783, bad a large sale, and was universally praised; but it was not till I(s07 that its author appeared again before the public with ** The Parish Register.” How could a man who appeared himself to sit so lightly to his avocation as a poet expect to have it taken very seriously by other people? It is true that when he did begin writing again he kept to it. " The Parish Register ” was followed by " The Borough " In 1810, and that by the " Tales in Verse " In 1812, and they again by the "Tales of the Hall " in 1810. But he was then too late for the position he might once hav« held. In the years that he lost between 1783 and the new century he could have had no rival except Cowper, and there might have been some chance of his disputing with Cowper the palm of popularity. There could be none of his disputing it with Scott and Bvron. A new world had been born with “ Marmion " and the Lay, and Crabbe belonged to the old.
That is perhaps the. Impression he Is most certain to make on the ordinary modern reader of poetry. He is old fashioned. He who lived thirty years longer than Cowper is much less modern that the best of Cowper. He who lived through the first generation of the nineteenth century belongs entirely to the eighteenth. This Is so both in manner and in substance. His verse is hi* own, *of course, and no one else’s, or he would

GOOD SENSE IN GOOD VERSE. j
A GREAT POET is among the very J greatest of men, and the • Jiours j we spend in his company are : among the highest our lives attain.. ! But is not there some resulting loss from this isolation of the peak of j poetry? Some people can never climb j these heights; very few can climb them : often. There used to be so many easier '| hills to climb. The Moral Satires, The | Vanity of Human Wishes, The Traveler, j The Village are certainly poetry of a ! lower sort than the Ode on Intimations of Immortality, or the Hymn to Intel- ! lectual Beauty. But they had the advantage of interesting every intelligent j man in England. Is there not a danger 1 of poetry becoming a kind of specialism, which only the initiated, or only people of a* definitely imaginative turn of mind, feel called upon to touch? Is it inevitable that after a century of great poetry and high imagination there should no longer ! be any room for the old pleasure in good sense and good ver§e?
That is a question too large to pursue; buf* there, at any rate, is the essence of Crabbe; good sense and good verse, a rare knowledge of the smaller ways of human character, a keen eye for the smaller doings of nature. English land-
4
scape was never so loved as it is to-day, and the everlasting human comedy never had more students. Well, Crabbe is a master of both. Of the lowlands, that is, in both cases. Heights and depths, whether moral or physical, are not his province. But when he keeps to the level land, as he generally does, he knows every inch of the ground. It Is the business of poetry to add the touch of life and pleasure to old sights and sounds that, till it came, were mere dull facts and nothing more. Who does It better than Crabbe for his Suffolk fields and waters? Let the people who fill Aldeburgh and Felixstowe to-day look over the description in Peter Grimes" of the typical Suffolk river, with its low-tide stretch of gull-haunted mud and seaweed,
Where the loud bittern, from the bullrush home, /
Gives from the salt-ditch side the bellowing boom;
and the next time they take a sail on the
Orwell or the Deben they will see a great
deal they never saw before and delight In
all sorts of things which hitherto they
have only seen. And before they start
out again along the pleasant Suffolk
roads on their feet or their bicycles, let
them take up ** The Lover’s Journey," and
not only enjoy its finely told tale, but by j
the help of It get eyes to see as Crabbe i
Saw them over the hedges, and with his
loving interest,	.
The unnumbered cottages and farms That have for musing minds unnumbered charms.
His poems are everywhere full of touches of this sort, waking to delighted activity dormant pleasures and sympathies that slept unconscious in us before. And he will often stop to give us a large landscape for its sake like the opening of " Delmy Has Danger," and the fine Autumn picture near its end with the wood
Where the rough wind alone was heard to move,	-	.*■.
In this, the pause of nature and1 of love, When now the young are reared, and when the old,
Lost to the tie* grow negligent and cold. Far to the left he saw the huts of men, Half hid in mist that hung upp^the-fen; Before him swallows, gathering?* fSir the sea,
Took their short flights and twittered-on the lea:
And near the beansheaf stood/ the harvest done.	'
And slowly blackened in the sickly sun.
How every line, every word, tells! The
poet has seen it all, and he can make us
see It; he has felt it all, and he can-make
us feel it after him. The magic, indeed,
of nature or her mystery, it Is not in him
to give; but who can better give us the
pleasure of our everyday companionship
with her? And there are many days when
we ask for nothing more. Where Ifl it

Truth and poetry; there are both in Crabbe, as Wordsworth said. Every one has felt the pleasure of satisfied thirst as a fact; everyone who has read these lines has felt it also as poetry.
'	* THE STORY TELLER*
THE other side of Crabbe is the novelist inverse. Here-agaln he certainiy receives far less recognition than ho deserves. Everybody reads novels nowadays and ^everybody professes to like watching the play of character. Well, few novelists have had such an eye as Crabbe for the small things that are always playing their great part in the shifts and turns of Its human comedy. It Is not surprising that Jane Austen said she could have married him. They have a great deal in common, and stretch friend-
m
ly hands across the gulf that separates prose from verse. She had not poetry enough In her, one suspects, to get the full pleasure out 6f " The Lover’s Journey," his masterpiece; but how she would have enjoyed •' Delay Has Danger ” and ** The Old Bachelor." and ** Procrastination *’ and ** The Frank Courtship." And now another great novelist, the greatest of the living, must, one would imagine, delight in Sir Owen Dale, who is, indeed, his own Egoist in lltte! Certainly both would appreciate a hundred fine bits of observation in every story. No novelist ever painted the unconscious growth of a love affair better than it is done Jn “Delay, Has Danger"; and how well Crabbe puts little humorous touches such as the beginning of the last of the old j bachelor's adventures with the other sex. ! Time after time the maid went out and in, ^ Ere love was yet beginning to begin;
