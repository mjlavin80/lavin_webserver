.Vctr Ytirk Times Saturday Review of Bookx:	|
May I	to	those interested in tbe '
story of Goffe and Whalley to obtain, if ; possible, a copy of Blackwood's Maguzlne 1 of March, 1847? It contains a. seventeen- j pagre article—very quaint and interesting— 1 called " The Cave of the Regicides,” the 1 writer evidently not tn sympathy with the regicides or their Puritan defenders.
