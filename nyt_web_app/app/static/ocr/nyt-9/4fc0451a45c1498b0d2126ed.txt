Wonders it Mr.Gosae thinksthe “ Co-;medie \Huinalne.r means tho “ Human Farce,”-1 Anatole France’s 'book, which - Mr, Gosse selects' as most Intimately representing the writer, is, by the way, ,iri its essential- motive no more " ironj ; ic ** than it is 41 funny.’* It Is one of : tbo moat powerful, most sincere, most : repulsive of modern French novels, which is# we fear, on the last-named
s
point, saying a good deal. It is a bald, cruel picture of natures that are not Oc-, praved only because they peem born without morals; no change for the -worse seems possible. The faint gleams . of decency and goodness the author permits to pas3 across the scenes he ; portrays appear to have the sole pur. pose of deepening the sombre, sordid, squalid gloom.	^
Curiously enough, the defects of Mr*;-Gosse’s treatment of French prose are much less obvious in his treatment of French poetry, as to which he has itir > sight at once delicate and sober. And in fairness we should add that his spirit of honest sympathy in his criticism of a literature at once alien and intimately neighborly is admirable.
M r. EDMUND GOSSE has essayed to do for English readers what the corps of trained and gifted French critics do for French readers with reference to French literature—to present a series of portraits of contem-j porary writers. He has added sketches i of two or three writers of a somewhat remote past, but more than three-fourths of his pictures are of writers still living or recently departed. They compete, therefore, in a way, with the output of the most brilliant of French essayists of our own time. It is clearly a hazardous venture- Mr. Gosse mod*-estly evades too strict or too nearly immediate comparison by pleading in his preface that his portraits are not “ from the front/’ not “ from a direct and complete point of view,” but are in fact " in profile.’* And most*' of them are “ snap-shots, as it were, at authors in the course of their progress/*
But though comparison is, in this way, deprecated, it cannot be wholly evaded, and we are bound to admit that this fact is unfortunate for Mr. Gosse.
His book is interesting. It is for the general reader informing. It will help those who are curious about current French books, and it gives a certain set. of facts as to these books and their authors which it is extremely pleasant and even necessary to have—facts as to dates, as to specific origin, as to classification among the various “ schools," as to the inter-relations of the men discussed.	>
' It is far from being an indispensable book, but it is decidedly a useful one. It stimulates curiosity and it satisfies it upon' points of which the chance reader cannot always readily * get knowledge. But Mr, Gosse’s critical judgment is not in our opinion, very trustworthy or even very engaging. He does not so much mislead as fail to lead at all. He is a patient and careful student, He can tell you, and does tell you, a lot as to the order in time of this or that writer's work, and whether the dates sustain or refute the inference of one being •• influenced ” by another. But we do not find that his insight Is original, or penetrating, helpful, or inspiring, as is that of so many of the French critics laboring in like fields.
Nor can we quite understand some of his interpretations of the French language, to say nothing of French genius, Thus, In warning his own countrymen that Anatole France is an “ ironist/* ancl ^nnot be appreciated by any one who does not take him as a/.i ironist, Mr. Gosse says: " To come to a case in point, tne very title of the ‘ Histoire Comicjue ’ is a dissimulation. The idea of calling this tale of anguish and disillusion a ' funny story 1 would certainly baffle us, If we did not, quite by chance, in the course of a conversation
