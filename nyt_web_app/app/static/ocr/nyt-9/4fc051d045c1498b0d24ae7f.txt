CTL. NICHOLAS SMITH is another of :
•	those who are ready to break a lance j with Dr. Osier over the question of | the usefulness of old men. And this vol- ' ume sets Itself to multiply instances of old age still in harness and doing its work ■ efficiently. Naturally there are all the historic exampIes^-Gladstone, Russell i Sage, and the rest—but Col. Smith has [ gathered from newspapers and like sources vast numbers of people in the lesser walks of life still hale, hearty, und useful—or* at least, still useful, in spite of the burden ot years. Particularly he cites many white-hulred ministers of religion. One of these being retired from his pastorate at seventy-odd, studied medicine and engaged in active practice of that profession until his death some years later.
Col. Smith goes over the list of Amer-lean men of letters, and shows liow much of their work was the work of old men. He writes of elderly engineers and of women centenarians, of the effect of work (not overwork) upon longevity, of when (if ever) one is too old to learn, of the " futility and absurdity of making any particular mathematical age a dead line between usefulness and mere cumbering of the stage. His opinion is that It is ] good for the aging man to stay in har- ! ness, and good for the world to have him in harness. The book further discusses the obligation of the aging to resist gravity " to keep themselves young, and the importance of the care of the body and the mental habit of optimism. Upon these matters eminent medical -authorities are quoted, and especially Sir Henry Thompson. In short. Col. Smith makes out what looks like a very good case for the almost discredited veteran. An index enables the reader to fortify himself by express back reference to the cloud of witnesses from real life—the " masters " of old age ** of the title.
