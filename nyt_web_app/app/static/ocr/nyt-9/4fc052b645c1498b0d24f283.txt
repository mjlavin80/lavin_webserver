i Descriptive. Historical, Biographical, Statls-llc&l* Second edition. Edited under the ■ auspices of the Bureau of Missions by the Rev. Henry Otis Dwight, D. D. ; the Rev. H. Allen Tupper. Jr.. D. D.. and the Rev. Edwin Munseil Bliss, D. D- Pp. xiv—851. 4to. New York:	F'unk	&	Wagnalls.
IT is twelve years since the first edition of " The Encyclopaedia of Missions " appeared. Since its publication, say the editors, " political changes have parceled out among the nations the islands of the Pacific, have brought one at least of the Asiatic nations into parity of influence with Western powers in shaping the destinies of the Far East, and have marked all Africa with the familiar national colors of Europe, and have made her mysterious central regions a field for the personally conducted tourist, and a participant in the privileges of the Universal Postal Union." The political events indicated here have affected tho work of missionaries throughout the world necessarily, and missions have developed and changed apart from the alterations produced by modified political conditions. AH these changes are recorded in the second edition of ** Tho Encyclopaedia of Missions ” now before us.
As the editors said in their preface to the first edition, the sc'ope of the book’s plan demantled that ■* minutiae must give place to perspective. However fascinating the details might be, they must be constantly used merely as illustrations.” This rule has been followed consistently in the new edition, with the result that the bock gives a bird’s-eye view of the missions of the world, and serves as a signpost—if the mixed metaphor will pass —to places where details may be found. For example, though mention is made of the Boxer troubles in China in 1900 in the article on the China Inland Mission, nothing is said of the political cause of the uprising; under the head China, however, is a list of the recent books on the country. It is thus as a signpost that the book reaches its greatest value to the average person, while hr who is chiefly interested in mission work will find the various articlrs by themselves informa-tory and provocative of thought.
Although the volume is devoted chiefly to Protestant foreign mission work, it does not ignore the home mission field or the work of city missionaries. Nor does it pass over the work of the Roman Catholic missions. This is so enormous and in its organization so different from that of , Protestantism that even witho.it the rule quoted above, it would be impossible to treat of it at any length. What is told about it, however, is given without comment, and an appendix of three and a half pages gives the approximate static ties of Homan Catholic missions and a list of fifty-seven orders and societies engaged in mission work.
The appendices to the volume contain much interesting information. The first of them gives a list of foreign missionary societies, from which it appears that there are 273 Protestant organizations endeavaring to convert to their own views the heathen or those who hold different opinions from theirs. The names of the home mirsion societies are not given. Another appendix gives the dates of the extension of Protestant missions since " the time of Carey.” 179,'t; the view of the growth of missions is certainly interesting and instructive. In the third and fourth appendices lire given lists of versions of the Bible, and of the missionaries who have made translations or revisions of the Bible. It is curious to notice in the former that the Prevised Version of the Bible is omitted. This list gives the names of .W> languages and UJ) dialects in which ihe Proiestant Bible is obtainable. The list *>f translators, the editors warn us, must be accepted as merely tentative. It contains the names of "vfii: persons, however, some of whom made versions in more than one tongue— William Carey, for example, translating the Bible into no fewer than six dialects. A valuable feature of the book is its biographies, which contain matter relating to missionaries not always to be found in other biographical works, and certainly not elsewhere brought together for reference so conveniently.
