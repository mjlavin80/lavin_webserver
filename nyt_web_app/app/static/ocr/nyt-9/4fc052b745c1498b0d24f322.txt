A STILL more surprising fact is that David Anderson and Robert ! Hichens jointly started a weekly
i
newspaper called Mistress and Maid, , which was designed as an organ of domestic servants. The tastes of the butler who yearned to retire from the dull routine of society to the possession of a comfortable public house, of the cook who yearned to share the butler’s fortunes and his trials, of the footman with an eye for a good ’orse, the parlormaid with aristocratic leanings, the housemaid with dreams of romance and chivalry, the page boy with theatrical ambitions, were all appealed to in this publication. It is interesting to be reminded that some of Mr. Hlchens’s earliest stories were given to an unresponsive world through this medium. How difficult it is to imagine the author of “ The Garden of Allah,"
“ Flames,” *' The Imaginative Man,” and “ Felix ’* starting his literary career by deliberately writing stories for servants! But when you think of it, there are passages in “ The Woman with the Fan M and some of Mr. Hioh-ens’s other tales of the wickedness of London society which exactly harmonize with the parlormaid’s point of view. They do say in London that the places to learn just how bad society is are the servants’ halls in Belgravia, and that if you want to know all about the vices and follies of royalty you must consult the flunkies in the royal palaces.
