UMING boldly to explain what Is happening behind the scenes In Russia—what has happened for a half century past—Alexander Ular's book is, to say the very least of It, lively, Interesting, and surprising. it Is also In many parts hysterical, abusive, and obviously unfair—for the point of view of the Red Revolutionary, while perfectly understandable under Russian conditions, is nevertheless not the proper point for a critic of men and policies to do his thinking' and writing from. Which is not saying that the root of the matter is not in the book. As you read—In the face of the hysterics and the warped point of view—you can't help suspecting that the root of the matter is there. The very text of the sermon seems to promise as much. That text was as follows:
Materially and morally, the Russian autocracy Is In a state of senile decay, which must inevitably terminate in death. It has outlived itself. During a period of nearly thirty years a process or internal decomposition has destroyed the greater part of the vital energy, and even the rigid structure of that political organization which the world oelieved the most stable and powerful in existence. Throughout this period of corruption the most civilized nations, the most subtle diplomatists, the most astute financiers, have been prostrating themselves before the worm-eaten throne of the Czars.
*.*
TO which it is added that "by*a sad irony of fate, the prestige of the Muscovite autocracy has increased beyond the Russian frontier in proportion to the decline of its internal forces." According to M. Ular, the fifty years between Sevastopol and Port Arthur represent at once a period of external splendor^, and internal decay. The first half of that J-eriod—from the defeat in the Crimea to the victory of Plevna—- exhibits," he says, " the beneficent consequences to the nation of its masters* distress.’* Plevna “ Inaugurated a moral decadence.** For the ** reforms in the sixties " had inspired &ome, at least, of the one-time serfs to regard as “ rights ’* what the Czar and his advisers persisted in regarding as
favors ” merely, and the very notion that these favors could be construed as rights startled the autocrat—always, according 10 Ular. an aDnormai pathological specimen rather than a man—feo as to throw him into the hands of the plotting and greedy bureaucrats. Every patriot became a Nihilist—in the eyes of the Government—and so presently In fact. And the i^ign became one of tyranny and 'Whi ilesale peculation on one side and utter abasement or dynamite on the other.*
V
IN an account of “ general conditions prevailing at the outbreak of tho Russian Revolution *’—which revolution he thinks is now well under way—the author declares “ the personal action of tbe Executive—^Czar, Princes, Ministers, and Generals—is the c&pitsi factor **:
Analysis of this Executive was therefore incumbent on me. The facts do not make pretty reading. But they are authentic, historical, exact. Ana it Is the facts alone that are of importance. The personages themselves are uninteresting, and I regard them merely as casual actors of a historic part. Prom this standpoint, therefore, I discuss them freely.
Indeed, Mr. Ular does “ discuss them freely." His facta, “ authentic, historical, exact," form the most complete catalogue of scandal, madness, and crime that could be desired (for clinical purposes, of course,) by the most morbid pathological enthusiast. All the Romanoffs (or Holst ein-G otto rps as he prefers to call them) are physical degenerates and mentally warped and disjointed; the Czars are epileptic, mad, or silly, and the Grand Dukes perverted criminals—thieves, liars, perjurers, murderers, violators of women.
The Czar, “ an anachronism who theoretically claims omnipotence while in reality be Is merely _the fulcrum of a caste of tyrants,” must nevertheless be the point of attack for the revolutionists, for thus only “ can the ruling party be defeated." So the author casts all sorts of aspersions upon the Imperial Une said to be descend-' ed from Rurik the Norman, and particularly asserts that the present family counts among its crimes a purely German blood. In fact, he wilt have it that the people of the villages of Little Russia complain that In Russia everybody who is anybody is German. Taking the Czars seriatim from Peter IIL, they are exhibited frankly (but not without animus) as “ pathological specimens,'* victims of hysteria, played upon by events, tmnd chance, and designing men. Alexander I. “abounded In incoherent expressions and In tears." He was " savage and sentimental by turns.*1 Nicholas I had fits and worse things.. Alexander H,—the Liberator—In-. berited " all the vices of the Holsteln-Gottorp3M and the “ undefined idealism of Louisa, his Prussian grandmother,’"
, And so: On down to tho reigning Nicholas , the Unfortunate:	„	...	, V ;
^ " His . menial ^content is :-a more; figure7 of ' eroeccb-. from his earliest youth his tutors
military' instructors declared openlythat “ Nicholas IL Would have been exempted from military service for Insufficiency of intellect in any country, by any army doctor/* In his boastful moods he pretends to omniscience—ne bursts into tears when asked to give the date of a journey.
He is "entirely subservient to three women^his mother, his consort, and his sister Xenia,” but particularly to the two last, who are ’* reactionaries.” He resorts also to meteorologists, astrologers, hypnotists, and spiritualists duly inspired tand subsidized) by the Grand Dukes.
Of these. Serge, (now “ eliminated *' that's the jargon,) was not fit to print, and Vladimir is held up as the most accomplished rake and peculator in Europe. " Where," said one to a Russian General in Manchuria, whose soldiers were marching barefoot. where are their boots? ” “ What." said the General, '* their boots? Why, in the pocket of the Grand DuKe Vladimir." In the same Grand Ducal pocket we are told may be found " certain locomotives paid for but never ordered; 30,000 overcoats made of Perm sheepskins, and several thousand horses.’*

MR. ULAR dissects the other Grand Dukes also — but the sample above will serve. Next he devotes himself to the exposition of Plehve through his career as " fortune hunter, informer, traitor, and parricide,*' through his administration or Hie secret police, when (according to the author) he invented plots in order to win favor with the Czar—through all the web of terror ho sat spinning till the end came a few months ago from the revolutionary'bomb thrown at the hated Minister's nickel steel armored carriage. Ular tells all about the planning, ripening, and execution of this particular elimination "—speaking as one having authority.
In another place he analyzes at length the career of that M. Witte who has lately visited America and spoken somewhat boastfully about his part in a famous peace treaty.
By Ular's account Witte s upbuilding of an economic Russia, while it has actually
i v *	«.. r	j
begun to- create Industries' and interests * which will live and tend to destroy Czar-dom, has at the same time applied the screw cruelly to tbe already overburdened proletariat. It is not a healthy growth, but a thing forced and swollen by all sorts of artifices and a burden which is near crushing the country. It must be admitted that the exposition of Witte doesn't leave upon the mind of the reader a perfectly clear idea of what it Is all about, but he is not accused, it appears, of any crimes. No other bureaucrat, save perhaps Count Lamsdorff, Is spared that.

THE scandals of the administration exposed, the author examines the revolutionary forces. These he seems to set down as national movements against Caardom, which has never really assimilated tlie medley of races which it overshadows. He l'lnds these national aspirations in Finland. In Poland, (not among: the Polish nobles, however,) in Georgia, Rgthenia, Armenia, among the Jews, even among the Greater Russians themselves. He does not say in so many words that Russia revolutionized will be not one but many, yet you may infer at least the probability of such a thing. The rashness of languor*? which makes the book particularly readable serves, of coure. to discredit it as a scrlcus study— but it Is infinitely suggestive.
