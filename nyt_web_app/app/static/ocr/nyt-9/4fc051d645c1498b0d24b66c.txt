Sarath Kumar G&bsfa’s .Livelx Tale of Loye ind Adventure in the Hast.*
HE most natu'ral -inference from a. reading of The Verdict of the Gods,”- by Sarath Kumar ; Ghosh, would be that this entertaining tale of Oriental love and • adventure ia the work of some . clever student of Eastern lore who has purposed to conceal his Western iden-tlty and at tbe same time strengthen the illusion of bis Arabian Nights1 stq.-Ties by adopting- as a nom de plume the most curious collection of names be could think of. Certainly there is nothing about the book, even to the excellent English in which it is written, to suggest ihat its author Is any other than a Saxon in good and regular standing, yet it is authoritatively stated that such an inference would be entirely wrong and that Sarath Kumar Ghosh is really an Indian of high caste and ancient lineage, who was educated to practice law at the English bar, but who prefers to utilize his more recently discovered gift for fiction and follow a
literary career.
Tht3 knowledge of the author’s training explains the otherwise somewhat puzzling combir-.ation which the siory offers of the mysteries and legends of the East and the science of the West.
The roost marvelous happenings are described with all the simplicity of actual matters of experience, and then, apparently for the benefit of the matter-of-fact among his readers*, there are added a materialistic 'commentary and a philosophic, instead of a theosophic, explanation. Both of these are, however, so skillfully assigned and incorporated in the story that they will not at all disturb those fond enough of mental thrills and shudders to appreciate the abundance of both in this narrative of the awful adventures of Narayan Lai. juggler, once upon a time, to an Indian King. It was all told long ago to another King who lay sick unto death upon his crystal couch, on the chance that by such proof of how a man may be in the grip of death and yet escape, the story teller might send new hope Into his heart* As for ourselves, we doubt not that the remedy was effective.
A stern old ruler on the banks of the Ganges found Narayan Lai, who passed for the Court juggler, but was of course really the greatest of princes, making love to his one precious daughter, kept hidden from all men’s eyes for seventeen years in order that she might be mated with some Prince worthy to perpetuate her ancient race. The youth swore that he was of sufficiently noble birth to meet the case, but he was laughed at, accused of the basest ingratitude, and sentenced to death at the hands of the guards. But the guards, for some mysterious reason, refused to cut off his head, and, rather than do it himself, the King decided to put Narayan to the ordeal by means of the six hardest tests of his occult powers that could be devised and thus leave the verdict with the gods, who could be trusted to protect the youth's life if he were really of Kshattric blood. The story details the seemingly unavoidable deaths which Narayan escaped before he proved his Innocence and won his Princess.
1 If there is any form of destruction of which the author does not give a sample in the course of his narrative, it must be a very painless and obscure one, since, in addition to the various horrible demises which the King planned for Narayan Lai, there was an entirely separate and independent assassin pursuing him with intent to make assurance doubly sure. Horror is added to horror and marvel to marvel, until Chapter XI. finds even the most unimpressionable of readers feverishly 3.w3.iting the grand finale, which includes an enraged tiger, a mad elephant, and the last fiendish attempt of the assassin to save his own life at the expense of Narayan Lai s. But it would be unfair to give the outline of a story whose best quality lies in the well-sustained suspense of its events. “ The Verdict of the Gods " can be recommended as an antidote for ennui in several of its forms.
