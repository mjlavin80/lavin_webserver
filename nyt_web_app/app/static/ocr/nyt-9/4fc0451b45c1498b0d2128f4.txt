with an acquaintance with the views of hierarchy and bureaucracy. Here is an interesting question; What is the relation of the Czar to the Synod and to the Church in general? Orthodox Russians are extremely sensitive on this point, for they hold that, theoretically, tbe Church has no " head *' but Christ. Practically, however, the Czar exorcises absolute sway and influence over the Church through the Holy Synod which, created by Peter, turned the administration of the Church into a political Institution.
In the chapters dealing with the no-bless2 and the serfs we find an exposition that is both sound and readable, illustrative of a condition which is well worth comparing to that of our own Southern States during the period of reconstruction. The serfs were freed. Valuable servants and workmen as well as useless parasites suddenly found themselves without masters who had provide^ for their material needs. These masters received compensation from the Government for bein? deprived, of this obligation. The result was two- ; fold: the noblesse used the compensa-
RUSSIA
An Enlarged, Rewritten Edition of and Authoritative and Informing English Work.*
NEW and rewritten edition of Sir Donald Mackenzie Wallace's valuable book on the people and political and social institutions of the Russian Empire comes at a particularly appropriate time which need not he expatiated upon. "Russia” was first published in 1S77; from that time on it has received serious consideration from students; it has also been widely read as an entertaining piece of literature.
As Russia itself has no analogy among the political institutions of the world, so the historian of Russia, in order to be serviceable to the intelligence and attractive to the imagination, must approach his subject, absorb it, and express it In an unusual if not unique manner. More than all. his equipment must include a profound knowledge of the Russian language and the dialects of the people and the abll-ity to appreciate the point of view of Grand Dukes, bureaucrats, revolutionary students, peasants. Sir Donald’s tastes, equipment, and experience have made him an ideal historian of and for Russia. The book when it first appeared was the result of some twelve years passed in the empire of the Czar —as diplomat, student, traveler, and observer. Since then, the author has revisited the country and broadened his acquaintance among Russians. A casual glance through its pages shows that it is made up of a series of papers, logically or naturally but not chronologically related to one another, and covering subjects widely different in matter and treatment. Some of these papers appear to be mere traveler's impressions, with or without attendant judgments and opinions, others are so-

j cial studies in which information itf revealed through conversation with priest, exile, peasant, or physician; then there are purely historical essays, both expository and controversial, and political studies which range from intimate conversations with courtiers to still more intimate chats with revolu-
tionaJres. In short, almost every subject is treated of in a method in keeping with its nature, from the opening chapter, “ Traveling in Russia," through a discussion of the serfs, landed proprietors, and the noblesse, to the Government’s theory and practice of “ territorial expansion and foreign pol-1 icy.’*
THERE are several points in the book which, although familiar to the readers of the first edition, are worth emphasizing at this time. The chapter on the Cossacks, both historical and contemporaneous, gives an inter- j esting view of these irregular frontier soldiers of the Czar. Here, as elsewhere, the author does not pose as a prophet; but, in the light of the treatment that the Cossacks have received from the Japanese, it is interesting to recall two opposite views concerning this notorious colonizing and military organization. Military men have asserted to the author " that the Cossack organization is an antiquated institution, and that the soldiers which it produces, however useful they may be In Central Asia, would be of little service in regular European warfare.*' But as to the Cossacks:	“They regard
themselves as the most valuable troops which the Czar possesses, believing '.hemselves capable of performing anything within the bounds of human pos- .
sibiiity. and a good deal that lies beyond that limit. More than once, Don Cossacks have assured me that if the Czar had allowed them to fit out a flo-
*
tilla of small boats during the Crimean war, they would have captured the British fleet, as their ancestors used to capture Turkish galleys on the Black Sea."
The question of Church and State is discussed with a profound knowledge not only of the creation and development of the institutions of each, but
tion for the most part in tneir natu- ( rally unproductive and improvident 1 manner; the serfs, to a large extent, be- ; came vagabonds. Neither class has j yet been reclaimed.	;
The Institution of the Zemstvo, of l which we have heard so much recently ! through its congress at Moscow, is clearly defined both historically and by the light of what the author was able lo learn through personal attendance at the meetings of the Provincial and Municipal Councils. The pages dealing with civil law and the execution thereof present the paradox of foreign codes literally administered—a crime committed, the law provides a punishment of that crime, and the Judge simply sees that the letter of the law is applied, without taking into consideration any extenuating circumstances.
THE latest phase of the revolution* ary movement in Russia as inter- | preted by Sir Donald shows the rise of a new power which combines j the modified theories of the old <J Intellectuals" with the activity of the
Nihilists; and this new power, one product of which was Father Gapon, finds a fruitful field for its propaganda among the various labor and trade union organizations which the Government has permitted, it to organize on condition that they should eschew all poiitical discussion and agitation.
All persons who are Interested In the present stirring events in the Far East or who wish to find the reason for Russia's policy In the Balkans and on the Persian and Afghanistan frontiers should not fail to read the chapter OQ ** Territorial Expansion and Forelgu Policy.’* The statistical and political history of this subject is given, ending with a brief sketch of the causes which led up to the Russo-Japanese war. The tvhole secret of expansion and of the war lies in this sentence: Russia desired markets for her commodities which may be manipulated from St. Petersburg; Japan objected, for purely economic reasons, to have these markets at her own door.
Sir Donald points out that, sooner or later, the bureaucratic machine driven by the autocratic power must break down In ruins which may engulf the source to which it owes its creation and development In the meantime, ** it is impossible to foresee the effects of concessions in the shape of reforms which are only wanted as the result of radical changes and as stepping stones to other changes of a more advanced and drastic kind still.*’	•
