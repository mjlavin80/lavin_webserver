[NPOUBTEBLY Mr. Curtis has thrown together In this volume a vast deal of miscellaneous information about the Indian Empire of his Majesty Edward VII. Readers Of former works of the industrious author need not be told that his method is to combine with a mass of observations and deductions of hfs own—r the observations taken hastily upon his travels and the deductions not too carefully -checked—statistics, fragments of history, geography, ethnology, guide book information, and what not, gathered from all available sources. Thus, besides his own Impressions of Bombay, of Indian railway travel, of the relative merits of Mussulman and Hindu, of the conduct and policy of the ex-Vlceroy, Lord Curzon, Mr, Curtis provides also a sketch of the system of government, figures of the population by provinces, by religion, and by races, figures also of the number of persons destroyed annually by snakes, tigers, and other savage beasts, figures again of the number of Britons and the number of natives employed in the Indian civil service and in the various branches of the Indian army. Not only so, but he sets down the numbers of mites of rail-'way in operation and under construction and explains what proportion is operated by the Government and what proportion by private corporations* He provides also statistics of trade and a guide book to the cities and wonders of the land of Ak-bar the Great. He makes excursions into the history of the religion of Buddha, the Hindu caste system, the Mogul Empire, and the mutiny, relating by the way stories of numerous dynasties of jewel-clad Rajahs, Nizams, and such like minor and tributary potentates still existing by grace of the inertia of the country and the pmcticnl recognition by the British Government of the folly of *' trying,*1 as Mr. Kipling says, " to hustle the East."
TT would, no doubt, be hard to find in [ another single volume such a variety of information about India and Indian affairs, but the assemblage, with all its facts and figures, lacks that authority v. hirh is necessary to give full value to a work of this kind. Mr. Curtis's own ob-scrvntions, while in many cases exceedingly curious and interesting to the un-travcied, (as where, for instance, he gives a diagram of an Indian first-ciass railway carriage and describes its appointments in detail,) are apt to be commonplace, and the total is, of course, utterly undigested. The following items selected from the more than five hundred pages of matter will serve sufficiently well as samples of the whole.
It may be set down, first, that the author l>esins his narrative on the Peninsular and Oriental liner, and inveighs against the women of the British aristocracy (observed upon this passage) for wearing quantities of jewels on shipboard. Then, coming to Bombay, *' no mean city,” he writes:
Few cities have such a splendid array of public buildings. None that I have ever visited except Vienna can show an assemblage so imposing, with such harmony and artistic uniformity, combined with convenience of location, taste of arrangement, and general architectural effect. There is nothing, of course, in Bombay that will compare with our Capitol or Library at Washington, and its state and municipal buildings cannot compete irdividually with Parliament House in London. tla’ JIutrl d$ Yille <>f Paris, or the Palace of Justice in I’rufcsids or many others I might :iamr. Hut neither Washington nor London nor Paris nor nny other European or American city possesses such a broad, sh.i'ird boulevard as Bombay, with the Indian Oroa.i upon one side, and on the uthir, stretching for a mite or more, a sir . . s.'-in:: nf siatMy edifices. Vienna has the lt<>.!!.■ v:\vil and buildings, but lacks the water efl'.-ct. It was as if all the buildings (*; tho l ’niv,jrsiiy of Chicago wen* scattered a’o:;*; Uic Ink*' front in Chicago from the i iv- ;• to Twelfth Street.

I ’mve vcr beer. nMe to satisfy myself of ; in* rli'i iv ition of the name. Some wise i s.ty that formerly before the days of r;tilr«Mds. ptople were carried about in se.ian ch-iirs. as they are still in China, and ih men v. ho carried them were called *• 1 n■!■■- others contend that the name is dU' t . the circumstance that those serv-nniLn 1'* ir tiv* while man’s hurd^n, which net .1 all likely. They certainly do not bear his baggage. They hire eoolics to do it.
Mr. Curtis says that "a first-class bearer ” can be obtained for 4T* rup' 3s 'which is Siro a month, and keep himself “ He gets his board for nothing ai the hotels for waiting on his master and on the pretext that he induced him to come there.”
Presently the author observes that in spite of a rather huge pressure o£ population—167 persons to the square mile— " there is Jess emigration from Iu^ia than from any other country,” and after an analysis of the population and indu. tries

THE author goes by rail to Delhi or Agra or Calcutta and tells you all about the discomforts of Indian railways with " their bunks too narrow for beds and too wide for seats.*' That leads to the railway statistics already mentioned. Then you may read of his Highness- Siwat Mad ha o Singh, Maharajah of Jcypore "the one hundred and twenty-third," of his line, and therefore almost if not quite as aristocratic as the Emperor of Japan, who Is only the one hundred and twenty-third of his line.
One feature of street life In Jeypore is likely to make nervous people apprehensive. The Maharajah and other rich men keep panthers, leopards, wildcats, and other savage beasts trained for tiger hunting and other sporting purposes and allow their grooms to lead them around through tho crowded thoroughfares just as though they were poodle dogs. It is true the brutes wear muzzles, but you do not like the casual way they creep up behind you and sniff at the calves of your legs.
OF course you read about nautch girls, fakirs, thugs, famines, " and their „ antidotes," and receive some more enlightenment on the frontier question (toward Afghanistan) and the celebrated Lhasa mission. There are chapters, too, on education in India and on the women of India with some mention of the former wasteful practice of burning widows upon their husbands* graves. American missions in India are also mentioned.
