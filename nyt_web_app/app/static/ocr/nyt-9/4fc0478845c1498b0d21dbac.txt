THE HISTOIIY OF FAIRFIELD. FAIR-FIIiXD COUNTY. CONNECTICUT. FROM 1700 TO 1800. By Mrs. Elizabeth Hub-boll Sclienck. Vol. II. Pp. xvl.-53S. Svo, cloth. New Tort; Tlie Author.
It is several years since the first volume of Mrs. Schenck's " History of Fairfield ’* appeared; now the second is published, bringing iiie story of the town down to the year 1800. More Mrs. Sehenek will stop working; the labor has been too much for her advancing years.
In her two volumes one may find about everything- relating to Fairfield from its foundation to the beginning of the nine* teenth century. The town was settled in 1G39, and was burned by Gen. Tryon la 1770; it had merely the usual experiences of towns on the north shore of Lons Island Sound. Yet Mrs. Sclienck has spent years in getting together every possible fact relating to the town, and printing it In her fat volumes. If Westchester County (for example) were treated in the same minute way, its history would fill a hundred volumes. One doubts if Fairfield deserves the care spent on it by its loving historian. The books are history through a microscope; they are monuments of Mrs. Schenck’s assiduity and carefulness, but not of her good senso, and even local history Is Improved if compiled with a eense of proportion.
