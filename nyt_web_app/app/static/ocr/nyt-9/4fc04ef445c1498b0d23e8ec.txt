A'cjn York Ttmen Saturday Review of Book*;
In the critique or review written by Prof. M illihin E. Dodd of Randolph-Macon College. Virginia, of *• Diplomacy in the International Envelopment of Europe,*’ under '* ideals in Diplomacy,” we have, ** Diplomacy lias a bad reputation Ui the minds of most men. A diplomat is one who ‘ lies abroad for hio country/ some one has irreverently said.” The ** some one who irreverently said " was Sir Henry Wotton, an Englishman, who lived in t£e reigns of Elizabeth and James I., and who was appointed by the latter sovereign as an Ambassador to Venice. Ho was a man whose mind was well SlUted to the Intricacies of the foreign diplomacy of iiis day.
The quotation as £i\*on by Prof. Dodd i^ incorrect and liable to be the cause of piacing an entirely different reading or construction upon what the author meant to convey when he wrote “ An Ambassador Is an honest gentlemun. sent to lie abroad for tbe good of his country."
