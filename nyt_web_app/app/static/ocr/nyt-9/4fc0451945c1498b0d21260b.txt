R. BURTON E. STEVENSON'S new book, published by Messrs. L*. C. Page & Co., shows by its title, ** The Young Section Hand.” that It Is not one of his historical -v.	romances, and it will be
found to be an uncommonly good railway story with a young hero who does not surpass the achievements of many a ieal youngster. Also, it gently insinuates the lesson that passengers whose easy sympathy for railway hands is volubly expressed anti stockholders desirous of larger dividends would do well not to make work for the section hands by strewing the track with papers, garbage, newspapers, magazines, bottles, discarded clothing, worthless books, and other things not too large to go through a car door.

Mrs. Henrietta R. Eliot's 44 Laura in the Mountains," published by the Lothrop Company, is distinguished from the many other books	about good	children	and
their simple enjoyments by the appearance of Indians among the characters. True, they are only contemporary Chinook berry-selling	squaws,	but	one of	them
carries a papoose on her back, and is therefore interesting, and the Eastern child will read, of her	with	burning	envy

School histories are made so dull nowadays, when their authors write expectIng their shortcomings to be compensated by " supplementary reading," that many a history class hears of the Cid, Bayard, Sidney, Roland, and Oliver once and no more, and Is not much more .intimately acquainted with Richard Coeur de Lion.
To remove this ignorance, Miss Frances N. Greon and Miss Dolly Williams Kirk have prepared, " With Spurs of Gold," such a series of tales of chivalry as even Mark Twain could not prevent a boy from liking. . It will be published by Messrs. Little, Brown &. Co. at about the same time a" " Wilderness Babies.” by Miss Julia A. Schwarz. The “ babies " arc a panther, fox, squirrel, buffalo, •whale, seal, shrew, the oppossum, bear, ■wolf, manatee, elk, beaver, molo, and a few more, and their pictures are to be drawn by Mr. John Huybers and others. The descriptions are of the elaborately simple species which average children prefer to any other sort, and remember longer.

The Rev. Samuel McChord Crothers’s lecture on the Ingersoll foundation, "The Endless Life," will be presented to Atlantic readers prior to Its appearance in book form later in the season. Mr. William Allen White’s contribution is called “The Golden Rule,” but at present a titld Is a bait, not a label, and it by no means follows that his work is strictly secular* Mr. William MacDonald anticipates the coming Franklin centenary flood with a paper' on "The Fame of Franklin/’ “Social Conditions Jn Southern Cotton Mills,'* by Miss Mary A. Bacon; “English Lawns and Literary FoIK," by Mr. Julian Hawthorne; " Pianists Now and Then,— by Mr. W. J, Henderson; “The Poetry of Landor/* by Mr. Arthur Symonds; “The Critic and i the Law," by Mr. R, W. Child; “The Country, to November/^, by Mr. H.

Miss Lucy M, Salmon will critically consider' decent Progress in the Study v of Domestic Service/’ collecting * and
criticising that mass of material collected during the last five years by methods often none too scrupulous, but sometimes by genuine scientific skill. Miss Rep-plier's convent sketches will close with "The Game of Love” and "Reverend Mother’s Feast/' Mrs. Harriet Prescott Spofford, whose first contribution to the Atlantic appeared forty-six years ago, a year later than Colonel Higginson’s first, will he represented by a story entitled "A Village Dressmaker," and tales by Mrs. Grace Ellery Channing-Stetson, Miss Alice M. Ewell, Miss or Mr. Clare Benedict, Miss E. S. Johnson, Mr. Arthur Colton, and Mr. Henry A. Beers will prevent the magazine from becoming too serious.
In the departments of religion and philosophy Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. have some valuable books In preparation. Mr. Crothers's "The Endless Life" differs so widely in Its scope and argument from that of Dr. Gordon, whose 380G lecture has been followed by discourses delivered by scientific men, that it would be subject to much discussion even if he were not the favorite essayist that he is. " The Immanence of God,” by ProfT Borden P. Bowne of Boston Universty, will command a wider audience, finding its readers wheresoever may be scattered his pupils during his thirty years at the university. *' Cities of Paul/' by the Rev. Dr. W. B. Wright, is novel in conception, successively taking up Tarsus, Tyana, Ancyra, Philippi, Old Corinth, Now Corinth.

Prof. Joseph Jastrow's “ The Subconscious *' touches on dreams; automatic action, mental and physical; hypnotic conditions, trance states, hysteria, behavior under the action of drugs are also treated, and the work Interests the inquirer into spiritualism and'the psychologist.

The little girl who plays mother to her younger sister is often absurdly successful in fiction, and Miss Nina Rhoades has produced an original story in “ How Barbara Kept Her Promise ” by making her heroine entirely unsuccessful not only in subjugating her elders but in obtaining control of her junior, a headstrong little piece of selfishness. Barbara has a delightfully heartbreaking experience, and will be a favorite with girls as long as the " little vtfeep" remains a feminine recreation. STEPHENSON BROWNE.
