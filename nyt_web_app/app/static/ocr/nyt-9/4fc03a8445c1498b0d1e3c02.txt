Recently Published Volumes of Verse by Doyle, Kirk, Wright, Bugbee, Jessup, Farquhar, and Mifflin.*
ATRIOTIC sentiment cannot be dead when so many historical events are sung with fervor if not always with poetic fire. Mr. Doyle writes with spirit and enthusiasm of deeds that have long since ceased to stir	the	public heart—of Rodney’s vote at
Philadelphia, of the check of the British at Harlem by Knowlton and Leitch, of Commodore Barry's refusal to strike his flag, of the memorial trees on
Washington Heights, and so on—and his celebration of these warlike themes gains a pathetic interest from the fact of his blindness. Many of his verses are deeply religious In tone and are healthity, almost buoyantly trustful, with an entire absence of morbidness even in the poems in which direct reference is made to his blindness. Among these is the following -sonnet to a child reading, which, though not the best in form, is one of the most touching:	.
My darling- spell the words out. You may creep Across the syllables on hands and knees,
And stumble often, yet pass me with ease And reach the spring upon the summit steep.
Oh, I could lay me down, dear child! and weep These charred orbs out* but that you then might cease
Tour upward effort, and. with Inquiries, '
Stoop down and probe my heart too deep, too deep!
I thirst for knowledge. Oh. for an endless drink! . Tour goblet leaks the whole way from the spring— No matter; to its rim a few drops cling.
And these refresh me with the joy to think That you, my darling! have the morning’s wing To cross the mountain at whose base I sink.
" Lyrics of a ' Lumberyack ' '* are verses in a dialect not familiar to this locality, and thus offer great apparent difficulties to the reader—difficulties more apparent than real, however, as they practically vanish after reading the few words of preface. The patois, which is that of the Scandinavian settlers in Northern Wisconsin and Minnesota, is simpler to un* ravel than the dialect of the Southern negro, and well reflects the simplicity of the Norse mind. The verses are largely given to the retelling of familiar stories in the strange speech, with sufficient twist to the thought expressed to make the reader remember that there is a dialect of the mind as well as of the tongue. The concluding stanza of " The Courtship of Miles Standish ” will serve as an example of the free and easy method:
Priscilla, she listen to Alden.
And den give him cute little venk.	'
And say: “ Vy not speak for yurself, Yohn?
Miles Standish ban lobster, ay tenk.*'
So Standish get double crossed planty:
And dat’s yust vat Ay vant, by yee.
Ef ever Ay get any feller	I
To doing my sparking for me!
The day seems to be returning for the celebration of pseudo-sylvan themes, such as picnics and motor excursions. In the poem called " A-Wheel" Mr. Wright with genuine gusto translates the sentiment of a pastime as delightful as it was swift to pass out of popularity, and incidentally commemorates an excellent luncheon menu for appetites of moderate ferocity. “ We lunched/* he says:
* * * I think on such wheaten bread As Hebe served on Olympus’ head;
. Oaten wafers.and crimsonjam.
Thin, pink slices, celestial ham.
Made from a fairy’s ^dream of pig;
*	Some rare delectioiv ot date and fig.
.	With a far-away flavor of sptce und quince, -.
Never tasted tjeforo or sineer. ’	.	.
.	* Little* it skHla what the^breaitis^of « .	.
Dipped; in the wine of youth ands lo ve.	.
There is an agreeable freedom, from references to goddesses in the volume called “Echoes from the Forest.” The echoes to which the author listens are the frank call of the woods and flowers and changing seasons. He also listens to the call of labor and exults In the thought of honest service. , Many of his lines are felicitous, and the following “ Sunset Phantasy ** shows a pleasant feeling for the pictorial aspects of nature:
Cloud bars of crimson strewn athwart the west, .

The flippant breeze a hush of wonder stills,
A purple darkness steals upon the scene:
And gloomy shadows o’er the waters spread;
There lingers in the sky a darkening red;
A cloudbank, mystic outlined, looms between;
And, visible within its strange dark mass.
Some phantom spires stand dimly forth to show That here a city stood till fairy hosts,
Dusk-venturesome, stole up the twilight pass And changed its semblance in the after-glow Of sunset, as the day seeks Hesper’s coasts.
As might be expected from a volume entitled “ The Charm of Youth,” the poems of Mr. Jessup are chiefly dedicated to the praise of young love. They have the unimpassioned lilt of holiday lovemaking. and while there is an occasional reference to loss and sorrow, the mood is that of the morning, and the j author apparently avoids with conscientious inten- j tion a too analytic psychology, although he devotes i a worshipful stanza to George Meredith. Perhaps j critics have proved unkind to prompt him to the daring announcement that—	!
Pictures and poems may be best when picked to pieces,
But not young love, in its May or June
*	In his volume of collected poems Mr. Farquhar takes a deeper plunge into the psychological mysteries of youthful hearts, and now and then succeeds in striking a truly poetic note, as in the first two lines of this stanza:	-
Sweet heart of maidenhood, that gives so much.
The while it gives not all!
Sweet laughter, sweet regard, and sweetest touch,
As leaflet's fall!
What is so dear in all the world’s embrace.
Where is such heavenly ease,
As in the sparkle of that moonlight face.
And tones like these?
“ The Fleeing Nymph and Other Poems.*' by Lloyd Mifflin, have the light and graceful touch characteristic of their author, and in the waste of commonplace always stretching before the persistent reader of poetry shine with refreshing suggestions of adequate training for a difficult craft. The title poem, filled with classic references, flows with a pleasant sound through the scenes of woodland life commonly associated with dryads and the great god Pan, and the simpler verses sing themselves carelessly into the mind. There seems no real occasion for the melancholy closing of the volume on these lines “ At Eventide,*’ which have a self-consciousness not elsewhere felt:	.
As one at twilight, silent and alone.
Pacing through some secluded garden-closc,
Notes the ungathered blooms, and sadly knows How all neglect their fragrance, amf disown;
Sees the parterre with crimson beauty strewn.
And where the nodding scarlet deepest glows,
Only the wind's hand take the bending rose, Where, on unfooted walks, the leaves are blown.
S.'i. wandering through the garden of my. rhymes, Now when the deepening shadows round me fall. With darkness coming and the dayspring furled,
I Fee my roses undesired of all;
They bloom and fade within a heedless world,
And I, remembering, muse upon the times.
