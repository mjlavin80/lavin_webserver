A new book on art in Spain has been written by Albert F. Culvert, author of •* The Alhambra," &c., and it will be published this month by the John Lane Company. It treats of the “ Moorish Remains in Spain," and is a " brief record " of the Arabian conquest and occupation of the peninsula, with an account of the Mohammedan architecture and decoration in the cities of Cordova, Seville, and Toledo. The priuc.pal feature of the work is the illustrations, which number over four hundred black-and-whitea and many col-or^d pictures, besides numerous diagrams, plans, &c. Mr. Calvert has made his text subservient to his Illustrations, of which a series of two hundred designs, produced to illustrate the composition and development of various schemes of Arabian ornament, will be found of special interest to students of Moorish art. The author says of the monuments:
Neither by camera, nor by brush, nor by the pen can one reflect with any fidelity the effects obtained by the Moorish masters of the Middle Ages. In their art te to be found a sense of the mysterious that appeals to one like the glint of moonlight on running water; an int^“\kle SDirit of joyousnesss that one catches from the dancing: shadows of	'J*}?
o	cun-sweot lawn; and an elusive key tP . its beauty which Is lost in. the bewildering maze of traceries, and the inextricable network of design. The form, if not the fantasy, of these fairybke, fascinating decorations may, however, be reproduced, and this I have endeavored to do.
The volume has been dedicated to Alfonso XIII.	-
