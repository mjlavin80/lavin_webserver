ESSAYS on 11 The Theory of Style ” by seven of the best writers of the nineteenth century are included In the volume on the subject by Prof. William T. Brewster of Barnard College, which the Macmillan Company is sending out. The essays are:	" Literature.” by
John Henry Newman; "Style,” by Thomas De Quincey; '* The Philosophy of Style." by Herbert Spencer; Chapters V. and VI. of “ Tho Principles of Success In Literature,” by George Henry Lewes; "Style in Literature: Its Technical Elements.” By Robert Louis Stevenson; "Style," by Walter Pater, and " On English Prose," by Frederic Harn-i son.	j
! The chapters, writes Prof. Brewster in his preface, have been selected from a contemporary rather than a historical point of view, and, taken collectively, they represent the more important bearings of the subject with os little repetition and in as much variety of idea as possible. He continues:
Newman’s essay may be regarded as an introduction, in that it states tho general problem of literature. The essays of De Quincey, Spencer, and Lewes follow, with statements of general principles and exposition of methods of a suggestive and interesting sort. Stevenson particularly. and Pj-ter are somewhat more confined; in <3 Mr. Harrison's essav Is an example of the safe, practical Ulk. the nam^ of which is legion. The volume may. therefore, be regarded as supplementing the more common smd iseful classes of books
*	* • It contains a body of ideas, certainly, that moderately advanced students of rhetoric should be ramiiiar with. The material is interesting.
He has also provided an introduction, as wetl as a set of questions, a bibliography, and notes, besides a comprehensive index.
