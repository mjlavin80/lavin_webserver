GEORGE R. BISHOP.
NY new, thoughtful, accurate work on the Philippines should command the attention of serious-minded Americans, A new interest in questions co^i^cted with territorial expansion was aroused when in J SOS it was disclosed that we might possibly receive the cession of an extensive archipelago in the Far East. Prof. Willis discusses the problem, a solution of which our treaty of peace with Spain imposed on us. The first inquiry about his book should be. What are its character and scope? Is it devoted to the setting forth of newly discovered and well-authenticated facts, and the careful drawing of conclusions from them, or is its purpose the exploitation of a theory—the justification or the condemnation of a policy?
He states his problem as one of imperialism; whether or not certain races that are called ** lower”
" should be controlled by people higher up In the conventional scale of civilization"; hence, whether we are justified in doing what we are doing in the East. He early makes it clear that he has a theorem to demonstrate—that our present policy is wrong, and should be abandoned; and this comes full circle in his last chapter, in the words, “ The first step toward a change must be a declaration of the intention to work toward independence, and a distinct definition' of the time when such independence may be possible." That is, whatever elements of uncertainty may inhere in the problem in other aspects of it, one thing must be declared now at all hazards: the time musl be " defined " when M independence may be possible,*’ To this no qualification Is attached, such as the candidate in the National campaign of 1904 interpolated —that independence should be accorded as soon as it should be '* prudent " to grant it.
The author claims to have traveled 2,700 miles In the Philippines outside of Luzon. If he did not cover too wide an area, a rather minute examination should have been possible. The physical features of the archipelago, however, he hardly touches on; nor do we find in the book any study of the inhabitants, any distingushing of the characteristics of the several clans or races, their divergent capacities, their higher or lower standing in the scale of civilization, their consequent greater or less fitness for the selfgovernment which he thinks should be conferred on them. He lumps them together indiscriminately. Then he makes clear his own conviction that ** in the nature of things no governmental control can be legitimately exercised by any set of men over an* Other.’* He quotes with disapproval Prof. Burgess's ' assertion of the contrary view, but without discussing this fundamental question. The ** belief " of the author of the Declaration of Independence, expressed in a letter to Lafayette, that it would have been better for the " brethern ” of the South American revolutionary republics to have remained under the national supremacy of Spain, with authority only to keep the peace among them ** until their experience, their emancipation from their priests, and advancement in information, should have prepared them for . complete independence”; his later expression, in a-‘ letter to John Adams, “ I do believe It would be ■ better for them to obtain freedom by degrees only;** and that ot John Stuart Mill, quoted by Dicey, that until mankind, have become capable of being improved by free and equal discussion, “ there is nothing for them but implicit obedience to an Akbar or a Charlemagne, if they are so fortunate as to find one M —all these he would probably unqualifiedly condemn.
The book Is voluminous, containing more than 450 pages; it discusses a multitude of facts, and imagines * events, many malign In character, aa likely or certain , -to happen; it discusses many matters of detail, in^ a short paper it would be possible to notice merely, a'-lft few passages. Illustrative of the author’s treatment of his theme. As the work is doubtless issued as a;c -; contribution to a present controversy, its consistency,^ Its title to be read and relied on, are important to t>e> considered.	.

At one or more joints he refers to India; and as Alleyne j£>trelan<r, wh&m lie also quotes, thinks we ■’have flown directly In the face of the ex r perfence of those European nations that i have been most successful in governing1 Eastern dependencies, It seems relevant , to consider what thf* policy of the British ‘ In India has been with reference to iro-■ provements there. Both Sir William Hunter and Sir Richard Temple hav» de~ scribed the system of " exploitation " to
•	adopt the author’s expression, of India.
PRECEDENTS IN THE EAST.
HOWEVER lavishly, long ago, that part of the gorgeous East " showered On her Kings barbaric pearls and gold,” she has long been a ** poor country," so that the construction - of great and much needed public works there, especially Irrigation canals and railways, has been possible only by a liberal use of English capftal. The guaranteeing of railroad securities proposed by our commission has Its precedent in means employed In promoting internal improvements in Britain's greatest Eastern dependency. Down tp isso about 80 par cent, of the capital expended on railways in India had been on so-called guaranteed lines, the guaranteed interest, usually up to 5 per cent., payable directly by tbe Government to the shareholders, chiefly Englishmen, as the funds were raised in England; the surplus profits, if any, divided between the Government and tbe respective companies. Sir Richard Temple said this system had been fol-owed by advantages which could not have been obtained otherwise. Reciprocally, the Government exercised considerable powers of control over the selection of routes, the fixing of rates, &c. This did not Interfere, apparently, with the development of local self-government. Sir Henry Alaine, when Law Member of the Council of the Governor General, expressed in 186S his surprise that the natives should be prepared for pven municipal government; yet. in	there
were 7G4 local district boards In India, almost exactly the number of the municipalities that we bad then established In the Philippines, So, our commission had a potent example. Prof Willis thinks such an investment of Western capital will result in the " practiral giving away of the very few valuable privileges for little or nothing.” He finds the Manila Street Railway Company obligated to pay to the Government 2V, per cenL of its gross (not net) receipts, iu compensation for its franchise, with no stipulation for reversion to tho city at any time. This, in his view, is a certain Indication that tbe outcome will be *'disastrous.1' He does not mention that it is only recently that such corporations as street railways have paid anything for their franchise privileges. The archipelago needs these improvements, and if every effort to obtain them be found to involve a danger so great that the question becomes acute whether it were not better to forego them, then the dilemma which the subject presents may well cause concern to those who are officially responsible.
However. It is in this exploitation chapter that the author praises one resolution entertained by Secretary Taft. He discusses the possibility of securing enough labor to meet the requirements of highway and railroad construction; concludes the Phiiipino is ready to work for a fair remuneration, and commends the Secretary for opposing the introduction of Chinese labor, with its consequent lowering of the wage scale. This chapter presents the dilemma already referred to, but the picture it exhibits is not wholly sombre. In harmony with this tone, it attributes a sinister motive to the commission, finding a reason for the promoting of railway construction in the belief that railway development is required for political reasons, and that the commission, having failed to act vigorously in the matter of building highways, is now ready to make excessively liberal grants in aid of the building of railways. It Is but three years since a i Condition of peace in the Christianized i parts of our new possessions was proclaimed; and new, fifty-five years after I the first great highway up the Ganges Valley from Calcutta to Delhi was opened j for Wheel traffic, it is asserted that the i building of highways in India is still neg- i lected, through preference tor railway construction. So we have time for me cor- ! rection of any mistakes we may have ttiade,	,
THE TAXATION at’ESTION.
CHAPTER XVII., on income and out* go, describes causes of diminution of income—by lightening poll taxes and taxes on stamped paper, and totally abolishing lotteries, the opium monopoly,
&c. It asserts that the imposing of a new tax—which it says was an unheard-of thing there—the land tax, from the first caused discontent and widespread hardship. Prof. Willis believes it was unwise.
Yet a great authority on Eastern matters,
Sir William Hunter, says: “That the jState should appropriate to itself a share 'pf ithe produce of the soil is a maxim of

tax of India is the .chief source ofc Government revenue there, and is acqblesced in by the natives. Prof. WlIUs also claims that tho expense of conducting the Government has greatly increased since 1898; this partly due to the creation of provincial Governments, which he advocates the abolishing of. He criticises provincial loans from the Insular Treasury, attaches a useful table showing those loans, and payments on account of them; emphasizes the danger of permitting the accumulation of balances of this description, and comments on the financial Incapacity shown in the government of the provinces and municipalities—that government understood to be mainly by the natives themselves. While advocating the granting of independence to tbe islanders he shows, incidentally, that they are financially incapable of self-government For a self-governing nation financial capacity would Beem to be indispensable.
An equally equivocal statement is to be found on Pfige 43S.
At present there seems to be a prospect of fair profits to be made from investments in Government land, at the* present nominal price, If (I) the tariff rates of the United States shall be abolished, (2) the restriction on large land holdings by corporations shall be modified, and (3) Chinese or other Asiatic labor shall be Introduced.
But he at once remarks: " If the second and third of these conditions be fulfilled, the result will be disaster to the natives, for the reasons already set forth." Leaving out of account that Secretary Taft doubtless will make an effort to have the tariff rates abolished, the second and third points demand attention. If It shall conclusively appear that the fulfillment of conditions indispensable to the obtaining of a profit from prosecuting an Important Industry must result in disaster to the very people who are sought to be benefited, an impasse is created of a serious character. Paralysis of all effort would naturally follow — government be brought t6 a standstill. His attitude is pessimistic; and the following may explain it:
Continuance In the present system im-J plies more and more distinctly, as time goes on. an indefinite maintenance of the existing status. From year to year more and more interests Will cluster about our ! Philippine policy and will oppose any at- j tempt to alter it.	‘ j
Apparently he would permit this appre- , nension to neutralize substantially every scheme to promote progress and develop* ment.	|
THE RIGHT MEN LACKING.
HIS comments on rates of compensation to the commission, civil servants, and teachers deserve attention. He thinks large numbers of American teachers every year return home, necessitating the constant training of a new supply; the rates of compensation do not induce them to renin in. Then, he says that while salaries paid American officials are much higher than they should be and than would be given for corresponding work in the United States, " they have not been high enough to attract the class of men contemplated by the Schurman Commission”; that “we have failed thus far to secure the type of English administrative force which has done the best work In the English colonies." He says the natives regard the salaries of even the commission as ridiculously high, and does not dissent from their view. If the exigencies of administration require the payment of higher salaries in order to secure such men as the Schurman Commission contemplated, then it seems remarkable that he should recite, without disapproval, the implied contention of the natives that the rendering of more intelligent and efficient service constitutes no ground for paying higher salaries to Americans, and their further contention that " if appointments ! are to be made by examination," the natives " should get the salaries of the places for which they have been examined, and not salaries based on the work they do! " This would seem to place an extreme construction on the Civil Service act of September, 1000, which provides that, " where other qualifications are equal, In selecting from the eligible lists, preference shall be given to, first, natives of the Philippine Islands." In the case of certain officials he is specific. He shows that in the offices of tbe- Supreme Court there are found a total of twenty-nine , employes, (including the Judges of the I court themselves,) of whom nine are Americans, receiving $38,200, &c., an aver-I erage for each of less than $4,300. Turning to India again, the Governors and Lieutenant Gr>vernfrs of even the prov-j inces receive as high as 8,333 rupees per i month—far exceeding the pay of members | of the commission. It seems inconsistent to intimate one moment that the salaries | are too high and the next to declare that I they are Inadequate for obtaining the class of civiliahs neeeded.
A DUAL SERVICE.
HE also complains that without any Official recognition of the fact there exist practically two civil services, one for Americans, tho cth«r for natives. He is probably dot aware tbat after much legislation and many changes of the regulations a dual service has been adopted in India* on the report made by the Sir
^land^for'-'the^oUu^ (-^Jisib}£*f6r-''&'e*;]prd^ limited ^number fronithe proviriiiial sbrvice ; -to the civil service of India* and that this system has proved satisfactory. He criticises the teaching: of English to the na-, tives, regardless of their desire to learn It, and probably does nbt^appreciate the statement of Prof. Bernard Moses, formerly of the Taft Commission:
The knowl#tge of English which the
Imbue schools offer to the youth of the slands will contribute materially to the emancipation of the dependent classes and to the development of that personal, independence which Is at present almost entirely wanting in the great mass of the people, but is necessary to 'the maintenance of a liberal Government.
In discussing the control of public opinion through the press the author, at Page 161, imputes bad faith to the commission when he says:
In some cases lucrative employment has peen raven by the commission to native journalists or the owners of native newspapers, seemingly to keep them quiet.
The American public can probably be trusted to judge whether commissions headed by President Schurman, Secretary 1 Taft, and Luke E„ Wright are likely to have been guilty of this sort of petty bribery, and also of Prof. Willis’s trust- i worthiness as a chronicler.
