And Conditions of the American Ad*
ministration. Civil, Military, and '
Religious, , by J. B. Dev. Ins, O. D.*
ECRETARY TAFT says in his ** foreword ” that “ generally the picture which is painted In this book i3 true to nature and to the facts as Dr. Devins saw them.” And certain-r	ly the Secretary its. an excel-
ilcnt, if not an entirely unprejudiced, authority upon the actual conditions of the Philippines and the Filipinos. It may be : added from the point of view of the. 'Ignominious “ book taster** that Dr. Devins has included in his yolurfvo much useful information and much matter inter: esting and entertaining for one reason and another. It Is'even possible that, for the ' purposes of the average-American reader,
~ ■ the book is to be preferred to those of ; Mr. Savage-Landor and Mr. A. R. Colqu-*; hotm dealing with the same subject—since 1 both of these last-named gentlemen ex! hibtt the British bias and neither of them j shares the average American^ peculiar limitations of horizon.
' Of course, as Secretary Taft is at pains to point out in safeguarding his expressions of commendation, ** Dr. Devins is a Protestant clergyman and.- looks at the ■ ■ situation from a possibly somewhat differ-‘ ent standpoint than that of a Protestant layman or from that of a Catholic layman
■	or a Catholic clergyman/* but fee adds that “ there is Uttle to which exception
; could be taken by either a Protestant lay; man or by a good Catholic, whether priest
or layman.” r	s
. 5Tou will not be surprised after this to 'learn that in general and in particular Dr.
:Devins is apt to approve of. the course of ’.the Insular Government, He commends the civil authorities, the army, the constabulary—he even has a kind word to say for the water cure as an administrative substitute for the death penalty. Naturally, Dr. Devins has much to say in praise of the American teachers, and as naturally as to the substantial character of the good they are doing the Islanders; he takes issue with Messrs. Savage-Lan-
■	dor and Colquhoun, already mentioned. To the judicious reader moderately well informed the value of the book, indeed, and the Interest of it is largely increased by a full recognition of the author's point of view. For that reason the extracts •which follow are selected largely with a view of illustrating that point of view. -First, upon the Government transport
Logan. on his way over, after some data about the transport service and its accommodations, Dr. Devins writes:
The writer mingled freely with both classes [officers and men J and closely observed the soldiers. Not an oath was h§ard—there was no sign of drinking and no gambling was allowed. Many of the officers and men played cards, but as one of the ■former said: " All we do is to kill time; so far as any harm Is done we might as well be playing mumblety*peg.”
In Manila tlie good doctor was tropically thirsty:	*
Wishing to secure an American lemonade I went to a Summer garden connected with a hotel. The lemonade was fairly good. Two glasses cost 40 cents. ‘* What would have been the bill if I had ordered beer?" I asked, seing other men with glasses of that beverage before them.
“ Ten cents a glass,’* was the reply. I was willing to pay the difference, of course, but it was easier to understand why soldiers and other Americans with small Incomes and without strict temperance principles should prefer some other beverage than lemonade.
Dr. Devins* in spite of his praiseful attitude toward the army, tells this story of the native Governor of Malalos, a personage by whom he was entertained:
Gov. Tecson was one of Asuinaldo's most skillful Generals, and at the same time displayed a sense of humanity not surpassed by many American officers. He captured at one time an American officer, and immediately wrote to the officer's father, also an officer, saying that the prisoner was In his care and that he ; would be personally responsible for his ; safety and for his exchange as soon as an i opportunity offered. Not long after this tne General allowed the young officer to gro on parole to visit his father, tho American promising to return at a certain time to await the result of the efforts to bring about an exchange. It is not pleasant to add that vjie never returned. Had a Filipino officer broken faith there would have been this comment: “Whoever saw an honest Filipino? ”
As to the question of the use of Filipino or Chinese labor, the author does not, like Mr. Colquhoun, take the coldly economic view that, as the Chinaman is a good workman and the Bnifplno a bad one. the interests of the country call unmistakably for the Chinaman. Yet neither does he quite lend his support to the obviously *' official *’ pronunciamento of the American Insular Government that the Filipino is (or can be made) a good workman.
In certain American schools, it seems, young Filipinos have been found quite willing to perform even menial tasks If or the sake of an education. Here is another interesting passage. Secretary Taft is being quoted;
A teacher went to a town in one of the province* and began her work. The

padre- was greatly: pleased and; helped her gather the children. Soon there were: one hundred and twenty scholars in the school. ‘ Everything, was going bn swim-: mingly. The. teacher - was popular; the padre was happy, the people were pleased” to have their* children an school learning English. One day’two missionaries came !* to that town—perhaps they were not mis; slonarles. but colporteurs or Bible agents;:
■ at any rate 'they were frionds of • tbla:

‘ and. the---teacher was obliged to go to another town. '	.	.
This to. explain why ” Americans, teachers, “and other employes state freely that-they are expected neither to*~entertaln missionaries nor to attend the services which they hold!” To be sure, the exist* ence of an absolute rule is officially denied.	*	—	^	"
The book has a very interesting chapter on opium legislation, one on the reduction of the army, and the gradual substitution of native ior American guardians of the peace; one on hospitals* one on the friars, one on Aguinaldo and other insurgent leaders, and chapters on the work and workers In the islands of the various Protestant communions and the Young Men's Christian AssociaUon. These chapters Ini dicate that, while the Episcopal communion seeks chiefly to supply religious opportunities and influences to the Amer* fcan colony, tlie soldiers and civilian em* l ployes and their families,, the other Protestant denominations arer-for'proselyting the Filipinos. The chapters are especially ! interesting, of course, to persons with ! missionary Inclinations, but others will glean much information from them.
