THE Wrong Box ” and " St. Ives: Being the Adventures ot a French Prisoner In England,” are tbe new volumes In the biographical edition of tho works of Robert Louis Stevenson appearing from Charles Scribner's Sons this week. ** The Wrong Box,*’ Mrs. Stevenson writes In her preface to the story, enabled the author to take the six months' cruise In the South Seas. While they were wintering tn Saranac, Lloyd Osbourne, Mrs. Stevenson's son, who was then 19, wrote a novel which ho called M A Game of Bluff.*' It was read aJoud to the family, and Mr. Stevenson de-| clared that it would be easy to pull it together and " make it go." So the two— " one of them old enough to be ashamed of himself, and the other young enough to learn better," as they have written in i their preface of one paragraph—changed I the title to "The'Wrong Box,” and over-i hauled and rewrote the story "in a few weeks with such high spirits and hilarity that the authors began to take a higher view of its merits than they did on reading it tn cold type under other circumstances.” The book was well received, and Stevenson got his yacht and began to write far the magazines.
"St. Ives" was written in the bouse at Vailima during the troubles there between the Samoan chiefs and those white men whose Interests lay In the sale of certain commodities whleh would be stopped if the tribes weie united.
