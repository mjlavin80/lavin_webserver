r>r. Saleeby on Consciousness.
New York Times Saturday Revicic of Boote:
One of the recent periodicals contained an unusually interesting article entitled •* The Problem of Consciousness/’ by Dr. C. W. Saleeby. I fear I shall do it but scant justice in this extremely cursory notice, but after a very clear and concise exposition of the structure of the brain he remarks. “ There is much to be said for a belief In the continuous action of the mind, even during sleep.” This recalled to me sundry poems I have read that were composed under such conditions, and Robert Louis Stevenson tells us in one of his letters of working out the entire plot and considerable detail connected w^th the characters and situations of one of his novels during sleep. It was while suffering from one of his attacks of blindness, and being unable to write It out, that he called to his wife to j come quickly lest It should be lost. Such I instances of mental activity go to show that the imagination can be operative, i while a little incident that occurred to me recently would argue that memory also exerts her power in sleep. I awoke one morning with the vivid consciousness that I had just repeated those lines from Tennyson's ** Idyls of the King*':
*Tis the little rift within the lute That by and by will make the music mute,
And, slowly widening, silence all.
The fact that I had not seen or thought of the !ines for years made It more remarkable.
To return to Dr. Saleeby's article. After dwelling at some length upon the various phases of consciousness, he finally arrived nt the difference between mind and matter, “ which Is.’* he sa.ys, immeasurably greater than all other differences whatsoever, and our concept of causation is inadequate to conceive how the one can affect the other.*’ He enu-, merates four attempted solutions, and i lastly that of Spinoza and Spencer, which regards mind and matter as correlated [ and inseparable manifestations of the unknowable. My thought went back to that Athenian altar with its inscription “ To the unknown God/' and I could almost hoar Paul saying, “ Whom ye ignorantly worship, Him declare I unto you.” .
