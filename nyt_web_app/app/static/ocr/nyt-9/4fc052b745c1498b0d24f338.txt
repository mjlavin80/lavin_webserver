A- POOR MAJSrS BOOKS.
Methods of a. Modest Collector Who Frequents Second-Hand Shops and Chooses Wisely.

Keu> York Times Saturduy Review of Books:
HERE are more ways than one of loving books. They may inspire affection by their rarity, by their mechanical beauty, ot by their contents. That is, they may be loved as curiosities, as brlc-it-brac, or as friends and entertainers. The first two ways are not for alL The pursuit of first editions and rare copies, no more than defending the America’s Cup or lowering the trotting record, can be the poor man’s hobby. Nor if he be wise will he cast covetous eyes on ornate binding, elaborate illustration, and the other factors of modem editions of luxury. Either

disgrace and suicide. And after this, perhaps. as in the case of one collector—'an embezzler and a self-slayer, though by no meanr; poor—his Groliers and his Meu-niers* brought to the auction block, may be found with leaves uncut, their souls dormant in their costly caskets. More ways thap one are there also oC buying books. My way of purchase involves many trips to bookstores, much pleasant stopping at street stands, constant stirring up of the chaff in which grains of wheat are often hidden, and as regards bargains " patient search and vigil long." When all is said, these last are few and far between. -Book dealers are apt in their business and do not allow their clerks to mix valuable books with cheap
ones. Nor. if they did, am I sure that a troublesome conscience Inherited from pious ancestors would permit me to take advantage of tbeir lack of knowledge. Fortunately I am not difficult to satisfy, and when I have unearthed a finely printed and illustrated Paul and Virginia *' or a prettily got up Gay’s " Fables ’’ at 25 cents, a complete Disraeli’s *’ Curiosities of Literature ” at 40. a complete one-volume Plutarch at 80, a Bohn’s Cary's Daiile in excellent condition at 50, a somew hat shabby Paris-printed volume containing.in their original tongue half of Moltere’s plays one day for a quarter, and the companion volume a few days later in another store and in better condition tor :r» cents, or a Voltaire's " Za-dig and “ MicromtRas,” with Aubrey ' Beardsley's autograph on the fly leaf, for a dime, I have returned home abundantly pleased with my expedition.	*
Often, though not always, have I done as well. Seldom indeed have I had to return disappointed and intellectually un-aneled. A respectable copy of some wanted book at a price entirely reasonable is almost certain to fall into my clutches.
I have even been led occasionally to wonder if there can be latent in humankind, by way of sixth feense. a sort of mental scent by which wanted objects can be run to earth, as dogs trail game. For repeatedly I have pluced a fresh title on my list of books wanted, and then in a day or two have run full tilt upon the volume-seeming to have been led by instinct to the right store and the right shelf. Would that this were always so!
I have become familiar with half the bookstores in New York, both new and second-hand, and know what to look for in each. There is X.’s, where is carried a splendid line of inexpensive reprints of standard authors, imported from England, where the publishers do this kind of thing so much better than in America. X. adds a liberal profit to the English selling price, running sometimes as high as t,^.i0 per cent.—as 1 discovered when I detached a sticker bearing his name from an old play in pamphlet form Tor which he had charged me a quarter, and found it had been affixed to hide the publisher’s “ Price Id."—but the books are good value even and I have several shelves full of them.
There is Y.*s. where long tables heaped with second-hand collections afford good rummaging. One sees here spread before the Philistines the old-fashioned treasures of clergymen, physicians, lawyers, and merchants who have been gathered to their futhers. Heirs are not always bookish, or perhaps they have modern collections of their own. and so the volumes once handled so carefully are cast upon the market to be pawed about by customers and tossed around by shop-boys. Some few are soon culled out and restored to tb^lr lost prestige, but the great bulk—who buys them? The ancient Scripture commentaries and books of sermons, for instance. Is any one living who ever dipped save from sheer curiosity into Dr. Boston's "Fourfold State"? Is any divinity student so poor as to do rcverence to a shr.bby homiletics of two ffnefations back?
There is Z.'s. where publishers’ samples and other odd copies of new books are marked down to prices so low as sometimes to tempt strongly when the title or the author tempts but weakly. This is sometime^ true, too. of the de- ' parlment store bookshop—just after Christmas, for instance; but usually I regard the department store as a place to l keep out of. It is sncred to the latest ; rapid-selling. circus-advertised fiction, and the altars of its gods are sometimes presided over by officious young women, who, if you will not have the fiction, insist on recommending indiscriminately | Milton’s ** Paradise Lost ’’ and Arthur’s “ Ten Nights in a Barroom."	J
There are also the dozens of little dealers, whose shelves are loaded with a motley array of dog-eared and bescribbled I schooibooks. finger-stained and torn pap^r-covered nowls. and dingy bound volumes that were even when new but
sorry examples of the printer’s art. Here , once in a while, if one has time and patience, a brand worth saving may be I plucked from the burning. For to bum-ing surely must these Falstaf fian regiments In the great army Qf books come at last. Day after day, month after month, they stand at attention, appealing In vain I to the passers-by. and becoming ever a little dirtier and more disreputable—in the lowest deeps a lower deep still threatening to devour them,
I But let not the reader think of me as a mere bargain chaser or Monday morning | buyer. Not all my book purchases are j the sequence of book hunting. Often j with a lofty scorn for bargains and price I cutting X walk into first-hand stores of aristocratic aspect, ask for a coveted volume, and, paying full market price, journey homeward proudly with my purchase. But these occasions and payday synchronize.
My collection now numbers some 875 volumes—not Including a score or two of books that are not books. These are not , exactly of the class that Lamb so charI acterized, but are sundry inherited or presented copies of pietistic fiction, inefficient biography, and other species of imitation literature. When my mild ; mania first became chronic I quieted all family alarm by promising to set as a limit to my energies the accumulation of 1,000 volumes. That, I maintain, was as much reading as, any ordinary man could do justice to rn an Ordinary lifetime; it was as many books as any small tenant should house and carry round from domicile to domicile. When the prescribed number should have been reached I could settle down contented, save for a little weeding out and substitution of good copIgs for poor ones. In a year or two the limit will be attained, and I trust that strength to stick to my promise will be mine. Let " Thus far and no further" block my path. And yet, already has it occurred to me—oh, power of casuistry!— that a hundred or two books more, purchased at intervals, would make no material difference and might serve to give a more rounded symmetry to the collection.
The most expensive single volume on my scanty shelves cost just $6—and that a morocco-bound Tennyson with a sentimental reason for being where It is. From this high-water mark my books run down to those that cost but a ^ime, or even a nickel. In other respects than price the collection is catholic. Its component Items vary in bulk from a 000-page one-volume “ Don Quixote ’’ to a green-paperbacked FitzGerald “ Khayyam." In regard to subject matter fiction, poetry, and belles-lettres run one another hard for numerical precedence, history and reference books make a fair show, biography and political economy are not despised; but travel* theology, natural science, and metaphysics are ruled out as subjects outside the province of an obscure bookworm.
I early learned the advantages in a collation like mine of small volumes. They greatly economize space, they accommodate themselves to the coat pocket, and they can be carried back and forth on daily journeys. Nor, nature having blessed me with a pair of her best eyes, do I despise small print If I can get in one volume works that are often spread over two, three, or more, so much is gained; for that counts but one book against the limit, and not several. T have all Macaulay’s Edinburgh Review essays in one volume, the complete Spectator in another, all Boswell's Johnson In a third, every word ot Goldsmith, plays, prose, and poetry, in still another—and a small one at that—and various other triumphs of typographical condensation. But these I do not read on trains, and, being neither an oculist nor an optician, I should do nothing to encourage their general sale.
I have no large sets or “ complete editions." Perhaps the mild scorn I have sometimes felt for acquaintances who speak of their “ libraries ” and mean thereby two or three handsomely bound but little read sets of standard authors, bought by or presented to "them at the time of marriage or furnishing, and a few miscellaneous volumes, the accretions of subsequent years, has in part deterred me from Investing In these showy products of publishers' enterprise. A more potent influence, however, has been the §freater ease and smaller cost of picking up a volume or two at a time. In consequence of this method or purchase some of my standard novelists present a variegated garb such as Solomon was certainly never arrayed in. Dickons, for instance, is represented by sixteen volumes ana eight editions, and George Eliot by seven volumes, no two alike.
Many of my books are shabby. Some nrc in mean editions and would, I fear, fall under the ban of John Ruskln, who holds that " every man who honestly exerts himself may provide stout leather binding for his books.” Poor, badly printed, ill-stitched volumes! Some day perhaps I will replace them by good copies and throw them back into the cold world to meet their fate, or, better, into t..e merciful furnace. But till that day comes they shall have shelf room—aye, and heart room too. For as many a nature’s nobleman has walked on run-down heels and pinned up his coat collar to hide the absence of a shirt, go many a noble book has been forced into unworthy dress. Tatters and shoddy may be despicable, but an honest hobo is better than ! a thieving millionaire, and a Shakespeare printed from broken plates on straw- ! made paper deserves more reverence than j an illuminated and levant-bound book of ] twaddle.
My literary taste, I dare to flatter my- i self, is comprehensive. I like Matthew | Arnold, but am far from despising Macaulay, I enjoy both the naturalness of Wordsworth and the artificiality of Poe, the 1 Puritanism of Whittier, and the license of Whitman. I have room on my^shelves for Hugo’s romance and Balzac’s realism, for the healthy optimism of George Macdon- ! aid and the utter pessimism of Guy de Maupassant, for the serious Robert Browning and the sportive Engene Field, i
for Richardson and for Fielding, for ! Burke and for Paine, I. like to wander in Hawthorne's New England and to look | about in Daudet’s Paris. I like the meas-i ured rhythm of Pope and of Goldsmith,
j the lyrical splendor of Shelley	of
I Keats, the soaring genius of Coleridge i and of Heine, the solemn music of Job,
, the mighty organ «J Shakespeare, the pensive strains of Gray. Incomparable essayists, too-Lamb and Hazlltt, De ! Quincey and Stevenson; historians like I Green and Fiske, like Buckle and Draper; ; economists like Mill and George; Carlyle with his " Revolution," Thoreau with his ! ** Walden "—all these are but a few en- i tries in the list, splendid and varied, drawn up for the day Salnte-Beuve speaks of when, voyages of discovery done, the book lover settles down hy his fireside to learn to know still better friends old and tried.
When I began my collection I gave up magazines for books. Before many years I virtually gave up new books for old. It is not only that books on which copyright has expired are less expensive and can be had in smaller, neater, and more comprehensive shape. Besides this there Is the great advantage of having posterity’s—the book's posterity—verdict as a guide—a verdict much clearer and less conflicting than that of contemporary critics on contemporary boo^s* It Is pos- : sfble to get a perspective on old books.
I The trasn has been submerged; the really i great works stand out like huge rocks.
I Even a decade furnishes a test. But the flood of to-day's publications is over-| whelming to those who attempt seriously to breast It. “ In forty days/' says Es-I dras in the Apocrypha, " they wrote two i hundred and four books." Surely he was prophesying. I long ago resolved to content myself with a volume snatched here and there from the floating mass or thrown at my feet by some swirling eddy.
A few novelists, fewer essayists, fewest poets—these among living writers I sometimes purchase. The rest can go drown I for me.	„
Talent there is In plenty in the mighty Output, but what a task to seek it amid
the commonplace so artfully puffed and numerously edltloned! And then the personal equation is wanting. One thinks of Chatterton starving in his garret and opens his poems with feelings very different from those induced by the boy poets of Manchester or Detroit One journeys , In Imagination to t~e Grub Street Of Dr. Johnson and feels for his writings what no modern platitudinarian could Inspire. One witnesses Sidney’s noble ^eath, Marlowe's shameful one, peeps into the Mermaid Inn, and straightway Elizabethan verse becomes vital with a power that could never Inform the best productions of tlie poets writing in slippered ease for the magazines of to-day. All the efforts of publishers and mutual admiration societies among contemporary writers to supply this personal note fall short Somehow one does not seem to care how many hours a day Arnold TerwiUiger Brown 1 works on lus inexhaustible series of his-I torlcal novels or where Miss Emeline Robinson, aged 22, who has never been east Omaha, got her inspiration for a story l of Holland before the Reformation.
There are drawbacks to the satisfaction I have in my collection. I have perforce to be contented with extracts and selec-tlons from many writers* and It is disap-1 pointing to find a particular essay to , which my attention has been called not included in my Tatler, though the number before and the number after are given, or a particular " imaginary conversation " j missing from my Landor. Books of selec-, tions, too. sometimes seem from the lack of literary judgment they display to have been compiled by the office boy or from the excess of expurgation to have been specially prepared by a new Dr. Bowdler for infantile use. Typographical errors are a constant source of annoyance, though these are by no means the exclusive property of cheap reprints, but disgrace many a pretentious issue, i	JONATHAN	LIBERVERMIS.
