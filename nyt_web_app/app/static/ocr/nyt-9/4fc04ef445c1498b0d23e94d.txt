Pofsnder or PoIe-axe:^. '
New York rimta ^afurc*ay ‘J2et;{ew of ;J?oo^r , ‘ I read'*with much interest the article ^ on the Fourth Folio Shakespeare' in your issue, of Sept. 0, but was somewhati sur-prfsed to see that your London namesake takes such positive ground in regard
to the disputed words “ Poll ax” *# Poleaxe,*.' and ** Polacks/'. as found in Hamlet, i., 1. The generally accepted modern text , reads " PoIacks/' but this word, so ' spelled, does not appear in any of the old editions in this place, though In other passages it does appear in various forms— ^Poleak," Polaker* ** Polack/’ &c.. wher«t it -undoubtedly means • Polander. The word 4‘ Pollax ” never appears In such a connection. The word “ Polack ”
In this passage was' introduced by pope; Malone added the " s,‘” making tt ^jP6-
lacks,” so to conform more nearly in Sound to ** Pollax/' Pew readers of the folios will be convinced that the use of capital letters has much to do in determining the sense of any passage In these early editions,
Tlie fundamental Question of course is: Did the elder Hamlet, ** in an angry parie/’ smite Polanders seated in sleds or sledges, or, as Dr. Schmidt explains it In his Lexicon, did he, “ provoked to anger in a conference with tbe King of
Norway, strike the ico with his pole-axe | as with a heavy hammer a very nat-i ural thing for an angry man to do?
; Upon this Question the commentators ; are divided, the weight of authority being deddedlly for " Polaeks,” while to nie It
; seems that the weight of sound argument Is on the side ot “ pole-axe.”
In tho " Shakespeare Cyclopaedia ” I endeavored to present a full discussion of-the question, the chief reasons In favor of “pole-axe” being as follows:
1.	The spelling, ** Pollax,*' is used In the literature of that time to signify a pole-axe. Thus in tlie address to the reader in 41 Euphue’s Golden Legacle " we find: “ I’ll down Into the hold and fetch out a rustic pollax.” And the word which, in the generally accepted text, is spellod " poll-axe ” In ** Love’s Labor's Lost/' Act V., Scene 2, Une 580, Is 44 Pollax ” in I the First Folio. On the other hand, where | the word undoubtedly means Polander. It is spelled ** Poleak/’ '* Folake,” " Pol-acke,” “ Poliak," and ” Pollock.” but never M Pollax."
2.	There Is no intimation of a war between Poland and Denmark. It was " the ambitious Norway ” that Hamlet combat-ted.
3.	Horatio speaks of a 11 parle/’ not a

These and other considerations le^d me ii ; to believe that a ‘pole-axe ,a'nd not Po-landers Is meant in this passage, and con- ■
, sequently^ that the correct spelling is. that . adopted By the unknown editor of the J Fourth Folia; notwithstandingthe ridicule I cast upon it by the writer In The London | Times.	JOHN	PHIN.	:
