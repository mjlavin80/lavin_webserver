Valence and Auxonne, at Corsica, at Aux-onne and Valence (notice the inversion), at Ajaccio, at Paris, at La Maddalena, on Paoll. on the Supper at Beaucaire—is not this treading on Mr. Tarkington’s preserves?—and on Napoleon at Toulon. Mr. Browning's story is old, his English Is sometimes open to suspicion, his French and Italian can be more than suspected. We have Napoleon baptized “ at the paternal house ” on July 21, 1771; and on the opposite page a picture of the church where he was baptized; we have Counseil Superieur, without an accent, and Council -General: on one page we have the Corsicans speaking Italian, and two pages later French; we find the usual English hatred of exact dates—economy of dates might be a better phrase. On page 211 we find the year date 1793; it has to serve
until page 263, though the fifty-two pages between contain the story of Napoleon'3 visit to Corsica and his rivalry with Paoll
and the siege of Toulon. In the account of this siege we have Gen. Doppet arriving to take command of the French Army on Nov. 1 ‘2, (page 249.) but detached on Nov. 3, (page 253.) Everything is confused.	^
Why Mr. Browning, with his reputation as a writer, should have permitted himself to turn out such a book we cannot I imagine. He has given little value to & I thing that might have had much.
NAPOLEON, THE WO-?bT PHASE.

B3TTER things are expected from Mr. Oscar Browning than his latest book,
“ Napoleon, the First Phase." There is in It practically nothing new, nothing that has not been told earlier and told better; even Prof. SIoane*s four-volume life of Napoleon has about all that Mr. Browning has given us. While admitting that this book is practically merely a translation of the “ Napoleon Inconnu " of MM. Masson and Biagi, the author deliberately offers it for comparison with Lord Rosfe-bery’s “ Napoleon, the Last Phase," which was a work of erudition, of value, not merely a story such as any clever newspaper man can turn out for a magazine or i a Sunday supplement twice a week- without thinking it needful to publish it In book form.
Mr. Browning tells us the old stories of Napoleon's childhood. Does nobody but the future General beat a drum and wave a sword and draw soldiers on the wall? Napoleon did those three entertaining things, and the fact -is recorded by all his biographers to prove that the child is indeed father to the than; But suppose the . child i3 a girl, what deduction would the . paidologist make? • • • • / v> -'
