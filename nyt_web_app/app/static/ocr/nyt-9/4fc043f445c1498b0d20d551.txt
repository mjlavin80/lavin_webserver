u—w»T is foreign to the tastes and 1^1 BSS not within the competence agaSl ISffi of The New York Times KkSI PttH Book Review to discuss in §ig5uS3j| detail the rights and the wrongs of the great corporation about which Miss Ida Tarbell has written a couple of volumes and an Indefinite number of ephemeral articles. The subject certainly Involves elements of great interest from the commercial, the ethical, the sociological, and the comical points of view. It has racked the minds of business men and Economists and the hearts of ministers of the Gospel. The profits of the gigantic corporation have gladdened or saddened the souls of educators and missionaries arid supplied the material for endless discussion in the religious press and on the “ curb.” And Uhe story or stories of the vast and powerful combination have figured in the assets of more than one magazine, so that the money set in circulation—whether “ tainted ” or not—has flowed through all sorts of channels and irrigated the most various fields.
In this often exciting and sometimes amusing movement of opinion and sentiment, one writer has found occasion for a suggestion that links the matter with literature and justifies comment in The New York Times Saturday Review of Books. In The North American for September-Mr. Gilbert Holland Montague has an article on “ The Legend of the Standard Oil Company." The title is an inviting one. It is sustained by the treatment of the subject, which, however, is more sober than the title would suggest. According to Mr. Montague, Miss Tarbell has not '* been content merely to suffuse history with emotion as Augustin Thierry brightened the events of the Merovingian dynasty." Had she done that, he thinks '* her work might fairly be called history." 3ut ** to dramatized history she has added all the fiction that the popular imagination has conceived regarding the Standard Oil Company,'* and thus she has become a mere gatherer of modern folk-lore." The real value, therefore, of Miss Tarbell*s “ statement of the legend of the Standard Oil Company " lies in the degree to which ’ she shows the psychological condition of that portion of the public which assigns mythical attributes" to that curious, obscure, and impressive corporation.
Now this strikes us as a happy way of putting the matter. Mr. Montague, with great industry and a brave showing in the matter of citations from records and reports, undertakes to show that Miss Tarbell has not satisfied the . conditions of accurate history writing, and that she has, on the other hand, used the material the mythmaker delights in, presented it as the popular desire for myths requires, and produced a result that will be accepted, passed on, magnified, and colored by the mental processes by which myths grow. It makes no essential difference, for the purposes of this artic le, whether Mr. Montague is or is not successful in his demonstration. We simply wish to note that he has struck a most interesting analogy, and has worked it out with extreme ingenuity. No one can have followed the current discussion of the
Standard Oil matters, in the press, and, even more, in the talk of the day, without being struck by the attitude toward the corporation of a considerable number of mlnd3. To theVe the company presents itself as the forces of nature —winds, storms, lightning, the light and heat of the sun—presented themselves to the Imagination of our remote ancestors, as something at once powerful and mysterious, which cannot be measured or explained by ordinary methods. The arrows of the angry god bearing pestilence among the heroes of Homer’s tale are not much more imaginary instrumentalities than are those commonly supposed to fee employed by Mr. Rockefeller and his associates.
All the same it is well to remember that there probably w-as a good deal of mortality among the Greeks in front of Troy.
