William Morris, one or the most eminent Imaginative writers of the Victorian age, differs from most other poets and men of letters tn two ways—first, he did great work In many other things as well , .as literature; secondly, he had beliefs of his own about the meaning and conduct of Jife„ about all that men ihinlr and do and make* very different from those of ordinary people, and ho carried out these views In his writings as well as In all the other work he did throughout his life.
! "The Earthly Paradise’’ Is* the writer goes on to say, the ftiost striking Instance of what Morris meant by the art of poetry—that is, ** the skillfully designed construction, and the furnishing with beautiful and appropriate ornament, of a house of tales, in which the reader m:\y find shelter, enjoyment, and rest/’ He selected those ancient Greek talcs and- the , stories of Swabia, Norway, Brittany. and | other parts of Europe which he liked best and redesigned them. His idea of a series of stories was obtained from Ghaucer. The poem la made up of twenty-four tales, two told -cach smooth of the year by a stranger and -a native Greek. * Vol. I.,i bc-sides the’introduction, has a photogravure portrait of the author.
