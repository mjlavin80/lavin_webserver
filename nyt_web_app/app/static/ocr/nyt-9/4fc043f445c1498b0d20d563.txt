fg3S32E32$P what, Ihen, does Renan owe his wide popularity? He was no erudite theologian nor a particularly distinguished Orientalist. All his writings have loag ago been superseded. His influence no doubt is due to the charm of his literary style and to his hostility to an unpopular Church. That a Seminarist should have written the “Vie de Jesus ** lashed into fury all the forcea of the Gallican Church and filled with exultation the growing infidelity of Paris. His ** Vie de J6sus," " Les ApGtres,” and “S.

charmed with the style in which Renan
skillfully relates his theories. It is said
that he made the Gospels a French classic, for until his “Vie de Jesus’* had appeared many of the French clergy had no idea of the interest which attached to the Gospel narrative. Yet surely he was a " prgtre manque,”—cSaturday Review.

Most of the new books read by the people of Alabama were published in Atlanta, Richmond, or Charleston* though during the last two years of the war- Mobile publishers sent out miny thousand volumes. W. G. (.'lark & Co. of Mobile confined their attention principally to text books,
works on military science and tactics, fiction. translations, music. <£rc. The best
selling Southern novel published during the war was ■* Macaria,” by Augusta J. Evans of Mobile. It was printed by Goetzol, who also published Mrs* Ford’s *• Exploits of Morgan and Ilis Men," which was pirated or reprinted by Rich-
ur.lson or Nvw York:. Walker. Evans &
Cogswell of Charleston published M1s3
Evans’s " JJeulah.” Both ** Macaria " and
** Beulah " were reprinted in the North.
Goetzel bound his books in rotten pasteboard and in wall paper. In 1804 he published <on wrapping paper) a four-volume translation by Adelaide do V. Chaudron of Miihibach’s Joseph 11. and His Court.” 5-1c published other translations of Mi^S MfilllbUCh'S historical novels—her

Hardee's ** Hille and Inf;mtry Tactics," in two volumox. and Wheeler’s ** Cavalry Tactics " were printed in large editions by Go* i7S‘l for the tite of Alabama troops. Clark published “The Confederate States Ahasin ic and Repository of t’seful Knowledge." a kh;d of annual eneyclo-pafdia. Lieut. Col.

This was not altogether a lack of critical judgment on Prof. Davidson's part; but, owing to the general stringency the times, he fell justified in *' watering “ our literary stock. It was a foolish ide.i. and resulted in some fool-i.-h ideals for writers in this region. But besides admiring one another's virtues here, we ha\ e always been more or less inclined to pet each other's shortcomings, not only because the North ha.s seemed ovi-ranxious to criticise us for both, but it the polite fashion of loyalty among us. Every one resents the truth when it is not flattering, but In the South we make a battleground business of resenting it, which has made literary criticism too much a matter of circumspection.—Mrs. L. H. Harris In The Critic.

The results of this clannishness are sometimes pathetically amusing. What could be more so, for example, than collections of the poets and poetry of this or that State or county, than anthologies
of the gems of thought inspired by this or that religious persuasion. Let a Catholic, or a Methodist, or a Unitarian produce a book, and straightway all the voices and organs of his kind will sing its praises. Let some frontier town discover an author in Its midst, and Its spokesmen will promptly view themselves as denizens of the coming literary centre iif the country. Tested by the even ’ scale of criticism, these phenomena may be utter-, ly insignificant, hut the loaded scales of sectarian or provincial prejudice will show them to weigh heavily enough.

have a dash of East
Anglia In their compositlon—but they must not have too much of it. The Mar-tineaus, intimately associated with Norwich. were, of course, a Huguenot family, and Sir Thomas Browne was bom In London of a Cheshire family, and so I misht go on through all the worthies of Which certain of my East Anglian friends
have been boasting rather recklessly of late. But the air of isast Anglia does j seem to help the writing faculty.
:	George	Borrow, of course, had but a
r very moderate measure of East Anglia in his veins. His father hailed from Cornwall, (he was the son ot a Cornish yeoman,) his mother, a Perferment, was of a French family. It was the mere accident that his father wandered from place to place fulfilling his duties as a militiaman that led to Borrow being born in Norfolk rather than in Ireland or in any one of the other parts of the empire where Capt. Borrow periodically round himself
and his family. It was, Indeed, at the house of his grandfather, a small farmer, that George Borrow was born, and this place must always have a peculiar interest. It is, indeed, much easier to find
now than when Dr. Knapp, Sorrow's biographer, went In search of It some years ago.
Probably it was Dr. Knapp's Investigations that led to the fact of any peasant in the district now being able without any trouble to point you out Sorrow’s house. A respectable-looking farmhouse, it stands in a quiet corner with only two cottagcs in sight; it is opposite a pond, from which it is separated by a garden and the roadway. One passes to it through a multitude of green hedges On
either side, and at the first blush one might think that Borrow was born Into a | worid of green hedgerows.
Fossfbly, such is the power of environ-j ment, he might never have written so j great a book as " Lavengro ” had this \ been the case. Borrow was born on July 5, 1803, and then and for many years aft-I erward the land surrounding that house , was one mass of wild common, covered in Summer with that beautiiul golden gorse that you see so frequently on Nor-i folk commons. Within sight of the house \ must there many a time have been a gypsy encampment, which kindled in his j boyish mind his first interest in a people ; to whose lives he has given so wonderful j a note of romance. To visit George Borrow s birthplace is to assist one materi-i ally in understanding George Borrow.—

In the Summer of 1003 The Doones a notlce appeared in The
Daily Chronicle of a booklet by Mr. E. J. Rawle, entitled ** The Doones of Exmoor/* from which I gathered that Mr. Rawle
believed that the whole, or almost the whole, of the Doone stories had sprung from the brain of Mr. Blackmore in Ins immortal romance of ** Lorna Doone,” Such a conclusion simply amazed me. I had lived at Luccombe, within the confines of the oid forest of Exmoor, when a small boy, from 1841) to 1S31, and Luc-combe Rectory was my home from J35G to latE), and many a tale of the Dooncs of Badgworthy were familiar to me’ from my earliest recollection. I could not resist making an Immediate brief reply, though away from home and all references, and

a rejoinder"'appeared in The Chronicle of July 0 sfgned ° Sexagenarian/* In . this letter tlie names of soma of those who'-Used to delight me .with Doone tales and legends* were cited, and also the fact that X used to retail these blood-curdling stories or the Exmoor outlaws in a school dormitory, with the result that a clever jroommate of mine wove some of these together into a story called '' The. Doones of .Exmoor,” which, appeared In -eight Weekly installments in The Leisure Hour for 1863. " Lorna Doone ” did not appear Until 1869. I further stated that I had a
letter from Mr. R. D. Blackmore acknowledging that it was the accidental glancing at the comparatively poor stuff in. The Leisure Hour that gave him the clue (or the weaving of the romance, and caused, him. to study the details on the spot. X did not then remember that a still earlier printed reference relative to Doone legends occurs in Fraser’s Magazine for 1857, nor had I then been told of me recital of. many of the DCQne legends in I Mr. Cooper's “Guide to Lynlon/* pub! lished in 1853. * * * i I have therefore made it my business during the last few weeks, during which i I have visited each parish in Carhampton j Hundred,'to inquire as to the Doones in i every direction, and of a great number of I the older Exmoor folk. In every single i ease I have met with a more or less in: dlgnant surprise that any one who knew the district could possibly doubt as to the reality of a band of Doone robbers infesting the Oare district, and as to the stories of them being commonly prevalent years before Mr. Blackmore wrote his novel.
The general consensus of opinion points to their coming to Somersetshire In the troublous times of the Commonwealth, or In the years immediately preceding, a few of the better-read Informants naming the days of Oliver Cromwell or King Charles. Several had always heard that they came as outlaws from Scotland. All gave them a name for malignant cruelty. Two believed that they knew the name Lorna long, before the date of the tale, (probably a mistake,) and the majority were quite certain they had heard of John Red, (Ridd,) as the great opponent of the Doones; and that he was one of the Reds of Broomstreet., or some other farm in Culbone parish, was maintained by most.—J.* Charles Cox in The London Athenaeum.

Cheap Reprint.? er paBe ,n The

an old question when he asks, “ Are the cheap reprints read by those who buy them? ** He thinks it is a question that no one can answer. We are afraid that no one can answer it with a stout affirmative. One reason—indirect certainly—for doubting whether these reprints are so much read as they are bought Is that the second-hand book trade is not in an advancing state. These reprints ought to appetize young people for solid literature in solid form. But second-hand booksellers do not appear to thrive on the public that buys the cheap reprint.

undergone a transfor-
mation in the past twenty years. The masses have come in and old ideals and fashions have had to give way to their imperious demands. Nor Is the end yet in sight. The one certain thing is that the purely propagandist dally has gone. For the rest, wo are still passing through a transitional stage, of which the only encouraging sign is the evidence of growing distaste for the j “ snippety " weeklies.	i
One incident of the revolution in British journalism has been the disappearance of individual forces. British journalism, like that of France, was once rich in individuality—that Is, certain men on both sides of politics stood out like great landmarks. British newspapers now rely less and less on individuals. They have neither the space nor the inclination <o allow men to achieve individual distinction. A dozen names might be mentioned at the present time of men who, in their day, had a commanding place in the British press, but who have now no lit arena for their abilities. Mr. E. T. Cook, an accomplished scholar and a profound politician; Mr. T. P. O'Connor, one of the most vivid writers of the day; Mr. H. W. Massingham, who formerly edited The
pally Chronicle, and I$r.- W, T. Stead, at whose nod1 Ministries used*to-tremble, in tho old Pall Mall Gazette days—oil'these men were great forces/ who at one time enriched’ and enlivened British journalism. To-day strength; as typified in these famous journalists, is “ momfuUy denied its arena,” Not one of them Is in control of a dally newspaper. The new newspapers have no room for one commanding, individuality.—Harry Jones in The Review of Reviews, •	.	-

Count Tolstoy has Count Tolstoy’s the courage to act up
Renunciation t0 hjs convictions. For
Periodicals. two J"0"1119 „he has
ceased to read magazine or newspaper, devoting the time so gained to the study of his favorite authors: Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, Plato, Confucius. Cicero, Montesquieu, Rous-Beau, Voltaire, Lessing, Kant, Schopenhauer, Emerson, Chjtnnipg, and Buskin. The great writer’s reason for this policy Is the belief that the modern world is deplorably ignorant of the treasures of literature; while he considers the perpetual perusal of newspapers as a calamity
worse than war itself. Readers ot Mr. Hamerton’s " Intellectual Life ” will remember how he- hints that some such regime is desirable in the case of the serious student, though he seems to regard the abstention as impracticable. And did
not Mr. Rose in “ The New Republic" adopt the course, and boast of It, wishing to dwell in the aroma of aostheticism and
keep vulgar modernity aloof ?
Very different was the attitude of Cob-den, who declared that there was more useful information in a copy of The Times than in all the “ works ” of the son of Olorus—who, as closer students of antiquity know, wrote one work only; and the free trader's view surely has quite as much to be said for It as that of the Mystic Apostle of Peace.—The Academy.
John Hay’s Literary Beginnings.
Four or five years later, when	American
literature on the continental terms was ceasing to be New England literature, there came to me. as assistant editor of The Atlantic Monthly, a paper from Madrid, written with	a	certain	very instructed	command
of	the	facts,	as well as with	a literary
charm which had the freshnesc of surprise. It was the first of the chapters which went afterward to form the brilliant volume, '* Castilian Days." and was the vivid study of ** A Field Night In the Spanish Cortes”; but. authoritative and vivid as it was, it showed an inequality which is most marked in Its difference from the second paper. In his study of the Cortes he is carried a little, or call it a good deal, beyond himself, by the dramatic picturesqucness of the material, which he feels so intensely; and there are reversions to younger modes and terms of expression; but, in the more analytical and descriptive sketches which rapidly followed, there are far fewer, and ofteuest none, or tnese survivals of
youthful Ideal. For a writer still so young, he keeps himself astonishingly In hand; if he escapes the rein now and then, it Is In the humor, which is largely an Ironical wit, or an excessive sarcasm, with also a touch of something academic in tho attitude. The prevalent note is that of a morality severe almost to austerity; It is all very democratic, very American, very Protestant; but the severity is not discordant with a lyrical pleasure in the beauty of the theme. Spain lives under his hand, and the .book itself lives through its fidelity.to the facts, and will always hold its high place among the three or four books by American hands in which the life of an alien people is rendered with unsurpassed intelligence.— W. D. Howells In The North American Review.
