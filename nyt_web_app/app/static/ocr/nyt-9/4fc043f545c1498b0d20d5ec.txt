THE name of Andrew Marvel ever sounds sweet, and always had, to use words Of Charles Lamb, a fine relish to the ear. As the author of poetry of exquisite quality, where for the lust time may be heard the priceless note of the Elizabethan lyricist, while at the same mr-ment utterance is being given to thoughts and feelings which reach far forward to Wordsworth and Shetley, Marvel can never be forgotten in his nalfve England. Lines of Marvel's poetry have secured the final honors, and incurred the perlJ of becoming ** familiar Quotations," ready foi use on a great variety of occasion. We may, perhaps, have been bidden once or twice too often to remember how the royal actor
Nothing common did, or mean.
Upon that memorable scene.
or have been assured to our surprise by some self-satisfied worldling bow be always bears at his back
“ Time's winged chariot hurrying near.”
A true poet can, however, never be defiled by tlie rough usage of the populace.
It Is thus that Augustine Cirrell opens his biography of " Andrew Marvel," which the Macmillan Company is about to ISSUC in the English Men of Letters Series, edited by John Morley. Andrew Marvel was a poet, scholar, traveler, diplomat, wit, and active Member of Parliament from the Restoration to his death, in 1C78. Among better-known poetical pieces are " Byes and Tours/* ** The Bermudas,” " To His Coy Mistress," ** Young Love," “The Garden/* "Horatlan Ode LTpftn Cromwell's Return from Ireland,” and others. He also wrote in rhyme political sal Ires. As a prose writer the present biographer finds Marvel to have ** many merits and one grwl fault. • • * He is too long.**
