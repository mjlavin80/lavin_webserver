Whalley’s Grave.

A«c York rimes Saturday Kcrinc of Itookx:
If the writers of the various communications on Whalley's grave which have recently appeared in The New YCRtc TlUBS BOOK Revikw care to learn the «x-act truth concerning: the career and final burial of " the three regicides “ they will do well to consult a most intelligent and discriminating paper on Edward WhaiUy an J Wiiiiam Goife, read before the New Haven Colony Historical Society by Mr. Franklin B. Dexter Nov. 14, l«TO. This is a thorough, impartial, and most interesting essay, which apparently settles the regicide episode so far as it can be settled by human study and careful research.
