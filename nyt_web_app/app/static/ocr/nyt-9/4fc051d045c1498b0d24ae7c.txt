"Poor Byron! The idol of my youth* the neglected of to-day, and the (by high authorities) condemned, how often have I mourned his fate! ” Thus wrote a courteous reader of The Times-Review last Week.
Byron In his day was accused by hia English critics, besides many other things, of two unpardonable crimes—of attempting to promote skepticism, in the Worst acceptation of the term, and of at* tempting to make innovations In the then
only acknowledged legitimate rules of
poetry. To these accusations, it appears to me, is to be attributed not only the cause for the enmity, as blind and relentless as it was unjust and shameful, which, Under the name of that public opinion which tne poet so persistently defied, made him the object of contempt in the «yes of too many of his countrymen, but also the cause for his g-ivin^ to the world those effusions prompted by the resentment of a passionate, outraged sensibility, and which in his maturer years he himself condemned. I do not believe I can bo accused, with justice, of blind infatuation for the poet, or of giving utterance to an untenable assertion, if I say that were Byron’s poems submitted to a fair minded lover of poetry for perusal who was entirely unacquainted with them or their author ho could but admire them, and that even though he might with good reason have grounds for deprecating the be-Etowing of so much poetical genius on certain subjects, not considered In good taste in our day, he could not permit the latter lo prejudice his mind to the extent of denying to Byron that poetical eminence which is his and his alone. Even
Vhougrh it may seem a. g-ltirinfj presumption
on my part, I will say that I believe that by far the greater number of Byron’s nonprofessional critics who have during the past eighty years or so scoffed at him as a poet and as a man have not read his works; or if they have read them, they have done so without first preparing themselves for the task by learning from reliable sources the man’s real character and the circumstances that bore heavily upon his career as a poet.. It seems to me almost Impossible for any one to be able to appreciate a poet's works at their just value without this preparation; for it is the only way, to my way of thinking, to ascertain whether he was prompted in his labors by sordidness or by unselfishness; that is to say, by mechanical or purely poetic instincts. I feel Quite on secure ground when 1 maintain that in all that Byron has left us by which to judge him on this point there is nothing to show that he was guilty of selfishness. As to the charge of skepticism brought against him, it can be easily and completely contradicted by a perusal of his serious poems, which abound in proofs of his great veneration of the Creator and His works, and as to the charge of being an innovator, that was true and to his great credit, if the unstinted commendations of his efforts coming from the pens of the very best authorities of Germany, France, and
