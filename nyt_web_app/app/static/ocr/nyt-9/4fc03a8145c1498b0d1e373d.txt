ONE of the new chapters in the new edition or Mrs. Roger A. Pryor's " Reminiscences ol Peace and War," issued by the Macmillan Company, describes the first observance of Memorial Day. Soon after the civil war, she writes, memorial associations were or; ganlzed in several places. The observance I of " Decoration Day" was the inspiration of Mrs. Judge Joynes of Petersburg,
I Va. She called the women of the town
1 together May 9, 1866, and organized them | into a memorial association for the express i purpose of decorating the graves of the men who had fallen in the late confUct j between the North and the South.
It was decided at this meeting to make I June 9 the day for “ perpetual remembrance." When the day came, the townspeople met at Blandford Church carrying I flowers and small white flags on which were printed the words, “ Somebody’s darling." After the singing of an an-
1	them, the school children laid the flowers on the grave of CoL Scott and that which Is filled with the bones of men who had perished At Port Stedman, besides the unmarked hillocks; on each grave, too, was placed a white flag. Orations were delivered and prayers said at the Blandford. Church- This old church, Mrs. Pryor writes, was at this time roofless and is still an object of interest to all who visit the historic sites around Petersburg. When the solemn chant of the first Memorial 0T Decoration Day service echoed through its mo I de ring walls, they, with a remnant of the roof, were imbedded in the emerald Ivy brough from Kenilworth and were literally vocal with hundreds of tuneful birds.
