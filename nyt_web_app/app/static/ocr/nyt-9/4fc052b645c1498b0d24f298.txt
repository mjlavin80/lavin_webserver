In opening his lecture on Herbert Spencer, delivered at the University of Oxford March 9, 1905, Frederic Harrison, the well-known English philosopher and author, says:
*	* • By the choice of the founder of this lectureship and of the Academic au-thorlties, one is called to open this course whose only claim to philosophy is that i for thirty years he has sought to explain ; and to propagate the system of a French philosopher to whom Spencer declared himself opposed on many points. He certainly coincided with him on many others. These points were quite as essential, and some differences also may he reconciled in the end. Philosophy, to be worthy of its name, must ever embrace and reconcile fundamental differences of view.
