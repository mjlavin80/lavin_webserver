:	School days in general and football play-	I
I	ing in particular are things about which,	I
somehow, both boys and grownups like to read—have lilted to read since the golden #days of " Tom Brown ” and before. This is the story of a Boston boy who went to Seaton (that is, Phillips Exeter) and met all sorts of other boys; polished, but i wicked boys from the fashionable set In | New York; sturdy democrats who washed i dishes for a living, studied hard, and played football harder if possible; prankish young gentlemen, honest but altogether given to practical jokes; shrewd I fellows from the West, and so on. The hero gets caught at first by the shining	j
outside of his fashionable schoolmates—	I
' later he finds out that they are whited	I
■	sepulchres. He goes--in for all sorts of	I
> school life—the glee club, athletics, and j the rest, and gets in due time to be a I wonderful football player, only to have his father forbid-at the most critical mo-( ment his participation in tlie game of	|
games. However, you'll find a description	a
I of a very hot contest on the gridiron be-	I
tween Seaton and the chief iieademic oval,	I
and in this game the hero takes part	I
' nobly- Kxcept in so far as it lends en-	I
, couragement to football, which some wise persons of late have begun to regard with ; singula- disfavor, the book is bent to en-1 courage all sorts of good things—honesty, democracy, morality, courage, a harmless gayety. Girls are not even mentioned	I
and no tricks are played on professors. £
