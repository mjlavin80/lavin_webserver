New York Times Saturday Review of Books:
It may be interesting to J. H. Savage,
: who wrote about the grave of Whalley, believed by some to be in New Haven, Conn., to know that there is good authority to believe that the regicide lies buried neither at New Haven nor Hadley, but that his later years were spent on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and- there he died and was buried. A pamphlet written by Robert Patterson Robins may be found in The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, Volume H., in which he claims to have a document written by Thomas Robins, third, of Worcester County, Eastern Shore of Maryland, in the year 1760. The document reads in part as follows:
‘' As most men wish to know something of their ancestors, and as I have from, authentic documents and direct tradition collected a number of facts relative to my ancestor, Edward Whalley, otherwise Edward Middleton, ye regicidei,
I desire to set down here ye facts concerning his life and death in Maryland.
'* Edward Whalley was the son of Thomas Whalley of Kirkton, Nottinghamshire, England, gnd Frances Cromwell, third daughter of Sir Henry' Cromwell, (grandfather of Oliver Cromwell,) .and. was born about 1615. He married Elizabeth Middleton and soon after he joined in ye rebellion under Oliver Cromwell, and was one of ye Judges yt condemned King Charles ye first, and at ye restoration of j Chas. ye second (1660) he fled to Amer- ; ica, she went to Conn., and there libed In : concealment until ye reward offered by ye Crown of -England made his residence amongst ye Yankees unsafe, and he then came to Virginia in 1681, where two of his wife’s brothers met him with his family; he then travelled up to ye province of Maryland and settled first at ye mouth of ye Fokemoke river, but finding yt too public a place, he came to Sine-puxent, and made a settlement, to ye which place he brought his family in yO name of Edward Middleton; his owne name he made not publick until after ye revolution in England, (in ye year 1688.) when he let his name be seen in publick papers and had ye lands patented in.his owne name. •	• * Col. Whalley lived
to a very advanced age. and was blind for many years before his death. *	*	*
A son, Elias Whalley. married Sarah Peel, daughter of Col. Thomas Peel, and died leaving one daughter, Leah Whalley, and she married Thomas Robins, 2d of ye name, and died leaving one son, Thomas Robins, 3rd of ye name, ye deponent. *	*	*
'■ Thomas Robins, 3rd of ye name, July 8th, in the year of our Lord 1769.’'
The headstone marked " E. W." is said to belong to one Edward Wlgglesworth, a citizen of-New Haven.
