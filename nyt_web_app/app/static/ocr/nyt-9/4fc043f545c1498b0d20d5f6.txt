Autumn and Holiday Books — Some That Are Already Published— Others Soon to Appear.

ANY a hero has been warned of the danger of saving a man’s life since the day when Sir Walter made the old superstition the central thought of “ The Pirate,** but In Mr. Arthur Stanwood Pier's " The Ancient Grudge,” the evil effects show themselves more subtly than in the simple rivalry In love or even in worldly affairs. The rescucd man is too small of nature to bear the burden of gratitude, and by frequent rebellion against it so embitters his mind that he can accept any slander against his friend as possible, and thus he injures himself suroly and steadily. The interest of the story does not depend entirely on his moral deterioration, for the author has some very well-defined theories' as to the rights of a righteous capitalist. Tlie book
will be published Saturday of next week by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co.
The Series of Red Letter Poets issued in the United States by Messrs. H. M. Caldwell & Co. will be continued this week by the appearance of Mr. Arthur Symonds’s “ Sixteenth Century Anthology,” containing a group of anonymous songs by no means universally known even to genuine lovers of Elizabethan verse. In the preface Mr. Symonds finds the inspiration of the nineteenth century verse in the sixteenth, ascribing Blake's to the song writers, Wordsworth’s to Daniel, the well-languaged, saying that Keats rifled the best sweets of Lodge's orchard, and that Shelley found In Dray- i ton’s elegies the model of his incomparable style of familiar speech in verse. This scries will in future appear not only in its proper red vesture, but also In the " Bibelot" edition, bound in full embossed leather.

The " Value ” series of gift books is carried on by " The Value of Simplicity,” printed on paper decorated Japanese fashion with a faintly outlined and shaded design on each page. The text ts printed In black, In the ornamentation of which there are twelve varieties in dusky red. The binding is of white vellum cloth or white watered silk with a name label in gold. The quotations illustrating the subject are equally divided between prose and poetry.
Mr. Charles Livingston Bull, who has so admirably illustrated Prof. Roberts’s animal stories, including " The Red Fox,” soon to be published by Messrs. L. C. Page & Co., has also made a picture for Mr. Edwin Carlile Litsey's “ The Race of the Swift," which Messrs, Little, Brown & Co. announce for the Autumn. This volume includes stories of a timber wolf, a wild cat, a raccoon, a hawk, a vixen, and a sheep dog reverted to wildness, a creature more fearful than any untamed beast. This story, by the way, was written before the appearance of “ The Call of the Wild.”

Messrs, John W. Luce & Co. are preparing an Interesting volume entitled '* Intimate Letters of the Presidents,” representing each occupant of the Presidential chair from Washington down to the man to be elected in 1908. The compiler is Mr. Lewis Perry, Assistant Professor of English at Williams College, and his choice among the enormous mass of correspondence at command has been dictated by the wish to exhibit the personal rather than the political character of the successive executives.
A London branch of the house of John W. Luce & Co. will soon be in operation, its establishment having been one of the chicf reasons for Mr. Harrison Hale Schaff’s recent voyage to England. After making his arrangements in London he
visited Paris and secured a group of French juvenile books for publication by the firm.

An ingenious bit of fiction, M All By Wire,” by Mr. Frank P. Sibley, will be published by-Messrs. Luce & Co. as a holiday gift book, fac similes of the official forms composing it taking the place of ordinary chapter heads and explanatory passages.

Mr. Charles Gibson’s “Among French j Inns/* Intended by MeiSsrs, L. C. Page & j Co. as a companion for Miss Josephine Tozler’s '* Among English Inns,** Is nearly ready. It describes Inns and chateaus not mentioned in its author’s ** Two Gentlemen in Touraine/’ and also Inna inErit-tany, Normandy, and Provence, andwill be illustrated as amply as the English volume. Francis Miltoun’s “ Rambles in Brittany/* now very nearly ready, includes a brief historical sketch, descriptions of the chief cities and fishing- ports, of tho menhirs and other relics of the past, and of the “ pardons/’ those curfous guryivals of a; day whfen religious^ feeling " " " '<ft*-: M
The Boy Craftsman,” by Mr. A. Neely Hall, to be published next week by Messrs. Lee & Shepard, carries economy even further in Its teaching than was promised by the author, for it not only shows a boy
how to make the best of cheap material, but also directs him how, after he has learned the use of tools, to make certain pieces of money-earning apparatus, such as a miniature snow plow, a snow shovel and scraper, a bootblack’s box, &c. Two or three of the chapters contain some excellent hints for girls.

The Pepper books become more and more ** peppery ” with each volume, and in “ Bon Pepper/’ the latest, there is no such thing as calm, no such state as quiet, and it will be a better mathematician tflan the public schools furnish Who can estimate how many miles each infant travels in the course of the story.
Of course, this book bears the imprint of the Lothrop Company, and So does " Dolly’s Double,” a story of twins, abounding in the errors and accidents peculiar to the lives of twins and so amusing to other children. The author is Miss Ethel Wood; the eight pictures and the cover design are by Miss Bertha G. Davidsons. Unselfish kindness permeates the behavior of the children, but the book contains no moralizing.
In the way of picture books the company is bringing out ** The Runaway Donkey,” by Miss Emilie Poulsson, rhymes written to the accompaniment of a series of pictures by Mr. L. J. Bridgman. Eight ** Pony Rollo Rhymes/’ describing a remarkable bit of horse flesh, and verses about other animals and birds, make the book as suitable for the kindergarten as for the nursery, and it has the uncommon merit of attaining the end of giving amusement without the employment ot coarseness or bad drawing.

it was something of a disappointment last Christmas to find that Miss Edna A. Foster had not followed the custom of most authors of children’s books and given her Hortense of 1£XW a successor, but this year brings “ Cordelia’s Pathway Out,” the story Of Hortense's chosen friend, and one feels repaid for waiting. There is no lack of pleasant stories, pretty stories, wholesomfe stories for children, but Miss Foster's long service on The Youth’s Companion has made her one of the very few editors who think it their business to write strengthening, developing, maturing stories for children, and " Cordelia’s Pathway Out *’ belongs to this species.	-

Mr. C. Hanford Henderson, the author of ” The Children of Good Fortune.” has sailed for Liverpool in the Republic for an indefinite term of residence and travel in England and on the Continent. He is at work on a second novel, but whether or not ” John Percyfield ” will soon have a companion is more than a little doubtful, as he works slowly and fastidiously.
