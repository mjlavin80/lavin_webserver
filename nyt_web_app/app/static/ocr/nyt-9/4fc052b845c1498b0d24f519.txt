SABINA. A Story of the Anilsh- By Helen Reimenayder Maxiin- 12mo. New xorK. Tlie Century Company, $1.25.
LAST year Mrs. Helen R* Martin wrote a very entertalnhig little story concerning a little Mennonlte girl named TUlie. Her new story deals with another sect among the Pennsylvania Dutch—the Amish—and to add to the dramatic side of this story there Is a queer psychical problem propounded and left unsolved.
Perhaps because the first always haa that potent charm of novelty, this second story of the queer people who .Jive so near worldliness and yet seem so far removed from it does not hold one as did its predecessor. The love of Sabina for the artist boarder who came out of the glittering East to stay lor a month at her father’s farm; the strong attraction he felt In her presence, and yet his honest and manly discouragement of her unconscious advances; the troubles of Ulmer Popple, her Amish lover—his jealousies, his petty revenges; and then the larger tragedy of Aaron, Sabina's brother, who loved and married Elephena, a Lutheran, and whose life spelt tragedy; all this Is told with many interesting de* scriptions of the Amlsn customs, their
marriages and their funerals, their prayer meetings, and the queer jargon they speak and call English.
As for the face which haunts Sabina, which foretells disaster, and which .finally throws her into brain fever and then robs her of the memory of the two years during which the artist played so great a part In her life—although the author states in her prefatory note that she can vouch for the truth of it, seems nevertheless to have been injected needlessly into tbe story.
