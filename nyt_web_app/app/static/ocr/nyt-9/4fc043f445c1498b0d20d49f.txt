AN eminently modern, although proba-. bly not final. word on the study of Homer comes from ;t scholarly Jesuit. Paradoxical as it may seem, his book is ;ui enthusiastic forensic on the compelling advantages of scientific criticism as applied to the prophet and cpie poet of ancient Greece, or, rather, to these poems which arc said to have flowed from thr> mouth of the legendary Homer. a” Hutuibook of Homeric ritudy." by Prof-Henry Browne, S.

Under tho topic. ** Kt-conl reaction tn lingland against scient Hie criticism. Prof. LJrowne touches on tlie views of. the authenticity of the " individual ’* named “ Jiomer,’* as UlUemi by Matthew Arnold and Gladstone, lie writes:
*	*	*	In the last generation, however,
two great names—those of Gladstone and I Matthew Arnold—were ranged on the side 1 of extravagant conservatism. We could i not refer in any terms but those of the I deepest reverence and gratitude to them both for the influence they undoubtedly ! exercised for good in making their countrymen enter more fully into the spirit of Homer and worship more intelligently at his shrine. But it must he owned that in their chivalrous loyalty to the poet and their generous refusal lo admit the mythological basis of his incarnation they were led by sentiment more than l*v sober reasoning. One of them was a poet and the other not unlike a poet iu the warmth of his imaginative faculty, and bv such persons dry philosophy and critical science are very e;ts'dy brushed aside as mere impertinence. But every day science progresses, and it is strange that even now writers are found who pretonu that Homeric questions are to be ap-;xpproached not in the “ scientific, but in the "literary." spirit- A more falsa antithesis could hardly be imagined, unless bv science they mean ** science falsely so'called." * * • A literary feeling which trusts to itself is of little avail for discussing the Homeric problem; neither will critics who abjure critical science succeed in putting back the hands of the clock.
Tl^e last two or three sentences show the author’s attitude toward Homer and his alleged works. His book has been written principally for students of the Homeric texts, and he devotes the larger part of it to a discussion of the Odyssey ** and " Iliad*"
