In this little volume Mr. E. V. Lucas, editor of I*amb and delightful writer about English countrysides, has gathered such a sheaf of verses as should please If not every child, then certainly ail of the persons who like the verses 'written by wise men and addressed to children. There are the bits from Stevenson that we all love, there are those nonsense rhymes of Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear. There’s Noll Goldsmith's " Elegy on the Death of a Mad Dog”; there's poor mad Cowper’s ** John Gilpin," there’s Henry Fielding’s “ Hunting Sons,” there’s Browning's “ Pied Piper of Hame-lin," there’s young “ Lochinvar,” '* Te Mariners of England." and bits of " Hlar-watha.”
Scattered throughout* also, are many familiar old rhymes—those about the weather and birthdays and lucky omens— the old Christmas songs as well, like *' The First Nowell ” and ** God Rest You. Merry Gentlemen.” You'll find Robert Burns’s “ John Barleycorn.” and Robert Herrick's '* Grace for a Child," and many other quaint and pretty things of his, besides a deal by Elisabeth Turner and some by Hilaire Belloc and James
Whitcomb Riley.
Altogether, the little volume Is one of the most desirable of such collections {in small space) now to be got at. Thero seems to be something in It for all good juvenile tastes.
