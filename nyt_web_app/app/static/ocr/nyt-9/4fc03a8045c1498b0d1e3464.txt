Publish Ins Company. jl.BO.
LACED in the reign of Czar Nicholas
I., when Russia__was undergoing the
trumlUattotr of defeat in the Crimea and in the Caucasus, the present story, according to the author, may be expected to suggest at least some of the conditions which prevail in the Russia of the current year. That is as xnayj>e. To us it seems hardly possible, but we know little of Russia.
The tale 13 one which involves the adventures of a young man alleged to be the natural son of the ]£mperor, & young man who. Ignorant of his birth, has been drawn into revolutionary plottings and had a taste of Siberia. He has a grandmother* who is a witch, and her the Czar comes by night to consult—and brutally knocks down when her answers are not satisfactory. And there is a girl who is persecuted by a blackguardly nobleman and beloved by the young man whose father is the Czar. You read also of a novelist who Is mixed up in some sort of revolutionary society, i^ captured by the Third Section, and clapped into prison after being scourged cruelly to induce him to reveal the names of his coconspirators.
This novelist, as if to complete his burden of miBfortune, has a jealous wife, who nevertheless after hlfl arrest sees the Czar and tries to bargain for the release of her husband. As for Nicholas I., you have him driving violently about, knocking people over and having them sent to his palace, and between times listen to him talking about taking poison. In the end you see him on his deathbed. For the young people the author has devised a happy ending. The story is full of stir, plots, and confusion.
