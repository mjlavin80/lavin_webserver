Withio the next fortnight Longmans, Green & Co. will publish “ The Poor and the Land/' which is H. Rider Haggard's report on tlie Salvation Army land colonies in the United States and at Had-leigh, England, with a scheme of national land settlement. Mr. Rider Haggard has written an introduction in which he gives a summary of his report to the British Government and an outline of his scheme to bring the poor people of Great Britain and its colonies into the rural districts. This scheme he indicates in one sentence:	" To combine a judicious use of
the public credit with that of what I have called the * waste forces of benevolence,' and by means of these two levers to lift some of the mass of human misery which demonstrates itself in the great cities of civilization to a new level of plenty and contentment.'* In short, he proposes to select suitable poor people from the cities, to convey them to distant lands, establish them there, teach them, live with them for a few years in the various settlements, ail of which should be done t>y “ charitable bodies using highly trained and specialized men/’ Arguments have been brought forward by ^ the author on every point objected to. And, he writes, whatever may be the difficulties and the possibilities attending land settlement:
Can it be right to keep^so many people with their delicate outworn women aua little children in a state that the imagination of most of us has not the power to appreciate or even to understand?
*	* * X say that have no right to keep these people meshed in their net of sorrows if we are not prepared to afford them the opportunity of leading a life of reasonable decency and comfort ill return for the labor of their hands. * * * I hope that some day the nation will come to understand that the true cure or palliative is to be found not in the workhouse or in other State-supported institutions, but upon the land, whether it 1 be the land of Britain or that of her immeasurable Empire.
