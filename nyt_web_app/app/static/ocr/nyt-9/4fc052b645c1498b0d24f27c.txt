MR VEDDER’S volume, which was first published as long ago as 1894, contains what may be called1* complimentary critical " notices of a number of American writers, many of whom are still living. The list includes Edmund Clarence Stedman, Francis Farkman, William Dean Howells, Henry James, Charles Dudley Warner, Thomas Bailey Aldrich, Mark Twain, P. Marlon Crawford, Prances Hodgson Burnett, Charles Egbert Craddock, Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, Adeline D. T. Whitney, Bret Harte, Edward Everett Hale, Edward Eggleston, George W. Cable, Richard Henry Stoddard, Prank R Stockton, and Joaquin Miller in the order named. The author professes the “ sympathetic " attitude, and, this being the case, what he says Is apt to be kind. He conveys Into the text certain crumbs of biographical information so that the reader may know something of the man as well as something of the writer, but it is not possible to place any high value upon the notices as criticism. Henry James, for instance, is gravely freed of the charge of having “ mannerisms,” and In the case of the lesser names, particularly, “ kindness ” so prevails over what, for want of a better word, may be called the judicity. as to leave the last quite out of the running. The book may serve to supply a not erroneous idea of most of the writers to those who are not able to estimate them for themselves.
