New York Times Saturday Review of Books:
The letter of “Manhattan” in last week’s Saturday Review op Books was of the refreshing kind, and I now wish to express my thanks to th,e writer for it.
Poor Byron! The idol of my youth, the negtected of to-day, and the (by high au^ thorities) condemned, how often have 1 mourned his fate! It took several decades for me to become half convinced of his worthlessness as a poet, and that quasi conviction might never have been forced to completeness had I not had the good fortune to be seated at a club table dining with a trio of university teachers who were more or less in the English belles-lettres line.
Soon after the first spoonful of soup the shop came boldly to the front, and not being of the guild I was barred out completely. Probably it is needless for me to write that I heard an authoritative thre$-parts lecture upon the relative merits of the more notable of the English poets. I was somewhat surprised and not a little crestfallen at not hearing mentioned the names of mv old friends, not one of them having elicited even a passing remark, and I was simple enough to ask some silly questions about Pope, Goldsmith, Gray, Burns, and others of my list. Suppressed surprise at my ignorance was rather clearly expressed, and I was whirled down the much-trodden highway of the ignoramuses by being told that they were not now regarded as poets worthy of consideration, (of course they meant by the Bramin class of the universities,) but that Dryden stood No. 1 and Wordsworth a close second. At this I timidly ventured to refer to ” Childe Harold ” as being a poem of some possible merit. Thig suggestion brought the heavy ordnance of the whole trio into action, and for several minutes broadsides came pouring out. But after my annihilation there came a period of silence, until I remembered that soon after Byron’s death one of the most distinguished Bishops of the Church of England, after having listened to a denunciation of the poet and his poetry, and to an especially strong condemnation of “ Don Juan,” said: " I do not agree with you, for I regard that poem as being at once the glory and shame of English verse." My remembering this incident en- ; couraged me to tlie making of another i venture by calling attention to that poem. It evoked but one response, and that came from a soft-voiced young gentleman of the perpetual smile fraternity, who remarked: “I believe we must admit that , he wrote some pleasant verse.” Soon after the birth of this fiat the curtain fell, and the writer's opinion of the value of a uni- > versify covree of English belles-lettres | became more fervid than ever.	i
