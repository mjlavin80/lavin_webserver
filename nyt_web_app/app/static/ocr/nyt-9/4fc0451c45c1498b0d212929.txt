THE CONSTITUTION.
- ' -
Its Formation and Development Treated Of in the Seventh Volume of " The History of North America.”*
T is a pleasure to review a book	so	excellent in many
ways	as	this volume proves
to be. It is well written, well printed, -and beautifully
*	Illustrated. Indeed, it is worth buying for the illustrations alone. These consist mainly of reproductions of portraits and some verj' fine photogravures. "W hile the illustrations	hear	no	specific relation to
the text,	all	the men	of prominence men-
tioned appear somewhere in the volume, and the period as a whole is made very vivid.
As for Prof. Moran's work, it is in the Highest degree satisfying. He appears to have been burdened with about as few preconceived opinions as it is possible for a man to possess. He is evidently neither holding a brief nor seeking to prove a thesis. He does not impute to the *' Fathers ” ideas which they clearly did not entertain, in order to prove that they meant to set up a strictly National Government, rather than one founded on compact. In fact, he is content to let the facts speak for themselves. He never
bases facts upon theories, nor are we asked to accept his ipse dixit.
ivROF. MORAN interprets the constl-| tutional period somewhat like this: It was a transitional period, in which the public taw of the land was changed by revolutionary process. This revolution, initiated by the Philadelphia Convention of 1787, was consummated in fact when ratifying conventions in nine States had accepted the new Constitution. He does , not say what was the legal status of North Carolina and Rhode Island, which remained^ outside the new Government for some months. Both finally came in, and of this ho remarks: '* All that was left for political theorists to do was to quibble 1 over what might have been/’ The States, i he says, were never truly sovereign. ' There was a union before there was in- j dependence. “ The idea that the States i were conceding something from their nb- ! solute sovereignty to make a union was ! an entirely mistaken conception."
The Articles of Confederation, then,
•	must be construed as based on this " en- j tfrely mistaken conception,” for in this ! document it was expressly provided that ! cach - State should retain all its sover-clgnty and powers not delegated to the United States. The word ** retain ’* means, of course, that the States were originally sovereign, for they could not " retain ’* what they did not already have. On the questions whether the Fathers intended to form a nation or a league Prof. 1 Moran has not much to say. He relates facts from which the reader can form his own opinion. The discussion of this subo jeet is proper material for the political I theorist rather than for the historian. Speaking ot the point made by Webster that the words of the preamble to the Constitution, ** We, the people of the ; United States," prove that the Constitu- i . tion rests on a popular basis, Prof. Moran ! suggestively remarks: “This phase of the matter was undoubtedly not appreciated by the members of the Constitutional Convention, as the preamble was adopted without a dissenting voice. At a later time when vital constitutional questions had arisen, the National idea in the preamble assumed a more positive form.** After showing the defects of government under the Articles of Confederation, Prof. Moran takes up the actual work of the Constitutional Convention* His chief authority here is, of course, Madison's record of the debates. The story of what went on at Philadelphia in the Summer of 1787 is one that will bear a good deal of retelling, and he tells It very well. In a chapter on the " Origins of the Constitu-" tfbn " he show3 how much the Constitu* tion owes to early Colonial and State experience and how comparatively little to direct English precedent.
Having described the formation of the Constitution, Prof. Moran, In the second half of his work, proceeds to inaugurate the new Government and writes its history through Jefferson’s second Administration. In explaining the fundamental difference between Federalist and Republican he goes straight to the root of the matter. The former was an aristocrat, the latter a democrat. AH other differences were incidental. They construed the Constitution differently. The Republicans sympathized with the Frepch revolutionists, the Federalists with England,, but all this was corollary to the main proposition. Jefferson's exaltation of tho States at the expense of the central Gov-

eminent was due to his conviction that they were nearer to the people and Ies3 likely to tyrannize over them. The Republicans of Washington’s Administration should not be considered as mere survivors of the old- anti-Federalists. In 1 fact, the two great Republicans, Jefferson and Madison, had neither of them been anti-Federalists.

WHILE Prof. Moran's general attitude toward Hamilton is highly appre-,	eiative,	ho	admits	that	in	his	rela-
tions with the Cabinet of John Adams he “ is indictable before the bar of public opinion fot receiving stolen goods, for his tools supplied him with inside information from the Government to be used against the President." Hamilton’s unpardonable intrigues in the election of 1800 form another blot on his public character. " His entire course in the election of 1800, except his opposition to Burr, is open to censure/’
When Jefferson approved of the treaty by which Napoleon ceded Louisiana to the United States, he was certainly not true to his strict constructionist principles. -Many writers have ridiculed him for this ^Inconsistency. It is a pleasure to note that Prof. Moran does not. “ The situa- j tion,” he says, “ was rather embarrassing. Theory seemed to conflict with practice, 1 but Jefferson acted the statesman, not the stubborn and unpractical theorist.” The mistakes of Jefferson’s second Administration are shown, and with his retirement from the Presidency the volume closes.
