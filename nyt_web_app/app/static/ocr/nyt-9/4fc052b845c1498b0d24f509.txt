THE TRIDENT AXD THE NET. A
Novtl. By the author of " The Martyrdom of un Empress." Illustrated. Pp. 54J). 8vo, Now York; Harper & tJr>Jthei-s.
THE Trident and the Net ” tells Hit* story of the unequal struggle of a knightly young soul, clad in the panoply of a noble lineage, and armed with all the weapons furnished by a fine mind and a loyal heart, against that dire retiarius, circumstances.
Tho fair promise of the boy ” as it was In the beginning,” his struggles, his triumphs, his sins—his alternate swaying by his bad and his good angel—all are Kid With only too great eloquence, for the tale is a tragedy, and it does not lose its clutch upon one's heart until long after the inevitable end is reachcd. That end is of a nature against which we have often been moved to protest. Let heroes and h«*roinr,p die. if their erector's " daemon ** so insists, but why tragedy’s crown of tragedy, that they should die one instant before tho gratification of their one dying wish?
The real love story of the book is that of a brother’s art'd sister’s iputual devotion, a devotion which shines like a star upon the most sombre pages, fixed and radiant through all the separations, the vicissitudes, the dividing circumstances of their lives. Giiidik. six years her brother’s senior, Is " always cheery and simple anti splendid.” never having " a look nor	a word	of	reproacL **jt	him
whatever his sins of omission find commission.” Loic, on the contrary, is eo-^ plex, violent, willful, though fundamentally noble and wholesome of nature. The Marquise de Kergrfiat is a wholly selfish and diabolical mother, injuring her daughter less by her lack of love than her son by her alternate adoration and tyranny.	She Is	wonderfully well	depicted, a	mother	so	impossible to	the
imagination that	she	must have been
drawn from life.
The story of Gaidik's and Txiic’s chil-hood in Brittany is exquisitely told. The ; description of Breton customs is full of j interest; a peasant wedding is an idyl of tenderness and beauty. The Bretons are ] fine sturdy figures, whether nobles or :
•
peasants, singularly simple in heart and dean of life, reared in an atmosphere of ** crystallinely* pure ” Catholicism, ** as tt is practiced in old-fashioned, loyal Brittany." The impoverished. Marquis de Kerdonugaszt In hfs ruined castle with his two sons brought up in ignorance for the sake of Independence, are noble representatives of Brittany’s ancient aristocracy. The young men " were very silent. Their father had seen his country humbled to the dust by idle babble, and the sight had taught him to dry up in his children the springs of idle speech. When they had anything to say they said it, but if they had nothing really worthy of mention, they kept those proud lips of theirs obstinately closed.”
The author shows her sympathy with what Is best In humanity, her faith in ** energy and a good purpose bravely held to.” It is for the lack of that brave hold-I ing that LCI* falls and fails, though his I very sins are, for the most part, a warped I nobility. His mother’s passionate devo-
I	tion and equally passionate persecution remind one of the usage Byron received | at the hands of his mother—though that | was but a ~falnt shadow of the course pursued by the Marquise dc KergOat.
Tho illustrations in water colors are : from the author’s own brush; and while j we find her beautiful women (we are glad , she did not attempt Giiidik) entirely disappointing, the bits of Kergiiat are charming, and the Breton peasants are wonderful.
