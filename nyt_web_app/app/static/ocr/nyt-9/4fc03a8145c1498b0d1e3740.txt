RE men of overmastering genius to be judged by different Btandards in morals and conduct from those that are Applied to more ordinary mortals? That is a question that will force itself to the front in the reading of the correspondence between Richard - Wagner and Mathilde Wesendonck. This correspondence has for some time been accessible in English in the translation of 'William Ashton Ellis,' (published in this country by the Scribners,) and already .has. been noticed by us more than once. Mr. Ellis is the chief literary champion of Wagner for Englishspeaking people, the translator of his almost illimitable prose works, and of the most elaborate biography of him that has. yet appeared. He produces English prose that is as gnarled as Wagner's German—a	quality that
sometimes seems to be a part of the homage that he is continually offering upon the master's shrine. He takes the most elaborate precautions in his long introduction to predispose the reader to look at Minna Wagner askance, as a weak, small soul, totally unfitted to he the wife of a genius, and to prepare him for a proper estimation of Wagner’s lofty and ideal passion for another man’s wife.
Whether the relations between Wagner and, Mme,. Wesendonck involved a violation of the obvious requirements of morality is not at this day, perhaps, a question of the utmost importance. The episode has- been a perplexity to his biographers, and has been sometimes harshly judged. These letters seem to invalidate the most evil judgment; but they equally show that Wagner lacked the fine feeling of a gentleman in his conduct both toward his own wife and the husband of bis inamorata; that an amazing egotism and selfishness ruled his thought and acts; that his treatment of his wife, »vhile often correct and even generous in material matters, was of a certain contemptuous pity more cruel than a grosser course would have been. Perhaps {hat sort of thing is one of the tributes exacted by genius from the world's sense of the fitness of things; but it does not make for love and admiration on the purely human side. A11 Mr. Ellis’s special pleading, often carried to ludicrous extremes, cannot make it seem so.
No; the important and interesting things in this correspondence relate to Wagner’s artistic activity. They relate pre-eminently to his composition of 44 Tristan und Isolde," the travail of his genius in that immortal masterpiece which U^has laid bare again and again. Mme. Wesendonrk was clearly no strongly individual Egeria; her part in the matter, with all her ardent admiration of the composer, seems to have oeen mostly a negative, a receptive one. Wagner had to have somebody who should listen while he poured his soul out, and who should provide him with the necessary sympathy and appreciation. The letters are full of the fury and the passion with which he wrought his very heart’s blood into the " Tristan ” score, day by day, week by week. J

And so on, in the lavish pro- | fusion of the artist's intimate commun- j ing. These are the things that make this correspondence precious to admirers of Wagner the artist- It is not often that the inner workings of genius have been so Illumined.
