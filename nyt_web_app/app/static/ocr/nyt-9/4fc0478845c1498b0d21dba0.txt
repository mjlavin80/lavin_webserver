& Facts About Fiction
A*
V	It’s pretty hard to classify THE ffi VENUS OF CADIZ. The author called it an extravaganza. The / scene is Kentucky to-day—without politics. The Dial of Chicago truly says:	"As	one startling develop-
ment follows another, we are left at -ij once breathless with excitement and convulsed with mirth. A racy and rollicking book it is, warranted to xi dispel the most chronic case of Sj blues.”
Mr. Eldridge proved in his MIL-^ BANK CASE that there was some*
^ I
thing new under the sun, even in M detective stories. For this tale, arising from the misdeeds of a set H of Maine politicians, has met with ^ j prompt critical and public approval. ^ As the New York Evening Post jj says: "It is?really dramatic, rather than cheaply theatric.'*
New printings have been called for in the last fortnight of three jh widely contrasted works of fiction: Mrs. Fraser’s MAID OF JAPAN ($1.25). The Times Review calls it “A romantic story that has caught
^ the very spirit of the country..........
j{ The format of the slender volume is J' a- stroke of genius. ... A book
jt full of artistic simplicity without and within, with genuine value un-jJ derlying its lightly heaped blossoms of romance.” Some of this refers to Miss Stuart's remarkably effective decorations. Colton’s BELTED j i SEAS, a very imaginative, also hu-5* morous and pathetic sailor's yarn, (L which competent critics have com-X# pared with the work of Jacobs, }j Dickens, Stockton and Mark Twain.
Mrs. Rankin’s DANDELION COT-U TAGE. Not all " wholesome” books W are humorous, but this one is, very. J | It tells of the attempts at housekeeping of some girls, and while JX aimed at the young, strikes the old favorably, too.
J J Two other noteworthy novels are si B. E. Stevenson's MARATHON | j MYSTERY, a detective story that
\ \ has been reprinted in England and JI Germany, and which the Bookman says places the author " in the front ^ rank of American writers of detective tales;” and Carryl’s TRANS-$ GRESSION OF ANDREW VANE, j I a story of the American colony in j* Paris, which The Times Review
says is H full of action and dramatic | J surprises.” and which has been republished in England.
