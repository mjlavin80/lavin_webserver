iWR following extracts are from Mr. Luigi VUIarl’s boob, 4‘ Russia Under the Great Shadow,” reviewed last week, Mr. Villari dees not think much of the Hus-secret police, th** famous Third Seetion, and tells this story as an instance of its worthlessness in ordinary matters:
PASSPORT AKD POLICE.
A FOREIGN passport is good in Russia for six months, after which a Russian passport must be obtained. Indeed, a traveler without a passport in Russia is not regarded as a real person at aK. The passport system leads to a number of vexatious abuses, and is often a means of extortion on the part of the police If a peasant or workman loses his passport, it takes him a long timo and costs him a great deal of money and annoyance to get a new one. If the authorities wish to oblige a man to remain fixed in one spot, all they have to do is to take away his passport, and Llieg he cannot move until they see fit to give it back lo him. One would think tiiat with the existence of the passport system the detection of crime and vhe arrest of criminals would be almost automatic. But as a matter of 'act dishonest persons usually have several passports, all in excellent order, and the manufacture of those articles is quite a recognized industry. The following anecdote, told me by a person who knew the parties concerned, illustrates how utterly futile the system is. A Russian family in Moscow had adopted an orphan girl, who was in bad health and sufrerea from lapses of memory. One day she went out alone and disappeared, leaving absolutely no trace. Her friends were very v.nxious. and made inquiries at the police office, but could obtain no information. They enlisted the service of the secret police, whose special detectives can employed for a fee in private cases. Inquiries were made throughout Hust-ia, but the only information elicited after several weeks* search was the fact that the girl had passed through Taniboff four ye;jrs before! Finally, after a couple of months, her friends met her in the street in the company of strangers. Explanations were given, and it was discovered that the girl had been found wandering about aimlessly by these other friends, had been taken home by them, and stayed with them the whole time, and as she had her passport in her pocket, it was taken to the police almost at once and registered in the Adressny Stol, or police address book.

EDI CATTOVAl,
THE village of R-
inhabitants at present has cnly one school. The *tory of Prince Y—■—'s fruitless attempt to open a second is characteristic of the way in which education is hampered in Russia. The Prince built the schoolhouse, furnished it. and added two extra classes to the ordinary elementary <. ur-rkulum, one for carpentering i±nd one for basket making, providing them with the necessary fittings. Then he offered the school just as it stood to the Minister of Education. An Inspector came to examine it and report on it, but the bureaucrats of the department declared that with those two additional classes it was a technical rather than an elementary school, and whereas they were prepared +o expend the 1,200 rubles a year, which was the sum assigned to elementary schools, a
technical one would cost 1,*^00 rubles a year, and this they could not afford,
so the offer was rejected. Prince T--------
then offered it to the Holy Synod, but that body declared that every Synodical school should have a well; this one was without that necessary adjunct, the construction of which would cost (>00 rubles; the Synod, therefore, refused it* There remained the local zemstvo, but
Prince Y------ happened to be on had
terms with that body, so he -Hd not make any offer in that direction. Disgusted at the twTo refusals, he converted the building into a convalescent home for wounded soldiers who had returned from the war. Thus FI has to get along as best it may by means of its one school.
REI.IGION IX RUSSIA.
A DOMINANT note of Moscow life is religion. The religion i f the Russians is really a revelation oi mediaeval devotion, and in the groat ceremonies, the processions, the pilgrimages, and the ritual, wre see a picture of what faith was in Wcsterr Europe at the time of Peter the Hermit. After Kiev, Moscow is the mosi holy city in Russia, and is said to con
tain over a thousand churches,-besides shrines~and chapels innumerable. The holy and miracle-working- images are, very numerous, and they are regarded with the deepest veneration tty the peo-pie. The most famous of all is the celebrated Iberian Virgin, (Iverskaia Boz-hemat.) kept in a small chapel in the Voskressenskaya Ploshtchad, between the two arches of the gate of the - same name leading to the Red Square. Whenever the Czar comes to Moscow, before entering the Kremlin* he ^ isits this shrine and prays before t* One may see the most important * eople in the land doing homage here **nd kissing the ikon.
Every day the image is taken from the chapel, placed in a large closed coach, drawn by six black horses, four abreast and two in front, one of the Int-
ter ridden by a hoy postilion. Inside, opposite the image, sit two priests in full vestments. Priests, driver, footmen, and postilion are always bareheaded, whatever the weather. It is then carried to the houses of people who are dangerously ill, (provided they can pay a fee of 50 to 200 rubles,) or- to assist at family festivals, the inauguration -of new buildings or shops, and other similar functions. In case of a jew building, a temporary shrine is erected in the courtyard, before which the priests hold a service. The belief in the Image is so great that last year, when a certain night restaurant of somewhat doubtful respectability celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of its existence, the proprietor sent for the holy ikon to sanctify the proceedings-. Whether any elevation of the tone of the establishment in question was noticeable afterward we are not told. During its absence from the home the image is replaced by a copy, to which great virtues are also attributed.
The Russian clergy are divided into two classes—the white and black. 1 he white clergy are the parish priests; they arc married—in fact, they must be married before they can be fully ordained: until quite recently their sons were obliged to be priests, too, and even now, although this is no longer obligatory, it is a very usual custom. If a priest’s wife dies, he must become a monk; dispensations from this obligation may now be obtained without much difficulty, but remarriage is not allowed. The village priest is -lot usually a popular character with his flock.
At best he is not more respected than the blacksmith or the cobbler, and in a general way he is regarded as an unlucky person who has the evil eye. Even to be the son of a priest is the reverse of a recommendation, and it is a taint, moreover, which it is difficult to hide as both the surname and the manner of speech often betray it. The character of the average priest is not indeed such as to overcome popular prejudice. He is grasping, avaricious and callous to the material and moral conditions of his flock; he seldom tVoubles about visiting the sick or the poor and his one thought Is to extract as much as he can out of his benefice. His excuse is, that he is wretchedly poor, and must eke out the insufficient income of the glebe lands by means of the fees which he charges for his services. Every ceremony has to be paid for. and as there is no fixed tariff, nothing can be done without t ndless bargaining, sometimes over a matter of a few* kopeks. The priest’s visitations through his parish are similar to those of the tax collector, and equally unpopular.
The black clergy are the monks; tney are bound ,to celibacy, and are obliged to live in* monasteries. But, on the other hand, they enjoy the monopoly of all ecclesiastical preferment, and the episcopate is chosen from their ranks alone, which is the «ause of bitter rivalry with the white dlergy, who are condemned to a harder life, greater unpopularity, and degrading poverty. They lead lives of purely contemplative devotion:	they do no practical good
works, they have no missions, they are shut up like cenobites, and although some of the monasteries own hospitals, schools, asylums, &c., the monks themselves very seldom take any direct part in their management, but l^ave it to salaried employes. While the white clergy are very poor, the monks, or rather the monasteries, possess immense wealth. They own land, vast quantities of jewels and plate, and they receive enormous sums in offering from the faithful, especially on the occasion of certain pilgrimages and festivals.
THE RUSSIAN SOLDIER,
THE troops encamped are the Guards regiments, including the
Emperor’s bodyguard of Cossacks in their picturesque but somewhit theatrical uniforms. These various corps are the £lite of the service. and their officers are mostly men of wealth and high social standing. Each regiment is commanded not by a mere Colonel, hut by a full General; one regiment, that of the Chevalier Guards, is commanded by the Dowager Empress, and would only go into action if that exalted lady herself were to take the field. At the cavalry school at Krasnoie Selo there are officers from all parts of the empire, who eonie for special training in riding, fencing, tactics, &c. There were wild-looking Circassians in strange costumes, and small-eyed Mongols from Eastern Siberia hobnobbing with smart young Guardsmen, Sheremetieffs, Yu-
•supof fs, Dolgorukls, Galitsyns, tlie best of the Russian* aristocracy. The Russian Army has this good point—that race Is no bar to a man’s advancement, (save in case of the Jews, who are not admitted as officers.) A Mohammedan from Turkestan has as much chance of attaining to the highest rank as any descendant of Rurik.
As the camp is a permanent one, earthwork emplacements have been built up for the tents, which are also provided with wooded flooring and doors. The Russian Tommy does not try to make himself at all comfortable; in fact, very few Russians ever do. He lives from day to day, reveling in untidiness, everything thrown all in a heap. His life is a hard one; his term a service of five years, which is longer than that of soldiers in any other Continental Army. His food is bad, although the poverty of the peasants in their
homes is so great that by contrast it is ample in quantity; the treatment he receives at the hands of his officers is often brutal in the extreme. But he manages to keep up a certain sad cheerfulness, and beguiles the tedium of long, weary marches by singing those beautiful but terribly plaintive songs of the Russian people. To hear soldiers singing these weird and touching melo-. dies makes one realize the sadness and sorrow of Russian life In another part of the camp we see him at play. He has nothing comparable to English garnet but he is fond of gymnastics and " giant strides —a game played by swinging around a pole on a rope attached to it. He is very handy with his fingers, as, indeed, all Russian peasants are. The mujik, shut up for months at a time in Winter In his little cottage, with nothing to do and only himself to depend on for most of his needs, develops great ingenuity in all sorts of ways, and learns to make baskets. furniture, sadd’ery, toys, household utensils, &c. These tall, stalwart men of war are more like great children than grown men; their ideas are utterly elemental, they are easily amused, and astonishingly ignorant. Military service, however, in spite of its many evils, certainly does shake them up, and gives them a wider outlook on Ufe. It is said that a peasant workman who has been in the army commands higher wages than one who
has not.	^
An interesting feature of Russia.n military life is offered by the schools attached to certain regiments. They exist for the benefit* of orphans and children whose parents are in poor circumstances. On the recommendation of some responsible person, the Colonel admits boys to the regimental school from the age of seven or eight and to the number of thirty or forty. The pupils are maintained free of charge at the expense of the State, and given an education more or less on the lines of ! the ordinary elementary schools, but in addition learn military drill, gynThas-tics, riding, &c., and they wear the uniform of the regiment, of which they are inordinately proud. It was most amusing to see one tiny little fellow only seven years old, standing up to be photographed with the greatest delight, trying to look at least seven feet high. After their schooling the boys are taught some trade; they are permitted to perform their military service four years earlier than is usually 3one, and on leaving the army they are helped to obtain employment and launched into the world. These schools are not the only aspect of the general educational policy of the Russian Army, for the soldiers themselves are f^iven a certain amount of elementary instruction, and are taught various handicrafts.
