IN FRONTIER days.
James Pattie's Story of His Adventures in Old and New Mex.'co ‘ Eighty Years Ago.*
HE eighteenth volume of the series of “Early Western Travels," which Mr. Thwaites Is editing, contains “The Personal Narrative of Junes
0.	Pattle of Kentucky,” a narrative which the learned editor described as "a tale of pure adventure, ranging all the way from encounters with grizzly hears and savages who , had never seen a white man to a revolution in a Latln-Amerfcan State."
The story Is capital; Battle wag not much of a story teller really,, but what he had to say could hardly help being interesting.
The title page of the original edition of Pattie's narrative explains his journeys
to some extent; the narrative covered his experiences "during an expedition from St Louis, through the vast regions between that place and the Pacific Ocean, and thence hack through the City of Mexico to Vera Cruz, during joumeylngs of six years, m which he and his father, who accompanied him, suffered unheard-of hardships and dangers, had various conflicts with the Indians, and were made captives, in which captivity his father died; together with a description of the country and the various nations through which they passed," *
For generations the Patties had been frontiersmen, traveling westward from Kentucky, the State In whfc/i they were proud to claim citizenship. In 3834 Sylvester Pattle and his son Janies found themselves In St Louis, loose-footed, the wife and mother having died recently, and joined a caravan bound for New Mexico. Pattie's story recalls the thrilling tales that Harry Castlemon, R.
M. Ballantyne, Anne Bowman, and others used to turn out every Christmastime; but hfs Is real. At one village of Pawnees i the caravan found a war party with a prisoner, a child, whom Pattle and his son I bought to keep from torture. Later the whites came upon a small party of Indians, consisting of between twenty and thirty women and children, besides three men:
Suddenly our attention was arrested by loud screams or cries, and looking up we saw our little boy in the arms of an India?. whose neck he was closely clasping, as the Indian pressed him to his bosom kissing him and crying at the same time.
As we moved toward the spot the Indian
£KP™hed	holdin? the child in
his arms, and falling on his knees made
us a long speech, which we understood ? hrough his signs, He was the father of this boy, whom we saved from being burned by the Pawnees. He gave us to understand by his signs that his child was carried off by his enemies. When the paroxysm of his joy was past we explained, as well as we could, how We had obtained the child. Upon hearing the name Pawnee he rushed into his hut He soon came out bringing two Indian swiIdb and his bow and arrows, and insisted that we should look at the scalps, making signs to tell us that thev were Pawnee scaips wmch he took at the time he lost his child. After he finished this explanation, he would lay the scalps a short distance from him, and shoot his arrows
+«r<lv.t	t0 Prove his great enmity
to this nation. He then presented my father a pair of leggfns and a pipe, both neatly decorated with porcupine qu Us, and, accompanied by his child, withdrew to his tent for the night

The story thus romantically begun coti* tlnues in like manner to the end; its truth might be doubted did not Mr. Thwaites point out facts that vouch for Pattie and his adventures. The traveler fignis Indians, hunts and traps; gets arrested by the Mexican authorities, and rs put into prison. We miss from the story only the silent, black-gowned inquisitors and their familiars; everything else of the old familiar tales is present A curiously modem touch is given to the story, however, by Pattle & assertion that he was liber» ated that he might vaccinate the people!
"ft ith points and lancets in hand, he traveled up to the Russian fort at Bodega Bay, M communicating the mattet” to thousands, and then returned to Monterey, whence he went to Mexico City to seek redress for the injuries suffered by his arrest and imprisonment. Failing in this, he went home, being robbed on the way to Vera Cruz by oandits, but reaching Kentucky safely, and telling his story to the Rev. Timothy Flint, who was editing The Western Monthly Review in Cincinnati.
Mr. Flint dressed the story somewhat, but as a whole It stands as Pattic told it, an interesting account of a remarkable journey. The present editor has done little for it except provide an introduction and make clear a few points. He corrects a month date in a note, but seems unable to Insert year dates at all, though those are at least as important as the numbers giving the pagination of the original edition.
