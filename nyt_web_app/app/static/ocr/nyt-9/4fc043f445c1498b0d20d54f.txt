SOBER SECOXSTD THOUGHT.
An Opinion of “ The Breadwinners *’ Revised After a Second Reading.
Kao York Times Saturday Review of Boofo;
HAVE just finished the last Installment ot “The Breadwinners ” Jn the Sunday edition of The New York Times, and thl3 second reading has considerably. modi fled my opinion formed some twenty yeacrs ago, when the novel first appeared.
I	classed It then as a good third-rate * novel, but now, after two decades and a quite extensive experience in fiction reading, I atn ready to cheerfully concede to it an honorable place in the second rank, with touches, here and there, which suggest the highest reaches of imaginative writing. Its merit is precisely of that sort which makes one wonder why it Is not greater, and leads to the suspicion (strongly confirmed by subsequent disclosures) that the book is a by-product of some facile pen otherwise employed than in what Thackeray described as novel spinning.” Mr. Hay has a story to tell, and he tells It deftly* with numerous happy descriptive touches and lively sallies of humor, and keeps the whole within a reasonable compass. Why cannot more present-day writers emulate this commendable brevity? Winston Church-iH, for instance, not to mention other offenders, seldom requires less than 600 pages to drag the life out of both story and readers. “ The Crossing " has Just
,vleft me in a state of collapse at the final 598th page.
So much for '* The Breadwinners ” as a story; but how came the sub-title. *‘A . Social Study/’ to be added? In so far as social or economic conditions are touched upon they are set forth on the most purely conventional lines. Algonquin Avenue in Buffland monopolizes the wealth—greenhouses. plumbing, beauty, and, as a necessary sequence, the civic, social, and domestic virtues of the tale. Bean Street and the adjoining alleys are the abodes Of poverty, want, and ugliness, with the inevitable resuits of selfishness, sottishness, and crime. The dividing line between the two classes (there are only two) is exactly drawn as between the sheep and the goats, the saved and the damned, the virtuous rich and the vicious poor. There is no question raised as to the justice of all this, no faintest suspicion that the rich may he on the road to a degenerate materialism, or that “ The Breadwinners ” are blindly groping for their manhood rights when they turn from the crust contemptuously flung-at them, after the loaf has been handed over to their betters.
Capt. Pamham. the hero, is a splendid fellow, and Alice Belding is a splendid girl. They are both rich and idle, and with all the grounds, graces, greenhouses, and bric-i-brac that money could buy. And poor little Maud Matchiu sees and wants these things, but gets none of them except a rose and smile from Fam-ham, whom she manages to waylay in one of his own hothouses. Saul Matchin, her father, is a deadly dull and ignorant carpenter* Sam Sleeny, her first lover, is another, with a touch of the fool added. Andrew Jackson Offitt, her second suitor.
Is a greasy reformer and a scoundrel. Bott. her third, is equally greasy and a scoundrel, while the culminating strike is a murderous assault on life and property. Maud marries Sleeny after he has killed Offitt, and the author dismisses them with eix brief and admonitory lines, giving up the whole of the last chapter to Farn-ham^s wooing of the splendid Alice. Where was tlie prophetic eye of our brilliant statesman, the biographer of the President of the plain people, who told us of “ Little Breeches" and disclosed the profane virtues of '* Jim Bludso/' pilot of the Prairie Bell, but who could discern no virtue In the Bludsos when they demanded a more liberal share of the earnings of the line? To charge this lack of prevision to a wealthy marriage would ba ungenerous, and, af.er all. Mr. Huy> point of view (now happily antiquated was that of a majority of our excellent citizens In the middle decades of the nineteenth century. " The Breadwinners/ with its pathetic title, is a capital story, but its moral, the awful wickedness of labor reformers, like most morals, has been disregarded.	JESSE C. JOV.
