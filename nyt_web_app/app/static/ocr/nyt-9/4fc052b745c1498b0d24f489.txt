A Showy New Book on a Fascinating Subject—What the Girls Read.
BOOK of the early Autumn that will be much talked of, for a time, Is ** The Jewish Spectre," by George H. Warner, a resident of Hartford, Conn., and_a broth. er, we believe, of the late Charles Dudley Warner. A hasty glance through its pages— there are 377 of them, all told—shows that it la a sort of hotch-potch of anecdote and quotation, legend and fact, held together by a strain of comment, now ironical, now impassioned, which is not likely to convince, but is generally diverting. As may be inferred from hts title, the author is burdened with no race prejudices. All the same, devout Jews will find plenty of offense in his book, if i they care to hunt for it, and so will devout Chris- I tians. Catholic as well as Protestant. The book involves something of a study of ethnology, of religion, of literature. It also deals largely with myth and paradox. The Jews, Mr, Warner argues, are not financiers—they are merely money merchants, and money is not wealth. A financier, he insists, is a man who makes two blades of grass grow where one grew before. We thought that was an agriculturist, or a hay grower, or a greens keeper in a golf club. But Mr. Warner really knows what a financier is, in : spite of his juggling with phrases, and he does not think the Jews of America are great financiers or 1 financiers at all:
The Jews amopg us have not furnished any great Finance Minister like Chase, or any great banker with the comprehensiveness or the idealism of Mor- j gran, and certainly no great master of material production or construction like Thompson, Scott* and HUI; or of merchandising, like Rockefeller; or of manufacturing and vending, like Havemeyer or Carnegie.
It is gravely stated that Mr. Warner haa spent twenty years of his life in writing this book- The least we can do with it, is to spend some more time
I upon it, say twenty tours or so, before subjecting It to„ a final review.
