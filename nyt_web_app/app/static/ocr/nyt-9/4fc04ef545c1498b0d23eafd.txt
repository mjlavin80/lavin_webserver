N his own manner, of studied ycontrariness and; in. short, i sharp phrases, artfully man-'iifactured to make his readers sit up and take notice of ,the utterness of his contfempl fort commonly accepted opinions, the auttior of 14 The Unspeakable Scot *’ (and other paradoxical volumes) has written a book about the Irish. The method is the same, tn -principle, as that employed by the eminent Irishman, Mr, George Bernard Shaw, and, as Mr. Cros-land warns us not to take Mr, Shaw seriously, It Is obviously superfluous to take Mr. Crosland so.	•
Altogether the best plan for the reviewer in the case is to quote-somewhat lavishly from the text and spare comment. Following that plan, we present the following
It has been said that Erin’s appeals for reasonable treatment at the hands of England have had to be made by violence of the most brutal and terrorizing kind. She has stood before us with the head, of a landlord in one hand and the tail of a cow in the other and screamed till we gave her what she wanted; And always in large measure we have succumbed.
*	* * Sir Francis Drake or some instrument of his planted the potato upon them. James I. planted the Scotch on them. George III. gave them a Lord Lieutenant and a Secretary. The potato, the Scotch, and Dublin Castle have been the three bitter Curses which have brought this people to the ghastliest social and political passes. All three are ineradicable, but they may be mitigated.

HAVING asserted with emphasfe; that tbe much harpit shillelagh is " an effete weapon,” and that he (the i author) never saw but one in Ireland—and that silver-headed and in the hands of a person with a marked cockney accent— Mr. Crosland proceeds cheerfully thus:
It Is, of course, common knowledge that, shillelaghs laid on one side, the Irishman makes an admirable soldier- The Irish never run away; in our late wars certain non-Irish regiments, which were neither ; English nor Welsh, did run away. I have i seen it remarked, and I believe it can be Justified out of military histories, that, while the Irish and English regiments have usually done the rough-and-tumble hand-to-hand fighting in our most famous ! engagements, the gentlemen with the bare I knees have had the good fortune to be I sent In at the tail end of the trouble merely to execute a little ornamental sweeping up. To the eye of officers and women “nothing looks nicer*' than kilts and apats. To derange them were a pity; therefore where possible we shall nold them in reserve.
THEN Mr. Crosland tags on to the deliberate platitude that ** the uni* verse abounds in enigmas ’* this:
And perhaps the most stupendous enigma oi them all is called whisky* In Scotland whisky is the universal ichor and panacea. In Ireland a kind of whisky which is unquestionably whisky, but not Scotch, stands in the same friendly relation to the people. In England we drink both kinds, lying thus between the devil and the deep sea. There cannot be the slightest doubt thet the baser sorts of whisky are Scotch, and that the primal, more edifying, and more inspiriting sorts —if we only knew it—are Irish. He who drinks beer thinks beer. He who drinks whisky thinks whisky. He who drinks Scotch Whisky becomes as the Scotch people, who, as all men know, are a hectoring. swaggering, dull-witted, bandy-legged plantigrade folk. He who drinks Irish whisky becomes as the Irish who should be nimble and neat and vivacious and thriftless and careless and lavish and decent and otherwise gracious.

MR* CROSLAND has chapters on ** blarney," which he counts pretty well extinct on Irish soil; on ■* pathriots/* whom he admires and gibes; on the Irish priests, whom he defends from the chat^es of Mr. McCarthy and others; on the beauty of Irishwomen. That beauty he grants and lauds, not without diabolical side remarks upon the growing lack of the quality in Scotswomen and the ladles of England. Further, he denies that Mr. W. B. Teats is really an Irish poet—calling him merely a disciple of Blake and the ** KelticM spirit really the Blakeian spirit. Still further he says that he finds the Irish In London—In the Commons, at the Bar. and in literature—but a sorry lot. To be sure he admits the meteoric splendor of one literary Irishman, but he writes, .“Hr. George Bernard Shaw has become an American playwright.’*
Mr. Crosland's conclusion, apparently, is this, that the first step toward a really regenerate Ireland ts the feeding of the pernicious potato to the equally pernicious pig—the pig to be kept not singly and as a household pet, but in droves and to be slain for the British market. The price of pig will then enable the Irishman to buy for himself and family proper vict' uals for human eating. Which is what the Irishman needs to have.
