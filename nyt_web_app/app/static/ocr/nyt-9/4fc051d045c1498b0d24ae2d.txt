Authority
for
Bad English.
The other day attention was drawn in a contemporary to the conventional use of aggravating ” in the sense of “ annoying,” and it was pointed out—correctly enough, no doubt—that the word, used	in	this sense, had found its
way into	polite	society from the back
kitchen, through the front one, the butler's pantry, and the housekeeper's room successively. Next day an indignant correspondent produced a passage from *' Clarissa Harlowe,” in which was the objectionable word with the objectionable and, so far as derivation gives guidance, , almost impossible meaning. But was this a clinching argument? When a few years i after the appearance of Richardson’s famous novel, a certain dictionary came out, " aggravating " had no such meaning attributed to it as it had received from ! the great novelist, who stood apparently j convicted of a vulgarism. Nor is this colloquial use of the word recognized by Latham. But whether Richardson’s error be | pardonable or not, it Is certainly a dan- i
gerous precedent to quote high authority ] to excuse mistakes or slipshod English, for most mistakes in writing could thus find condonation. A few years ago I resolved to make a list of contemporary writers who split the infinitive, but the list grew Indefinitely, and I destroyed it, resolving to substitute for it a list of those who didn’t. That is almost a virgin list, and it is a safe bet that split infinitives will occur iii three out of every four books that come to me for review. And if high authority for this abomination be needed, I found it a few days ago in ** The Trumpet-Major,” where in less than ten chapters I met three or four split infinitives.—Marshall Steele in The Pall Mall Gazette.

Book Titles.	.	.	„
once more how curiously writers of fiction differ in their power of choosing good titles. It is to a certain extent a matter of fashion. Thus, not very long ago an attempt was made to revive what may be called the conversational title which Trollope used in “ Can ; You Forgive Her? ” and " He Knew He Was Right.” But this form seems to have been definitely abandoned, for this season at any rate, aft hough it obviously 1 affords splendid opportunities for exciting curiosity. Just now novelists seem to prefer the plain descriptive title, of which an excellent example is ** The Parish Nurse.” We have no doubt that the merit
or demerit of the title has a great deal to do with the success of a book. The experienced reviewer of course knows by bitter experience that the merit of the title is often in inverse ratio to the merit of the book, but the public are less sophisticated and are influenced in giving their orders by the title almost as much as by the name of the author. ° The Prisoner of Zenda ” certainly owed nothing of its success to its unattractive title —indeed, it might also be laid down as an axiom that the names of places and countries, whether real or imaginary, should be avoided. “ The Count of Monte Cristo ” is a grand exception, but the elder Dumas had a positive genius tor titles, which his son inherited—as. may be seen by the extremely clever names he gave to his plays.—The Academy.

Prone Cat Into Verse Length!
Tacitus was deservedly censured for beginning the “ An-nales ” with a hexameter, and the cutting	of prose	into verse	lengths has
always been condemned; and in English to carve prose into the iambic pentameters, called blank verse, is a grievous offense, indulged in by many writers of note, from Bishop Burnet to Dickens—nay, from Milton to Edgar Allan Poe. If we remember that when the “ Areopagitica " was written spirit was still usually pronounced as a monosyllable, the following quotation	from	it:	" A good	book is the
precious life-blood of a master-spirit embalmed and treasured up on purpose to a life beyond life,” seems to us excellent blank verse, with one weak ending. Dickens, of course, in his earlier work, was prone to fall into this error, and Henley
noted the iambic beat In that perfect piece	of	descriptive	writing	which	tells
of Tom Pinch’s coach ride from Salisbury to London. This beat may occasionally, too, be noted even in Elia and	in the	masterpieces of	the Wizard of
the	North.	As	for writers	of a different
calibre,	when they	try the	highfalutin’
style	they drop into poetry more	fre-
quently than Mr. Wegg, and there is enough blank verse in ** The Sorrows or Satan ” to make a good sized epic.— Marshall Steele in The Pall Mall Gazette.

tory which is being go thoroughly rewritten at present as the history of the United States. Sir George Trevelyan is devoting his whole energies to the great theme in this country; while in America many of the ablest historical students are again going over the ground so imperfectly covered by Bancroft. From these contemporary studies a curious and interesting contrast emerges. While English writers still con-< tinue to heap every possible condemnation on the set of men who carried out the policy of George HI., there is in America a decided reaction. A sort of whitewashing is going on, and the new school of historians, weary of the old schooibooks and patriotic histories, are trying to look, at the action of English rulers from a saner standpoint. The National outlook has widened with the years. The sad experience ot the civil war has taught the new generation that EngJjsh rulers are not the only men subject to errors of mind and heart; and there is a sort of scientific revolt from the attempt to tack history on to patriotism.—The Academy.

The placing of a tablet on Holly Lodge, Wandsworth, to mark it as one of ~	the	homes	oWGeorge
Eliot, is a satisfactory piece of commemoration. It was a “ deliciously fresh, bright day ” in February, 1S39, when George Eliot and Lewes took possession of this home, and she accepted the weather as an omen. But two years later came the removal to Blandford Square.
Here George Eliot watched the effect of
"Adam Bede" on the public and on the
Carlyles, and read the laudatory reviews in
* the Athenaeum, Saturday, and Literary Gazette. Blackwood wrote to tell her that she was now ** a popular author as well as a great author,” and to Holly Lodge came Herbert Spencer with the news that ** Adam Bede *’ had been quoted in the House of Commons. In an atmosphere of success and reactive misgivings, George Eliot sat down to write The Mill on the Floss,” the novel really associated with Holly Lodge.—London Globe.

"Life dul not deal too kindly with George Giss-ing. His apprenticeship to literature was hard and cruel. In spite of a long and bitter struggle with poverty he upiield his standard jj and never consented to pander to the public taste by ephemeral work or meretricious effects. Strength and sincerity characterized all he did. But it was impossible for a man of Iiis temperament, placed as he was for the greater part of his life, to escape the taint of pessimism, and he would seem to have taken a sort of sombre delight in relentless delineation of failure. It was impossible for him to accept life at other people’s valuation, nor could he consent to bow down and worship commonplace ideals. When at last worldly success came it arrived, as it generally does, almost too late. He was only to enjoy it for so short a time.v And yet that brief time of DrosDerity stamped
itself upon his work. His nature unfolded. His outlook upon life became more genial, better proportioned. "Will War-bnrton,’* alt!tough not by any means the best of his books, shows no failure in power. 11 does not rank with such books as “ The Nether World ” and *' Demos."
