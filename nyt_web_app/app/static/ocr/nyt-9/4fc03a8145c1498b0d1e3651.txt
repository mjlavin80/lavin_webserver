New York Timzs Saturday Rcvicic oj Books: As I first started the query as to tho burial place of Edward Whalley, allow me a few words further. I note what your various correspondents say, and if all are correct in their conclusions, there must have been at least three of the Whalley regicides—one buried in Hadley, Mass.; one at New Haven, Conn., and one In Maryland.
As but one Whalley signed the death warrant of Kin^ Charles, somebody is mistaken as to the facts. I still incline to the belief that Whalley was buried in New Haven.
I quote from '* New Haven Historical Collections," Volume 2, us follows, by Franklin B. Dexter; “ For it is certain from Goffe’s letters in the volume of
*	Massachusetts Historical Collections ’ that Whalley died in 1G74-5 or ItfiU” Probably 1G7G is correct, for a letter in Goffe's handwriting, Sept. 8, 1G7G, and sealed with Whatley’s seal, is among Goffe’s letters. This Whalley letter is headed " Ebenezer,” but it is known that Goffe and Whalley were at Hartford at that time.
Dexter notes further the finding in 1795 of the bones of a man buried in Mr. Russell’s cellar at Hadley, Mass., and says: " There is no good reason to doubt that these bones were the mortal remains of Gen. Edward Whalley.”
He does not state, however, how these bcnes were identified as Whalley’s. They may have been the bones of some one else buried fifty years later. My impression is that Whalley died in New Huven and was buried there or died in Hartford, and his remains were later taken to New Haven for burial.
