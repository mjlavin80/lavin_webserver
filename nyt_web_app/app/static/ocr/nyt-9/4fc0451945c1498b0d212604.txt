object in writing her volume of reminiscences of George Frederick Watts, of which much has already been said in these pages, was “ to record accurately " those things which have reference
to her husband's and her own personal friendship with the late artist—"to give to the future a page of contemporary history, which, though by no means exhaustive, Is correct.’' She has chapters on her first impressions of Watts, when she first met him in Dante Gabriel Rossetti’s studio; his aims, as expressed orally and In writing; his genius, his work with the chisel, their friendship, the relations between Watts and Leighton, the latter*s death, and the last years of Watts. Throughout are references to the painter’s different works and some of his subjects.
There are torty illustrations, the larger number of which arc caught at tho edges on tinted paper mats. Among the *_oicred reproductions are the frontispiece, a portrait of Watts from the painting by i Cecil Schott, in 18S7; Watts's “ Bryn-hildr"; his portrait of Mr. Russell Barrington, and 4*Oh. Who Will O’er the Downs So Free”; in tinted^ half-tones are some sketches, symbolical paintings, and portraits; and there are two or three photogravures, including the drawing in | chalk of 14 Aspiration,” executed in 18&7, ] which is at the very end of the present | volume.
