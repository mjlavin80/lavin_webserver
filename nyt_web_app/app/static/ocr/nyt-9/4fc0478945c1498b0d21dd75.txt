T IS close on fifty years since Charles Darwin turned the thought of the world toward the problems of-life in the stricter sense of the term. His ** Origin of Species ’* was, as he called it, merely a sketch of the very complicated problem, which he, following his grandfather's example, set out to solve. The successive chapters dealt with the different aspects of the problem of^blological evolution, and so closely knit was his reasoning, so wide the basis on which his inductions were based, that each of them might have by itself formed the^ subject of a special treatise. As a matter of fact, several of these treatises were afterward written, one notably by Darwin himself, “ Animals and Plants Under Domestication/' which really expands the reasoning of his second chapter, and Dr^-A. It. Wallace's " Geographical Distribution of Animals/' which on an equaBy formidable scale deals with the topic which Darwin touched upon in his seventh chapter.
So, too, Lycll dealt with the imperfections of the geological record which Darwin utilized to account for the non-appearance of missing links, whereas nowadays Prof. De Yries has shown that nature itself makes jumps in forming species. One of the most suggestive hints thrown out by Darwin in his general treatment of the problem was the light that comparative embryology would throw upon the development of species, the underlying assumption being that the embryo passes successively through all the stages of development which the race to which it belongs had traversed. The idea was to a certain extent carried out in the work of P. M. Balfour, whose “ Comparative Embryology" is perhaps the most important contribution to biology made by any Englishman, and was conscientiously adopted as the matrix idea in Prof. Haeckel’s “ Anthropogenic,” an i^nglish version of which has just appeared in two volumes, the first dealing with human embryology, the second with human “ stem-history,” as the translator calls it, or what is generally known as phylogeny. The earlier English version translated tho second; this is a version of the fifth and much enlarged edition of the-'original.
The subject is rather gruesome, and is not best adapted for public discussion, but its importance and sijjnil ieance for the theory of evolution ran scarcely be overrated. Almost all the speculative work of the last twenty years has clustered around it, in particular the researches of Welsmann, whose lnytr-nious views are almost entirely concerned with the distinction between that part of the huinau body which subserves the individual interests, and that which goes toward continuing the race. As Is well known, he contends that there is no means by which the germ plasm or reproductive element can be influenced by the experience of the Individual, so that wo get the paradoxical result that the race must always remain the same, since no means *is provided for passing on any change. It Is not surprising to find Prof. Haeckel somewhat superciliously disregarding the possibilities of such an un-evoluttonal view of evolution. He sturdily declares himself on the side of Lamarck and Darwin in regarding the possibility of the inheritance of acquired characteristics, but IS seemingly ignorant that it was rather Erasmus Darwin that held this view. The Innovation that* Charles Darwin made oh his grandfather’s theories was rather to give imphasis to the influence of casual advantages than to allow for that of acquired characteristics. In the view of many, Erasmu3 Darwin was more in the right than his grandson, and Certainly recent investigation has trended more In the direction of his thought than that of- Charles Darwin. Yet it must always bo allowed, that it was the latter that convinced the world, whereas Erasmus Darwin only'made it laugh at him with his “ Loves of the. Plants.”
Prof. Haeckel is concerned throughout his two massive volumes to prove what he terms the bio-geret.ic law that ontogeny is a brief and condensed recapitulation of phylogeny. By these somewhat repellant technical terms he means to say that the development of the ovum to maturity is. a\short

epitome of the development of the r£jce* -In other words, if this contention were exactly true; a life history of one of the; higher vertebrates should'.repeat the •whole biological history of the organic ‘ world since life began upon the globe. This is obviously a large order. In the first place, marvelous as has been the progress of microscopy during the nineteenth century, even the minutest of organisms evades any complete analysis owing to its very minuteness. Then, if the whole life history of the branch of the race to which an animal belongs could be traced in its embryology, it would only be one branch of the Wide-spreading tree of life that would thus be elucidated. But beyond this lies the fact that the biogene tic law only claims that embryology gives merely an “ epitome ” of the racial development, and it is easy for the evolutional biologist to get over the missing links in the way by dragging in the principle of condensation. If a certain linkage is not there, it is easy to say that they have been skipped in the process of condensation. When to all these difficulties is added the very rapid processes by which the ovum is segmented Into very definite organs, it should not be wondered at that the science of comparative embryology is still in a very om-bryological condition, and that these volumes of Prof. Haeckel are filled with hypotheses which may or may not be verified as further knowledge comes to the student of biology.

PROF. HAECKEL is probably aware of the very hypothetical basis on which his science is at present founded, but he scarcely leaves the impression of doubt as to Fundamentals in the minds of his readers. In particular he has a large number of illustrations which at first sight seem to base his theories on ths widest form of induction, but more carefully examined, a good many of these are rather diagramatic than photographic. The discriminations made by the injection of coloring matter into ssmi-fluid objects are a very precarious basis on which to found such a large and wide-
varying induction.
It is only by means of such simplification through diagram and hypothesis that Prof. Haeckel succeeds in .tutting before his reader a very plausible, and in many ways very clear account of the development of all organic life from a single cell. By their aid he shows how the impregnated ovum divides up into an outer and an inner skin, ectoderm and entoderm, which in their turn give rise to an outer and inner and middle layer, ectoblast, eatoblast, and mesoblast. From the former is derived the sense organs, from the second the mucous membrane, and from th€ last the muscles and the vascular system. From these comparatively simple elements he traces the whole complex of the animal organism, and having thus cleared the way by an accounl of human ontogeny, he proceeds in th< second volume to give an account oJ human phylogeny. or what Harwir called “ the Descent of Man.” Here h< traces the line of development from th< Amphioxus and the Ascidia up to man dealing1 in successive chapters witl •* our protist ancestors,” “ our wormlik ancestors,” " our fishlike ancestors,’ and “ our ape ancestors.” In all thi Prof. Haeckel is plunging into lines c investigation which simply bristle wit difficulties in comparative anatoms but he has the courage of his convic tions, and settles the most romple problems off-hand aniwith the -Jtmos confidence. ’While there can be n doubt as to the general validity of th scheme of development thus laid dowi Prof. Haeckel would probably be tY first to own the probability of ~evisio in detail throughout the line of deve opment. In particular, the position < the monotremes is very doubtful, tl duck-bill platypus being quite off U main line of ascent. The work cm eludes with a series of chapters on tl evolution of the nervous system, sen organs, the motor organs, the eleme] tary organs, the vascular system, &< all treated from the standpoint of er bryological development.
TAKEN with this warning, the bo< may be recommended as givi: a very clear—in fact, a too cleai account of our present knowledge bo of the development of the individi and that of the race. Much is guei work, a good deal is scarcely to be qui ified even by that name, but the brc
fact of development 4nd the main. details of the process/ are - undeniably given by Prof. Haeckel.with of illustration and; a ?positlveness • of statement which aids both understand-fng and memory, even if it somewhat obscures the complexity of the-problem and .the insecurity of the conclusions to which one is led*	'■■	■
The final chapter connects this rather specialist book with the' more general philosophic 'position which Haeckel has expounded, as feeing the' root idea of the problem of evolution,
He is a monist—that is, he regards the whole universe as the expression of one substance or unifying principle ''Which finds its expression either in matter or in thought, each of which Is the aspect of the other. This was the roint of view which he took in his lecture .on M Monism ” some twenty-five years ago, and in his book on “ The Riddle of the Universe,” which has had an extraordinary success in Germany, for 150,000 copies have been sold, and of the English version of which no less than 100,000 have been distributed. He now follows this up with M The Wonders of Life," which he regards as supplementary to “ The Riddle of the Universe.” It is scarcely likely that it will be so popular. Curiously enough, when dealing with general physics and psychology, on which he is not an expert, Prof. Haeckel was clear, if somewhat superficial, but in dealing with purely biological problems, on which he is one of the greatest living masters, he is not superficial, but he is also not clear. The puzzle of life remains a puzzle, even after his elaborate ex- j planation of it.
This obscurity is no doubt due to Prof. Haeckel's continual endeavor to make out that he has anticipated all the most important of the theories on the nature of life which have been put forth during the last thirty years. He is perpetually reminding the reader that this is what he said in his "Gen-erelle Morphol&gie ” or id his ” Plasti-tude Seele,” or in one of the many works on the philosophy of biology with which he has instructed the world during the last third of a century. As he is naturally concerned to point out the differences between his view and that of the person who has gained credit for it, a considerable amount of space and time is wasted over details that to the readers of the book are somewhat minute, and, to tell the truth, wearisome. One would have preferred to have had a view discussed without the exact amount of credit being apportioned between Prof. Haeckel and his successors. Still, the tendency is a natural one. We all feel inclined to curse those who, as the Irishman said, “break two of the Commandments upon us; first steal our theories, and then adulterate them.
The result is, tnererore, that the ne^ book is by no means so easy reading as " The Riddle of the Universe.” Here we come at close grips with specifi< details of a special science, rather thar with vague generalities about the uni' verse in general, and Haeckel’s owi scientific instinct causes him to gi into fuller details than the ordinary layman can follow. His chapter 01 the forms of life, for example, is prac tically a short summary of his worl on morphology. For instance, the fol lowing quotation is not altogether t be '* understanded of the vulgar ’ with out an amount of technical knowledg which cannot be usual:
The distinction between protists an histons is much more important tha the familiar division of organisms int plants and animals, in respect of the: fundamental forms and their < onfjg uration. For the protists, the unicelU lar organisms (without tissue) exhib a much greater freedom and variety i the development of their fundament* forms than the histons, the multicelh lar tissue-forming organisms. In tl protists (both protophyta and protozo: the constructive force of the elemental organism, the individual cell, det€ mines the symmetry of the typical for and the special form of its supptemei tation; but in the histons (both met; phyta and metazoa) it is the plastioi of the tissue, made up of a numb of socially combined cells, that dete mines this. On the ground of *his te tological distinction we may fllyu the whole organic world into four kin doms, (or sub-kingdoms,) as t morphological system in the seventh t ble shows.
The point is well taken, but not w put. This same chapter, by the we deals partly with one of the most i markable of Haeckel’s productions, 1 *4 Kunst-Formen der. Natur,” in which he gives illustrations of the lower order of animals as instances of pattern in artistic form in nature. So, too, in the chapter on reproduction, he Bum-
mkrizes much - to^is^jBiven in'-his greater worit-. on' anthrogehy, • biit the ' summary is so condensed that it. Is by -no means easy to follow his argument.
IVTOTWITHSTANDING this’ obscure
IN ity in parts, the whole book is ,fairly "dear as to its tendency, which,,as is well known, is opposed to the" claims of any recognition of any supernatural element in. the universe. Haeckel is for the moment a representative of the opposition of science .to religion. But when one examines into the philosophical basis of his anti-re? ligious attitude, it is somewhat curious to find antiquated views and methods of science made the basis of its opposition to religion. Thus, the essence of his contention about the mental life, as based on the parallelism between the body and the mind, was originally started by Spinoza and adopted by most psychologists until within the last fifteen years or so. As a matter of fact, the two most eminent
psychologists of the English-speaking world, James Ward and William James, reject this parallelism and regard the possible influence of body on mind and mind on body as being y no means disproved, and indeed as be ng the most probable hypothesis to exp a n various psycho-physical phenomena. Similarly Prof- Haeckel's contention that science deals with causes and. is Indeed the only source-from which we can get any explanation of the -auses of things has been somewhat rude y disturbed by the views of Mach and Ostwald, Kirchhoff and Pearson, all eminent physicists, who are one in declaring that science can only give changes of configuration, rather than explain the causes of such changes. It is rather the modern view that science can only describe, but cannot explain.	.
Certainly the explanations wmch
Prof. Haeckel gives of the wonders of life answer more to descriptions than explanations. When he is aBked the blunt question:	"What is life?” he
described the typical organism, but does not for a moment profess 10 explain what is the real difference between that organism while alive and when it has suffered somatic death. Similarly, when he comes to the next wonder of life, sensation or the elements of mentality, he has a most ingenious scale of development from the sensation which he assumes that an atom has up to the highest flights of imagination of the poet and the thinker. Further on Prof. Haeckel entirely fails to substantiate any claim that he can treat from his scientific standpoint what he calls the value of life. Science, which deals only with the facts, has to accept all facts—good, bad, or indifferent. For instance, the criminal and the sage are each facts in the mental order, and science has no criterion for determining why one should be reprobated and the other admired. The world of values is outside the sphere of science. Here again Prof. Haeckel, the foremost exponent of modern science, is somewhat out of date in not recognizing a distinction which has been since Lotze a commonplace in modern philosophy. In fact, his incursions into the philosophic field strike one as being as amateurish as the excursions philosophers sometimes make into the world of biological science.
THE fact is that biological science I is not old enough or advanced | enough to give certain data to that science of sciences which men call philosophy. After all, in its modern form, biology is only fifty >ears old, and its fundamental principles have not yet been established so thoroughly as to form a firm basis for philosophical discussion. As we have seen, the work on which Haeckel's reputation is mainly founded is full of hypothesis and guesswork, and yet it is upon this foundation that he professes to instruct us as to the real meaning of the wonders of life. Theology in the past has been presumptuous enough to found a whole pseudo-science on its guesswork as to the relations of this and the other life. Science as represented by Prof. Haeckel is equally presumptuous in its claims to a solution
of the wonders of this life.
