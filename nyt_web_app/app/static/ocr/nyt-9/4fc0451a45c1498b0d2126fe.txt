PREVENTION OF RAILWAY ACCI
DENTS.
Reccm disastrous railway accidents in Germany will probably load to the general introduction and use of wireless telegraphy on all the State railways. Two years ago exhaustive practical experiments were commenced and continued until recently on the military railway leading from Berlin to Zossen. The telegraph stations -on the route were each fitted up with a transmitter and receiver, while the t rains were equipped' with the same apparatus. The ordinary telegraph wires along the track were also used to facilitate the work. The experiments proved conclusively that the dif-I ferent stations could at any time communicate with a train running at full speed and warn it of impending danger. The use oT wireless telegraphy in this connectiun would especially safeguard trains on one-track railways from danger. It is not expected that the expense of supplying stations and passenger trains with the necessary apparatus will be much bejund the budget allowed each year for the purpose of repairing old signals and introducing new appliances and inventions which have for their aim the protection of life and limb in railway travel.
