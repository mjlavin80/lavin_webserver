Lippincott Company. &1.2&,
THESE letters are addressed to a youthful *' Violet,M who, it appears, has begged the author out of her own storehouse of knowledge and experience to give her advice and counsel for guidance along life's pathway. Thus ad- ! jured, Lady Jephson discourses sweetly uid mildly on the art of attaining happiness for one’s self as well as others; on i the ethics of dress; on country house vis- j iting; on the choice ot literature; on the art of conversation, and the difference between wit and humor; on friendships with men; and how to establish sa- 1 Ions; on housekeeping; and lastly, on love’s young dream. Happiness, 1 says Lady Jephson, does not consist In j beauty, nor yet brains; neither is the old ; saw, " Be good and you will be happy,'* j always true—but cultivate charm, and one ; lias the hey to the door of happiness. And by charm Lady Jephson means goodhess and amiability, tactfulness, and resourcefulness, all kneaded into an agreeable whole. Above all, does the lady warn her youthful correspondent against the danger Cf smartness. The sharp tongue, she i thinks, is the worst of all evils—It is far worse than a gossipping one, (which Is Quite bad enough,) and will leave the young debutante who practices sarcasm ot her neighbors friendless and forlorn in | less than no time. At a country house party be unselfish; always be ready to | lend a helping hand to the harassed hostess. If the elderly lady among the i guests wishes to take a morning drive, be the gentle spirit who immediately offers to accompany her, even though you hkd more congenial plans. Thereby do you not only win the love of your hostess, but also her invitations '£or_next year’s party-There is an edifying fchapter on litera- l ture in which tho author commends tho reading of standard books In preference *, to the cheap romances of to-day. “It is safer." she says, " to give a child an abk*. if eoarse. book than a. foolish one. What is gross in * Tom Jones,’ * Amelfa,’
*	Tristram Shandy.' and ‘ Gulliver's Travels * is not* perceptible to the innocent mind of a child; whereas Squire .Weston, (sic,) Corporal Trim, Uncle Toby, and the Lilliputians remain lifelong and valuable possessions."	!
It is probable that if the young person , really does read ** Tom Jones,*' as recom- , i mended, she may learn to know Squire i Western even belter than her teacher, i whose acquaintance seems to be but a , ] passing one since she appears to have for- I gotten his name.	I
On the whoi<‘. however, the lady gives wholesome enough advice—albeit njost of It has been given to other debutantes i many times before. They are the good traits we all advise others to cultivate, 1 but which few of us foster in ourselves.
