“I would like to live to see this, but I shall not. I would also like to live to see a connection by a canal between the Danube and the Rhine. But this undertaking also Is so glffantlc that I doubt its execution. considering our limited means. And. finally. I-would like to see the English in possession of a canal of Suez. These three things I would like -to see done, and it would pay to plod on for another fifty years for their sake."

The inclosed passage, containing most interesting and, indeed, prophetic, utter- I rmees of Goethe, is translated from the | third part of Ecltermann's “Talks with Go»*the." The time Is a little over five years before tlie poet's death, although the third part of the “Talks" was not published before the end of 1&47, the date under the preface being Dec. 21 of that year. The passage is not marked with an asterisk, which means that it is based on Eckermann’s own notes or recollections, and not on Soret’s notes, of which he made liberal use in the third part.

with Goethe. He spoke much and admiringly about Alex. v. Humboldt, whose work about Cuba and Colombia he had begun to read, and whose view about the pro.iect of piercing the Isthmus of Panama seemed to be of a particular interest to him. “ Humboldt," said Goethe, " has Indicated with great keenness some other points where, by using some rivers that flow into the Mexican Gulf, one might perhaps accomplish one’s object more easily than at Panama. This is, however, all reserved to future times and enterprise. But so much is sure, a canal of such a kind that ships of any size could go through it from the Mexican Gulf to the Pacific Ocean would produce quite unmeasurable results for all civilized and uncivilized humanity. I should wonder if the United States should fall to get that undertaking into their hands. One can predict that this young commonwealth, with its decided western trend, will have j taken possession of and settled the great stretches of land on the other side of the Rocky Mountains in from thirty to forty years. One can also predict that on this entire coast of the Pacific Ocean, where nature has formed already the widest and safest harbors, there will eraduafly rise very important emporiums for a great traffic between the United States and China, together with India. In such a case it would not only be desirable, but almost necessary, that merchantmen as well as warships should keep up a quicker connection between the eastern and western coasts of North America than has so far been possible by the long, ugly, and 1 costly route around Cape Horn. I repeat, therefore, it is quite imperative for the
