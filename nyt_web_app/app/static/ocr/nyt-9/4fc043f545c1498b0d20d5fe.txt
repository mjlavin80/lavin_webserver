RATHER thinly dlsguisod as a novel, this book sets forth conditions In certain Southern States which affect tho black man and his * chances, as the author, a negro, sees them. The part of tho South selected is that In which tho system of contrast convict labor exists and is subject to more or less administrative abuse. Tbe author finds the abuse duo to the descendants of the overseer class, who have gained wealth by hook or crook, rather than to the descendants of the old stave owners. The trouble with the latter is that in spite of a kindly feeling toward the negro they are too supine to interfere.
Tho story tells of an ex-Confederate officer who came to New York as soon as the war was over and there grew rich and lost touch absolutely with his native State and village. ’Ill-health takes him South after twenty years, and seelns things with other eyes than those of his fellow-townsmen who have stayed Where they were, yet retaining a sentimental attachment to his old home, he settles tdown there for a time with a great deal of money, his motherless boy and a number of plans Iot the improvement of the place. He buys back his family home from the negro who has acquired It; he finds an old servant of the house, and a woman he has admired In his youth. He sets about getting justice for a worthless negro who has offended the local lowborn money lender and magnate, and so gets cordially hated by that rascal and the element he controls. He tries to build a cotton mill to be run ' without skilled labor—but he doesn't know how to adjust the niceties Involved in employing work* men of two colors. He proceeds upon theories and forgets facts. In short, with the best intentions In the world he makes a mess of things. Finally he shakes the dust of the place from his feet and .returns to the North, hopeless of overcoming the prejudices of that class of whites which Is in-political control, equally hopeless of any help from the other whites. .
