A new magazine called The Dickensian came into life in London with the beginning-of the new year. Its name relates to Charles Dickens and the publication is to be dp voted solely to that gTeat writer and his works. The word signifies a follower, Btudent or admirer of Dickens. It is a word for one painfully to contemplate, though not quite so bad as the word “ Dickensonian,” (having the same meaning,) which we have been occasionally compelled to eliminate from manuscript. Why not simply The Dickens Magazine? Mr. B. W. Matz, Secretary of the Dickens Fellowship is the editor of the new periodical, which will appear monthly and be sold for three-pence a copy. Mr. Percy Fitzgerald and Mr. Arthur Waugh are among its early contributors.
