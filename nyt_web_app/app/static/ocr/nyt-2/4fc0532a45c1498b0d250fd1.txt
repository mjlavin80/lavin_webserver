Being a leader of -The New \onK Times and Ks Book Review, it always gives pleasure to me in reading the correspondence and critical remarks on tlio Reader's Page, and on these later issues T have noticed with great interest the remarks on Dante’s ‘‘ Divina Commedia.*’ 1 also possess an Oxford edition of “ Tutte le Opere di Dante AligierL" As a beginner in the study of Dailte’S works it gave me much concern In notic--ing Mr. Charles H. Ward’s inference of Dante's self-praise on the two verses:
Tu so solo colui da enimi tolsi Lo boiJo stiJe o)je m’ba fat to onore— —and also his imputation to Dante’s l-'ciog.K's of being a. palpable imitntion of Virgil's.
Unfortunately. I have no Virgil's works, and therefore I would like to know if there is any evidence that Dante, at the lime ho wrote the first canto of the " Divina Commedia.” had already written his Eclogues on	imitation of Virgil,
and if really they are Imitations, for I am inclined to think that he did not need to imitate. In regard to the two verses above, I have seen Mr. F. W. Mitchell’s masterly answer, based on Fraticelii and Longfellow, but I am told that through his works (Dante’s works) there are other references' lo the beautiful style, which I failed to notice, and if by saying so he only referred lo his ** Vita Nova *’ and •* Canzoni ” as a license of saying queer things, or if he also meant the then new style of writing in the Italian language which was in its inception, as, I think is the case excluding from it the license of saying queer things or the allegation of
*	self-praise.
