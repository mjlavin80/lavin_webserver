Atcjc York Times Boat: Review:
In quoting two lines from Dante's “ Di-vlna Commedia/' Mr. Ward has had bad luck. The first line is so mangled by the types as to be unintelligible. In Bar-bera’s excellent Florentine edition, which I possess, the passage is as follows:
Tu se* solo colui, da cu’ io tolsi
Lo bello stile, che m’ha fatto onore.
Freely translated, “ From thee, and thee alone, I acquired that beautiful style which has done me so much honor.” As Mr. Ward i?ays, this sounds somewhat like self-praise. Written by a modern poet it would be characterized as conceit and bad taste. Dante, however, seems to have had a license to say all manner of queer things, and scattered through the M Divina Commedia ” there are many much harder to reconcile with modern Ideas than this.
Here Is Fraticelli’s comment:	"The
beautiful style which did honor to Dante was that used by him in the Sonetti and Canzoni.” This is nearly the same view as that quoted from Longfellow.
Dante’s great work contains over 14,000 lines. During the last hundred years every sentence and idea in it has been overhauled by an army of scholars. They have raked over every word and punctuation mark with a fine-toothed comb to discover hidden meanings and disputable passages—frequently with great success. The fact that nobody else seems to have noticed anything amiss about the two lines cited by Mr. Ward I Inferno, I., 80, 87) makes it reasonable to assume that Longfellow and Fraticelli's view is right.
