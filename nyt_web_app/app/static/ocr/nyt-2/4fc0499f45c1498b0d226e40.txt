; Hew Tork Times Book Review:	I
! If any one of the book building’ craft ' can give me a sensible, reasonable reason for deckel edges and uncut leaves In an Otherwise perfect piece of bookmaklng I shall be glad to hear it.
For many years I have been occasionally annoyed by this fad, that seems to ! have had Its origin in an exclusive snob* bery not wholly unknown in *' dear old Lunnon, dontcberknow," but I can see no valid reason why we should import the inconvenient, useless, and meretricious custom.
There can be no excuse for either deckel edge or uncut leaf. Both merely express to me, at least, the binder's unfinished work. The deckel edge has neither utility nor beauty to warrant it. On the contrary, the rough edges attract dust and microbes, besides being unfinished and unsightly, while the uncut leaf (what shall I say? It is impossible to do the ; subject justice) is a physical nuisance and | ' an abomination. Why, when I sit down j to read a handsome book that I was jus- j tified when I took it ud in believing to be j properly bound—why, I say, should I be ; °bi[ged to jump up an<3 hunt for a paper cutter at the fourth page, and so on to the end of the volume, jabbing at the pages as Mrs. Sid dons used to stab the potatoes? Our good cousins in England may have time to waste on this unnecessary mechanical exercise, but ’We are too busy on this side the water, and too impatient.
The height of absurdity, however, is reached when the publisher issues from his press a high-class edition de luxe of some favorite or standard work, printed In the higher style of the typographic art on hand-made, cream-laid paper, each page bearing its watermark, specially illustrated on Japan vellum, bound in silk and altogether sumptuous, but— with uncut leaves, defaced with hideous ragged edges on the bottom and side, With the top, forsooth, trimmed in the bindery as it should be, and gilded. Presumably the edge gilding of book leaves was designed to bring the leaves closer together and so exclude the dust when the'valuable volumes were on the shelves. For what earthly reason, then, do the publishers, as in this instance, gild and trim the top of the book and leave the side and bottom open for dust and Spiders?
Finish your binding before you put your wares on the book market.
