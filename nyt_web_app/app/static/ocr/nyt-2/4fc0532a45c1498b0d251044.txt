A'etr York Times Hook Review:
It Is with pleasure tempered with modesty that we find the editor of The Rochester Post-Express agreeing with us that the charm of *' Quits " is greater than that of " The Initials.” But then we feel regret, mingled with the satisfaction that the editor of The New York Times Book Review finds a greater attraction in ** The Initials." It is so monotonous to have everybody agree with one. Perhaps, too. the editor of The Book Review is just at " a ripe age for the judgment of sentimental fiction.” Mr. Howells is not. Our preference for the second book is because it has so much more in it than mere story. As Mr. O'Connor says, “ Common sense rather
than passion is Its ruling motive.*’ And the former is far more agreeable. We have always found such an attraction In " Quits" that we could not allow Mr. Howells’s assertion that it had not the " entire and perfect fascination " of “ The Initials *’ to pass unchallenged. We knew the danger of confronting such a practiced champion as Mr. Howells, but though no longer twenty-five, we have yet some of the daring of that blissful age. We confess that Hildegarde is attractive; we even like her ourself. She would never bore one—a blessing for which one can never be too grateful. She would, however, be somewhat in the nature of a whirlwind which leaves one stranded on the edge of uncertainty. That is, after her marriage to Hamilton, who would make the most saintly woman a sinner.
There would indeed be scenes of more tempestuous a nature than the ones they indulged in before that prosaic period. While we carnot believe in “ the perpetual charm of Hildegarde ” as Hamilton's
wife, she migrht. with a different type of man, become a joy forever—perhaps.
