Here the silver gieam of a. rising perch,* chub, or trout caught the eye; there a. pickerel lay rigid in the clear water, a fish carveU In stone; here eels colled in the nruddy bottom of some pool, and there, under the deep shadow of a rock, lay big-, sleepy bass, undisturbed by the rural

The Saco Ira Mrs.	New	Book.
In the first chapters/ of her new novel, 14 Rose o' the River,,j /in the March Century, Mrs, Kate Douglas Wlggin describes the River Saco, along which the scenes of the story are laid, and,. which flows by the author’s Summer home, Qulllcote, where the new book was written. Mrs. Wlggin writes:
And the river rolled on toward the sea. singing its morning song, creating and nourishing beauty at every step of Its onward path. Cradled in the heart of a great mountain range It pursued its gleaming way, here lying silent In grassy lakes, there rushing into tinkling little falls, foaming great falls, and thundering cataracts. Scores of bridges spanned its width, but no steacpers flurried its crystal depths. Here and there a rough little rowboat, tethered to a willow, rocked to and fro in some quiet bend of the shore.
