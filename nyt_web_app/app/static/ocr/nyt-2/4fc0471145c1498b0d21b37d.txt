The author of this book says that his apology for. presenting it is that none of the preceding translations reproduces the inetr'cal form of the original. His book certainly justifies itself, and stands in no need of any apology. Any work which tends to awaken interest In one of the great epic poems of the world should find recognition and welcome at a time when comparatively few readers are attracted by poetry.
The scholarly introduction deserves unqualified praise, and Is, indeed, quite a model of^vhat such a work ought to be.
' In thirty well considered pages the author gives a most comprehensive and Justly proportioned account of the history, character, and influence of the Nibelungenlied. He escapes the diffuseness into which such a theme might naturally tempt a writer, and shows a high degre^of ^temperate self-restraint.
The introduction is divided into two parts, the first treating of the Nibelun-gen Saga, the second of the Nibelungenlied; the first section has these subheadings; "Origin of the Saga," ■* The^ Northern Form of tne Saga,” ** The Saga as Preserved in the Nibelungenlied,”
“ Mythical Element and Historical Element.” The second part is thus sub-divided: ~The Manuscripts,” ” Stages in tirts Evolution of the Poem,” 41 Character of the Poem,*' “ Later Forms of the Saga," “ Poem and Saga in Modern Lit* erature,” Modern German Translations,’1 “ English Translations,” and Editions of the Nibelungenlied.” The author says:
Wagner £n his mustc-drama in three parts and prelude has followed in the main the Saga in its Northern form up to the death of Siegfried and Brunhild, but to the entire exclusion of the latter part of the story in which Atli (Etael) figures; his work has accordingly hardly any connection with the Nibelungenlied here offered in translation Only the pious loyalty of national sentiment can assign a high place in dramatic literature to Wagner1 s work with its intended imitation of the alliterative form of verse* while nis philosophizing gods and goddesses are also but decadent modem representatives of their rugged heathen originals.
Appreciative mention ts made of Carlyle's admirable essay upon the Nihelun-genlied. A fresh reading of that essay makes one wish that the author had seen fit to include it in his volume. It is in Carlyle’s best manner, and is quite free from the strange perversions of English which deformed so much of his later work. At first sight the versification is not attractive, but the liking for it will be found to grow with increasing familiarity. Exception might perhaps be taken to the liberal use of archaic words, such as *• eke,” “ ween,” “ hight,” mickle,'
“ wood,” (for mad,) &c.( but the author might reply that his work w;is not designed for readers who wouhl find such words obstacles, and that he could not expert such readers to buy hla book.
