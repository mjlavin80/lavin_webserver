the Indians, &t\, and discourse on the weather. In the first entry in the present volume, dated Aug. :M, 180r>, Lewis describes the dress of the Indians:
The mockersons of both sexes are usu-allv the same, and are made of deer Elk or buffaloe skin dressed without the hair.
*	*	•	they sometimes ornament their
mockersons with various figures wrought with the quills of the Porcupine, some of the dressey young men omiment the tops of their mockersons with the skins of polecats and trale the tail of that animal on the ground at their heels as they walk. I he robe of the woman is generally smaller than that of the man but is woarn in the same manner over the sholders. the Chemise is roomy and comes down below the middle of the leg the upper part of this garment is formed much like the shirt of the men except the sholder strap which is never used with the Chemise,
*	* * the sleeve underneath as low as tne eibow is open, that part being very full. * * * the breast us usually ornamented with various figures of party colours rought with the quills of the Porcupine. it is on this part of the garment that they appear to exert their'greatest ingenuity, a girdle of dressed leather confines the Chemise around the waist,
*	* • They seldom wear the beads they
possess about their necks. •	• * the
men and women were them suspen(ded) from the ear in little bunches or intermixed with triangular ,peices of the shells of the peri oister. • * *
