'Sew York Times Bool: Rericic:
I do not see that Mr. Spears In his last letter has added anything- to his side of the controversy concerning my strictures upon Gen. Custer. As to the case of Hull and the Constitution, how any one can draw a parallel between the action of a i naval Captain who, fearing that his ship will be detained In port and prevented from getting into action, sails without orders in the hope of falling in with the enemj’’s ship, and that of a soldier in command of a part of a force which is organizc-d specifically to fight Indians, who. in his eagerness to get into action before any one else, deliberately disobeys his orders, breaks up the plan of the commanding officer, and sustains a disastrous defeat, I fail to see. In omitting the name of Admiral Bell I simply followed Mr. Spears’s lead. Did he omit the name of the Admiral from his five-volume history to save space*? Besides, Admiral Boll to the contrary notwithstanding, I still refuse to believe that Hull would have been hanged or shot for sailing without orders if he had lost his ship in action. But even if he^Jjad been so punished, the case is not disobedience of orders, i It is Idle to compare Farragut’s independent operation against New Orleans and its defenses with Custer’s movements 1 on the ground that both were subordinate parts of a general plan. In no sense was Farragut’s movement a subordinate l part of a general plan, as Custer's was,
■	As to my alleged misapprehension of !
I the effect of the loss of the Tecumseh at i the battle of Mobile Bay, I can only call 1 attention to Farragut's own words and to uianv published accounts, in which m> contention is fully borne out. As, for in-1 stance, where Commodore Foxhall A. Parker, who has written perhaps the best account extant of Mobile Bay, uses the following language: “ Appalled at the disaster to the Tecumseh, the Brooklyn stopped ’* See also " Battles and Leaders . of the Civil War," Page 3SS; also Maclay, j Vol. IT.. Page 470.	;
Furthermore, there is another phase to the movement of the Tecumseh well brought out by Farragut's words cited last week. That Is this: Even if Craven’s movement had not resulted in the loss of his ship, it forced the remaining vessels of the fleet so far to port—the left— in order to pass her, that they were all subjected tu the dangers of the toi^edo line, and that the torpedoes proved Innocuous save in the case of his own ship, does not alter the facts. Had the torpedoes been in working order, Craven’s action would have lost the battle of Mobile Bay. Whereas, had Farragut’s orders been carried out. the ships would have *■ gone inside the buoy marking the fair way, and none of them would have been lost. It is preposterous to urge that the stoppage of the Brooklyn was independ- 1 ent of the loss of the Tecumseh, for If , the Tecumseh had gone inside, as ordered, the Brooklyn would have followed, and no torpedoes would have been encountered by either vessel!
