Andrew D- White.
March 18 is authoritatively announced by the Century Company as the date of issue of Andrew D. White’s diplomatic autobiography. Few men have had such a largo amount of material for a valuable autobiographical record. Just through col* lege, Mr. White went to St. Petersburg as an a£tach6 of the American Legation. He was a State Senator from 1864 to 1867. He was President of Cornell University from Its inception for twenty years, and his work in advancing the cause of American education is acknowledged as beyond all estimate. He was one of the Commissioners to Santo Domingo in 1871 and a Commissioner to the Paris Exposition in 1878. He was Minister to Germany in 1S79-1SS1, and to Russia in 1S92-1894. He was a member of the Venezuelan Boundary Commission and Ambassador to Germany from ISO7 to 1003. He was President of the American delegation at The Hague Peace Conference. And, in spite of the many demands on his time, he
wrote on political and historical subjects.
