I	This book is addressed, as its subtitle , Indicates, to young: women, and to those : most of all who hy breeding: and educa-| tlon are entitled—If they prefer it—to be | called young: ladies:
That our daughters may be as cornerstones, polished after the similitude of a palace.
The name of its author, Mrs. Burrill, is to us new, but her book will readily sug-. gest comparison with some of the works j wblch Elia has taught us to call " Great i Nature’s Stereotypes." There is in it i what that master himslf would have been likely to approve. It is characterized by that personal note of which he is in | the English tongue the great exemplar, and nowhere more than in this is its ! author so piquant or convincing. For instance: “Are we ashamed of work? We ' must be, or why do people apologize for j opening their front-door? It is their own ' door, and they are quite at liberty to open ! It or bang it in my face, as they feel inclined. Who cares one straw if the j cook has gon^to see a sick aunt and the ! parlor-maid Is away for a holiday? I do [ not see the use of keeping a dog and bark' tog myself, so I do not persistently open the front door; but I should not apologize even If I found a Bishop or a publisher on the doorstep.1*
The ethical purpose of the book and Its pleadings for sweeter manners are sufficiently plain, and are handled so wittily, with such lurking fun and brimming humor, that their assimilation Is an easy and pleasant process. Its author has read widely and sets her pages with gems from far and near, fitting them to her own merry manner “ like apples of gold In pictures of silver.’' She knows what the current thought among women is, and writes up to it. She takes instances from the hooks of the day of which people talk. It Is so distinctly up-to-date that it might have been written after the issue of this morning's Times.
The pace is sometimes so rapid that in the reading wo have here and there expected a catastrophe—which never occurs; and though there is so much movement in Its pages it never outsports discretion, but ever and anon come notes of deeper wisdom and more tender thought, which steady the mind and invest her theory of life with the beauty of an ardent hopefulness. As a gospel of goodness It Is eminently reasonable, and its style has the charm of unconsciousness. In its first chapter entitled " The Garden of Friendship,” and in those that follow, it discourses on the essential relations of the modern woman, and in the most natural manner reaches its close in a chapter on Garrick's remark that A Good Woman is an Understudy for an Angel.”
