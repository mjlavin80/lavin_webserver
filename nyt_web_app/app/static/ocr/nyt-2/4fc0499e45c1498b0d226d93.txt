FROM R'EADE'RS*
She Does Not Like “ Alice.”

I am so glad that at last a real child has been heard trom regarding the true value of that book known as " Alice In Wonderland.” In my own childhood it was repudiated by my brother and myself as an Imposture. But then we were great critics! We refused to be beguiled into thinking of any wild book for children as a fairy book unless there were really a true fairy in the story, and we were very particular that our fairies should be the genuine thing. Our elders were much more easily satisfied with the books they gave us at Christmas time than we were.
I remember how my brother gave his judgment one day on reading Grimm. *' After all,” he said, oracularly, “ though these are. fine tales, they ought not to be called fairy 3torles. To my way of thinking ‘ John Dietrich ' is the only real fairy tale in the whole book, because it is the only one that has real little fairies In it.” As a matter of fact, he was correct, because these are recognized now as folklore tales.
In order to give “ Alice ” a chance to set herself straiglit in my mind, wliile I was
in London I went to see the play founded upon the books. It was even then to me a piece of Insanity, though it tvas enjoyed by others who had acquired a fondness for (he March hare and the mad hatter. But to me it was like the Ravings of John McCullough," on the phonograph—brilliant, but upsetting to the intellect. The ethics in " Aiice " are distinctly bad to an immature mind, though they may sound funny to the elders. The Rev. Mr. Dodg-son, the author, was himself very eccentric, and not at all a normal tqan. For my
part I think, even now. that Thackerayls
“Rose and Ring” eclipses these ravings of Dodgson so absolutely that there Is no comparison between them. For humor and healthy enjoyment, Thackeray's “ Christmas Pantomimer* surpasses any of them. I have just sent three copies of this charming tale to my little nieces in California. And their parents write me that they are enjoying the battles of Prince Giglio and Prince Bulbo over a^ain, as in the days of yore.
