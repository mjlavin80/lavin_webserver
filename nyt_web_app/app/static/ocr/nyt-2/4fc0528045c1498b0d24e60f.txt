| Harper & Brothers have been asked by Ay ad A, Ghazuli, an Egyptian engaged In work In the medical department of the University of Cincinnati, to allow the translation of the late <?en. Lew Wallace’s “ Ben-Hur *’ into Arabic. Mr. Ghazuli thinks the story would be useful in the work of the Egyptian Christian Church. He has already translated into Arabic a work of so different a character as Spencer’s ** History of Philosophy.”
