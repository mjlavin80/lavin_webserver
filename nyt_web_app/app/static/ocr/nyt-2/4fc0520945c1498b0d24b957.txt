OMETHING over a year ago appeared Mr. Dobson's monograph o»-^-Fanny Burney in the English Men of Letters Series. It had the customary quiet distinction of manner, the paucity of generalization, the ordered abundance of detail, the clearness and simplicity which have made this writer one of the most satisfying of commentators upon eighteenth century life and literature. No one certainly could have been better qualified to stand sponsor for a final version of the Fanny Burney—or, as they have unluckily come to be, called, Mme. D'Arblay—"Diary and Letters.'1 There has been special need for a carefully made edition. There has, so far as we know, been no rell* able American edition. The last version was “ revised ” or abridged to considerably less than half its original bulk; and there was no indication in text or notes to suggest how much had tbeen cut out, or where or why the excisions had been made. Mr. Dobson here presents a reprint of the first impression of the first editiont ^(18*42.) Two impressions were made in that year, the second of which was strangely incomplete. Considerable abridgment had been made in the text of the first two of the seven volumes. There was nothing in the title page to indicate the fact of these changes; and there Is no internal or other evidence to suggest upon what principle they had been undertaken. In reprinting the complete version, Mr. Dobson has indicated by brackets the passages omitted In the later impression. As either of the 1842 versions Is likely to be picked up,in book shops, the existence of this reliable collated text should be a permanent safeguard to book buyers. The matter is otherwise of impor-ance because it concerns the early volumes, which contain altogether " the cream of the correspondence.*'
Mr. Dobson’s preface Is hardly more than a note stating the character and occasion of the republication. He felt probably that his recent monograph had left him small occasion for further commentary. Miss Barrett's original introduction is allowed to stand by itself as a critical summary of the novelist's life and work. The footnotes are precisely what one must desire for such a text; not offering so much minute collateral information as we find, for instance, in Birkbeck-Hill*s " Boswell," but offering quite enough for the purpose of the general reader. Some interesting supplementary matter is to be found in the appendixes.
Macaulay, In nominally reviewing the first edl~ tion of the '* Diary and Letters," appears hardly to realize their intrinsic importance. His mind is preoccupied with the tradition of a Mme. D’Arblay, author of a single famous novel; and with his own theory of* her failure in later work to approach the quality of that maiden success. Dr, Johnson he conceives to be responsible for her decline; and upon that theory builds an elaborate paradox, using the novels ** Evelina" and “ Cecilia ” for purposes of Illustration. OJhe result is, as usual, rather brilliant than sound. " Evelina ” itself does not, after the passage of a hundred and twenty years, rank among the great novels. The “Diary and Letters/* put forth sixty years ago, have gained and held a place among masterpieces in that kind. In some respects, to be sure, there was a greater gap between Macaulay and Dr. Johnson than between Macaulay and ourselves. " Evelina " appeared in the stone age of English fiction. In the polite circles of the day, not very large circles. It was a portent unparalleled; a novel of contemporary manners which was actually not Indecent, the work of a wit who was also a young person. It Is amusing to note, when, on the Ul-advised advice of her friends, the young Fanny attempted a comedy, the skepticism of so wise a mentor as her “ Daddy Crisp” as to whether a young person could possibly expect to produce' a good comedy: " I need not observe to you/' he says cautiously, 11 that In most of our successful comedies there are frequent lively freedoms (and wagger-les that cannot be called licentious, neither) that give a strange animation and vigour to the style, and of which if it were to be deprived it would lose > • .

As to the merits, of/' Evelina/* there, were no doubts in the mind of its first-audience. Dr. Johnson pronounced it better than Fielding, who with a characteristically elephantine naivet£ he declared to be superficial. The novel became the rage, and for lack of competition held„its supremacy for a considerable number of years. It is dead now, unless as it lives in the memory of students of that period; or, a better claim to remembrance, as^it lives in tho pages of the immortal ary/* That rccord without “ Kvelina would be the play without the Prince. It is for those early entries, those bursts of girlish confidence, that engaging sense of guilt in being an authoress, those innocent qualms and subterfuges, that delicious torture of being flattered by a Mrs. Thrale* a Burke, a Johnson; it is for these things that we give the “ Diary ” a place of honor among thumbable volumes on our shelves. Little Burney/1 not the wife of the French exile, is the beloved writer. AVe arc glad of the account of her expe--riences in the royal household, of which Macaulay seems to have given too gloomy a p*cture. We are glad to see her safely out of that artificial life and happily married to a good man. But tbe Fanny Burney of our affection seems to belong to Dr, Johnson, and it was a more con\ en-tJonal person who survived him.
There ?s a superficial oddness in the fact that diaries, dealing as they do with the most ephemeral and trivially personal themes, are less likely to grow, antiquated than more impersonal and sophisticated forms of literature. But human nature is not gauged by questions of fashion, and is most directly expressed, outside of poetry, by the intimate manner of the diarist, the letter writer, the autobiographer. ** Evelina/* though put forth anonymously, was written for the world; but the “ Diary " seems to have been quite honestly a. word of intimacy.- "'To Nobody," she says in her girlish introduction, “ to Nobody, then, will I write my journal,, since to Nobody can I be wholly unreserved, to Nobody can I reveal every thought, every wish of my heart, with the most .unlimited confidence, the most unremitting sincerity, to the end of my life: " The bounds of absolute privacy are subsequently crossed without undue remorse, and the entries become really a series of letters to the favorite sister. By that time the diarist has begun to use her medium pretty consciously for literary compoFition. The incidents of a given day have been, she says repeatedly, pleasant, but "not writable”; by which she evidently means that nothing has happened to afford material for her peculiar talent. That talent was for satirical description. The journal is a gallery of odd worthies taken from the life. First in :mportance, of course, is Dr. Johnson, though Fanny's reverence and affection for the great man lead her to soften his outline anti only to hint at his most grotesque aspects. He was, moreover, the. m.ist ardent of all the ardent admirers of her work: it is a marvel that between him and Mrs. Thrale this young creature managed to retain any sense of the relative value of things.
" Ay, Miss Burney/’ said Mrs. Thrale in an early interview, " the Holborn beau is Dr. Johnson's favorite; and we have all your characters by heart, from Mr. Smith j up to Lady Louisa.”	;
“ Oh, Mr. Smith, Mr. Smith is the men! ’* cried he, laughing violently.
" Harry Fielding never drew so good a character! Such a fine varnish of low politeness!— such a struggle to appear a gentleman’. Madam, there is no character better drawn anywhere—in any book, or bv any author.”	,
I almost poked myself under the table. 1 N^ver did I feel so delicious a confusion | since I was born!	i
Mrs. Thrnl**, though IJiss Burney and Johnson arc always expressing their admiration of her, (till she marries the " fid- ; dlei\”) does not nako a brilliant showing j in conversation. She has a kind of complacent insipidity which is rather irritating, and of which, curiously enough, the critical youug Fanny seems unaware. It is in the portraits of Mr. Rose Fuller, with his smirk and his " that sort of way of Sophy Streatfield, the belle with that uncanny lachrymal control, and. above all. of the unidentified but immortal " Mr. B—y,” (whose name 01 fragment of name should certair/ty appear, as it does not, in the index,) that we find our masterpieces. “ Mr. B—y ” is a. comic character certainly superior to most of the inventions of stage Comedy,
_ " *1 never/ he says ‘go to a tragedy— -it's too affecting; tragedy enough in real life-/tragedies are only fit for fair females;

The second of. these two volumes ^brings us well into-the- midst of Miss Bumey^s experience of • thc sufficiently paltry Court" life. She is not at-her-best in the rOle qt adoring subject., With the second marriage of Mrs.. Thrale- and the' death -of Dr. Johnson, the girlish vivacity-and .buoyancy quickly ebb. Her hope of exceeding or equaling that first performance seems *to have left her some 'time earlier After the condemnation of "The 'Wittings ’* she wrote to her father, “ What my Daddy CriSp says, * that it would bei the-best policy, but for pecuniary advantages, for me to write no more,’ is exactly what I have always thought since ‘Evelina* was published.” But ** Evelina ” and the-journal to which it gave life were enough; for their sake we may best ignore the later deterioration of the writer’s mattei" and manner. ■ Mme. d’Arblay was for literature a lamentable old woman. 11 Little Burney ” is to be none the less a. source of permanent delight -to lovers 'Of intimate literature.
