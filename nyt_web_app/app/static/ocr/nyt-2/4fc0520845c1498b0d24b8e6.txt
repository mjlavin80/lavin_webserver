It is agreeable to note that the literary tradition associated with the American Ambassadorship to London has been kept alive, in the minds of English- ! men, by our retiring Ambassador, Mr. Choate. An advocate, who has nev*tr published a book, excepting his collected addresses, he is accounted there one of the same line as Bancroft, Motley, Lowell, and Hay. The same thing was	true	of	Mr*	Phelps
and Mr. Bayard, two of	Mr.	Choate’s	prede-
cessors. They were not men of letters, but their speeches were often, like his, of a charming literary quality. Mr. Whitelaw Reid, of course, will be welcomed in London, Mr. Lowell was by Queen Victoria, " not only as the representative of the great Republic of the West, but as a representative of the great Republic of Letters/’ Mr. James Milne contributes to The Book Monthly of London an article entitled " Ambassadors of Letters,** In which he bespeaks a cordial reception for Mr. Reid and writes pleasantly of Mr. Lowell, Mr.	Hay,	and	also	of Mr.
Choate, if not as a " man of letters,” yet	as a	" liter-
ary man.’*
