'The Conquest of Mexico.
Cyrus Townsend Brady, in his new book " The Conquest of the Southwest,” which
D.	Appleton & Co. will publish this month gives some war statistics. Speaking of the conquest of Mexico, he says;
We paid about $180 for each square mile of territory, or $32 for each member of the population to-day. It will be safe to * call it $170,000,000 in all. * * * Suppose, convinced that we must have this (Mexican) territory to round out and complete our National domain, that we had gone to
Mexico and offered her $25,000,000, ?50,-000,000, $75,000,000, or even £100,000,000? We would have been greatly the gainer from tl financial point of view, even if she had demanded the highest figure.
