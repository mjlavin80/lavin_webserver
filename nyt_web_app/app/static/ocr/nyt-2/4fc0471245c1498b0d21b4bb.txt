JWir Yorl: Timts Book Rtrieu::
Having read two or more loiters in Thb n!,w York Times book Review referring to the source from which Longte low obtained his story Of “ Evangeline. I would like to give, jls nearly as I nan recall it after thirty years have passed, an account Of it that I heard from Judge
Edouard Simon of St. ^a^l"svl* h 1.,
St Martin's on the banks of the Teche. While Judge Simon was a law student at Harvard and Longfellow was a professor in the college, they met at dinner, and there was present another literary man of note, but I do not remember who he was. Young Simon spoke of the expulsion of the Acadians from Nova Scotia and the settlement ot large numbers of them among the creoles in Louisiana. At first it seemed probable that the other man of letters would make use Of the suggestion, but as he failed to do so Longfellow wrote to young Simon, who had returned to his home. Tor a description Of the country where the Acadians
had settled.	.	..
The description in “ Rvangehne of the '* Eden of Louisiana * could only have come from one who know it well, and fg^* besides those who Ii\ed there knew anything of the region.
Judge Simon's mother was a creole. His father, a native of Belgium, was Judge of the Supreme Court of Louisiana.
The descendants of the Acadians are now the small farmers or “ poor whites ” of the region where they live and arc known as Cajuns or Cadeans. They still speak the Norman French, or *' gumbo French,” as it is locally called, and few of them can read or write. The women : still spin and weave and indeed do nearly all of the hard work, while the men ride about the country’ on their small horses. The creoles of Louisiana are the wealthy ' and cultured class of French descent, and claim to be of the best blood of France.
