J. Parmly Paret’s Interesting History :	of the Development of the “
■_	.	Modem	Garnet
* JK^^glAWN TENNIS., as played to'	1	^kUSI day,-Is decidedly a modern
‘ 1 eame* ** *s true ^at t^ie :	S	gS|2|sfi ginhings of the game had
-■* 1 ‘	their origin many years ago,
hut so crude were those
early methods as contrasted
. 'with the lawn tennis of the present that
the author of this latest and very enter-
tairiing work upon the history and prin-
•	cipfea of the sport dismisses them In
-	few words, tri early days when French
■	royalty amused Itself with the racket and ball in the open Air. this amusement was called “ 1st longue paurae/' It was
. the natural outgrowth of court tennis ' and from the fact that the word “ tenez,#r
•	. signifying “ play,** was cried by the ' feeder as he prepared to strike the ball,
the’new term, tennis, was coined for the ’ English language, and for years the open-air game was referred to as ** long tennis.”
Major Walter C. Wingfield of the Brlt-
-	leh Army, however, appears as the true inventor of the game as we know It today. In 1873 he introduced many of the
■	essential features that have since been characteristic of the sport. He gave it the! uncouth name of “ sphairistike." a
•	compound Greek word meaning “ hall ' play."’ Fortunately, this name‘has been
forgotten. Lawn tennis at once entered ‘upon a wonderful career of popularity*
_ and', with the exception of cricket and golf. It is probably played by more persons throughout the United Kingdom than can be said of any other sport.
In England* Ireland, and the United States lawn tennis has achieved its greatest success. Indeed, America and Great Britain have been strong rivals for. tennis supremacy ever since 1883, when the Ciark brothers, by their visit to England, instituted the series of international competitions. In 1900, by the offer of the silver challenge bowl by Dwight F. Davis of St. Louis, these international meets received the official sanction of the two great tennis associations of both countries, and the trophy •was recognized on both sides of the Atlantic as emblematic of the world's championship. There have been three competitions for this trophy, 'our own players winning twice, but in 3iV03 the Doherty brothers succeeded in taking the cup to England, and there it will remain until an American team goes across the water to recapture it.
Mr. Paret, who knows the conditions of play in this country and abroad equally well, gives high praise unhesitatingly to the English for ther management of competitions as well as for their system of handicapping. This is due to the employment of professional referees and ban dicappers. These men devote their entire attention to the details of the sport. The policy in this country has thus far been opposed to the liiring of tennis officials, but the success attained abroad ha^ caused the critics here to look with more favor upon the plan, and it may be adopted in the near future. The big English tournaments are much better patronized than is the case with prominent events here.
On the Continent the game has grown «lowJy. but under the influence of English arid American residents and tourists many excellent tennis courts are to be found along the Riviera, while Germany, France. Italy. Switzerland, and Austria all hold national championships. Tn Germany the finest courts are at Homburg, where the big events are always held. The German Emperor is a keen lover of ihe gitmc, and lo Ms interest is due the : increasing popularity of tennis among the j Germans wit Inn rccent years. At Berlin the Kniser has a special court for the us** of himself and his iamily. Australia , rapidly bocomin? a groat lawn tennis rc.jlrf*. and in New Zealand -her*- are many clubs. Indeed, like &olf, the prog-j ess «if ihe gime can be traced throughout the English colonies, although the exces-.-n\e hc;u of India has ronfined it to a few ’oca lilies in that country. While Mr. l\tr«*t’s pl:itom*nt tlmt lawn tennis rn.i\ '^e taught nearly well by written iiistruction as by p« isonal direction may be s< rh*usly tjuestinned, his remarks on th«' *--trr*uigy of the gam*' and the physical tnumntf i<*r hi;: matches are full of eom-in'Mi s»*nse and instruction that apply ntually well to other forms of exercise, (tn.- <s iold what to oat and drink, how
lo	breathe, and how to prevent blistered hands and	whkh.	to	a	ienni?	player,
are f.ilal. Al'-fThol is prohibited, but coffee, ua, and chocolate may be used mod-eryftly. The English habit of drinking hoi t< a between matches is approved, as the hot liquid acts as a mild stimulant, and does not chill the stomach. Instead of resorting so freely to iced drinks American players are recommended to io as the English do.
