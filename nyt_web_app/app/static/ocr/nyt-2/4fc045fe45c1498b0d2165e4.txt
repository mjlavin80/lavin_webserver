THOMAS MOORE.
STEPHEN GWYNN'S NEW BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR OF “LALLA ROOKH" AND THE "IRISH MELODIES.** *
'Written for The New York Times Book Review by HORATIO SHEAFE KRANS,
Author of “ William Butler Yeats and the Irish Literary Revival/’
ITICISM has ^ taken the measure of Thomas Moore and his work, and the time has now long^ been ripe for the appearance of a volume which should aim,
___________ as does this of Mr. Gwynn's, to make a
brief sketch of the life and a concise and B comprehensive estimate of the character and achievements of the man who shared with Byron the honor of being the most popular poet of his day. Mr. Gwynn, already known as a novelist and as a critic of English and of English-Irish literature, is himself an Irishman, and In writing Moore’s life he undertook a task for which he was well equipped. It will be convenient, in speaking of the latest addition to the English Men of Letters Series, to consider it first as a biography, then as a literary estimate.
There is no more striking incident in English literary history than Moore’s almost instantaneous rise to fame and favor in the great world of English rank and fashion. In 17f)D, when twenty years of ag’e, he left his native city, Dublin, to study law in London, carrying with him in manuscript his translation of the odes of Anacreon. His parents and kinsfolk were people in a small way of life—his father a grocer, his mother the daughter of a provision merchant. Shortly after his arrival in London an influential friend whom he had known in Dublin presented him to Lord Moira. This acquaintance growing rapidly to friendship, Lord Moira in turn introduced the young poet, then about to bring out his Anacreon, to the Prince of Wales. Moore was soon in high favor with his Royal Highness, and begged to be permitted to dedicate his translation to him. The Prince, as Moore reports him, replied In the most honorific terms, granting the request and declaring that " the honor was entirely his In being allowed to put his name to a work of so much merit.'" The Prince's favor launched Moore in London society, and within a year he had established himself firmly as one of its prime favorites. His successes were far from inexplicable. Moore was a kind of modern troubadour of the courtly circles in which he moved, composing poetry and singing it to his own accompaniment in a. way that did not fail to charm the most critical hearers. More than this, he was possessed of an agreeable presence, an infectious fjayety, a copious wit, and in gen,
eral of extraordinary social gifts. And he had a talent for poetry of a kind that exactly hit the taste ot his public. Almost from the moment he set foot in London this son of an humble Dublin tradesman had his choice of all that was most brilliant in English social life. The doors of the best bouses swung open to him, and he became the pet of London drawing rooms; Princesses sang his songs, and peeresses wept and languished over them. Great men welcomed him, even courted him, and esteemed him as a valued friend. Bowood and Holland Souse were the best things of their kind that England has produced, and fa both houses Moore was perfectly at home.
Moore’s intimates throughout his life were to be people set on a pinnacle. Of his friendships with great or famous men, that with Byron is the most notable.
The passages in Moore's letters and in his journal that tell of his and Byron’s frequent meetings, their conversations, and joint festivities, make interesting reading, and upon tbe relations of the two poets Mr. Gwynn properly enlarges at some length. Byron and Moore, at the time when their friendship was closest. ha* much in common and were naturally drawn together. Both, were poets; both were plunging for amusement into London society; each was at this time in his period of dandyism, and both were members of Watier’s, the dandies' club par excellence. Nothing in the way of gayety seems to have escaped the two companions- They might be seen together at the most fashionable assemblies, or, In the smalt hours, cupping upon lobsters and brandy and water at Steven’s, in Bond Street.
The story of Moore’s life Is largely interesting for the light It throws upon the tone and temper of society in the first third of the last century, and because of the people of distinction with whom it makes us acquainted. Mr. Gwynn has not been greatly sue* ceesfut In lending that kind Interest to his biog-

raphy. He has not succeeded in reviving for the imagination the social world In which Moore lived, or In Bhowing how completely he became identified with It A more conspicuous shortcoming of this volume is Its failure to establish any sort of vital relationship between Moore and the literary society of his day. One would gladly hear more of his literary sympathies and antipathies, and know who among his brother poets and breihren of the pen were his congenial friends and associates. Of matters of this nature the present biography has strangely little to say.	^
If Mr. Gwynn has not well succeeded with what may be called the stage setting of his piece, it must at least be allowed that he has a firm grasp of the character of his protagonist, and makes him live for his audience* In Moore there was much that was admirable as well as amiable. His Immense success in London did not dazzle nor spoil him. His devotion to his parents never swerved. Of the little grocery business in Publin, which seems never to have been a hindrance to him in society, he was not in tbe least ashamed. There was an extraordinary persona] charm about him that attached people to him wherever be showed his face. Two men whom be challenged to mortal combat, Jeffrey and Byron—with the former he actually exchanged shots— became his devoted friends. His agree* ability was irresistible. He had a happy faculty of giving real pleasure to all sorts of people, and they reciprocated by treating him as though he had actually conferred obligations upon them. His beautiful and lovable wife, who had no taste for the brilliant gayeties in which her husband delighted to move, and who was con-^ tent to remain at home, keep down expenses, and care for the babies as they came, one after another—there were five of them in all—he loved with an affection that grew wanner, if that were possible, with the years. The passages in the journal and in the letters that give expression to the devotion of this most happy couple are delightful to read and pleasant in the memory. They breathe a sweetness and tenderness, a purity of sentiment, and a depth of feeling that Moore has only at the rarest moments been able to put into his verge.
Moore’s fine and solid qualities are not summed up when it is said that he was a dutiful son and a loving husband. He made many sacrifices to retain his independence and his dignity as a poet. In all things he was constant to the point of honor. In money matters he was scrupulously careful. He lived in a gay set, and lived freely, and as a consequence, though
the publishers paid handsome sums for his work—£3,000 for " Lalla Rookh,'’ for example—he was continually in financial straits. Yet when hard pressed he almost uniformly refused to accept loans from friends, preferring to supply his needs by advances obtained from his publishers upon promises to supply them with poems or jeux d'esprit. His conduct in the dispute over the publication of the Byron “Memoirs” is an instance of this delicacy in money matters—a delicacy, by the way, that honorably distinguishes him from some of his greater contemporaries in the world of letters who were content to remain the pensioners of their friend and the public in general.
By burning the " Memoirs ” Moore deliberately incurred a ruinous debt of £2,000 purely for the satisfaction of playing a magnanimous part in the transaction and making it impossible for any one to say that he acted from mercenary motives.
Mr. Gwynn’s critical estimate of Moore's work is-at least so far as it is concerned with the intrinsic merits of that work, and with its place in English literature—adequate and admirable. All the best of Moore’s poetry, excepting onjy the society verse and light satire, Is amatory or patriotic. In his first two volumes, " Anacreon " and " The Poetical Works of the late Thomas Little,” he is seen at once as the amatory poet, the poet of dalliance rather than of passion. In the " Irish Melodies," where Moore reached his high-water mark, he appears as the poet of patriotism. The songs included in the “ Melodies," warmed by deep feeling and lit up as they often are by genuine fire and passion, contain the only things of Moore’s — such lyrics as "The Irish Peasant to His Mistress ” and “ At the Mid-hour of Night" among them-that can measure up to a high and exacting critical standard. Of the strange, high notes of poetry Moore has very few, and of the strangest and highest none at all. This was recognized by the best Judges
even in the heyday of Moore’s fame; and, a3 the more impassioned muses of Shelley* Keats, and Wordsworth gained the public ear, a fashion set in of regarding Moore as a mere melodious trifler. Such an estimate Is as unjust as the praise of this poet in the first quarter of the last century was extravagant, and Mr. Gwynn is right In maintaining that to-day depre-ciatlon has gone too far. Among Moore's eongs there are dozens, nay scores of charmingly melodious things, admirably set to music, and delightful in themselves as said, not su.-g. And what is more, there is a very considerable number of poems which it would be absurd to call mere trifles. “ I saw from the beaefc *’ is
#*■ . ■ ’ * not a trifle, nor " When in death t shall calm recline,” nor 11 Tell me, kind fiftge, I pray thee,” nor many another.
Whatever one may think of Moore as a poet, It must at least be conceded that as an artist in verse he bolds a most Important place in the development of English poetry. And upon Moore’s part in ; the extraordinary advance In poetical j technique, which was characteristic of ' the last century, Mr. Gwynn dwells very | emphatically in his last chapter and elseWhere. It is a far cry from Cowper to Swinburne, and Moore, by bringing into verse a variety and multiplicity of musical rhythms, did good service in bridging the gap between them.
Moore’s long romantic poems, *' Lalla Rookh,f and " The Loves of the Angels," have long since gone to a poetic limto from which they ate never likely to emerge. Florid in style and sugared In sentiment, they will be remembered only as examples of an extinct taste. The vigor and freshness, the romantic Imagination, the weight of personality, that a Scott or a Byron brought to his narrative poetry were qualities Moore did not share, and he vainly hoped that elaborate finish, profusion of ornament, and novelty of subject might atone for whatever else was wanting. Moore himself set no great store by his long poems. His own Judgment as to the relative merits of the 4t Melodies ** and “ Lalla ” has been finally indorsed by criticism. "In a race to future times, (if anything of mine can pretend to such a run,’’) Moore wrote to Longman, “ those little ponies, the * Melodies,’ will beat the mare ' Lalla * hollow.”	‘
Along the poetic pathway that has for landmarks the “ Anacreon,’* the " Irish Melodies,” "Lalla Rookh/’ and “The Loves of the Angels,'* Moore scattered at intervals slender volumes of light verse, which served now and again to fill his empty purse, and were, besides, of a quality that entitles them to be ranked among the best things of their kind in the language. The ** Two Penny Post Bag ” and the " Fables for the Holy Alliance," brilliant examples of social and political satire, are perhaps the best. of these volumes. What, indeed, could be better in Its way than the ridicule of the Prince Regent, his foibles and defects, his fatness, his huge whiskers, and Ks inordinate love for claret, cu'.lsta, and his old mistresses? And not less excellent In their kind are tbe verses in which English religious and political intolerance j toward Ireland are attacked with the lightest and keenest, If not with the most dangerous, of weapons,	1
" Moore’s Importance in the history of literature,” Mr. Gwynn says, “lies not in his connection wfth English, but with | Irish literature.'1 That way, no doubt, Moore’s chief Importance lies. He was Indisputably the national poet of his day, and his influence Is clearly traceablc In the poetry—lik.e Moore’s in its declamatory tone and exuberance <«' fvnJ^ient— which the Young Irelandera pr<»d»5c*jd t-o profusely in the forties of tne century. Moore’s importance in Irish literature being what it is, Mr. Gwynn would surely not have gone amiss in giving us something more nearly approaching a philosophical consideration of his relation to both the Young Ireland literary movement and the present Irish literary revival than the observations he offers us here and there in his volume. And, further, one would Wish, more information ! as to the traces of Celtic influence in Moore’s poetry, and some comment upon the fact that the distinctive Celtic qualities are strangelv and conspicuously absent from the bulk of it. The Irish literary revival of to-day finds its motive ( power In a desire to embody in artistic form all that Moore and the earlier Eng- , lish-Irish poets had either neglected entirely or presented inadeauately— the mystic, passionate, and romantic sides of the Irish nature. That Mr. Gwynn, whose Celtic sympathies are well known, should have given only casual attention to considerations of this nature constitutes a surprising gap in his volume.
Considered as a portrayal of Moore’s character, this book of Mr. Gwynn's is adequate and satisfactory, It is not, however, eminently successful in evoki.15 for the imagination the world in which the poet lived. As a literary estimate, while it neither observes its subject from a new angle, nor throws new light upon it, it is upon the whole a thoroughly competent and workmanlike performance— an orderly, trustworthy, and comprehensive statement of the established critical opinions regarding Moore's poetry and prose. It is not to be counted as one of those rare biographies in which the author spares neither time nor labor in mastering his subject in Its details and Its large outlines, in its connection with what preceded, and in its bearing upon what followed. In this volume Mr. Gwynn has shown himself a safe, if neither a brilliant nor a remarkably painstaking critic.	HORATIO	S.	KBANS.
