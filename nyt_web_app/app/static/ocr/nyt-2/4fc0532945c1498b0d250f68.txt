Tin- rcfrrenccs in late letters in vuur Book Hevjew to John Hancock look'like vain attempts to disparage one of the leading: men in New England in the Revolution. There has been a. growing disposition in the last few years to give the shady side of many who were most prominent in our early public affairs, and such have been pleased to give out the traditionary gossips and the flippant newspaper flings concerning Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, and their contemporaries to show how common they were, after all. It is not strange if romancers should not overlook Hancock, who had his foibles, but who was not an ordinary man. lit1 was of a highly respectaDle family, his father and grandfather being clergy mo.] of talent. Being bereft early of his father, he was, perhaps, too indulgently reared by his wealthy uncle, whose large wealth he came into possession, His educational training was equal to the best in that day, having the advantages that were given by Harvard.
If the reader will turn to Sanderson’s " IJ vcs of the Signers " he will see how soon Hancock grew to be conspicuous among his leading townsmen. He was acting on important committees, tnd was ready to act wherever he could lend his aid. He lived luxuriantly, too much so, like others in affluence, and he was ambitious for distinction, but not more than John Adams and Alexander Hamilton. Ho w:is bold to pronounce an oration iift^r the Boston massacre, whether he wrote it or not. although we should not doubt his capability when we see that he was chosen to be the President of the Provincial Congress and the President of the Continental Congress in 1775, 1776, and 1777, whore the first men in the colonies were in council. Their approbation was a warrant as to his fitness.
Let us see how others of high distinction saw hini. John Adams, in his diary, tells us that Hancock “ had an ambition to be appointed Commander in Chief.” TTc adds: “ Whether he thought an election a compliment due to him, and' intended to have the honor of declining it, I know not. To the compliment he had some pretensions, for at that time his exertions, sacrifices, and general merits in the causc of his country had been incomparably greater than those of Col. Washington.” Charles Francis Adams, himself no mean authority, makes this comment in a marginal note: -"This will scarcely surprise those who know Mr. Hancock’s prevailing foible was a fondness for official distinction. But the writer never was among those disposed on this account to depreciate the merit of this gentleman’s services in the Revolution. 1 Sunivan, in his sketches of Revolutionary eharactcrs, speaks of Hancock as “ one of the greatest men of ifts age.”
Hancock married Dorothy Quincy, daughter of Edmund Quincy, who had high local honors. She was, like Abigail Adams, true to her husband's political fortunes. It will be remembered that on the eve of the battle of Lexington Hancock and Samuel Adams were hidden away in the house of the Rev. Mr. Clark, which is still preserved, upon which the writer has looked. Such was the royal hatred they had incurred that a reward
was offen d for their capture. Mrs. Ellet, in her *' Queens of American Society," has this to relate in honor of Hancock:
“ While Mrs. Hancock was in Philadelphia her husband came to her room one day, saying he had a secret to communicate which must be faithfully kept. It was that he had that day received a letter from home, stating that it was thought it would be necessary to burn the city of Boston to prevent its falling into the hands ol the enemy, and, as his wealth was cent red there, he was asked if he would he willing to sacrifice all his property for such an object. He immediately replied that he gave his full consent to commit his property to the flames if the good of the people demanded ft. This, Mrs, Hancock answered, was rather a disagreeable secret. ' Her husband acknowledged that it would reduce them to beggary. But his purpose was fixed—he wished his possessions to be devoted to the best interests of his country." It Is said: “On further consideration the inhabitants of Boston deemed it unnecessary to burn the town.*’
There we see the nobility of the patriot, and if he had his personal weaknesses he had his rare political virtues. Mrs. Hancock accompanied her husband when }^e was chosen President of Congress for the first time and Mrs. Ellet says: " She often spoke of Ids reluctance, from natural modesty, to accept the office. While he hesitated one of the members clasped him around the waist, lifted him from his feft, and placed him in the chair of state. ’ And at the last, Mrs. Ellet states, ” Governor Hancock left orders that he should be buried without public honors,
and forbade the firing of a gun over his
grave.”
Hancock had many to oppose him, and fierce were often the anLftgonisms which the foremost had to meet in those days in the army and the Congress. Jealousies were rife, but we can see them »J1 in a better light in our times. John Adams tells us that Samuel Adams felt at one time “ bitter ” against Hancock, and again, this is related, by Mrs. Ellet:
ing out with his wife when they met Samuel Adorns walking with the Sheriff beside him. Hancock asked: 'What is the meaning cf this?' Adams replied: ‘ I am going to jan, as I cannot satisfy the Sheriff's demands.’ The Governor said he would see to mat and settle the demand, and bade the Sheriff leave the prisoner. Many limes was nis purse opened for Mr. Adams’s benefit.”
It was rt presented that Hancock did not show proper rospect to Washington on his entrance to Boston, but he was suffering so keenly from one of his attacks of fiout mat it was impossible. The author we have quoted from has this to say:
"Inc next day the Governor ordered his carriage, and, with limbs wrapped in red baize, he was placed in it in order to call on the General. When he arrived at Washington’s lodgings he was carried in the arir.s of his servants to the bead of the stairs, and thence he crawled on his hands and knees into the presence of the Commander in Chief. The General, seeing him in this position, was moved to tears. AH difficulties being soon removed, kindness and cordiality were reciprocated.”
Ilancocit was chosen Governor or Massachusetts to hove the earliest honor under the new republican rule, and acted as the Chief Magistrate in all for some ten yean*, which v/as a proud distinction when there were others so capable around him. Ho presided over the convention in Massachusetts which acted on the question of adopting the Federal Constitution, and it was thought that his favoring it, with the understanding that, there waald be amendments to secure furtnei the rights of the people, had influ*n<;® to carry it with a nico majority. Let us be just to the memory of such a Patn°t’ who was one of the boldest to sign his name to the DccLfiratin^f lnd-pcndenc^ and the f.rst.	J.	LOOK.
