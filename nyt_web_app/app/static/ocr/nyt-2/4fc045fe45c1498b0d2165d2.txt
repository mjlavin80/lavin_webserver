FROM READERS,
Air. John R. Spears Replies to Dr. Brady’s Letter on the Subject of Custer.
Nao York Times Book Review:
ECAUSE the subject Is of much more importance than the good fame of even the lamented Custer, give me a little space in which to reply to Dr. Brady's letter of Feb. 8, which you publish. Dr. Brady says that tbe case of Hull taking the Constitution out of Boston Harbor is in nO way analogous to the Ouster affair.
I submit that the spirit of Hull was precisely the spirit of Custer. Hull was determined to fight regardless of the known views of his superiors. Had he been captured he might have entered the technical plea that he had received no orders, but it would not have been like a good fighter to have done so. For the good of the Nation, and each acting according to his judgment formed on the ground, Hull evaded and Custer disobeyed orders. In his heart Hull set the pace for the navy that Custer set under the shadow of the Rockies.
It is astonishing to note that Dr. Brady says my “ good naval authority ” is “ unknown " I quoted Rear Admiral Bell. The story is told by Maclay. Volume I., Page 344. I omitted the name to save space and because I supposed the majority of the readers of The New York Times
BOOK Review would remember the quotation.	.
Wa? Farragut “ in an entirely different
position at the mouth of the Mississippi ”? Suppose he had failed, and had lost, say, a half of his fleet under the walls of the forts? Would he not have been tried for
disobedience of orders? A.11 J. need I remind the readers of this paper that Far-ragut in his attack on New Orleans was "to do a certain and definite thing In the carrying out of a larger general plan/' to wit. the great “ anaconda ” scheme for
strangling the Confederacy?
But supposing the details of this work
and those of Hull’s are altogether different from Custer’s affair, the point to be made in each case is that each was th9 senior officer present; each in the exercise of his judgment believed he saw an opportunity to serve his country; each liad the couni&c—alas, too rare-to assume the responsibility and strike.
1 hope my bluntness may be pardoned if I say that Dr. Brady has misapprehended the facts of the battle of Mobile— a statement that 1 am sorry to make
after reading " The Southerners.” It was
not Craven's dash across the torpedo line that threw JTarragut’s fleet Into disorder; it was the flinching of the Brooklyn. Did the sinking of Craven’s ship excuse the Brooklyn's Captain for backing up? To thr>se familiar with the story I need &a.y no more, but let me add this: If the Captain of the Brooklyn had been animated by Craven's splendid spirit there would have been no disorder in the line, and Farragut would have had no opportunity to thrill the world with his inspired words: “ Danin the torpedoes! ”
However oracular it may seem to say it, I most observe that orders are issued in time of war for the one purpose of destroying the enemy. Behind and within every other order is this one order—Destroy the enemy. This standing order. If
I may call it so, is necessary because unforeseen circumstances often arise. The senior officer present is in duty bound to consider the circumstances of the moment. He is especially bound to consider them if they seem to show that the moment for an effective stroke has come. Custer’s fight was at worst an error of judgment, and for this he paid the penalty with his life. He died doing his duty as he saw it. Let us not go out of our way to blacken the memory of a man who understood what it was " not to be afraid of doing too much/’
