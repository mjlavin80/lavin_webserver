Tho discussion by English authors, publishers, and printers of the unfairness to them of the present American copyright law goes on briskly in The Standard of London. Many of the contributors to the discussion urge retaliation. Mr. Edward Marston, the veteran publisher, thinks that would be useless. He is of the opinion that the one thing needful is the removal of the clause in the law providing that copyright can only be obtained for books set up In type in this country. Yet he does not believe that this objectionable clause gives much advantage to American printers and papermakers, and thinks that if the clause were abolished “ nearly all the printing of English copyrights for the American market would still have to be done in the United States, seeing that, in most cases, it would be quite impracticable to supply printed and bound books from this side, even if there were no United States import duty to block the way.”
