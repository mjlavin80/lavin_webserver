Dr. Brady, in a spirited preface to th'a , hia latest romance, is at pains to warn ! all reviewers that the number of his'other I published works is none of their business, Their part ta merely to adjudge the merits of the book in hand. He declares, moreover, that, any appearances to the contrary notwithstanding, hia pen is no Jess careful for being? prolific; he has not hurried himself with this story; he has taken all the time ho needed. So ther< you are. The truth is, barring the parts ! where he seems to insert passages ol j " history for schools/’ the doctor has written a very -creditable and entertaining book, with an Idealized Napoleon and a less idealized Nelson to serve as what are called in armory " supporters to stand on either band of the shield on which are emblazoned the loves anc deeds of the principals—and add dignity, strength, ornament, completeness to the general effect. The peoplo of the piece are, on the one hand, the ci-devant Marquis de Vaud4mont, lato Vice Admiral in the Royal Navy of France, an emigre with his beautiful granddaughter, hi? grandson, and a faithful and silent servitor; and on the other Captain Sir Robert Macartney of his Britannic Majesty's Navy, serving at tho time of the opening
of the story as second In command to Si Horatio Nelson aboard the line-of-batUe-i ship Agamemnon.
There fs, of course, a villain besides, a I coarse ruffian, by grace of a world upside down Captain in the navy of the French Republic, in the first scene this vile sans culotte fs parleying with the Marquis and presently with cannon assaulting him In a ruined seacoast tower, the garrison of which consists of the old nobleman himself, two women, a man, and a boy.
£ lhe Erood old illogical way and just in the nick of time the Agamemnon comes to the rescue, and Macartney promptly falls m love with the Marquis's granddaughter Then they are all at the siege of Toulon, where a little Corsican artillery officer Is beginning to be famous; later’they are all prisoners aboard the fine French ship Le Tonnnnt. commanded by that wicked sans culotte Captain who was assaulting the tower, He also h:is pretensions to the hand of the Marquis's grand* daughter. The final scene is at the great battle of Aboukir Biv. when Nelson destroyed tho French fleet of Admiral Brueys. Dr. Brady has taken great pafns to describe this fight in detail,' and made it not it little Impressive, especially where lira little emigre Marquis' and one-time royal Admiral, a guest (or prisoner) ahoard Le Tonnant, forgets when h^r Captain is slain, that she flies the hated flag of the French Republic, assassin of his King, and. standing high on the bloodstained QUiirter deck, assumes command and fichts her for al] she is worth re-mnmb-erin'T only that ho is French Mvtr she is French, and that the enemy, ''though allies of his sovereign of (he fallen house of Bourbon.) are English and nnoK*nt foes of his race.
Before the battle there is an episode in which Bonaparte appears at his master- j fullest and b^«t as courteous ’nlper of the ■ weak and inflexible doer of justice upon a traitor Llr. IJr'idy’s hero. Macartney, is, t as m;iy be RuesRed. an Irishman. Of hi* i Marquis he says he “inv;iriublv preferred men to scenery—and for all hi« v^e wo-m^n to either.'* As for the romance of Mucnrrney and the Countess Louise, that Is exactly like all other
rrvrmnces.
