The correspondence we lately published concerning , the continued popularity of the delightful novels of j tho Baroness Tautphoeus has inspired some pertinent comments from Mr. Joseph O’Connor of The Rochester Post-Express, which we reproduce on another page. Mr, O'Connor is one of our own contributors in whose excellent reviews of important books many of
v	-
our readers have evinced a. lively interest. AS for the discussion of the comparative merits of ** The Initials " and “ Quits ” we confess to some disappointment at Mr. O’Connor’s acceptance of the view of our correspondent of last week that “ Quits ” is the better of the two. Mr. O'Connor frankly admits that as a heroine Hildegarde of “ The Initials *’ would be the choice of “ a young fellow of twenty-five." Now we hold, firmly, to the belief that twenty-five years is a ripe age for the judgment of sentimental fiction. With Mr. Howells, also, we believe in the perpetual charm of Hildegarde.
