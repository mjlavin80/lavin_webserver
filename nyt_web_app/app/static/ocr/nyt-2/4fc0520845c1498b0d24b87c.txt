The hero of this story :s that brave Capt. de Tonti who was associated with Robert Cavelier de la Salle in his explorations in the Mississippi Valley. The action begins in Paris, in the place of execution, with an eclipse and the escape of
&	prisoner, shifts to a garret where the valiant Captain is sheltering during a season of poverty and fll-fortune, passes to a romantic encounter in a street with a reckless galloping horseman and a lady in a sedan chair, then leaps to a meeting at an inn and the discovery of treasure beneath the hearthstone, followed by a secret deed of horror. Presently again you meet the famous lady called " La Grande Mademoiselle she who would not have for husband Charles II. (then in exile and kingdomless) and later rejected the German Emperor, and In another turn you are ushered into the Court of Louis le Grand, where you overhear airy persiflage and wit of La Rochefoucauld and ^acine, and encounter Mme. de Montespan. Another shift and there’s a duel, a man left for dead, and a flight to the seacoast, and Capt. de Tonti sailing westward with the Sieur de la Salle. Now the scene Is Canada, in Quebec, where the Comte de Frontenac is quarreling with his Intendant and th« Jesuits, and where the hero is nearly caught in the toils of a siren set upon him by those astute priests. Then comes the heroine (she of the sedan chair) overseas, and the whole book’s company, heroine, hero, villain, faithful attendant are swept out into the wide American i wilderness among the virgin forests and ; the savage Iroquois. The heroine com*
! mands In person the garrison of a little 1 fort when Indians attack it—commands with a man’s hat on her head and a musket in her hand and beats off the painted assailants. Again she is prisoner among
the Five Nations, and looks upon the burning of a brave of the Mohegans, a burning which the author has described with every wealth of horrid detail—leaving nothing to the imagination. The villain is there in war paint and feathers, master of the savages, though he was a French Count and Court gallant in the beginning. So it goes, with plenty of incident and fire till tne end, the nature of which it is not necessary to indicate. The story is better written than most of its kind, and is starred and sprinkled with ihose deep-voweled Gascon oaths which have been favorites of romancers since Dumas.
