A’cic York Times Hook Review:
The discussion on your delightful letter page of the character and services Of John Hancock has interested me, and 1 have expected to find no less an authority than Henry Cabot Lodge summoned in support of the portrait drawn of the Boston usurer-patriot by Dwight Tilton in “ My Lady Laughter/’ As no one has done this, however, perhaps I may be allowed to quote “ the scholar In politics.” In a chapter of history headed “ The Last Forty Years of Town [Boston] Government," Mr. Lodge says: “ There have been few men in history who have achieved so much Came and whose names are so familiar who at the same time did so little and left so slight a trace of personal- influence upon the
times in which they lived as John Han-
ccck. He was valuable chiefly Erom his picturesqueness. Hancock was Car from greatness; indeed, it is to be feared that he was not much removed from being
*	the empty barrel,’ which is the epithet, tradition says, that the outspoken John Adams applied to him.”
Mr. Tilton certainly has the best of authority for his position with regard to this patriot for revenue only. Yet his picture of him is sketched with the eminent fairness which characterizes the treatment of the various historical characters who figure in ** My Lady Laughter.”	JAMES	AUSTIN COOKIS.
