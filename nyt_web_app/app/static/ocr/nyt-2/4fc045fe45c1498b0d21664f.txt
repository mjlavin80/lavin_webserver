| Mrs* Atherton dedicates these tales to Henry James, and, as one reads her description of Ralph Orth in the initjal-story I which furnishes the title of the volume,.
■	he mentally exclaims: '* Aut Jacobus, a.ut
diabolus! '*
"Orth had left the United States soon after his first successes, and, his art being1 too great to be confounded with locality, he had Ions since ceased to be spoken Of as an American author. * * * His subtleties might not always be understood— indeed, as a rule they were not—but the musical mystery of his language and the 1 penetrating charm of his-lofty and cultivated mind induced raptures in the initiated forever denied to those who failed to appreciate him. His following’ "was not : a large one. but it was very distinguished. The aristocracies of the earth* gave to it. and not to understand and admire Ralph Orth was deliberately to relegate one’s self to the ranks.’H?)	'
With much more equally pointed and applicable to “the master ” alone, Mrs. Atherton has woven a charming tale, having that touch of the occult always so fas-cinating—a faraway suggestion of Poe's " Lady Ligeia.” The other nine stories vary in everything save in the artistic manner of their handling, the larger num.-ber impinging, as does the first, upon the realm of the supernatnral. LikeMr. Jiow-ells, Mrs. Atherton gives such imaginings the perfect touch by leaving everything vague and unexplained, and by placing them in a setting of real people and things throw.n upon her canvas with her own surpassing skill.
Of the tales which concern themselves with the realities only, ‘‘The Tragedy of a Snob ” is the most significant. It is a j wonderful bit of drama-a poor clerk's obsession by the columns devoted to the doings of society: his inheritance of a modest fortune, enabling him, as he supposes. to enter the charmed circle: his going to Newport, sufficiently intelligent, handsome. “ well *et up." to bear comparison with any of the gilded youth—and then his becoming aware of the pitiless | exclusions of that society, all the more J ! pitiless because so totally unconscious, | The descriptions of the Newport cottagers sire marvelously done, especially of i
the slim girls, *'widi their deerlike move’ ments.” their '* curried hair,” their pe-1 culiar distinction nnimilatod and inirnita- i ; ble by the merely “ stylish." And one is i made to appreciate their attitude toward j " les autres.’1 It is not arrogance, not | scorn, simply "a great gulf fixed’’; on the one side the elect: on the other " people whom no one knows,’* no more to be considered than invisible space. “ To any and all without their world they were unaffectedly oblivious.” And the sufferings : of the poor snob, wln-n at last he understands are too real, and are drawn with too much sympathy to provoke the reader’s contempt. The rtither does one perceive with a new clearness of vision how j much is done by newspapers and maga-I zincs to blind their public to the comparative values of life. ** The Tragedy of a Snob" is a companion picture to Mrs. Van Rensselaer Oruger’s strong story,. *‘ Kat Not Thine Heart.” It is a rare bit of literary workmanship, as well as something larger than literature.	~	•
The stories are of- unequal merit,^ but upon the whole they well sustain Mrs. Atherton’s reputation, and will repay more than,one reading. ^
