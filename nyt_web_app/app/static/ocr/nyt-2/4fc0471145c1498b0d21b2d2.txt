of the Lenox Library will sell his collection of rare books.. and manuscripts; through thv Anderson Auction Company, In the Spring. Mr. Eames had experience as printer and bookseller before he was made assistant to the late Dr. George H. Moore In 1883. He was appointed Librarian In 1883. He has compiled and edited bibliographies of Ptolemy, Raleigh, Eliot, the " Bay Psalm Book/' early New England catechisms, the Columbus Letter, the
" Marparita—Philosophies," and JEeisHhIi
Hook trade catalogues. For thirty-four years Mr. Eames’s studies have been largely bibliographical, with special reference. to American history. Oriental literature, general ethnology, archaeology, and philology, and his library is chiefly composed of works illustrating the different branches of these studies. The^irst book purchased by him fin 18CS) was an American reprint of the Rev. Wliliam Be-loe's translation of Herodotus. This book was soon replaced by Oe first edition of Beloe’s version, ^ird the department of Greek and Latin history, archaeology, and literature (the first department in literature to which Mr. Eames gave serious attention) now contains every translation made into English, together with the earliest-continental editions, beginning with Lhe cditio prlnceps. Venig< 1474. His collection of Americana dates its beginning from the early 70’s, and his books relating to the American Indians frorff^lSTO. when the late James C. Pilling secured his aid in the compilation of the bibliographies of Algonquin and other languages. Africa and Its languages next attracted fcla attention, (In 1892;) the formation of his Indian collection (which includes works treating of the history of Afghanistan, Tibet, and Indo-China) began in 1895, while from 1000 to 1905 he has been occupied in bringing together a Chinese collection, the largest of hla collections and the finest of its kind in private hands in this country. The Eames library also contains twenty-two other special collections, exclusive of the department of bibliography.
The earliest books of Americana belong to the Mexican department, which contains an excellent copy of the first edition of Molina's Mexican vocabulary, printed In the City of Mexico eighty-five years before a rude Massachusetts press brought forth the " Bay Psalm Book/* the first book printed In the English Colonies now extant. This work, which is onb of the rarest examples of American lricunanula, has a special mterest as the Tirst dictionary of sny kind printed on the American Continent. We know of no auc:ion sale of a perfect copy, and only two complete copies are In existence, that in the Lenox Library and the Icazbalceta copy, in Mexico. The Eames copy is defective, with the title nage, A8, and-foUr other leaves near the end of the volume !n fac similp.
Next in orter of date is Gllbcrti's " Dia-logo de Doctrlna Christiana/’ 1559, in the Yarasean dialect, printed In Mexico by Juan Pablos, the first printer in America. It lacks le?f 80 and the title page to the second part, but is in belter condition than most extant copies. The only perfect copy known to Quarltch was the wormed Ramirez example, which he
priced at £105 in 1S8Ti. There is no copy in tho British Museum. Among the works in the native languages of Mexico are Perez’s “ Farol Indiano y Guia de Curas de lndios,1’ 1713, (not in the Brinley col-leciion;) Perez’s "Arte de el Indioma Mexicano," 1713, (not in Brinley;) Vas-quez Gastelu’s " Arte de lengua Mexi-cana," jTlt3; Perez's " Cathecismo Romano," 1723; Quintana’s " Confessonario de Lengua Mixe," 1733, (not in Brinley;) Klores's “ Arte de la Lengua Metropoli-tana,” 1753, (not in Brinley, and with a ieaf of errata lacking in all other known copies;) Paredes’s *' Promptuario Manual Mexicano,” 1759, &c. With but a few exceptions, the Mexican works are in fine condition. Harrisse once stated that there Is scarcely a single early Mexican book which is not “ torn, incomplete, soiled, stained, or worm-eaten."
Among the books ana pamphlets relating to the North American Indians are dozens which have seldom been offered for sale in the last thirty years. One is David Cusick’s " Sketches of the Ancient History of the Six Nations,” Lewiston, Ontario, 1S27, the very rare first edition, unknown to Sabln. Mr. Eames's copy is one of two known examples, the other being in the Edward E. Ayer collection, In Chicago. Other rarities are Heckewel-der's “ Account of tho History, Manners, and Customs of the Indian Nations who once inhabited Pennsylvania and the Neighboring States/’ 181S, boards, uncut, and a presentation copy from the author, (Mr. Ayer’s copy, the only other one known, is in inferior condition:) “Laws of the Cherok«*e Nation/’ Knoxville, Ky., 1S21, the first collection of laws made by the Cherokee Indans, (the Eames copy is probably unique;) '* Lutheii Catechis-mus,” Stockholm, 1696, with the map of New Sweden in its first state, with the ^inscription " Nova Svecia,” (afterward changed for the Campanius of 1702;) Zeis-

berger’s " Delaware-Indian and English Spelling Book,” 1776;	“ Collection of
Hymns,'* ISO'5, and Grammar of the Delaware Indians,” 1827; Wakefield’s “ History of the War Between the Sac and Fox Nations of Indians," 1827; Lewis's “ Aboriginal Portfolio," 1836, with eighty colored plates, (the book is usually said to be complete with seventy-two plates,) &c. The works included under the names of Schoolcraft, Catlin, Squirer, and Smet are the fullest lines of their •writings ever offered for sale, and there are other collections which -wrtT'lnterest many collectors.
The Chinese collection is very full in works printed in the Chinese language; it also includes the principal works in European languages relating to China and the Chinese, and Is especially rich in publications treating of the Chinese .-tongue and : its dialects. The most important *work in the collection is “ The Twenty-four Histories," by Ma Twan-lin, the imperially authorized records of the empire, ending with the history of the Ming Dynasty. The encyclopedia of Ma Twan-lin, the fruit of twenty years' labor, is followed by a continuation, by Wang Ke, the two works filling 114 volumes? No other nation has a history so thoroughly digested and so trustworthy. It is interesting to observe that in Mr. Eames’s copy of " The Twenty-four Histories ” the greater portion of the work is printed from blocks engraved
entirely in the early part of the sixteenth
century. About one-quarter of the leaves are from blocks recut in 1630, and each leaf so dated, with a few leaves dated 1631 and 1632. There are also reprinted leaves dated 1575, 1576, and 1580. The earliest dated leaves are remarkable specimens of xylography, the art by which books were produced before the invention of typography, of which it has been called the forebuilding.
Among the manuscripts are the following: A funereal papyrus, written for *• Pa-de-Amen " in the small hieratic writing of the XXn. Dynasty, (circa 1000 B. C.;) compaits of the " Book of the Dead," with the proper vignettes for The same, mounted on eleven boards, eleven inches high and twenty-five inches wide, and bound as a: book; several manuscripts of the Koran; a manuscript roll of the Pentateuch. written on about sixty goatskins, making a roll fully one hundred feet in length; five Ethiopic manuscripts; a manuscript in Irish of Keating’s " History of j Ireland," in .three volumes, transcribed for Sir Thomas Phillips from an early manuscript preserved In the library of Trinity College, Dublin, (the only manuscript of the kind ever offered here;) the “ Bhagavad-Gita,” a Sanscrit manuscript, richly illuminated, written in extremely minute characters with eighteen miniatures, on a roll of very thin paper, fifteen feet long by one and one-third inches
broad, and a dozen palm-leaf manuscripts
In the Pali text, the finest examples being the '* Kammvaeha," (the ritual of the Buddhist priests,) written on thirteen leaves of the talipot palm, superbly painted in gold and black on red ground, iruthe square Burmese characters. Still another manuscript of the ** Kammavacha," in Pali, is similarly painted in black on gold enamel, on twelve long, narrow, thin plates of copper, and inclosed in a pigskin case by Lortic,	R.	F.
