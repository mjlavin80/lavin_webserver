The second edition of Dr. Chapin’s boob on Infant feeding contains what appear* ] to the layman to be an extremely dear and sensible exposition of the conditions which have to be met In providing a proper diet for very young children,, who : for any reason are deprived of nature’s orovision for that purpose. The author sets forth what food must do for a baby tn language which all may understand. He explains how, while many animals 1 come Into the world almost ready to take care of themselves—that is, with a 1 fairly complete nervous system—the helpless human offspring needs to have his | nervous system built up from the beginning. And "the foods provided must do that. Obviously cow's milk, for instance, prepared in nature’s laboratory , with a view	to the	needs of calves, la not
exactly the	thing	for babies—even	If it	j
be pure. Dr. Chapin declares very plain- I 1 y that merely ch emi cal tests will not ^ serve, pointing bi« moral with the fact that there is no chemical difference between a diamond and a bit of charcoaL Then he proceeds to explain tlie pGCUll&Tl* I ties of the digestive organs of different animals, and to deduce rather a reasonable state of	openness of tnlnd than	any	I
w>t of rules.	Next	he takes up raw	food
materials, especially and at length cow's rn"kt as It ought to be and as it com-mwoially Is. Part III. of the book is concerned witn practical methods of feeding Infants, and adds something about infants’ aliments. Part IV. deals with growth and development. The book Is plentifully provided with scientific data, taMes, and facts, but it is neither tech* n*caJ nor dulL On the contrary, It makes rather good reading for anybody with an appetite for curious and usefo1 knowledge.
