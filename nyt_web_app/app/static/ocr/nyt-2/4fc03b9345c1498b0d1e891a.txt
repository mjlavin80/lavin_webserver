This study in political pathology will be a welcome addition to the hooks available to the student of political sclencc. It is not ql history of political parties* but a study of the growth aud Influence of two nearly evenly balanced and contending parties which the author believes to be absolutely necessary in the conduct of a democratic government like that under which we live and worH. How weli these work out to .the necessary balanc^ ing1 of power and correction of £YiIs that might arise in the too great centralization of authority the author points out, as he doe.s how much superior our plan Is In a democracy to the English, system! where the Cabinet and-thc ruling party are synonymous, while here the President may represent one party and the legislative bodies be one or both opposed to him, and so constitute a balance that often operates for good, .without disruption and “ an appeal to tbe country.’* Party organization actually* began here , with Jeffersonls Administration, even though President Washington had to represent the Federal Party during his Administration—and much against his will— when there were a number of factions op-, posed to him. But distinc '	‘
ministration. From that time the Democratic Party has continued* to exist, the opposition taking a variety of forms and names until the formation of the Republican Party was brought about just before the war between the States. How these parties have grown and developed Prof. Macy shows pathologically rather than historically, "and by tracing them from ' their organization in the people of the t township or county, up through State,
! Congressional, and National Committees, j shows how they have at last attained an 1 extra-legal hold on the actual government of the country, one that^the organizers of our governmental system never had intended or dreamed possible.
In detail the work of the committees, from the small body close to the peo-. pie and getting their power directly from them, up through the various bodies of Directors of State and National politics, even to the Executive of the Nation himself, who perforce is leader of the successful party in a National campaign, is followed minutely in a succession of cbapters which, beginning with the Presidential leadership* trace back to the lesser organization that is directly of the people, and from which, rafter ail, springs party power.
Tammany, says the writer, was the first organization to master all the minute details of “ living with the voter 3Go days in the year," and “so making a compact party organization that has no equal, even in Pennsylvania, where the one-man power of the ** business applied to political management ” reaches its highest exemplar. The variation of party management in the different States is pointed out clearly, until it has reached a point in South Carolina and some other States of the South where the party has actually taken the electoral privilege away from the whole people by substituting therefor the party primary, which is the real election, even in the case of choosing a United States Senator, the Jogal election which follows being u mere registration of--the people's will as expressed in a party primary. At tin1 other extreme is Massachusetts, of which the author says;
" No other State has gone far in the legal recognition of parly organization and in the legal control of party action,’* where “ a very large part of the rules regulating the conduct of political parties is to be found in the Revised Sin lutes of the State.”
There seems to be nothing omitted from this little hand-book that any student of ( party methods or managi-nnm con hi possibly wish to know.	_
