One of our correspondents this week, on the always interesting and suggestive readers’ page, makes inquiry aa to j the ten living English authors of the highest standing. The context of his letter of inquiry shows that he has- in nind only the imaginative writers. The first five, he thinks, might be easily named, but he fancies there would be many differences of opinion in regard to the others. Among those others we should unhesitatingly name Mr. Robert Hichens, whose newest imaginative work, " The Garden of Allah/’ (just published here by the Frederick
A- Stokes Company,) is one of the books of the week.
We should not care to venture further In the particular field of literary Speculation opened by our correspondent’s Inquiry. We leave that to our readers. But we are confid&ni that Mr, Hichens is entitled to a place among the ten leading English writers of fiction, and that there would be no Strong disposition, in English literary circles, to dispute his title, should a controversy arise. The precise place Mr. Hichens occupies among the ten would be more difficult to decide. If all his work were of the quality of the best parts of his “ Felix," which is veritably a Balzadan study of contemporary life, or some of the chapters In “ The Garden of Allah,1' a book which in spite of Its obvious faults of pro-Iixity and a labored minuteness in some of the descriptive passages which fails of the effect it is Intended to convey, nevertheless possesses an uncommon charm, Mr. Hichens would stand not far below Mr. Meredith and Mr. Hardy. But in “ Felix,” and now in " The Garden of Allah," Mr. Hichens has put the very best of himself. The smartness of " The Woman with the Fan," the very photographic accuracy of its superficial pictures of London fashionable society, have been equaled by Mr. E. F. Benson and other writers whom one would not think of naming among the first ten of Knglish contemporary novelists. The clever but hopelessly banal “ Green Tarnation " and the pseudo-mystical "Flames" and “ The Imaginative Man ” only gave us a faint idea of the possibilities of Mr. Hichens. These are not bcoks to be long remembered. Hichens has broadened and ripened since he wrote them.
In observation, in a true feeling for the beauty of inanimate nature, in a quick perception of human failings and foibles, in a keen sense of humor, in The gift of apt and felicitous expression, (which he sometimes permits himself to abuse,) he is now the equal of any living novelist. He knows the world, its garden spots and its barren places; he knows the power of man to-suffer and his propensity to make a fool of himself. He is smart, too hopelessly smart, we fear, ever to gain the laurel of the immortals. One reads his best books with huge enjoyment, and sometimes lays the best of them aside with a feeling of disappointment.
Yet " The Garden of Allah ’* is too strong and true, novel and tender, eloquent and picturesque, to be treated merely as the pastime of an hour. Even so treated, it would be pastime for a very long hour. It contains a multitudinous array of well-ciiosen words, its analysis comprehends tha slightest
of ;passing moods,r Its. desaipUonthe last faint reflection o£the setting son’s glow on the least noticeable leaf of a desert palm tree. It Remands much of the reader.	~
From those comparatively few readers who have followed Mr. Hichens with interest and a varying measure of admiration since the beginning of his career, " The Garden of Allah ” will receive' the closest attention. These "^vlll appreciate its extraordinary merit and not be dismayed by its prolixity. Its setting of the tragedy of life in a splendid scenic environment would
doubtless appeal to many others if they could once form the habit of reading the books of Mr. Hichens. *' The Garden of Allah '• is a good book with which to begin to form that habit.
