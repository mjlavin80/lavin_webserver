In it also appear about Seventy .or eighty hitherto unpublished tetters, many of much importance; while it Is the first edition to takn note in chronological order of those letters printed by other editors that are not available for the present volume, owing to the long period of copyright Mr. Lucas, in the preface to Vol. VX, writes concerning his work In annotating these	vol-
umes:
In these two volumes I have, after much consideration, placed my notes at the end of each tatter, rather than, as tn the five preceding volumes, at the end of the book. My reason for doing bo was twofold: in the first place, to serve the convenience of the reader, to whom annotation of the correspondence is often a ne-ce^8^1 not, as in the case of the i other writings, a luxury; and in the sec-ondI place, because by joining the letters with a few words of commentary they can be made practically into a consecutive life. The self-conscious deliberate construction of Lamb’s essays £n!? Poems, each a work of art, fori bade the introduction of footnotes that ! might distract the attention from the true matter of the text; hence, fn the preceding five volumes, such remarks as the editor had to make will be found sharply separated from the author 3 part of the book. But here, where Lamb is often writing without premedi-j tation, with a running pen, and writing I moreover for a single reader, It eeexned to me that the impropriety of interrupting the correspondence by elucidatory comments was so. slight as to be almost | non-existent. 1
Among the new hitherto unpublished letters are those to the Wordsworths, the Moxon correspondence, and letters to Coleridge, J. B. Dibdin, Ayrton, and j others. At the end of Vol. VTL are api pen dices containing some letters and passages of letters omitted from the body of the book, and supplied from various sources; the text of various poems referred to in the letters, and a number of notes on the earlier volumes of thin edition, together with some new material, authentic and conjectural. Both volumes have photogravure frontispiece portraits.
