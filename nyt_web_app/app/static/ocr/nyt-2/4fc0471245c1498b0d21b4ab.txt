To the well-known series of " Heroes of the Nations," Mr. J. B. Firth, already a contributor, adds another volume, a life of Constantine the Great. It is, on the whole, a well-balanced piece of work, being practically a brief account of thu life and times of the founder of Constantinople, raiher than merely a life of that Emperor of Rome.
One of the most curious experiments in the history of government was that made by Diocletian, which led finally to the accession of Constantine, whom we call the great. Regarding the empire as a private trust, Diocletian took a partner, Maxi-mian; and then he chose two soldiers as junior partners, to be trained as successors to the seniors when they should retire from active business. For such retirement was part of Diocletian’s plan; and when they had reigned twenty years, retire they did—Diocletian gladly, to raise cabbages on bis farm; Maximian unwillingly, to try to regain his-lost power, and finally to die in the attempt. Then, in time, came Constantine, promoted from junior to senior partner, and finally the head of the firm which ruled the world. The plan works well in private business; but it did not succeed when applied to government, and is to be noted as a curiosity of politics, and as the indirect cause of Constantine’s accession.
Mr. Firth devotes much space to Constantine's relation to Christianity. The famous “ Vision of the Cross,” long asserted to be the immediate cause of the Emperors conversion, is described at length, and the conclusion reachedt from a study of tho various accounts. 19 that the event is purely legendary. The edict of Milan, the first act of toleration in history, is also described and the more important clauses of it given in full.
To the various controversies that vexed Constantine and the Christian Church, a large part of the book is given—probably not an undue amount of space when one remembers that the Donatlst troubles, and the great Aryan controversy, with its sequel, the Council of Nicaea, were two of them. Constantine had hoped, seemingly, to quiet religious differences by his edict of Milan. Instead, freeing Christianity from the fear of persecution, he gave it a chance to turn its attention to details forme'rly overlooked. The old proverb about Satan and idle hands might well he quoted in regard to the Church troubles in Constantine's time, hut not as an excuse for persecution.
In his chapter on the building of Constantinople, Mr. Firth fihows to be false the oft-rcpeated assertion that the Emperor permitted no pagan temple in the new city. There were temples of Cybelc and of Fortuna, and a temple and precincts for the Dioscuri in Constantinople. "'Throughout his reign,” says Mr. Firth, " Constantine never forgot that the majority of his subjects were still pagan, despite the hosts of conversions which followed his own, and he took carc not to press too hard upon them and not to goad the upholders of the old regime to the .recklessness of despair.’* A curious comparison might be drawn between Con-
slant me an.l Queen Elizabeth of England. Each rt:Icr had adopted a new religion not followed by a majority of his and her subjects. There was 110 central authority to oppose- Christianity, which forced out paganism; there was a central authority to oppose the spread of tne Reformation, and had the Papacy not ct-red in practically driving England into Protestantism to prove its loyalty to the Queen, the Roman Church might to-day have been all-powerful through the Western World.
The book opens with an absurdly bad genealogical table, and continues to practically a dateless limit. Tho date of Constantine’s accession is given only incidentally. that of the battle of the Milvian Bridge is omitted; there are no dates for the edict of Milan and a dozen other events. There is no map; a plan of the hippodrome at Constantinople is given with reference letters, for which no explanation is vouchsafed. Similarly, a once Important legena is dismissed with few contemptuous words: “ There is no .jeed to discuss at length the once famous tut now simpiy notorious Donation of Constantine.” In a life of Constantine there is every need to discuss the so-called Donation. The story of the Donation was spread by the Church with a purpose, just as the Isidorian Decretals v/ere forged; the purpose having been
grained, the Donation and the Decretals are now admitted to be fraudulent. But they are of importance historically, at all events.	'
