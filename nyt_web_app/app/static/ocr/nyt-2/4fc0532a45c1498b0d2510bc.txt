“THE CLANSMAN.”
Its. Author, Thomas .Dixon, Jr., Replies with Spirit and Good Humor to Some of His Critics.
3?eir York Times Book Review;
3RMIT me a few words of reply to some critics- of ** Tho Clansman.” Mr. Edwin L. Shuman of The Chicago Rec-ord-Herald, whom I regard as one of the best- critics In America, says that my portrait of Thaddeus Stevens as Austin Stoneman is a gross caricature. Will Mr. Shuman print verbatim the bill and speech of - Stevens which provided for the confiscation of the property of the South, its division among the negroes and the reimbursing: of himself for his burned mills, and then defend his character? This speech is on Page 203, Congressional Globe, March, 1807, and was delivered two years after the close of the war, while the South was yet in her life-and-death struggle with starvation, (Henry TImrod, the poet, died of insufficient nourishment in Columbia Oct. 7, 1807.) The following words will identify this address:
The laws of war authorize us to take this property by our sovereign power. You behold at your -feet a conquered foe, an atrocious enemy! We have the right to impose confiscation of all their property—to Impoverish them. This is strict law and good common sense. To this issue I devote the small remnant of my life.
No biographer of Mr. Stevens has ever dared to print his speeches. Why? This speech is the one supreme act of his Iifer-an act which lights with the glare of immortal infamy his whole character and career. I have not caricatured him. It was necessary to soften, humanize, and idealize his character to make it fit to print. My only errors are on the side of mercy. Let my critics put a finger on a single line, page, scene, or insinuation in “ The Clansman ” in which I do him injustice.	-
My book will stand or fall as a contri-I bution to the history of Reconstruction on this character. Unless I have sketched i him with honesty and accuracy I have committed a crime. I rest the book on this issue.
The Outlook declares that I have deliberately prostituted such talents as I possess to arouse the worst passions of my readers, made a case of all devils against all angels, and that my book will retard the harmony so eminently desirable between the North and South. Surely not! Could a literary fake, written by a deliberate intellectual prostitute, retard anything? It is a psychblogical impossibility for a fakir to write a book of power unless endowed with superhuman mind. I 1 protest against such high praise.
Nor is the *' case of all angels against all devils ” true. I sketch five negro j characters, two good, two bad, and one : j humorous. I draw full length the charac- j ters of two great Republican leaders— ■ 1 Lincoln and Stevens—one good and one i bad. Should a reviewer deliberately try j 1 to deceive his readers even to promote j harmony between the North and the I South? Can harmony be gained by falsehood?
The Outlook assumes that my facts are true, but says: ** Let’s hush it up—it’s all over now, and we’re ashamed of it.” Is it so? Hear this choice deliverance of calm philosophic criticism from The Boston Transcript:
He reaches the acme of his sectional passions when he exalts the Ku-Klux Klan into an association of Southern patriots, when he must know, or else be strangely ignorant of American history, that its members were as arrant ruffians, desperadoes, and scoundrels as ever went unhanged.
Did it ever occur to The Outlook that I may be trying to reach Darkest New England with a few rays of Southern sunlight? One of the best preachers in Boston, a man of the sweetest Christian character, a leader of Evangelical Christianity, whose sermons The Transcript prints on Mondays, was a Ku-Klux Clansman, and at this writing Is still unchanged and very popular in Boston. Has The Transcript moved to Salem?
My father is a venerable minister of Christ. He has built twenty flourishing Baptist churches In Piedmont Carolina in a pastorate of sixty years. He is one of these " desperadoes," and Is still unhanged. I could give the names of a thousand of these ** ruffians ” who are today among the noblest men In America.
The Outlook was founded by Mr. Beecher to promote Christian union. Will my father vote even to unite with his Northern brethren of the same faith so long as such experts in ignorance as The Boston Transcript teach that in saving the civilization of the South he was a ruffian, desperado, and scoundrel? Is it possible to promote harmony by a lie?
I am no sectional fanatic, but a citizen of New York, with scores of warm friends in the great, rushing North. Their support has given me my successes in life, i This is my country—the whole of it, from sea to sea and from Alaska to the Keys of i Florida. I love the people of the North, and I have promised that if God gives me strength they shall know mine own people of the South, and love them, tool Is this
a crime? - I am writing-out- of the fullness of life the story of my father and mother and brethren. It is an authentic human document. In these books I am giving utterance to the deepest soul convictions of l&OOO,000 Southern people on this, the darkest problem of our century. Can there be harmony until we understand each other?
You cannot ** hush up ’* the history of a mighty nation. This is no dead issue.
! The President of the United States devoted his whole speech to it on Lincoln's Birthday. We have not settled the negro problem. We have not dared to face it aa yet.
One of my critics accuses me of buying a house and yacht out of the royalties of my books. It seems a pity to destroy this fairy tale, but it may ease his pain. I have a beautiful home and a modest ; yacht, but I bought and paid for them before I had written a book. iacht±ng is a means of economy and health with me, not luxury. My wife and children are as passionately fond of the water as I am. and we live cheaper on the boat than on the shore. May I mildly ask if it is im. moral, or even a violation of the canons of art, to do this?
Another critic is very angry becauso I do not write like Thomas Nelson Page. How can I help it? Mr. Page has never ! asked me to write his books. I couldn t 1 do it "If I tried, and wouldn’t do it if I , could.
; Whether "The Clansman" is literature : or trash Is a question about which I am losing no sleep. This generation will not i decide it and In the next I’ll be dead and j it will not matter.
I My ideal of work Is very simple—to do my level best every time and try to express my story in the most powerful manner possible. The most powerful way is always the most artistic way, for art is the appeal to tb© intellect through the emotions. When a critic says my book is one of “ marvelous power,’* but “ thoroughly inartistic,” I don’t try to understand him or answer him. I give it up. He is talking in an unknown tongue, or he is beyond my depth.
I never write a book unless I have something to say, and never say it as long as I can keep from it. When at last I have become so full of a great dramatic idea that I feel 1 shall die unless it is uttered, that others may know the might of its truth and the glory of its beauty, I write the story—write it simply, sincerely, boldly, passionately.
This may not be “ Literature,” but I have my reward—and it is large financially, and larger spiritually. Out of the depths of the Unseen these passionate cries of the heart come back in echoes wet with tears and winged with hopes, and life becomes a joy wide as is the world that holds these kindred souls and deep as are the secrets of their hearts which are also mine. And I am content.
I owe much to my critics. They are all my good friends, and none more so than mine enemies among them. This challenge I wave to them with a smile and a friendly greeting.
