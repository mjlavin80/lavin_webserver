ONDON, Feb. 10.—No book likely to cause a great “ literary sensation ’’ is announced in the Spring lists of the London publishers, but the announcements show that the coming season will be full and fairly interesting, especially in war literature, books of travel, and general biography. The number of travel books will be exceedingly large. The lists of books on literary subjects include a good many that promise to be entertaining.
For instance, John Lane will publish a booklet on *“ The Women of Shakespeare’s Family,” written by the Curator of .Shakespeare’s birthplace, while Chapman & Hall will publish a larger work entitle^' 4‘ Shakespeare s Marriage and Departure from Stratford." Chatto & Windus announce a “ Life of Charles Dickens as Revealed in His Writings," by indefatigable Percy Fitzgerald. John Lane has in press a volume by sprightly, paradoxical G. K. Chesterton, entitled “ Heretics,” in which the author treats of the writings of Kipling, Yeats, H. G. Wells, Omar and the English “ Omar-ites,” George Bernard Shaw, and others. A book on Russian literature, by Prince Kropotkin, is promised by the Duckworths. William Heinemann has about ready the fourth volume of Dr. Georg Brandes's “ Main Currents in Nineteenth Century Literature.” It deals with " Naturalism in England."
John Lane is preparing two Napoleonic books, one of which, by Oscar Browning, treats of the boyhood and youth of Bonaparte. The other is a life of the Emperor’s son, the Duke of Reichstadt, by Edward von Wertheimer.
John Murray will publish this month ! Edward Cadogan’s studies of Napoleon ! III., Count Cavour, and Bismarck, un-j- <jer the title of " Makers of Modern , Europe.”
