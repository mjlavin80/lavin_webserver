In '** The - Old' ’ Shipmasters ot Salem” the author traces the development of the tommerceof tiie city, which com-, menced as early-as 1G70, with trade with the Leeward Islands. The fishermen caught cod, the fish were cured and sent to the West Indies. ! On the; return trip the cargoes were of sugar attd -'molasses. From such small beginnings dates a wonderful increase of trade. Among the earliest of Salem merchants was Capt. Philip English. He was born in England and came to Salem in 1675. He sent small craft to Newfoundland* and the cod caught -thero were* sent to Barbados*
I Surinam, Spain, and elsewhere. The first ship fromNew England to visit the Isle i of "Prance;.. Irtdia, and China, was The Grand Turk, which- cleared from Satem Nov. 25, -785. The brig William and Henry, arriving at; Salem In 1790, was the first American vessel which brought a cargo of tea^ -A romance-of commerce reads as follows:	,
Capt. Jonathan Carnes touched at the port of Bencdolen ir* 1703. and while there, learned that pepper grew wild on the northwestern ^-coast of Sumatra, On ms voyage home to Salem it is quite probable that he built many air-castles touching the immense wealth which would likely accrue to himself and his native City of Salem by trading with the Malays and monopolizing the traffic in their great staple. ... He returned to Salem full of plans, schemes, and hopes. He was not long in imparting his important discovery to Jonathan Peele, one of Salem’s wealthy merchants, who quickly saw the advantages to be derived from carrying- out the plans formulated by the sagacious Captain. Mr. Peele soon had a schooner built suited to the trade contemplated, and she was placed in the command of Carnes. The vessel was named the Rajah, and was only of 130 tons burden, and carried four guns with a crew of ten men* She left port in lTDD, the destination of the vessel being kept a profound secret, even to neighboring merchants.
Many months elapsed, and nothing was heard of the Rajah. Her owner was becoming anxious, when one day Mr. Peele, who had been scanning the horizon with his spyglass, discovered the schooner coining into the harbor.
The anchor was soon l**t go. and a boat conveved Capt. Carnes to the wharf, where he received the hearty greetings from the owner and his many friends. The curious were not long in finding out the character of the cargo, which proved -to be pepper in bulk, and was sold at a profit of 700 per cent. It was the first cargo of pepper imported into this country. Then followed a big traffic between Salem and the Spice Islands.
Here are extracts taken from a diary kept by George Cleveland, who was clerk to Capt. Samuel Derby, master of the ship Margaret, which sailed from Salem on the Iflth of November, 1S0<>. Arriving at Batavia. Capt. Derby agreed to carry to Japan a cargo belonging to the Dutch Bast India Company. The Margaret was the first vessel from Salem that had visited Japan, the first having been the ship Franklin of Boston. The ship's clerk writes:
The first place we went to in Nagasaki was Pacquta’s, an eminent *' stuff ’* merchant. Here we were entertained in such a manner as we little expected. ~.Ve h#»d set before us a repast—pork, fowls, eggs, boiled fish, sweetmeats, cake, various fruits, and sacky tea. The lady of the house was introduced, who drank tea with us, as is the custom in Japan. She appeared to be a modest woman. * * * We w^nt to a teahouse nr hotel, where we dined After dinner we were entertained with various feats of dancing and tumbling. 3 * * As the time was ap-proachinEr for our departure, we began to receive our returns from the interior-brought many hundreds of miles. These consisted of the most beautiful lacquered ware, such as waiters, writing desks, tea caddies, knife boxes, and tables. We also rectived a great variety of silks, fans in large quantities, and a great va-i j.aty of po/c‘*'.am. *'he East I fdia Oom-"3*.uyfs ear^o had slreadv* 'lesn put on boa-’Q. The prirtc‘i;<il a-l'Se was copper In small bars. The company's ships have been obliged to take their depai'ure from tlu* anchorage, opposite Nagasaki on a certain day to the lower roads, no matter whether it blew high or low, foul or fair, even if 1,000 boats should be required to tow them down. We. of course, had to do as our predecessors had done.

In the war of 1812 Salem was once more :
. in the lead, and sent out forty vessels with letters-of marque.papers. The most famous of the privateersmen was th_e ! Grand - Turk. The author gives this ac: count of "her performances.	.>	_

; Hawthorne was bom in Salem, In 3S04. S-and the stranger there is certain to think j of him, and will visit the Custom House, the scene of the great author's routine work. He will, it,may be, search for “The House of the Seven Gables,'1 said to be ' on Turner Street, and he may be shown a certain liousc; but' the one pointed out is not the veritable one, for it is likely that 1 Hawthorne was the architect of his own fancies. But there have been many distinguished men associated with Salem. There was Nathaniel Bowditch, who ! takes the lead among American scien-tlsts. Mr. Trow writes of him:
! Dr. Bowditch sailed as supercargo on
■	several voyages from Salem. In 17i)G, in the ship Astrea, Capt. Prince, he went to Lisbon, Madeira, and other places. * * *
; That Nathaniel Bowditch was eminently 1 a self-made man no one can truthfully deny. He* was led to take an Interest in the- higber branches of mathematical science, in 17S7, when he was fourteen years of age. The iesire to gafn knowledge was brought about through the agency of an .older brother, who had been to sea on a voyage or two, and who, feeling the ; need of a better education and of a i knowledge of navigation, as he intended ; to follow the sea, attended an evening school while at home from one of his voyages. On returning home one evcn-ing he informed Nathaniel that tiie mas! ter had got a new way of doing sums and working questions, for instead of the ' figures used in arithmetic he employed letters of the alphabet. The novelty ex-i cited the laa*s curiosity, and as mathematical books of all kinds were then scarce in the country he managed to borrow the hook of the master. That night he did not close his eyes, the book being all in all to him. He' copied the contents, from beginning to end, and soon mastered every problem it contained,
*	*	Dr. Bowditch’s fame as a scient-
ist rests on his translation and commentary of the great work of the French astronomer, La Place, entitled “ I>a M£ea-nique^ Celeste.’*
