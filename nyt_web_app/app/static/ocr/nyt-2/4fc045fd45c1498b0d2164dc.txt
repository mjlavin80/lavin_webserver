FRENCH CAMPAIGNS.
Memoirs of a. French Cavalry Officer of tbe Time off Prince Eugene-*
DE LA COLONIE was a French officer of cavalry, having a good acquaintance with engineering, who took part in the war of the Spanish succession ana In other leading contests of the period, his active services beginning In 1CW0 and ending in 1717. He published his memoirs in 1737, and several editions followed. The translation of the memoirs by Mr. Walter C. Horsley has its special merit, as It gives an excellent idea 6f the methods of warfare at the close off the seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth centuries. In the campaigns described by M. de la Colonic France had for opporents Marlborough and Prince Eugrne. When he was born he does not state, but ssys:	When I had reached
the age of ten I had learnec to read and wiite in a market town in P&rigord, my rative country.” Though in former, limes the family might have been well-to-do, when tbe author of the memoir began his career his parents wore very poor. When he was seventeen the King of Fra tier, Louis XTV., had been victorious and the battle of Fluurus and the capture of Mons v ere the sensations of the day. M. do la Culonie writes that even in the smallest villages bonfires were lighted and extraordinary rejoicings were everywhere manifested. The only talk was of war. and such was the spirit of emulation among the youth of the country that *hey crowded to join the new levies which were
made almost daily.
The hid wanted to begin his career as an officer. But such a chance was only open to the aristocracy. The former claims of the de la Colonie family were pres* nied, and the young man was permitted to join a company at Charlemont In Flanders. The education of tlie young soldier included fencing, dancing, riding, geography, fortification, and the principles of mathematics, great attention being paid to manual and musketry exercises. All the instruction seems, however, to have been lax. The young man determined to master the science of fortification, together with mathematics, and so won the respcct of his masters. His principal recreations were fencing and gymnastics. In his time M. de la Colonie figured in many duels, In which, according to his memoirs, he always came out victor. In lime hr received the appointment Of Sous-Brigadier. His first experience in actual warfare was when the King made an attack on Namur in lfJ92. Louis, who was desirous of conducting so important a» operation in person, left Versailles May 30, and one of the incidents of the times was that he was followed by the ladies of the Court, at the head of which was Mine, de Maintenon, For their safety and comfort the womenkind were lodged at Dinan, some three miles from the scat of action. Before the siege was opened a curious agreement was made between the belligerents that certain parts of the town should not be fired on. During the siege M. dc Vauban thought the French forces were at a disadvantage from this arrangement, and wanted the King to a J low him to fight as it pleased him. The Kins, however, would not permit him to break the treaty. M. de la Colonie wrift s:
But Hi-- Almighty decreed (hut the King should in■! perjure hirrfself. and instead brought .ihcuf one of the most unexpected and lucky rhances, by means of which we bt'cunic masters of the place. and that without tl, further construction of any more la rue works or the loss of any great numbci <>f ia* n.
A irM.iin siue of a fortress was found abandoned, and into this the Fn neh forces poimd, and there was a surprise. The author toils of the lessons imparted to him bv such famous engineer officers as Yanban and de Marigny. He adds that of sixty oll’icers of engineers who served before Namur only twenty-two came out alive; lhe rest died in the trendies. As a reward for his services there came to him the appointment of a Second Lieutenancy in the Vex in Regiment. M. de Luxembourg was commander of the French forces in Flanders. Charleroi was taken, but the loss* s of the French were heavy. On tin* whole, (he campaign was not successful. After the peace of Hyswiclt M. del la Colonie went to Paris on half pay, the King having reduced his army. Something of life in Paris is described. There is a lung ue(,-<>uiit of his quarrels with M. Boism^iv], when an attempt was trade to capture him. M. de la Colonie tells oi his own prowess.
U was lucky for me that I happened to be endowed with some considerable strength. for, without boasting, 1 have never found the man who could resist me when roust'd, and as my passion grew my power redoubled itself. It served me marvelously in my violent struggles to shake oft seven great ruffians, who threw themselves upon me with all desperation.
Finally, jn single combat Boismorel got the worst of it and had to beg for his life.

Now follows the campaign celebrated for the decisive action of Ramil lies, where ** Milor ’* Marlborough played such an important part* Describing that portion of the contest as he witnessed it, th© author writes;
Our brigade formed -part of the right wing of the first infantry line, not far from the centre, and consequently some distance from the marsh. • * * As soon as the respective armies began to cannonade and bombard each other I had ordered flourishes to be played upon our hautboys to entertain us the while, but the booming of the guns that went on all around so startled our musicians that they disappeared like a flash before any one noticed it and transported the melodious sounds of their instruments to some quarter where the harmonies were not quite so discordant.
Colonie was present at Oudenard and Malplaquet. It is worthy of mention that our Frenchman, having been once seriously ill from exposure, tool^a dose of quinine, as he describes it, “ compounded of cinchona bark, confection of alkermes, hyacinth, eyes of crayfish, prepared red coral, syrup of absinthe, and centaures." Ha telle how he gave the medicine to many doctors, and how always the results were beneficial to their patients. Having entered the Bavarian service, de la Colonie served under Prince Eugene in the war with Turkey. The fighting qualities of the Turks he acknowledges. Once a sally was made by the enemy, and he writes:	'
They made use of a most varied assortment of weapons, for javelins and arrows accompanied by bullets fell .among us. Being mounted I attracted their special attention; and, moreover, in my red coat I doubtless appealed In their estimation as a person of importance, for one of their number, a man of great stature, hurled a javelin at me, which passed close by my side and buried Itself in the ground. I had it brought to me and, haying sheathed my sword, carried the javelin for the rest of the day.
The capture of Belgrade ended the campaign and the Turks were beaten. Now came the proudest day in the varied experiences of our Frenchman. For an act of singular bravery, when, according to his own account, he turned the tide of victory, M. dc la Colonie had the distinguished honor of being embraced by Prince Eugene, and this fact is vouched for by others who have written the history of the campaign of Prince Eugene in Hungary. At the conclusion he writes “ that my actions * * * bcought me the dignity of MarSchal des Camps et Armfies, and the position to hope for still higher honors had the war continued." The translation is remarkably well done, and the notes at the foot of the pages of gTcat value.
