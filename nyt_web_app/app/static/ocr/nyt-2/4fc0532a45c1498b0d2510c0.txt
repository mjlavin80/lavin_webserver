A couple of books have recently appeared In Paris which throw light at once on a curious manifestation of mental queerness and on the prevailing tone of sentiment in France on the eve of the great revolution. Both books relate to a certain Capt. Laclos, author of a work, “ Les Liaisons IDangereuses,"
which, in .the last quarter of the eight.	c
eenth century had an immense vogue as an openly and cynically scandalous ^portrait of depraved characters In a time when depravity and scandal were
far from rare. One of the volumes referred to contains the hitherto unpublished letters of Laclos; the other is a
biography, though a somewhat imperfect one.
“ Les Liaisons ” embodied an elaborate and wholly unrestrained study of the motives and actions of avowed and, so to speak, professional profligates. It is not a story of passion in the ordinary sense; it is a story of the development of wholly abnormal and morbid wickedness, of minds witli whom corruption was an obsession and who found their delight in the suffering and shame they could inflict, the moral degradation and social humiliation they could impose upon their victims, With the hero the dominant and insatiable motive is the gratification of diseased vanity; with the heroine it ist a still more horrible pleasure in the debasement of the relatively innocent, the utter betrayal of those whose weak and
&
confiding natures yielded to her subtlety yf intellect and baleful force of will.
Naturally the author of this monstrous creation, which surpassed la Its hideous shamelessness anything with which that unscrupulous age had previously been regaled or shocked, was taken by his contemporaries to be himself a monster. It was assumed that his life passed amid the scenes i and in commerce with the detestable characters he described with such unblushing candor. His biography, to which we have alluded, and still more his letters, show that the truth was quite the opposite. Most of the letters are addressed to his family. They reveal him a particularly kindly, thoughtful, attentive husband and a father full of homely and commonplace solicitude for the virtuous training of his children. He retails with tedious minuteness his personal doings and manifests the keenest interest in the
| little affairs of his household; He Is ! sentimental. after the most prosaic j‘fashion,-arid te a moralist of the most approved and least wayward sort. Neither in the letters nor in the life Is there any indication of the models from which he drew his despicable portraits, or of any connection with the revolting life he depicts in his romance. Indeed it is. only after the appearance of the romance and the great scandal it made that he seems for a while to have tried to live up, or down, to the character commonly attributed to its author. These somewhat factitious and forced attempts at a debauched existence are reported to have been a rather ludicrous failure, and he lapsed presently into the flat, bourgeois, comparatively virtuous habits of his class.
Apart from the psychologic interest presented by such a life contrasted with such literary products, one’s interest is awakened also in the state of society that tempts a man of this sort to so strange vagaries, and could reward him with a vogue that, for the time being, the brightest writer might envy. The prevailing note in Laclos's strange work Is that of a consuming, all-perverting ennui driving the victims to the vilest excesses for relief. And lt was ennui—the hopeless, helpless weariness of an existence essentially materialistic and barren—in the upper classes of France at that period that gave his book the hold it had upon those classes. By what terrible upheaval this deadening condition was displayed history tells us. Costly as lt was in life and treasure, it restored the French Nation to a wholesome life and made possible the sound evolution that has since taken place.
