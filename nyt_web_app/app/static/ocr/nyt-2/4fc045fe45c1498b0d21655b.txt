HI.

It seems to me that those who appear so excited at the atrocity of the expression " the hair stood on end " are lacking either in e3rperience or in observation. or suppose tftat tue expression means that each particular hair stood stiff and stark at right angles with the surface and straight as a lightning: rod.
It is difficult to believe that there can be any one who has not experienced at some time, under the stress of fright or chill or other sudden and violent emotion, that sharp nervo-muscular contraction of the surface which compels the shifting of the roots of the hair and causes the lower portions of the individual hairs to assume a more erect position. The hair, being flexible and not muscular, of course cannot be raised perpendicularly by the impulse which alters the position of the portion near the root.
Have your correspondents never stroked a cat and noticed what happened to the hair upon her back?
