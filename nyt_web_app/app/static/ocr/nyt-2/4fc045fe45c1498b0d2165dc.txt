In our blessed land of freedom philosophy and politics do not have a very close connection. There is not what the economists would call an ** efficient demand M for either on the part of the devotees of the other. "We have philosophers who dabble in politics, but they are not numerous, nor are they deeply respected by the politicians. We have a certain number of politicians who dabble in philosophy, or in what answers to that name In their own minds, since they do "pander to the ' better element ” by trying to adapt their professions to some general principles of solemn apparent signification and not too recondite to be “ under-standed of the people.” It would not be difficult to indicate a gentleman in high position, whose aptitude as a politician is demonstrated by the c^nclu-sive test of the ballot box, who is truly opulent in the matter of general prin- | ciples, and who has a theory to fit any situation which arises, with or without his aid. But It cannot be maintained that his generalizations smell nf the lamp. They do not depend on the au-I Uiority of the schools. They are not | argued with respect to the works of Darwin, or Spencer, or Mr. Kidd, or Schopenhauer, or Marx. They are the normal product of a simple and sincere American mind which tests Its workings by the fundamental doctrines of the Ten Commandments or by more modern and equally unsophisticated codes of morals, of which that of Poor Richard is among: the most revered.
It is different in England. There we find still a distinct nexus between politics as it is professed in Parliament and philosophy as it is taught in the more ambitious volumes issuing from the press. Principles of considerable scope, based on reasoning scientific at ^east in form, sustained by authority, with all the pomp and circumstance of such glorious certainty as the universities c&n i_ttesl and honor, are a neccssary part of the bairgage of a leader in or a writer on public affairs. Mr. Gladstone had them in assorted variety at successive stages of his career; Mr. Disraeli, though he sniffed at the things in public, cherished a motley company of theoretical ideas in the back of his head and experimented with the advocacy of them in his books; Mr. Morley, who ought to be—but will not be—the leader of the Liberal Party when it comes shortly into power, is a theorist by nature, training, and almost by j ro-fession; Mr. Balfour finds the most exquisite pleasure of public life in abstract criticism of abstract notions, and delights to cheer his followers or confound his opponents with a prion reasoning on practical questions, which reasoning he does not permit to interfere with the aims or methods ot daily politics.
These reflections are suggested by the perusal of a very interesting volume entitled “Democracy and Reaction/’ by Mr. L. T. Hobhouse, published in this city and in London by Messrs. G. P. Putnam’s Sons. If we were called on to give a succin:t description of the elaborate work, we should say that it was the fruit of a successful search by the author for a
plausible ground of union between the Liberal Party and the English Socialists, or Collectivists, as they prefer to be called. The Liberals are In a curious predicament- They are apparently on the ove of a national victory which will compel them to take the responsibility of government, and several of ! the most conspicuous of their ideas are discredited or suspect. Their creed as it stood when they were Jast in power was opposed to Imperial ism and was In favor of home rule in Ireland. The country undoubtedly is now committed to the first and against the second of these. If the Liberals come In, as they seem bound to, it will be on the negative ground of opposition to Chamberlain's protectionism, and mere negative policy will not suffice. So Mr. Hobhouse, an able and, we doubt not, an honest Liberal, seeks a positive programme and finds it in a union with the Collectivists, for which lie argues with great earnestness in essays fairly reeking with philosophy. They make good reading. Their style is sober, vigorous, at times almost brilliant. But, oh, it is so desperately philosophic’ Certainly it will have readers, and they will take it very seriously, as, indeed, they should. But we cannot but feel that at bottom it is a party pamphlet. As such we wonder what effect it will have. One like it in this country would have mighty little.
