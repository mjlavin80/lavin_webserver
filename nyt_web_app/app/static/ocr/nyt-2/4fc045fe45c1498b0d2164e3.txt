LAST LETTERS OF AUBREY BEABDS-IJ!Y. "With an Introductory Note by the Rev. John Gray. 12mo. Pp. 153. New Yorlc:	Longmuns, Green & Co.
The modern farhlon of printing the last least word any famous man may have trusted to paper in tiie exigencies of existence has here an extreme illustration. Yet even in, this extreme case, where the absurdities, futilities, wearinesses of the method are conspicuous, there are a few compensations. The volume before us spreads over its pages a series of notes and letters written by Aubrey Beardsley du; ins the last three years of his life. Nearly all the letters are to one person; none that was written to that person, however trivial, seems to have been omitted. There- are dozens no more mlightcnlng or important or cftaraeteristic than this:
My dear Mentor:
So good of you to call for me. I will be ready at ten minutes past 11. Yours, AUBREY BEARDSLEY.
But on the other hand are letters dealing with very intimate matters like the following, referring to Beardsley's reception into the Catholic communion. The date is March 31, 1897, the place Bournemouth, where the writer lay suffering from hemorrhage and other consumptive symptoms;
My dear * * *	~
This morning I was received by dear Father B. into the Church, making my first confession, with which he helped me so kiodly. My first communion will be made next Friday. I was not well enough to go up to church, and on Friday the blessed sacrament will be brought me here. This is a very dry account of what has been the most important step in my life, but you will understand fully what those simple statements mean.
Later he adds:	.	.
Father B. did not baptize me, as he was satisfied that I had already received that sacrament with all the necessary form. You kno/w 'I have a second oiame which will make one of the St. Vincents my patron.	'
Many othetr notes deal with the distressful state of the young artist's health, many are notes of thanks for books and flowers and chocolates that read exactly like the missives dispatched* in similar cases by young women to their admirers. Here are some samples:
My Dear * * *
The chocolates were delicious.
My Dear * * *	'
You sent me most delicious chocolates. It was so good of you. How charming of the Japanese to risk a lacquered warship In a real battle.
That was in October, 1896*
Such a nice little packet of French books has reached me. How kind of you to send them. Catulle Mendes is a great favorite of mine.
Again, Beardsley writes of illustrations suggested for " Pilgrim’s Progress.” - M I wonder,” says ' he, " what * Pilgrim’s Progress ’ is like. I never read the book,’* or he scribbles the delight he has in green covered or “ primrose colored ” books, In a gift of Browning, or in having by him a complete set of Nietzsche, or Miss Burney’s novels. Then he says: ** I have been suffering dreadfully from depression. a condition which seems to me next door to criminal,” and quaintly announces his opinion that " the child who- only parts his hair when a stranger comes to lunch must be charming.” To be sure, 44 adorable ” is the word he chiefly uses— not “ charming.” When his correspondent has given him some walking sticks, for instance, he writes, “ the little sticks •were adorable.”	.
The editor professes that he has changed nothing, not even the spelling of what he has printed, but acknowledges omissions and blanking of proper names. Altogether the book seems to throw some light on the artistic temperament in general, as well as upon the character and ways of thought of the young artist, whose career was so untimely ended In March, 1&>8. For all that, it is quite impossible to see how the inclusion of many of the utterly trivial notes of thanks or regret «.dds to the light the book affords, and tlie trouble is that such Idle Inclusions are apt to make the reader scol’f at the rest.'much-of •which ^s^not matter for scoffing.
