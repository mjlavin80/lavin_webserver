N tho Old Testament beauty us an attribute of man is not only frequently referred to, but is also recognized as a distinctive endowment. The Hebrew chronicler thought while to dwell on the of the wives of the patri-in the case of Sarai (Gene-

sis, xii., 11,) and Rebecca (Genesis, xxlv., 1G:) ** Leah was tender-eyed,” (literally, . “ had dim eyes;”) " but Rachel was beautiful and well lavored,” (I. e., in feature and expression,) says the writer of Genesis, xxix,, IT. Samson’s father-in-law said, re-1	ferring1 to his younger daugh-
i ter: ** is not Tier younger sister fairer than she? ” That is, than the elder one,
(Judges, xv., 2.) The following women
also are praised for their beauty: Abigail,
(1 Samuel, xi., -V.) Uriah’s wife Balhsheba,
(2 Samuel, xi„ 2;) Absalom’s sister and
his daughter, both named Thamar, ** paJm,” <2 Samuel, xii*-, i; xiv., 27;)
Abishag the Shunamite, <1 Kings, i., 3;) Vashti and Esther, (Esther, i- 11; »•- 7:> and Job’s daughters, (Job, xlii., 15.) The prophet Amos predicts that the “ fair "virgins ” shall faint (or thirst, (viil., 13;) beauty is paralleled with maid in Zacha-
ria, ix.. 17; and Isaiah prophesies " burning " (i. of the female slaves taken In war) instead of " beauty " as the fate of the vain women of'Jerusalem, (iii.. 24.) For beauty enhanced the value of a wo-
-man captive, (Deuteronomy, xxi., 11.)
In Canticles, also, feminine beauty is both aluded to and discussed in detail, Sulamith, of course, only alludes to her charms modestly in the words, “ I am the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valleys,” (ii., 1.) But the ardent lover exclaims: “ Behold, thou art fair, my love; thou hast doves’ eyes within thy locks," &c., (iv., 3;) or, ** Who is she that lookcth forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun? " (vi., 10;) or, “ 1 will go up to the palm tree "—literally, :hy height is like unto that of the palm, (vii., 8.)
The ancient Hebrew historians even refer to the beauty of men. Joseph was "-a goodly person, and well favored,” Genesis, xxxix., 0.) David's beauty is mentioned twice; he was 4* ruddy,” (admOni, 1. e., he had a fresh, red complexion,) had beautiful eyes, and was goodly to look upon, (1 Samuel, xvi., 12; xvii., 42.) The expression " admoni,*’ ruddy, refers prob-
■	ably not to ilie color of David's hair, as the Assyriologist H. Winckler has recently maintained, in order to identify David with the sun god Marduk, for David’s wife Michal made a fly net of goat hair in exact imitation of the color of her husband's hair, as recounted in 1 Samuel, jdx., 13. and the common goats of Palestine had ordinarily black hair. Absalom Js said to have surpassed all men in beauty, (2 Samuel, xiv., 25.) A royal bridegroom is extolled for his beauty in Psalms, xiv., 2. It is not surprising, therefore, to find explicit references to male beauty in descriptions of love scenes, as in Canticles, (ii,, 3, et seq.) The two other passages in the Old Testament where the word *’ beauty” occurs with reference to men, namely, Isaiah, xxxiii., 17, and Ezekiel, xxviii., 12, will be discussed further on.
Although beauty is often mentioned in ancient Hebrew literature, especially in describing women, yet the exclamation of wonder with which, according to this literature, the first man greeted the first woman, was not, How beautiful she is! The well-known sentence, “ This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh ” (Genesis, ii., 23.) means, rather, this being is related to me in build and appearance. Adam noted in this being those
characteristics which lie had missed in all the other creatures, namely, the upright walk, the uplifted face, the readily smiling features, the intelligent eye, the articulate speech, all these characteristics designating this being as the meet helper of man. Bui otherwhere also the ancient Hebrew writings emphasize those attributes of J.he woman on which the congeniality between husband and wife are chiefly
vised, namely, the psychic gifts and endowments which divert the mind from the attributes appealing to the senses and elevate it to a higher conception of the world, gifts which may l?e further’ deyel-oped by earnest endea.vdr, and which are. therefore their own reward.' * ' * * In all the twenty-seven bodies of the New Testament the term signifying beautiful does not'occur once * in its literal sen6e in ref-erence;/ to - persons^ No ^woman is -here"", designated as being. beautiful; much, less. any^Biaiiii; The\i$nu;6ignWy^^

Correspondents of The New York Times are discussing the novels of j the Baroness Tautphoeus. Mr. Howells, in his *' Heroines of Fiction,” j had spoken of “ The Ini- j
.	uajS M as .* one 0f the i
most captivating love stories ever written,” and then remarked that " Quits,'* her second novel, had not ** the entire and - perfect fascination of i
the first"; and a critical reader says that ‘'Quits” is the better story of the two; that it Is a sure solace to one whose 1 literary palate is weary of the flavorless food now offered to the public; and that
the chapter which gives the hook its title
Is " ever a source of satisfaction and joy to the properly constructed feminine; mind.” The Rochesterlan read “ The Ini- i tials M in his boyhood and was almost as! much charmed with it as with Jane Austen’s “ Pride and Prejudice," in which the keynote of all the novels of the Baroness Tautphoeus was suggested, though she wrought it into several wonderful variations. The fascination of the heroine and the hero was overpowering for the
I youthful reader; and many of the minor
characters arc masterpieces. "Quits’' came ij Its turn and had its peculiar charm, though common sense rather than passion was its ruling motive. Strange to say, after long familiarity, the Roches-terian read both recently and found that " The Initials '* had lost its old enchantment. and that “Quits” seemed as delightful as ever. The chapter giving the title to the book is no less a jos* to the
masculine than the feminine mind; but that in which the adventure of the fisherman’s hut is described is even better, lt was in this novel that the Passion play at Oberammergau was first described to English readers; and it has never been so well described since; for the novelist lenew the peasant players of Bavaria thoroughly, and knew aiso the attitude of the foreign mind toward such a celebration as theirs, for she was an Irishwoman whose home was m the Bavarian highlands. In “ Quits," moreover, the life of that region i is sketched wiin a masterly hand. The nobles, the wood-carvers, the foresters, the villagers move about in the story as realities, and the very hailstorm on the heights is as if the hailstones were rattling around our ears. " At Odds ’’ will never take- rank with “ ^he Initials," or with ‘'Quits”; and indeed the misun-' derstandlng of the lovers is spun out alto-! get her too far; but it has a rare value' of its own. The author had the advan- j tage of knowing familiarly German wo-1 men who had lived through the Napoleonic ware, and from them she had caught the spirit of the revolutionary era and the struggle with the French Invaders: so that her account of the siege and surren-, der of Ulm and the Tyrolese revolt are ; strangely, suggestive, not taking rank witli Tolstoy’s ** War and Peace,” but next to it—at an interval. The Rocheste-rian never read but one other‘novel Of this writer, and it is little known and not
easy to buy in this country, though good critics regard it as her best. Not having had a chance to glance over it for years, he cannot say whether that opinion would now commend itself to the judgment; but " Cyrilla ” has left an impression that will never lose much of its glamour of delight and sorrow, mingling joyousness even in the shadow of mystery, and triumphant happiness suddenly shattered into tragedy. Some literary critics once on a time discussed the delicate question,
“ What heroine of fiction would you like to take in to dinner? ” As for the heroines of these novels, a boy under twenty would choose Hilda, in “At Odds"; a young fellow of twenty-five, Hildegarde. in “The Initials"; a man between that age and thirty, Cyrilla, in the story that bears her name; beyond thirty Leonora,-in " Quits," would be best. Beyond fifty one might be glad to get any of them!— Joseph O’Connor in The Rochester (N. Y.)
