NEW ENGLAND.
A Glance at the Fifth Volume of the Admirable New History of North America.*
T IS certainly true that “ New England was not only the media through which European institutions be. came American institutions, but she originated ideas that have had lasting impress upon the development of the United States.” Volume V. of the new *' History of North America,” edited by Prof. Guy Carleton Lee, treats of the colonization of New England and was written by Prof. Bartlett Burleigh James of Western Maryland College. The work is of the most comprehensive character, the chronological table beginning with the sailing of the Mayflower and concluding with the passage of the Stamp act. It was not the spirit of adventure or the love of gain that brought the men on the Mayflower to the new land. “ They came bringing with them a thirst for religious prerogative rather than for religious liberty/' They believed that they were the elect, chosen by God, “ and being the chosen, their prerogatives were not to be controverted.” In this respect the Puritans did not differ from many other sects of to-day.
Political exigency broadened the religious spirit of the colonists, and this in turn reacted upon their civic conceptions. As their jealousy of religious prerogative yielded to a better comprehension of the nature of civil administrature, civic methods came to have a preponderance over religious motives; faith came to be a function of the individual conscience rather than of the common consciousness.
rfhe legacy of the Reformation was a contest between the Conformists and the Nonconformists. Henry VIII. was an opportunist—and waited on events. Separation from the influences of the Roman Church could not be other than a gradual one. Puritanism may be described as a protest against the tardy movement of
the Reform. It was at variance with not only the Catholic Church but with the prevailing " looseness of manners,** What was lacking in the English Reformation the Puritans thought to supply
toy greater insistence, and it was “ i>OTi-
ten morality as existing In the middle classes of England which gave it Its Strength." The author follows all the intricate movements of the period, from the time when in 1567 rules were devised for worship outside of the authority of the Church. Divisions arose among the ultra-reformers, known as Congregatfonallsts and Separatists. Quarrels were unceasing. As early as 1607 and 1608 the Scrooby congregation migrated in part to Amsterdam. Later a refuge was found in Leyden. The time came when the Scrooby-Leyden congregation of Separatists determined to seek fortune and the practice of their faith in the Ne^y World. It was an epoch in the history of the United States when the Mayflower left Plymouth Sept. 16, 1C20, with 124 passengers. 22 of whom were servants and the rest colonists. In the volume there is a copy of the title page to a book of 1G1G containing *' A
Description of New England." This was the first time the term *• New Tftngiftnfl « was used. Capt. John Smith was Its author. Sixty-four days after the departure, Nov. 19, the sands of Cape Cod wot sighted. As to the characteristics of the Pilgrims the author writes:
Across the watery -waste, 'However, the Pilgrims carried not	institutions
alone, but also the narrow spirit of the Ojge,. rendered more .narrow by the of intellectual breadth and the intensity of the religious convictions of tho Scpar-alists. in transit with them wero influences of the mediaeval superstition which was to imbue New England's soil with. the blood of the innocent. But with the passing of bigotry, and the dissipating of the miasma of witchcraft, the wisdom of conservatism, as presented in that little company, was to be made clear.
'The motives which brought the Puritans to New England are carefully examined. The origins of the Connecticut and the-Rhode Island settlements are described. In 16G5, at the time of the incorporation of New Haven into Connecticut, “ the population of New England numbered from forty to forty-fivo thousand souls, of which twenty-five thousand may be assigned to Massachusetts, ten thousand to Connecticut, five thousand to Plymouth, and three thousand ^tO^Rhode Island-*' The chapter devoted to the manners, the customs, the rigorous penal laws, are of great interest	“All kinds of social re-
straints were enacted. The theology preached on the Sabbath day was as rigid as the decrees for Sabbath observances. It taught the damnation of unbaptised in* fants and all the non-elect infants whether baptized or unbaptized. Educational facilities were not given to women-’* Gov. Wlnthrop expressed contemporaneous opinion with regard to female education when he said that ** much learning was dangerous to a woman's wits/*

be little doubt that Whltefield's visit to New England brought about important changes. The final chapter treats of the causes which led to the Revolution. " Great Britain's needs and her determination to enforce Parliamentary control upon the colonies were to bring the crisis. Great Britain herself had prepared the fagots, and the colonies were ready to apply the torch." The volume is remarkable for tho excellence of its illustrations and for its admirable typography. The treatment of an extended topic is carefully and philosophically worked out.
