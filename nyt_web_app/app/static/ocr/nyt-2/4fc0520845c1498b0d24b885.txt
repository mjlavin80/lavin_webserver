The Freeing of Canada.
THE OVERLORD. The Story of tho Peons of Canada. By Allan Mclvor, Author ot " The Bride of Glendearg.*' 12mo. Pp. 423. New York:	William	Ritchie.	SI.50.
In this curiously heaped up-and involved lot of fiction are a vast number of tags and ends of stories and undigested Ideas, the winnoying of which would be hopeless here. The author conceives of the Canadian, in the first place, as a humiliated creature in .that he has no nation all his own; he is not a partner (as we have been accustomed to think him> in the great British Empire, but a slave, a peon, oppressed and abused by British satraps. The Englishman is not <as we have been accustomed to consider him) rather a fine, manly, honest, kindly fellow, with all his faults; he is a cruel and brutal beast; his Governor General in CanaOa abducts young women quite like a common ruffian—is, in fact, a common ruffian. Among the Canadians themselves the salt wherewith they are salted is found in the French habitans and the
Soots Highlanders. Of these last, the greatest, and by way of being something more than a demigod, is Donald Glendearg, whose family possesses palatinate rights (and more) in a region upon the Upper St. .Lawrence called “ the village/’ a region which he rules patriarchally and with benevolent despotism as u overlord.” It seems he is besides, in right of his wife's fortune, chief owner of most of the railways in the United States, of which country he is a citizen.
He has administered those roads also as a benevolent despot and paid his men whether the road was doing any business or not. The wicked Governor General of Canada (a commercial person named Grimes who has bought a peerage) tri^s for speculative purposes of his own to dislodge Glendearg from his palatinate, almost sovereign, rights, and when th>' partisan TSnglish court finds against him, Glendearg resorts to arms, organizes a force uf several hundred thousand men, and defies *he power of England, i J is wealth, in fact, puts him on an equality with lhe greatest nations, and the I n-} States, though ostendibly neutral, him much aid and com(ort. That nation, too, by the way, appears in this story to be changed into a benevolent despotism, and the benevolent despot (called President) seems to be Mr. Roosevelt. The war is one of horrid carnage, for the English give the order, “ No <iuarter,” but in the end, of course, the English General, Lord Pitchener, is defeated, and Canada, freed, is turned over by the victorious Glendearg to the United States. Most of the characters jn the plot are
furnished with love stories of a rather schoolboyish sort, and the overlord is provided with an attendant—an idiot boy of giant proportions, who has psychic or supernatural powers to guard his chief .from harm; It’s a very long*queer book.
