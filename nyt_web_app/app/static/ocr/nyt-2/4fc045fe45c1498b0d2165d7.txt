TALES BY TARKINGTON
rN THE! ABENA. Stories of Political Ufa. By Booth Taj-kingtou. illustrated by A- L Kfiller. Power O'Malley, and J. J. GonliL One volume, Pp. STS. Mew Yor^.: McClure, Pbllllps & Co.
In more ways than one the six short tales which Mr. Booth Tarkipgton has collected under the title ** In the Arena, ” remind one of that notable hook, “ The Gentleman from Indiana," with which he made his first bow to a public that has ever since looked for great things from him. Mr. Tarkington has given several examples of his versatility in a literary way, and haa never failed in any of them to charm and entertain his readers, but for fineness and strength, and that rarer quality of humor, nothing that he has written has exceeded the excellence of his first effort. These stories of Western politics, most if not all of which have , made a previous appearance in the magazines, are, however, of much the same calibre, and confirm the opinion that it is i their author's chief duty in life thus to | widen our wisdom from his experience to j the greatest possible extent.	,
Presumably without any very extensive j dealings with eighteenth century cavaliers or Colonial gallants, Mr. Tarkington wrote " Monsieur Beaucaire ** and “ Cherry,” than which, of their light and frivolous kind, there is none better; hut the talent for local color and the clever, indescribable touches in dialogue and comment that are the mark of the born story-teller are fax more noticeable in his work when imagination is rather at a discount and he is really writing out of his own experience and his own knowledge of people and affairs in the Middle West, particularly In- J diana. That was his advantage in “ The Gentleman,” and it is just afe plainly to be
seen and teit tn “ in the Arena.”
There is the ring of truth and reality in these stories that is lacking in just about nine out of every ten books that come to the reviewer’s notice. The characters are human and interesting, they say things worth hearing, and almost all of them are types of the men who play the game of politics. Mr. Tarkington ought to know such types, since in the intervals of writing about their interesting class he Is playing the game himself. The “ Old-Timer ” who to a certain extent assumes the part of narrator, delivers a little preface, very much to the point, upon the general reluctance of good men actually to get down into the ’* arena,” from the mistaken idea that " politics is too dirty a business for a gentleman to meddle with,” and very broadly hints that if such is the truth it is another case of the " woman who lived in the parlor and complained that the rest of her family kept the other rooms so dirty that she never went into them.** Most of the hotter class, he adds, aro content to buy -a newspaper, which is only a ticket to the amphitheatre, where the distance is hazy and for, and there ard such clouds Of dust that one can't see clearly. To make out just what is going on one must get dotVii into the arena himself. where the view he*U have and the fighting that will come his way will more than repay him if he looks for pay for doing his duty by his country and making some attempt to understand what is going on. “ Old-Timer0 seems to think that " when wrong things are going on and all the gopd men understand them that is all that is needed. The wrong things stop going on.”
** Boss Gforsett ” is a story of reform methods” coining tn contact with ward-heeler politics, and is told by this " assistant 0063/* who was compelled by the exigencies of election conditions on a certain occasion to hand over to a reformer the nomination for Mayor. It is an excellent story, most picturesquely told, and well illustrates that the. difficulties to he faced by the uninitiated ia the hand-to-hand battle of wit and ingenuity which the author dubs ** the game of politics,” are a test of a man’s personal strength about as thorough as will be found in any walk of life. No weaklings enter there. Nor is it a bad figure that Boss Gorgett himself cuts when it comes to making terms with the reform candidate, who, because he didn't know how to “ play the game,1* failed ignomlniously after talSing loudly of the fitness of his opponent for the penitentiary*
“The Aliens'* and "The Need of Money" contrast in a striking manner the pathetic attempt of an honest Italian lad to live up to republican institutions in the land of his adoption, as he understood them, and the ease and celerity with which a native-born American,
