A story or the civil war wlilch really goes by its own momentum has got to be something of a rarity. This one does go. and goes with some sweep and dash, without omitting any of the old-fashioned stage properties of romance or noble sentiment. The hero Is a Captain in the Confederate Army who is sent by Gen. Lee to ride with dispatches to Longstreet, and upon this duty meets In the dark a beautiful woman. She exclaims with horror when she finds he Is a “ rebel,” but the exigencies of military duty require him to hold her prisoner. Adventures follow thick and fast. There is a lone hut and a fierce dog, a capture by a squad of Federal cavalry, the appearance of an officer who seems to be the lady’s husband. Presently the. hero is near being: hanged as a spy, but climbs up a wide chimney from his dungeon and so escapes (with the lady’s help) In the borrowed brand-new blue uniform of a Colonel of artillery. After that a wild night ride; then the mad charge at the battle of Shenandoah, a regiment annihilated, another capture, another glimpse of the lady, a midnight rescue by Mosby and his rangers. And so on through hospital and fight to a climax where a squad of blue soldiers and a ‘squad of gray soldiers stand shoulder to shoulder and defend an old house, with a precious content of women, from murderous bushwhackers, deserters from both armies In the last days of the war. There, of course, is the lady of the North and the Confederate Captain and the villain and rival, and there, besides the siege and defense, is a duel, with incidents as dramatic as the heart of the novel reader could desire. Does the loyal lady forget that the hero Is a '‘rebel”? Has she really a husband? May the Jiero hope to win her hand and heart? The villain is a most passionate man, and green with jealousy, though by chance he wears a blue uniform.' And while his manners 'are bad, his courage IS above Question. It is a story which follows safe old lines, and follows, the.m so .well as. to be entirely readable,- If you-happen to be In that Indefinite state- where you Justwant something to read-and it you happen-Jat' the Eamc Ume to'like fetories rif love and War and merit rewarded.
