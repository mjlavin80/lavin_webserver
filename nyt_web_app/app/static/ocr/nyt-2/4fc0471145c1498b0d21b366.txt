Covering the period from the first striving of the American colonies for deserved recognition from the mother country to ,the termination of the war be^ tween the States, the author deals with the personal labors of the dozen men who, more than all others, brought about the establishment of our Republic and .guided in the days of the making. In critical periods of our history these made themselves masters of the situation, and led to the results obtained after years of struggle and tribulation, Tiie process of ihe evolution of the Nation Is thus given a biographical character in a novel method of writing history.
The stor# begins with the struggles of Benjamin Franklin in England as the agent of the colonies to secure relief from stamp duties and other annoying methods of taxation, a mission in which lie failed. That failure led to the rising of Samuel Adams of Boston as a maker of history through the media of the town meeting, of which he was the father. Adams's efforts brought about the first idea of federation in the colonies through his protests against taxation without representation, his Boston " tea parties," which voiced those protests effectively, and led to the formation of the “ Sons of Liberty ” throughout the colonies.
John Adams, that “ partisan of independence” whose tireless efforts resulted In the first Congress representing the States, and finally to the Declaration of Independence, after it was found that there would be no relief from U\e impositions the London Government imposed on tbe struggling colonies in spite of all protests, has his disheartening but ultimately successful work treated of at length. Then follows a chapter devoted to Robert Morris, whose financial skill and
personal sacrifices carried the colonies through the dark days of the Revolution, when he was Washington's mainstay and financial " right arm.”	*	.
Alexander Hamilton’s services in finding a way to a system of government by the people and from the people after the war of the Revolution had ended and the young Nation was at the mcrcy of a lot of theorists, are concisely shown, followed by a story of the almost heart-breaking efforts of George Washington to put this form of government into effect, an effort so constantly misrepresented and mlsun-dei stood that he retired to Mount Vernon disgusted wit 11 the treatment he had received at the hands of the colonists for whom he labored and who seemed always to find some renson for abusing him, even in the fnd charging him with trying to create a monarchy with himself at the head of it.
Other chapters tr^nt of lhe labors of Jefferson In introducing democracy in,his blunt fashion, to supplant the aristocracy that the colonists feared Washington and Hamilton anti tho Adamses would have established; of Henry Clay's labors in opening up trip Great West, labors that earned for him the title of “ the father of public improvements"; of Andrew Jackson, who as " the people's President,” again brought the democratic Idea to the fore, after Jefferson’s immediate successors had sidetracked it; of Daniel Webster, who, as defender of the Constitution, saved the Nation from the first proposed secession in which Calhoun and Hayne of South Carolina were the leaders; of Horace Greeley. " the anti-slavery editor/* and finally of Abraham Lincoln, that new type of American whose wise counsels brought about an end to slavery, the bone of contention in the Nation's history that made most of her troubles, , and guided the ship of state in the most* perilous part of her journey after she was fairly launched. -	*	-
