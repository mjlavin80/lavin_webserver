THE PILGRIJH'S PROGRESS. From This World to That Which Ts to Como. By John Bunyan. With Bight Illustrations in Color, by Gertrude Demain Hammond, R. I. Svo.. pp. 379. New York:
The Macmillan Company.
This attractive edition of Bunyan's famous classic contains merely the text and Gertrude Hammond’s pictures. There is no biographical preface, no commentary. But the text is handsomely printed in large, open-faced type, with the Biblical references and captions in the margin, the whole appearance of the pages most satisfying to the eye. The eight pictures, good in themselves and excellent examples of modem processes of color printing, will certainly not tend to mar the effect of the letterpress. The irontispiece represents Vanity Fair and the pilgrims with strained faces stopping their ears as they pas?, while the gay traffickers and Idlers there tempt and mock; the next represent * Christian, bowed down with his burden, and Evangelist pointing the -way across the field to the '* wicket gate." The next is Christian before the Cross, where his burden falls away, and the next a most horrific one of a scaly Apollyon, in whose middle the infernal fires burn visibly and with much smoke. The moment selected is that point of the famous fight at which Christian is down and the Evil One is about to plunge his dart into the good man's breast. Perhaps little can be said for the art in this case. The next picture represents the ascent of Christian and Hopeful through the trailing clouds of glory that hem about the City of God. The remaining three pictures illustrate the second part of the Progress; the first, Christiana and her children just as they are about to set forth; the second, tbe improving conversation between Mercy, all in gray, and worldly Mr. Brisk, in scarlet; the last, of Christiana again, commending her grandchildren to the Saviour. The volume has a square format and has a. binding somewhat richly decorated in~ orange and gold end brown and green*
