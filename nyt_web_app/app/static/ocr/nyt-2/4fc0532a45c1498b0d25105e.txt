SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS.
A New History of Science Edited by Dr- Henry Smith Williams.*
seems daring to attempt to describe the history of science within the compass of five volumes, even though they be of the generous size known to the Germans as " Handbiicher.” Yet In such a. number of volumes, of some 300 pages each, and by no meai^s of the portentous size of German handbooks, Dr. Henry Smith Williams, assisted by Dr. Edward
H.	Williams, has undertaken to review the beginnings and development of science; and he has succeeded. His labors as editor of “ The Historians’ History of the World ” and of " The History of the Art of Writing" must have aided him both to compile the history of science and to restrict it within the comparatively small space of some 1,500 pages without many noticeable omissions or slurring of important events in that long story.
“ Should the story that is about to be unfolded be found to lack interest, the WTiter must stand convicted of an unpardonable fault." So Dr. Williams begins his history. It must be said at once that the writer stands completely acquitted. Th£ story be tells, dry as it might be un-'xler certain circumstances, Is fascinating as told by Dr. Williams.	„

In effect, the plan followed by the editor in chief and his collaborator is to give a brief biography of the scientific men to whose labors the world to-day is indebted, prefacing these biographies by a brief account of the beginnings of science and connecting them by references to the circumstances amid which each investigator worked.
'* The Beginnings of Science ” is the subject of the first of the five volumes. Under this comprehensive title are described the prehistoric sciences, the wisdom of the Egyptians, the Babylonians, and the Assyrians, the development of the alphabet, and in seven chapters the rise and progress of Greek and Roman science. The idea of prehistoric sciences may seem strained and overingenious, yet, as Dr. Williams says: “It is patent enough that the veriest savage must have been an observer of the phenomena of nature. lie must also have been a classifier of his observations—an organizer of

knowledge. And In the familiar definition of Herbert Spencer, science is organized knowledge." Therefore It was scientific for primeval man to rub two sticks together to make fire, to smelt orea, to alloy copper with tin to make bronze, to cast this alloy in molds to make weapons and implements. “ The conception of fishes, birds, and hairy animals as separate classes made him a zoologist of relatively high attainments. The relatively high development of mathematics in the early historical period suggests that primeval man had attained a not inconsiderable knowledge of numbers. It would appear that the entire superstructure of later science had its foundation In the knowledge and practice of prehistoric man. The civilization of the historical period could not have advanced as it has had not there been countless generations of culture back of it. Due meed of praise must be given, then, to our primitive ancestor for his scientific attainments.”
Certainly Dr. Williams Is more generous than many writers to the prehistoric man described by Mrs. Charlotte Perkins Stetson Gilman as
*	• * an enterprising wight.
Who kept his simple instruments unusually bright;
Unusually clean he was, unusually brave. And he sketched delightful mammoths on the borders of his cave.
In his second volume Dr. Williams carries on his story through the Dark Ages, among the Arabians, tho most famous investigators of their time, Into the Western World, giving the biographies and telling of the labors of astronomers, physicists, physicians, down to Franklin raid Linr tp.
A too-	chapter	of this volume Is
entitled	Pseu dp .-Sciences—Alchemy
and Astrology.’* The demands of space must be the reason for the brevity of this chapter, for certainly the development of astrology into astronomy and the substitution of chemistry for alchemy are interesting and important in any history of science. Nor, in his place, is Lavoisier, father of modern chemistry, treated so fully as might be expected. In fact, in the history of modern science, a certain insularity seems to possess Dr. Williams, and he pays much more attention to the labors of British investigators than to those of scientists of other nations, Possibly this fact is due to the limitations of space rather than to the author’s belief that only Britons have carved their names on history’s columns.
In the last three volumes Dr. Williams treats of the modern development of the physical sciences, of the chemical and biological sciences, and of the present as-
pects of science. These are as interesting as the earlier volumes; there is no sign
*
of weariness about them; the same good, the same bad, qualities are present; insistence on the value of the work done by British naturalists, a briefer mention of that of Continental Europeans, -and still shorter comment on that of Americans. Eight pages contain all references to Agassiz; James Dwight Dana’s portrait is given, but no mention is made of his investigations—so far, at least, as the index shows; Morse is not named, nor is Edison, nor Marconi; Tesla is ignored. But Prof. Marsh is mentioned because of his discovery of the fossil horse, while the discovery of anaesthesia by Weils and Morton Is noted and due credit given to the latter for the wonderful invention.
In fact, the attitude of Dr. Williams to Western investigators is apparent from the titles of the chapters of the final volume, which deals with the aspects of recent science. These are “ The British Museum," ” The Royal Society," " The Royal Institution,’* ** Some Physical Laboratories,’* (those of Sir man Lock-yer of the University College, London, of j Sir William Ramsay,) “ The Marine Bio! logical Laboratory," at Naples, “ Haeckel (^and tho New Zoology,” “ Some Medical j Laboratories/* (Pasteur’s, Virchow’s, j Koch’s,) " Some Unsolved Scientific Prob-j lems/’ The volume might almost be a history of modern British science alone;
| to Dr. Williams, apparently, American contributions to the subject are merely incidental.
Yet in spite of this the five volumes ara extremely Interesting and cover the ground, on the whole, with very great thoroughness. It is to be regretted that the proof-reading is careless and that Dr. Williams is inconsistent in the spelling of some of the names of his heroes. One name, however, is spelled consistently— only incorrectly; Sendivogius is not Sen-divogins. An index of little value makes part of the last volume; the work is worthy of a good one, in spite of the shortcomings we have pointed out.
