Mr. McChesney, in gainsaying a popular belief that hair stands on end, is going against a venerable authority. Job (iv.,
10,) says: "Then a spirit passed before my face: the hair, of my flesh stood up." Readers of “ NOtre Dame de Paris" will recall Hugo's apt use of it where Claude Frollo thinks he sees Esmeralda's ghost on the balcony. In English we have the noun ** horripilation/’ without the verb, (horripiler, in French, but It should be found in Jacobean writers,) especially for ** the sensation or impression causing a shuddering and making the hair stand ! on end.” All from the "Latin, horreo, to ; Bhiver or shudder, and pllus, hair. It is ; allied to horrent, to bristle up. Primary j I school teachers will bear me out that i children trying to draw the human likeness under strong emotion invariably represent the hair sticking up separately and bolt upright; It is innate; for, questioned, they will answer with contempt for the ignorance of so natural and Indisputable a trait: *' Can’t you see he is fright(en)ed? ” But, which is amusing, French, herisser. to bristle, is derived from herisson. the hedgehog. (Latin, Hericius.) and hence, herisson is a spiked obstacle, used in war, a kind of Begulus barrel inside out, from that animal's mode of combat. Whatever slant the porcupine gives his arrows, at times, they do stick out upright, as is seen in a cooked one, gypsy fashion, enveloped in clay, for the whole mass is a perfect globe. As for the act, a glance at an Irritated lion, hyena, boar, or even a " hog ’'-maned pony, will show that the Tiair does stand out straight. As to us, any class of thirty scholars will boast one or two gifted, enviable urchins (T used the. word with its full meaning) who can raise their crest so the hair stands on end.
