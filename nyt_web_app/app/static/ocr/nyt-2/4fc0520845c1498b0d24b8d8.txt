An editor whose name Is well known In literature recently directed my attention to Sarah Jeannette Duncan’s novel, •* A Daughter of To-day,” characterizing lt as “ one of the great books of the last
dneacle." It seemed high praise, but I have since read the story with genuine delight. Nowadays one reads so much that is not worth while that a masterly study of a self-centred and withal honest artistic temperament Is a find to be recorded for others’ advantage.
It is not too much to say that, had this book been passed mo without clue to thfi author, I should have decided it was a recreation of Henry James’s. Miss Duncan's scalpel is lighter, but none the less unerring.
It is not well known. I am wondering if it did not appear ten years too soon, for it seems strange that so good work should be unrecognized. I shall be very glad if this little word of appreciation calls the attention of those who enjoy artistic work to a book whose reading will be its own reward.	H.	G.
