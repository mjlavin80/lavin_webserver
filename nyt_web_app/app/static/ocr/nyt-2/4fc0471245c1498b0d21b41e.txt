Miss Oly Dougall, author of	“ Beggars	®
All,'* “ The Mermaid,” ** The Madonna of	I
a Day," and other novels above the aver- H age In Interest and literary quality, is a Canadian woman, who was educated in Scotland, and has traveled extensively. Her latest novel, published in England with the title of “The Earthly Purgatory,*” has been brought out here with a new title, (on the cover and title page,)
** The Summit House Mystery.” (New York: The Funk & Wagnalls	Company,
$1.50.) The scene la laid in the	mountains
, of Georgia, and Miss Dougall’s	frequently
too fluent descriptive facility is freely ex-j ercised. There is beauty, however, in her , descriptive phrases, and she can place a scene before the reader’s eyes with just the effect she aims at.
The story concerns a mysterious crime and a strong-willed, long-suffering religious woman Is the central figure. It recalls, in the solution of the mystery, and in one powerfully dramatic passage. Miss Braddon's famous “ Henry Dunbar.” It also recalls (as vividly) superficial facts of the Eorden murder mystery at Pall River about sixteen years ago. The plot is Ingenious and sufficiently original, and is remarkably well worked out. Miss Dougall is one of the cleverest of contemporary story tellers.
Better still are the studies of character, the Impoverished Southern gentleman, returning nearly a quarter of a century after the war to his old home to work for his living; the mountaineers and the darkies. The novel has value, too, as an impartial comparison by an outsider of
Northern ajyi. Southern traits of charac-: ter. It is a readable book, and it deserves i success.
