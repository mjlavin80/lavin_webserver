j Eva Scott has added a preface to hor book on "The King in Exile: The Wanderings of Charles II. from June,	to
July,	She	explains that she has at-
; tempted to relate in some detail the story i of the first eight of the fourteen years of the exile of Charles II. Concerning ihis period, Miss Scott writes:
, These years, therefore, were years of hope, when Royalists still stood in arms In the three kingdoms, when the intervention of Europe was confidently expected, and when restoration seemed not only
possible but probable to the yearnin'* exiles. But they were also years of hope deferred, years that saw the gradual sickening of the heart, the growth of divisions and dissensions in the Rovalist ranks, the steady decay of morals among men capable of a splendid devotion, but not proof* against all the misery it involved. And to many came the bitterest pang of all in the knowledge ihat ihrsp years* had witnessed also the dishonor oi thoir King.	.
The author obtained material for the book from collections in England mid from English and foreign works on the subject. She will be recalled as the author of *' Rupert, Prince Palatine.’.; " The King in Exile’" is published by EL P. Dutton
&	Co., who wiU probably bring out "a second volume, which Miss Scott has ip preparation, relating to the last six years o£ Charles II.'s exile.
