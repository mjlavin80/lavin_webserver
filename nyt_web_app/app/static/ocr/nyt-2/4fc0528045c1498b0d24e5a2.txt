SIR WALTER RALEIGH,
. ; ■■ - - ■ - ... .■ A New Biography of the Gallant Gentleman of the Elizabethan Era ' ■ by Sir Rcnnell Rodd.*
[AT. flash of romanticism which illumines the Elizabethan era* would lose much of its intensity without Sir Walter Raleigh. The man’s merits, and faults have been frequently discussed, and yet certain incidents in his life remain enigmatical. Sir Rennell Rodd concedes the difficulties, though he has done his best as far as study goes, toward the solution of many mysterious actions on the part of the gallant Englishman. King James I. was something of a pedant, whose tongue was too large for his mouth, and who was both revengeful and cruel, and it was he who caused the execution of Walter Raleigh, The day of Raleigh's birth cannot be exactly fixed, but according to the most careful research it was in 1552. Where he first saw the light was long a subject of dispute. Now it is believed that he was born at East Budleigh, situated between the Otter and the Exe, As to the spelling of his name among his contemporaries there were many variants. Sir Walter himself was apparently inconsistent, for in a deed of 1578 there are not less than three different spellings, as Ral'eigh, Rawlygh, and Rawleyghe. But Raleigh is to be accepted, because it was adopted by his noble wife. Little is known of his early home life. He went to Oriel College, Oxford, in or about 1568, so the old story goes, but that is not positive. Anyhow, he did not take his degree, for Walter Raleigh was off for. the wars before his time.	-■
Sir Rennell Rodd's record of social life during the two decades of the reign of Queen Elizabeth gives a clear insight into actual conditions. The dominant classes in England were pervaded with the speculative forces of the Renaissance. There was " a growing tendency to luxury and magnificence." Italian culture had brought to England Italian artists; Italian literature held its sway. The author believes that two books, Macchiavelli’s “ Principe *’ and particularly Castlglione’s " Cortegio,” exercised a marked influence on Raleigh's life. Cortegiano wias the hero whose ideal was the knightly gentleman, who was skillful with weapons, but at the same time must be a poet and capable of turning a sonnet. Supposably at an early age Raleigh dropped his college textbooks and sought, foreign service as a soldier of fortune. Washe one, of the members of a troop of gentlemen who espoused the side of the Huguenots? Was he present at the battle of Malprtaquet or at Jarnac? If he served in France, there is some certainty that he was in England in 1574, for his name is on the register of the Middle Temple of that year. The name was spelled Rawely. Some of Raleigh’s contemporaries tell of his having seen service in the Netherlands under Sir John Norris. It seems positive that he was preparing to accompany Sir Humphrey" Gilbert on an expedition against the Spaniards, which, was a failure, as lt was stopped by order of the Privy Council. Now appears for the first time the name of “ Raleigh.” In 1577 he had been introduced.at Court, “perhaps in the suite of the Earl of Essex.”
When the Spaniards sent men to Ireland, Raleigh’s help was called upon. He was made commandant of a footband of 100 men, and his pay was 4s. per diem* The Spaniards were considered bandits, anct when captured w^re killed by the English. “ The value set on human life/* Sir Rennell Rodd writes, “ varies with social and geographical conditions.*' If the Irish were brutal, so were ,the English. Raleigh was sent to England with dispatches, and the story of his gallantry attracted the notice of the Queen. Certain suggestions of the young man received ‘ the attention of the higher authorities, for in Burleigh’s handwriting there is a paper headed, *'The Opinions of Mr, -n.awley.” Among ..ie Queen’s ladies was Mistress Katherine ABhley, and it may be that through her there came about an introduction to Elizabeth. Fuller is authority for the often-repeated incident of the cloak cast by Raleigh at the feet of the Queen, so as to save the shoes of the illustrious lady from the mud. In the original it reads: '* Her Majesty meeting a'plashy place, Raleigh cast off and, spread his new plush Qloak on the ground, whereon the Queen trod gently over, rewarding him afterward with many suits for bis so free and seasonable tender of so fair a footcloth,” ’ Anyhow, the demands made on him for personal service began at this time. Ought we to call Queen Bess the " English Cleopatra”? Just then the Duke of Anjou was one of the suitors of the lady. When compared as to looks with .Raleigh, it was all in favor of the Englishman. He certainly was handsomer than either Leicester or Essex. . The portraits of the man show his distinguished^ appearance. He dressed In the’ height .of* fashion and wore much-jewelry.

Sir Rennell Rodd gives Ralcigli the credit of having founded a club, the object of whictr^was to give information from the leading authorities of the times. The meetings at the Mermaid Tavern, he_ thinks, were in a measure due to Sir Walter, and thither came Shakespeare, Ben Jenson, Donne, Beaumont, Fletcher, and Cotton.
A horror of persecution and a genuine love of toleration were the characteristics of Raleigh throughout his public life, and as a consequence he was perhaps more unpopular with the clergy of his day than with any other class. He was in advance of his age in opposing any enactment making the attendance of public worship compulsory under pain of banishment.
Now had come the zenith in the careor of Raleigh. Essex had returned from the Nfetherlands and he was a rival. It is not necessary to go over the efforts made by Raleigh looking toward the settlement of Virginia, which proved to be a failure at the time, but which eventually led to the greatest of modern events, the opening to civilization of a new world.
In the fight with Spain and the destruction of the Armada, he took a notable part. It was Raleigh who wrote in the "History of the World”: "It is impossible for any maritime country not having its coasts admirably fortified to defend itself against a powerful enemy that is master of the sea.T* The next few years are difficult to follow. ’ The Queen was capricious. When Essex married he fell into disgrace. Raleigh was occupied with the expedition to be sent to the Azores. To accomplish this he spent all his money and borrowed largely. Why it was that the Queen was angered is not made clear. Anyhow, after sailing, Raleigh was recalled and was put under arrest and confined in the Tower. Was it his marriage with Elizabeth Throgmorton which had been the cause? Raleigh's brain was throbbing with ideas of finding gold in Guiana. El Dorado he thought could be reached. The Queen had forgiven him. In 1595 he set sail for the South American coast. Save for conflicts with the Spaniards, the result was insignificant. Certainly the most brilliant of all the actions of Sir Walter was when he participated in the attack and capture of Cadiz. The decline of Spain began then. Returning to England, he was most graciously re-celved by her most capricious Majesty. An attack was planned on the Azores, but it was not successful.
Another inexplicable tangle followed, in which Cecil, Essex, and Cobham were involved. After the death of the Queen the many enemies Raleigh had made all seem to have joined their issues in opposition to him. Sir Walter was accused of conspiring against King James. It was asserted that he wished to place Arabella Stuart on the throne. He was arrested and confined in the Tower, Then his trial for treason began. He was sentenced to dea.th. How he escaped the headsman at the time is not made clear.
: In prison he remained for nearly twelve years.' His loving wife shared the prison with him, and his other solace was the writing of books. The greatest of hia books is “ The History of the World,"
Mean James’s antipathy to Raleigh may be noticed in his criticism on certain passages in “ The History of .England,’.’ as 4t too saucy in censuring the acts of Princes.*’ Did Sir Walter pay for his release In .money or promises'? How did he obtain permission to take charge of an another. expedition to Guiana? Had it been decided that if Raleigh returned without any gold his life should be forfeited? What had Gondomar, the Spanish Minister in London, to do with it all?
In 1617 the little expedition sailed. An attack on the English was made by the Spaniards on the land and Sir Walter’s son George was killed. Then the infuriated Englishmen took their revenge. The expedition was a failure. No sooner was Raleigh in England than he was rearrested. Surely King James had sent Raleigh off, “with a halter around his neck.’* The Spanish Government would have liked to carry Raleigh to Madrid and there hanged him. The charges of the old trial were revamped, and Raleigh was
doomed to death. On the morning of his last day, “ he breakfasted and smoked his last pipe of tobacco." Just before his head - was stricken off it was suggested that he should turn hia face, toward the east. His last words: “ What matter which way the head lies, so the heart be right?” The date of’ his execution was Oct, 29, 1618,
