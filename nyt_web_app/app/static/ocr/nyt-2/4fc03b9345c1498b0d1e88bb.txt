THE DOUKHOBORS.
Aylmer Maude's Story of the Development of a Peculiar Russian Sect.*
sT a review or s. book such as is Mr. Aylmer Maude's " Peculiar People." the subject being the Doukhobors, a Russian religious sect, a portion oC which has migrated to the Dominion of Canada, the wisest course is to summarize, with no comments. The presence of the Doukhobors. in Canada and the strange conduct of some of the* sect are well known in. the Vnited States. The general public is less familiar with the influences of Tolstoy and their effect on certain classes of "Russians. The precise belief of the Doukhobors is not easy to determine. As to Mr. Maude, he was certainly actuated by the broadest philanthropic motives. He took a leading part in the movement of bringing the Russians from the Caucasus to America. Perhaps he was somewhat imbued with the Tolstoyan philosophy, and (he ideal was certainly high. Whether Mr. Maude still holds to this ideal may be questioned.
In a chapter called "Sources of Douk-hoborism " religious differences in Russia are considered. There never was in Russia a convulsion like the Reformation, which rent Western Christendom in twain. But there always has been dissent. In the fifteenth century there was a sect known as the Judaizers, which combined Jewish tendencies with rationalism. Few take note of the fact that in Southern Russia many of the original barbarians were converted to Judaism. Go to the east side of New York to-day and you wilt see orthodox Jews who show anthropologically barely any trace of Semitic origin. 11 The Judaizers denied the divinity ot Christ and rejected the worship of icons." In 1504 the heresy wa^ crushed. Many were burned* Some, having escaped, were known afterward as Sabbatarians. The Reformation had then some slight effect in Russia, for in 15*23 there was a Reform Church at Riga, and the author writes: " The effect of Protestantism in strengthening and encouraging Russian dissent is from this time onward a constant though never a very prominent factor."
Now came the Anabaptists, and no other sect suffered as much. Innumerable were the dissenters, and their leaders for the major part were burned to death. One important schism is known as the Raskoiniks. It began with the differences on certain points of ritual, as ** how the name of Jesus should be spellel. what shape the cross shouAJ have, whether two or three fingers should be extended in making the sign of the cross, and whether * Hallelujah * should be sung twice or three times." During the minority of Peter the Great the Tsareviia persecuted the Rasgolniks with “ indescribable, ferocity." For more than thirty years the policy of extermination was carried out. Between 16o7 and 1700 8,834 men, . women, and children were consigned to the flames. But the Raskoiniks would not down, for the sect even increased in numbers. To-day there are from 12,000,000 to 15,000,000 Raskoiniks in Russia. Whether Danelo Filipo-vitch, a dissenter from the Raskoiniks was the founder of the new religion of the Doukhobors is not clear. He made converts, and among them an Orthodox Bishop, who was tortured and burned in the presence of Peter the Great. In Moscow some of the followers of Filipo-ritch were called Hllats, or whippers, ^ie application of the scourge being a part of their act of devotion.
Toward the middle of the eighteenth century some Quakers paid Russia a visit. They seem ~to have made some converts, for in 1746 an edict was issued condemning their doctrine. Mr. Maude is decidedly of the opinion that the Douk-_ hobors did not take their belief from, the Quakers. In ono essential point the Doukhobors differ from tho Quakers, the first placing implicit faith and obedience In a leader whose word is law. Describing the period when Doukhoborlam took actual form, the author writes:
These were the times when serfdom was being enforced in Its worst form. Its evils were almost beyond exaggeration. The wives and daughters of the serfs were at the mercy of the proprietors. Runaways were sometimes drowned or otherwise done away with, simply to save the trouble of restoring them to their owners: sometimes they were presented as a gift, or as a bribe, to an official. The general disorder baffles description. Monks in the monasteries entered Into league with brigands. as also did priests* The highest officials were occupied with a series of palace revolutions, and the whdie policy of Russia turned, at times, on the amatory Intrigues of people, among whom Catharine the Great stood out as an exception rather by her ability than by her unblushing profligacy.	.
The high ideals of the Doukhobors were conspicuous, that Is to say jat the beginning. The distinguishing trait was the rejection of alt external authority. There was mystery in' their faith, and the power of what was called the "voice within.” Toward the close of~ the eighteenth c£n-

tury there were many groups of Doukhobors scattered in various parts of Russia. The Government had not omitted the punishment of them, for many of the sect were banished to ’Finland, Archangel, and Siberia. In 1803 stringent measures were adopted by the Emperor. One of the exiled colonies was visited by the English Quakers in 1810. The record of this visit has been kept. About this time many charges were brought up by the Russians against the sect, including murder. The methods of the Emperor Nicholas I. were, always drastic, and in 1839 he had all the Doukhobors from the milky waters on the Sea of Azof shipped to the Caucasus. The Government, the author tells us, entertained the hope that the transportation of the sect from a healthy to an unhealthy country might in time get the better of such troublesome subjects. But much to the disappointment of Nicholas, the Doukhobors increased in number in their new surroundings. Once more that tender representative of Russian force, the Cossack, was let loose on the sect. Every effort was made to uproot the villages. It did look as if the Doukhobors would be annihilated. Then was it that Tolstoy brought before the English public the terrible facts, and in 1SD5 The London Times printed an account of the Doukhobors and vouched for them with a letter from Tolstoy. Mr. Maude and Prince Hilkoff, with two Doukhobor families, left England In 1S9S for Canada. The Canadian Government consented to receive the Russians, giving all the necessary aid. Means were subscribed in England, and the exodus began. In 1809 two shiploads of the 11 Peculiar People " reachcd the New World and found a home in the Assininiboia and Saskatchewan countries.
Is it necessary to offer ah apology for what we might call the obstinacy of the " Peculiar People" ? In their new quarters they gave a great deal of trouble. They declined registration, and also to give any account of either their deaths or births. One source of constant annoyance was their aiherence to the orders of their so-called leaders. How well fitted may be Peter Verigen to be their autocrat cannot be determined. Certainly lie has written a superabundance of trash. How are you to expect that men and women who have lived for two centuries under persecution should be either cultured or gifted with the power of adaptation to new surroundings? Certainly the Canadian authorities have shown much patience with the new-comers. That the Doukhobors were suspicious may be laid at the door of their former masters. They are subject to what is called a psychic religious epidemic. During 1901 and 1902, when Peter Verigen wd& expected, their aglta-
; t!on'was extreme. Then there was among them a. fanatic, Bodyyansky, who insisted tra a pilgrimage. He told the poor people. that,they had .only to walk far enough and they would find God. A pilgrimage was determined on. Among some of the absurdities emanating from this fanatic was that it was wicked to expect cattle to serve man's wants; that the use of metal was a sin as well the wearing of certain clothes. Even leather was tabooed, but rubber boots, might be used. A pilgrimage of crazy people Set forth, met with bad weather, and many of the Doukhobors suffered from exposure. Of course such stupidity rather extinguished the sympathy of the English and the Canadians. Finally the long-desired leader, Verigen, came to tnem. and there was an end to their absurdities for the time.
