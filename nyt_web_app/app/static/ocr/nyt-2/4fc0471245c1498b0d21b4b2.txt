ASSING over lor the moment the excellent bookinaliing features of what is a genuine definitive edition of Laurence Sterne, it is interesting1 to turn to the first of the three volumes of " Letters ’’ to see what the editor. Prof. Wilbur L. Cross of Yale, has made of the numerous collections of Sterne correspondence published in the eighteenth century anil whether he has been able to incorporate any genuine fragments which have uoi yet met the public eye. In the first place, we are informed that the only material made use of la authenticated by the British Museum and authorities on English literature, both in England and America. Thus at once are swept asido those palpable forgeries of the Eliza-Vorick correspondence, which, for lack of any genuine effusions from Eliza's own pen, had been eagerly read and more or less accepted by Sterne’s admirers.
It may be recalled that Yorick mentions in bis letters to Eliza a *' journal " which he is keeping during their separation. This journal, long supposed to bo lost, was found years ago by Thomas Wash-boume Gibba of Bath :unong some old books and papers inherited from his father. With the journal were also autographic originals of several letters written by Eliza. When Tliackeray Was delivering his lectures on 11 The English Humorists of the Eighteenth Century ’* Mr, Gibbs loaned him the manuscripts. Thackeray, in his lecture on " Sterne and Goldsmith," and later on In the published editions of that Iccture, makes generous use of the letters to castigate Sterne more severely, but curiously enough overlooks the journal, which would have been of even greater aid to his animus. On the death of Mr. Gibba, in 1804, the manuscripts went to tho British Museum. There Percy Fitzgerald saw them, and was so impressed by their importance that he rewrote his " Life " of Sterne, originally published about 1865.
With the Gibbs manuscripts interpolated with trustworthy material already published, the romance of Eliza and Yorick, or. rather, the infatuation of the Rev. Mr, Sterne for Eliza Draper, the wife of an East Indian official, becomes almost a complete and coherent narrative, although Eliza's “ journal " is still missing. Among the manuscripts reproduced in the first volume of letters in the York Edition are Sterne's "journal" and a hundred-page letter written by Mrs. Draper to Mrs, James, in which the writer tells the story of her connection with Sterne and his family and expatiates, upon her literary aspirations. There is also a crude draught of a letter from Sterne to Mr. Draper, wherein the chastc character of Yoricks passion for Eliza Is demonstrated. Three letters that Eliza wrote on the day of her elopement with Sir John Clark have also been obtained and incorporated.
In his introduction to the volume dealing with the Draper-Sterne episode Prof. Cross has briefly drawn from the mass of material on the subject sufficient authoritative 3ata for his purpose. We I earn that Daniel Draper, in 1750, married Elizabeth Selater, who was then fifteen years old, and twenty years, his junior. We also learn of the journeys one or tho other or both of the Drapers made between England and India, and, finally, of the meeting of Sterne and Mrs, Draper in tho Winter of 17G7, when Sterne was fifty-four and Mrs. Draper twenty-three. Prof. Cross then gives the story of tho friendship thus begun in the light of the material which is to follow. He also tells us of the circumstances in which Mrs. Draper was induced to publish, in 1775, the ten letters she had received fromt Sterne in the Spring of 1707. A history of the Gibbs manuscripts and a detailed description of their features como next, as well as a brief commentary on tho Gibbs-Thackeray transaction, into which have been Incorporated the letters received from Thackeray by Mr. Gibbs. The body of the book opens with a reprint of Mrs. Draper’s edition of ** Letters from Yorick to Elisa.” This is followed by tho ** journal" from tho Gibbs manuscripts, by letters from the same source and others, and the volume closes with “ An Eulogy ” by the Abb£ Raynal, reproduced, from The European Magazine for March, 1784, when it appeared translated from the original in tho “ Histoire Philosoph-lque et Politique."
Although providing much cntertainmom for readers of polite literature, the new material Included in the York Edition cannot be said to throw any new light op Lkurenco Sterne or offer the basis for a new point of view. At the same time, it makes the reader more intimately acquainted with noor, melancholy Yorick and the sentimental, capricious Eliza than would otnerwise be possible, Moreover, it brings into striking prominence and emphasis those traits in the character of

Sterile which Thackeray so ironically pointed.
The York Edition of the Complete Works of Laurence Sterne is thus divided: ** Tristram Shandy ’’ has four volumes, " A Sentimental Journey ” one, “Letters” two, "Sermons’* two, while, as a fitting conclusion to the issue is Percy Fitzgerald's “ Lac ” in two volumes. Tho editorial work by Prof. Cross, whether of an introductory character or in the shape of notes, or in the correction of numerous errors or the exclusion of spurious material, is of a high order and speaks well for the gentleman’s schoUirship no less than for his just appreciation of the duties of editor. Tho mechanical features or the edition are in keeping with the eaitorship. A Scotch pica type, which makes a tme impression on tho Irish linen paper employed, was especially imported bv The Westminster Press for tiie work. The result is an amply leaded and generously margined page, presenting a fine bookish appearance. The volumes are bound in green linen, with paper label. The text is illustrated by over sixty etchings and photogravures, including reproductions from Sir Joshua Reynolds, Gainsborough, Stothard, Crulk-shank, Hedouin, Furniss. We also have r&» productions in photogravure of the portraits of Sterne's friends. Lord Spencer and John Hall Stevenson, the originals of which are preserved tn Skelton Castle. In a word, tiie York Edition is the most satisfactory interpretation that WO liavo hitherto .seen of him Who was the gayest, kindliest humorist of hts time, the most ardent yet inconstant lover, and the most facilo writer, whose spirits seemed always to be running a race with his gooseciullls, terminated only by nis death.
