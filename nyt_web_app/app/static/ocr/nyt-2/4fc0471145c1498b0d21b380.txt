BITERS on the negro problem tend more and more to treat the several possible solutions of that ugly question rather as they might harm the white man than as they might help the negro. The consensus of these writers—North or South—unless they are negroes or extreme negrophiles—seems now to prefer the greatest good of the greatest number. Practical minds are apt to take the problem this way: What is to be done for the betterment of the negro, provided always that something does not work to the tinjury of a dominant race whose well-being is of vastly more importance both to the country and the world? It seems a reasonable view, though, no doubt, to the negro it looks hard. There was a time when the attitude was different; the white man was not considered at all; the proclaimed object was merely to raise the negro. Education was to do it—and amalgamation. Few seemed to bother about what amalgamation would do to the whites or consider whether it. was wise, or even humane, to set back
70,000,000 in order to set forward 10,000,000. In the volume in hand. Prof. Smith of Tulane University has planted himself squarely upon the proposition implied in the phrase just used, a proposition which he considers as mathematically inexorable as that 2 and 4 divided by
2	is only 3. In Prof. Smith’s judgment, the chief thing to do is to prevent " mon-‘grelizatton " of the white race in the South, and eventually in the whole country, and no mistaken kindness for the negro ought to permit an instant's dalliance with anything which may tend that way. That there is danger of such mongrelization, provided attention Is not called to the danger, the author is certain. He admits that he feels strongly on the subject, and he defends with a vast array of historical and anthropo-metrical data what some call race prejudice and what he calls race instinct. To this very instinct he thinks the country must trust In the present emergency. The question of the 41 inferiority ” of the negro he sets out pro r.nd con at great length, and proves that inferiority by a very complete argument. Yet as a matter of fact he considers the thing self-evident. Apart'Yrom academic discussion, of course, and taking each race by and large, it is self-evident, else the negro would not be what he is nor the Caucasian what he is. Here is one of Prof. Smith’s pasages which is striking and characteristic.
Why does the South, if she be right in this matter, find the virtue and intelligence of the world arrayed against her? We answer, the overmass of adverse authority is indeed immense, but it is weightless. The testimony of the North and	of	Europe is	hardly more
relevant than would be that of the Martians. For in neither has the race question yet presented itself as a serious, practical matter: for them the Black Peril	has	no	existence.	Hence their
treatment of the subject is merely academic and sentimental. They have generous ethical ideas, respectable but well-worn and overworked maxims, high humanitarian principles, and these they ride horseback. For them the negro is a black swan, a curious and interesting specimen in natural history; and they	have	no	hesitancy	in extending
their sympathy, their hospitality, and their	co-operation. But	the practical
problem never confronts them in its unrelieved difficulties and dangers. The possibility of race contamination is not suggested to them, or, at least, it never comes home to them, and they yield freely to their philanthropic impulses, not thinking whither these would lead them, not seeing the end from the beginning. Southern hearts are not less benevolent than Northern, but Southern eyes are of necessity in this matter wide open, while most others are shut.
That the negro in all the ages has done nothing for himself which may stand even remote comparison with what the white race has done Is to Prof. Smith’s mind ample proof that the root of the matter is not in him. If the white race is twenty centuries ahead in civilization,' It is not accident but something In the white man which has made it so. The undoubted accomplishments of negroes under the hothouse Influences of white contact argues In the professor’s mind only this, that whatever the negro gets must be given him—and as a corollary in the present instance in America whatever he gets the white man must lose. *
This leads up to a point upon which Prof. Smith insists strongljs, and buttresses his insistence with many statistics and no little ingenuity and eloquence. It is that education cannot do for the negro what nature has refused to do. He shows how wide is the gap between the best that the negro has done and the achievement of the white, and concludes:
Now, if nature and the tide of time have spent such centuries of centuries In ch is Ming out this chasm, how infinitely preposterous to suppose that man can close it up in a generation with the filmy
webs- of common culture: and social equality, and civil rights,-and partisan legislation, and caricatured - religion, and tne political spoils of tho country Post Office. As well expect to rise from the*floor to the roof without ever traversing the intervening space! .
As tc the economic future of the negro, even if he accepts the gospel of the Principal of Tuskegee, Prof. Smith can * find no ultimate comfort for that sturdy , laborer in his race’s vineyard. He adverts to the well-known ways of labor unions, ■ more and more in control of all skilled trades, and says:
■	There Is not the' slightest probability that the great labor organizations would, in general, think of admitting1 to their membership an element of such J^aK-ness as the negro would certainly be. Such would be the case even if other considerations were absent. ±>ut they are present. As inferiors, accustomed to a lower standard of life and more pliant to the demands of employers, the negroes would present the same problem and the same menace as the Chinese-only in a more aggravated form. In their admission in large numbers to the rs-riKa of skilled labor, this latter could irot fail to see a terrible and instant threat of reduced wages, of lowered life, of baser thralldom. Race prejudice, if you call it so. would blaze out immediately, and with irresistible violence. It makes not the slightest difference ^whether labor would be right or wrong, justified or unjustified,
It would be the instinct of self-preservation, fanned suddenly into a flame, and nothing could withstand it.
Briefly, then. Prof. Smith sees the negro crowded back to his old work of hewer of wood, drawer of water, personal attendant, farm hand, and the like, and Booker T. Washington in the end able to do no , more for him than Du Bols and the others j who believe in the higher education as a : panacea. Even thus, the full fortune of j the negro is not told. For as the world i moves on his agricultural opportunities will grow narrower, and personal service Is about all that is left. There is no room for him at the top, he complains with quite comprehensible bitterness. But there Is none. And at the bottom there will bt less and less. So Prof. Smith sees for him the same end as that of the Indian, disappearance, slow but sure, from
off the face of the land, the weaker going to the wall as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, wherever philanthropy and humanitarian motives have not warped the spirit of nature’s laws, standing as they do always on the side of the strong, in order that the race may flourish; considering that and not the individual. the whole and not the fraction. Thus as the country has less and less use for the negro, he will cease to be. It will be a race lost, but an inferior race; it were better so than that the superior race were set back In~ its career—tainted forever with a blood which has shown in all the ages no power to help itself.
The doom that awafts the negro has been prepared in like measure for all inferior races. Rxcept where they are bulwarked by the climate, they must be
drowned by the mounting wave of their superior rivals. To the clear, cold eye of science the plight of these backward peoples appears practically hopeless. They have neither part nor parcel in the future history of man: they are rejected as dross from its thrice-heated furnace. This may sound harsh and unfeeling, but in reality it is not so. We do not mean that the Inferior should be treated unjustly, unkindly, inhumanly. Far from It. Let equity be dealt with an even hand. We have never given either voice or vote for any form of injustice, however specious or plausible, or grandfatherly. The processes we have in view are deeper than any legislation.
The single alternative is amalgamation, rr.ongrelization. No one can blame the negro, and Mr. Smith does not blame him, for looking to that as his hope—desiring It. No one can blame the white man for shrinking from the idea with horror, with a vision of negroid descendants to come after him and rule in his place. Prof. Smith thinks, and the South thinks, It is a high duty to keep that horror before the eyes of the people, that the race “ instinct " may not be drugged to sleep by mistaken humanltarlanism. His notion is that nature is wiser (in secular processes) than any philanthropist, enthusiast of a downtrodden class or race. As to what is actually happening, he devotes his last chapters to showing that the negro .is weakening, slowing down, beginning the process of extinction. As he presents them, the figures certainlv hint as much. The rush to the towns is impairing the vigor of a great part of the race; the death rate increases, the birth rate decreases, and, above all, he finds that the old hopeful buoyancy which marked the negro while, sheltered under the institution of slavery, he was spared competition with the whites, has with that competition to face steadily declined, as failure has followed failure. It is all very gloomy for the negro. Obviously less gloomy for the nation saddled with a population it doesn't know what to do with. And, obviously, there is much truth in lt, even though it may be Prof. Smith has allowed his predispositions to color his conclusions somewhat.
