Two new additions to automobile literature are appearing. One is ” Self-Propelled Vehicles; A Practical Treatise, with Illustrations and Diagrams," by J. E. Homans, M. A (8vo. Pp. 672, Bound In black vellum. Gilt top. Gold title. New York:	Theodore Audel & Co. $2;) the
other, “ The Complete. Motorist,*’ by A. B. Filson Young. (8vo. Pp. xxiv. plus S68. Ulustrated. New York: McClure, Phillips & Co.)
The book by J. E. Homans is a revised and partly rewritten edition. It is a treatise on the theory, construction, operation, care, and management of all forms or automobiles. It contains over 500 illustrations and diagrams giving the essential details of construction and many important points on the successful operation of the various types of motor carriages driven by steam, gasoline, and electricity. The frontispiece is ft. half-tone reproduction on Japan paper of a portrait of Gottlieb Daimler, inventor of the practical high-speed gasoline motor, and ” father of the automobile.”
The automobile, considered as a practical machine, occupies a peculiar place, both from mechanical and popular points of view. It must be carefully designed and thoroughly equipped co serve Its purposes tinder all the trying conditions of its use. It must, furthermore, be of simple and strong construction, so as to render disablements in service and consequent Repairs—often at points distant from raeohanies skilled in the special field —as few and as unimportant as possible. Last, but most conspicuous, It must be readily controlled and operated in the large majority of instances by persons who do not consider that the pleasures derived from 44 motoring ” warrant them in becoming well-informed in engineering matters.
The opening" chapters treat of the general principles of automobile construction and operation. Then follow over 100 pa£es on an account of the theory, construction. and operation of gas engines.
There 1b also a long chapter on the description of leading types of gasoline vehicles, including the most important American makes. And several chapters are devoted to the vehicles run by electricity.
A. B. Filson Young, who is the author of " The Relief of Mafcking/' ** Master-singers,” ** Ireland at the Cross Roads,'* ftc.* declares in the preface to his “Complete Motorist” that he has attempted to deal with the whole subject-historical. technical, critical, practical, human, and sentimental. He. has tried to write the kind of book that he has wanted to read since he became interested in motoring. He describes some of the best makes of automobiles, but has nothing to say concerning marine and cycle motors.
The author writes about self-propelled vehicles, from the first attempt, in 1000, of the mathematician Simon Stevln down to the present day. The volume is profusely illustrated with photographic reproductions and diagrams. Two inter-estlng chapters are given to a consideration of motor literature and accessories and to letters by Kipling, Lady Jeuno, Horace Plunkett, J. St. Los Strachey, Charles Jarrott, and Major Lindsay Lloyd, In which each writer tells why he or she likes motoring, its influence on the nation, and some incidents. Another chapter is on motoring abroad—in France, i Itqly, Austria, and Germany. The frontis-1 piece is a photogravure reproduction of i the painting by Paul Gervais, '* L’effrol,” In which some wood nymjflis are surprised In their gambols by an automobile.
