Latest Scientific Knowledge.
Under the title. " The New Knowledge,” A. S. Barnes & Co. will issue early In March the first volume in The New Science Series, written by Prof. Robert Kennedy Duncan, editor of the series. It Is a popular account of the new theory of matter and the relations of the new physics and new chemistry to other sciences. Laymen in science. Prof. Duncan eays, ar^ usually limited to popular pseudo-science or to technical books.
