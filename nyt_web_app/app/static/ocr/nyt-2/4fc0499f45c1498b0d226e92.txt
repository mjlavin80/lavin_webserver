HERE Is no Thackeray land in the sense that there is a land of Scott (all Scotland/ and a land of Bums. Even the London of Thackeray-may not he as clearly traced as that of Dickens. So much Mr, Lewis ■ Melville admits in the very beginning of his npw book in Tho Pilgrimage Series,
“ The Thackeray Country,” (New York: The Macmillan Company, - $2.) It was Thackeray's .aim, he infers., ,to create “ atmosphere,” rather than, to describe locality.
Who remembers where the Sedleys went from Russell Square after the crash? Yet who does not recall, even without an effort of memory, that It was a shabby genteel neighborhood—whether It was in Brompton or off the Edgeware Road, or in some distant suburb, is immaterial. As a matter of fact, the chronicler tells us that the Sedleys removed to St. Adelaide's Villas, Anna Maria Road, West.
Others before Mr. Melville, who has lately turned out a readable biography of the great novelist, have written of Thackeray land. Our own W. H. Rlde-ing’s “ Thackeray’s London '* was published in 1885. Eyre Crowe wrote and illustrated *' Thackeray’s Haunts and Homes ” and “ With Thackeray in America." William Sharp has recently written
on " The Literary Geography of Thackeray/’ Mr. Melville expresses indebtedness to these writers and to Mr. James MacVicar, who will contribute *' topographical introductions” to a forthcoming •* London" edition of Thackeray’s novels, to Miss 6. E. Mitton, the historian of London Inns of court, and Mrs. Ritchie.
His book is largely devoted to London, with three chapters on Paris, the rest of the European Continent, and America. It Is a pity he has placed Beacon Street in . New York. That is the sort of a slight no Englishman would wittingly put upon a Bostonian, feoreover, Boston still needs its Beacon Street and all its traditions, while New York can get along without them.
Thackeray’s London, so far as it can be defined, all lies in the centre of tilings metropolitan. It comprises neighborhoods every visitor to London knows. It is agreeable to ramble with Mr. Melville through the Temple, the Chancery Lane and Holborn district, Bloomsbury, and the West End. He writes with vivacity, his descriptions are brief, his quotations apt, and one who knows both London and Thackeray reasonably well will find this a charming book for an idle hour. The pictures, too, are well chosen and excellent.
Mr. Melville thinks that Walpole House in Chiswick Mall was undoubtedly the Academy of Miss Pinkerton, whcncc Becky Sharp departed with a copy of Dr. Johnson’s " DIxonary,” which she threw out of the carriage window. Walpole House, in Chiswick, still stands, and is now the property of Mr. Beerbohm Tree, the actor. Fairoaks, in ** Pendennis,** is identified as Larkbeare, at Ottery St. Mary, Devonshire, the home of Thackeray’s stepfather, Major Carmichael. Smyth. In the Temple Thackeray dwelt a while, as well as Pen and Warrington. Great Coram Street, in Bloomsbury, where Thackeray lived once, was also the abiding place of Mr. Todd, the junior partner in tho great firm of Osborne & Todd. In the church of its famous Foundling Hospital tlie tablet was erected to the memory of George Osborne, Junior, Esquire, who fell at Waterloo. There poor Amelia went one Sunday just to see the back of little Georgie’s head as he sat in the family pew with his spinster aunt. Russell Square, near by, is full of memories of Becky and Amelia, the Sedleys and the Osbornes, Dobbin and Jos. Col. Newcome’s house, with the funeral urn over the doorway, still stands in Fitzroy Square. Nearly ! every American In London goes to see Becky Sharp's house in Curzon Street, Mayfair. Major Pendennis dwelt in Bury Street, St. James's, off Piccadilly, and i there have been few changes in that neighborhood since his day. Narrow Jer-myn Street, back of St. James's Church, is where Harry Esmond was presented by Capt. Dick Steele to Mr. Joseph Addison.
; Ail St. James’s Parish is associated !n the ! minds of novel readers with personages in Thackeray’s works.
Mr. Melville thinks that Gaunt House still stands In Berkeley Square. That now occupied by the Earl of Rosebery, perhaps! He does not think that Hertford House, in Manchester Square, was the ^cene of Becky's great social and artistic triumph, though he accepts the legend that the Marquis of Hertford was the original of Lord Steyne,
