Col- Ui^ginson’s I iistor3r.
A new and revised edition of Col. Thomas Wentworth Higginson’s 4‘ History of the United States ” will be brought out March 9 by the Harpers. Col. Higginson's collaborator in the work was William MacDonald, Professor of History at Brown University, and the authors have brought the narrative down to the current year. That Is, it covers the whole period from the beginning of American history to 1005. The later chapters are concerned with Lincoln, the questions with which African slavery is so closely linked, the civil war, the reconstruction of the South, populist and free silver movements, post-bellum tariffs, as well, of course, as the Spanish-American war and the phases of imperial expansion which have followed after it. In its original form the history extended only to the close of President Jackson's administration.
