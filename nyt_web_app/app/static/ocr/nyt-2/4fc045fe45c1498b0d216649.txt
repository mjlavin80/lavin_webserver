TOPICS OF THE WEEK.
E devote a page this week to reviews of the two new hooks relating to the Younghusband expedition to Tibet and its results. The first and more important of these is the work of Mr. Perceval Landon, the correspondent with the expedition of The London Times, whose graphic dispatches were also published each day in The New York Times. But there is much information in his book which was not in his news dispatches. Mr. Landon £s intensely anti-Russian, and so outspoken in his political views that Col. Younghusband, who commends his narrative of the expedition in a preface to Landon’s book, respectfully declines responsibility for the writer's opinions. But Mr. Land on's employer, The London Times, holds to ■ its correspondent’s view that Russian influence precipitated the crisis in Eastern affairs which made the Younghusband expedition necessary, from the English point of view. Some of the statements in Mr, Landon’s book will be hotly discussed, but to American readers it is chiefly interesting as a remarkably graphic account of a memorable undertaking. Mr. Candler’s book carries the story of the expedition further than Mr. Landon's. He, too. Is an English newspaper correspondent of distinction.
