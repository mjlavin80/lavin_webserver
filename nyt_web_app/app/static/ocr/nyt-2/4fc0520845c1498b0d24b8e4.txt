Once on a. time when William Dean Howells made an address before some literary club he advanced the idea that i most people had the material for at least 1 one good story In their personal experiences. He also said there were very few of them indeed who appreciated that fact and fewer still who could either tell or write the story so that It should be entertaining:	The first part of this statement |
confessedly appealed to Mr. Bolton- Fos- | sibly he overlooked the latter part of It, ! for in the introduction he says he devoted I a year to preparing the present volume.
Mr. Bolton's experiment is hardly so interesting as the Harris-Ingram experiment; yet the investigator is forced to either read or skip 395 pages before he discovers what the latter is. In those 395 pages he has taken a journey in the Baedeker style through Europe; has enjoyed more or less the platitudes of a number of very commonplace people who tn.lk on all sorts of subjects; has been saturated with information about the mechanics of an ocean steamer In considerably less entertaining fashion than KipUng does that sort of thing; has acquired a Vassar College recipe for “ fudge," (a sickly-sweet compound to which schoolgirls are addicted;) has been misinformed at least to the extent that whales " spout water.” snd has been Introduced to a love scene at
Smith College, (an institution for the higher education of women,) where the Harris girl stops her lover’s avowal to I discourse on “ the alluvial basin of the beautiful stream by which we stand," regarding which discourse the author says: r* Gertrude's words were music to George's ear "—had ho but one?
'Reuben Harris was very rich and had so tired of the piling up of millions of dollars that he decided to sell his steel wofks to an English syndicate, thus clearing $4,000,000 more, and go to Europe to satisfy his wife’s desires, as “ her mind was burdened trying to discover the steps that lead to the metropolitan and international Pour Hundred." Just as he had sold his steel works and on the very day he was to sail there came a dispatch that there waa a big strike in progress at his mills. European trip shut off. Family went over alone, and three or four possible love affairs loom up in the offing. Harris meantime has a regular Homestead strike on his hands which culminates in the complete destruction of the mills by the strikers, who used dynamite and firebrands. Harris, disgusted, and the sale of his mills “off,” starts for Europe with all that Is left of his family—the daughter of the alluvia] basin love scene—her lover, George Ingram, son of Harris's former partner, who had been ill-used by Harri3 tn the steel business, and Ingram’s sister. Which opened up possibilities for further descriptions of a steamer’s Internals, more Baedeker description and more M alluvial basin ” and pseudo-scientific love rhapsodies by the priggish young daughter with a mission as a social reconstruction! St.
Reuben had hard luck in Europe. One daughter died just as she received two ** most eligible " proposals of marriage, his son disappeared because a Dutch coquette ** threw him over ” tn Amsterdam, and his other daughter had a simple wedding in Paris,” much to the mother's disgust and after a half dozen pages descriptive of Worth and other fashionable dressmakers of that gay city and their ** confections.” So back to New York went what remained of the family. On
arriving: there George Ingram who had married the “alluvial basin" Harris girl, found that her father had made her a •present of $5,600,000 with which to reestablish the Harris steel mills on the cooperative plan, so els to prove that capitaf and labor might get on together. That plan begins at Page 390, and the creation of . a JJtopian mill in a Utopian village where there were no politicians, no saloons, no graft.- no crime, nothing but that which was serene and restful and frightfully educational and instructive under, the guidance of the ** alluvial basin " girl, and where everybody was. happy and hearty, and wise and rich, takes up the
remaining forty pages of the book. There were no practical people to comer in ana make a. rustle In the town, and so tne founder got tfr&i and died Just as some sort of a financial crash, ~ due to taxixi reform. came along. That gave the long missing brother a chance to turn up. loaded with gold made in mining, and save the “ Experiment ’ from financial ruin. Death had been very busy with the Harris family in the last quarter of the book, but there were Just about enough of them left to carry on the idyilic work, and they are at it to-day in that land of Somewhere to which there are no railroad guides.
