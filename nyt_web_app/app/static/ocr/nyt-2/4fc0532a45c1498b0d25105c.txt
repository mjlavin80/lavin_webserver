Lord Beacons-field on Theodore Roosevelt.
HE remarkable revival of Interest in the life and writings of Disraeli, which has made it possible for The New York Times to pay his executors the unprecedented
price of a dollar a word Tor an unfinished	posthumous novel, has also
brought Into prominence Walter Sichel’s exhaustive literary tribute to I^ord Beaconsfield, entitled *• Disraeli, a Study in Personality and Ideas.”
One sentence in the book has been pointed to as a striking portrait of Theodore Roosevelt. Disraeli gloried in many-sided ness In the broad 0elds of human effort. “ How very seldomi’* he wrote, " do you encounter in the world a man of great
abilities, acquirements, experience, wlio will	unmask	his mind, unbutton bis
brains, and pour forth in careless and picturesque phrase all the results of his studies and observations, his knowledge of men, books, and nature.”—Sauce Piquante.
M. Louis Thu-Some New Studies asne’s ” Etudes of Rabelais sur Rabelais"
and His Masters. wm be welcome
, to all students
of literature, though I am not sure if it will please any regular Rabelaisian. He shows by parallel passages how much the master was indebted to Erasmus— who may almost be called his master—to Teofilo Folengo, better known under his pseudonym of' Merlin -CocaJ, to Francesco Colonna, author of the " Hypnerot-omachia Poliphili " which has just been reprinted, and especially to those honest
monks such as Halliard, Raulin, M6not, and F£pin, who were then thundering from their pulpits against the corruption of Church and State. Especially one may mention the episode of the Abbey of Thfel&me, the name of which he traces to Thelemia, one of the divine nymphs who guide Poliphilus on his journeys. These borrowings seem to have been due to no lack of originality on the part of the historian of Pantagruel, but to the habit, common to all writers of the Renascence, of seeking their goods among the literatures Of all literary nations, the last example of which is to be seen in Burton's “ Anatomy of Melancholy." For the rest M. Thuasne shows, conclusively as it seems to me, that Rabelais had quite as keen a grudge at the new Protestant preachers as at the lazy and gormandizing monks, and he devotes many pages to his denunciation of the severe Calvin. His own religion, teste M. Thuasne, seems to have been a kind of Pythago-reanism, which taught the union after death of all noble souls with the Deity, while the sinners have to expiate their crimes by a sort of homeopathic treatment at the hands of devils, who are, after all, " bons compaguons." Perhaps it is for this that Rabelais has always remained the writer most offensive to what may be called the clerical mind, as typified by Renan, who, as M. Thuasne reminds us, thought Rabelais's gift of laughter little short of hellish.—Pail Mali Gazette.
Paul Bourget Has Become a Polemical Preacher.
No one, probably, who had only read M. Bourget’s earlier works would have ever supposed that he would become a preacher. But the development of a democracy has strange effects on some of the most delicate thinkers of the nation, and nothing seems more clear than the fact that Republican France of the presort day, with her institutions and her truculent tendencies, has alienated the minds of some of the more thoughtful of her sons. Just the same phenomenon Is found in the history of the Greek republics. While Pericles and all the advanced school-of democracy were pushing Athens along progressive paths, thinkers like Plato and Aristotle cast many regretful glances behind at older and outworn constitutional forms, and were over and over again inclined to vaunt the superior virtue of Sparta In preference to the eager, pushing ambition of Athens. And row. strangely enough, we see the same thing happening in France. There seems no question that the republic represents ‘ the line of least resistance, and therefore is the only available form of government for modern France, if we take into consideration all the manifold shapes of her industrial, social, and political activities; but the republic is not loved, by the thinker or the artist. M. Maurice BarrSs and M. Rent Bazin wage war against the attraction which the capital possesses and the consequent depletion of the countryside. M. Bourget portrays with merciless hand the social ruin which happens when provincials come to Paris. Above all, in the region of life dominated by the'Roman Catholic communion, M. Bourget again, reinforced by M. Paul Hervieu, rides a tilt against current conceptions of marriage and the facilities allowed to divorce.
On the last point I am referring especially to M. Bourget’s “ Un Divorce/’ The two novels which give best expression to the increasingly didactic tendency of M. Bourget are “ X/Etape and . “ XJn Di-. O'• ’	\	fr'..	’	’	.	,
