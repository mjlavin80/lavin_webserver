STUART ENGLAND.
Air. Joseph Jacobs Reviews George M. Trevelyan’s England Under the Stuarts-^
Y	old instructor in history, Sir John Seeley, used to hold informal talks on .Friday evenings for his class, which in after years formed their pleasantest and most	instructive recollection.	I
remember on one of these Friday talks his saying that there was no history before Ranke. On some of us pointing to Tillemont and Gibbon, he explained that he meant history founded upon archival research*	On our again pointing	out
hooks like	Madox's " History of tbe	Ex-
chequer, *’ he granted with £L SIIlU6 tU&t his aphorism was a paradox, hut insisted that it only had been within the last forty or fifty years that materials for history had been made known to the world, and that history not founded on documentary material might be artistic, hut could not be scientific or trustworthy. 1
Indeed, the tendency nowadays is entirely in the direction of work founded
—	on research into the archives. This
I	means minute specialism and the publi-
i	cation of monographs which as a rule
!	may be scientific and trustworthy, but
are far from being artistic- To such an extftpt has this gone into the study of English history that Prof. Gross of Harvard some four years ago was able to fill a tolerably bulky volume with a blbliog-
■	raphy of English history merely down to
i	1483. There is not an episode In English
history, not a prominent character in its
annals, that has not received monograph!	lc treatment in the last half century.
!	Slight as are the rectifications that each
,	of them makes in the older conceptions
i	of these episodes and characters, the ac;	cumulation of these minute variations
r	produces an astonishing charige in the
whole conception of the course of English !	history. And now after specialization
I	comes generalization again, which differs
i	remarkably from the old picture or pict-
i	ures on which one was trained.
We are clearly in the midst of a recon-i	structlon period, to use an expression
from another division of history. John i	Richard Green began it with a "one-
i	man show,” giving pictures from all sec'	tions of English history. Though nom-
!	inally a " Short History of the English
People,” his book dealt with everything else than with the life of the people. It was Traill who first attempted to bring together all the antiquarian research about the life of the English people in -the '* Social England" edited by him. This was arranged on the co-operative plan, specialists in the different branches contributing various sections to the six volumes. I myself contributed a couple of sections. Naturally the result was somewhat patchy, and it was difficult for the reader to get any bird’s-eye view of any one subject or of any one period.
The book before us is evidently an attempt to combine what may be called the i	Green and the Traill methods. It is one
of a series of six volumes (the number of Traill) which Is to deal with various epochs of English history from the beginnings down to the battle of Waterloo. Each period is to be contributed by a dif~ ferent author. This avoids the patchiness of Traill, giving a unit^to each period, but on the other hand avoids the inequalities of Green, who naturally could not be an expert on all branches of English history.
It is somewhat curious that the first volume to be published of this series, and dealing with the age of the Stuarts, should be by a scholar who has hitherto been known as a specialist on a much earlier age. Mr. Trevelyan is favorably known among students by his edition of Gower and by his admirable study of " The Age of Wiclif.” The conditions of England were so different in Chaucer’s and in Dryden's time that It Is with a sense of surprise that one finds Mr. Trevelyan selected to deal with the latter after having dealt with the former. Still, he has an almost hereditary right to deal with the sevontoonth century. For nearly half tlie volume his chief authority is his grand-unclo, Lord Macaulay, and for the whole of it his eminent relative has formed a model.
The book is divided into two distinct parts of varying inti'rcst and merit. The first two chapters deal with the state of England during the early Stuarts (IG03-1G40,) and give a most admirable summary of social conditions during that period. This may be distinguished as the Traill part of the volume, and it may at once be said that if the rest of it had risen to the high level of this admirable sketch the bJOk as a whole would have ; been almost without a rival in modern English historical literature. Within the space of four or five sheets Mr. Trevelyan has managed to give clear and concise pictures of the squire, the farmer, and the peasant, which vie in vividness with Macaulay's celebrated second—or is it his third?—chapter. Even the external as-

jpects of the land we not .left .out . of ac-
-	count. The reasons which led to a wild picturesqueness in the landscape and architecture of the period are clearly illustrated by Mr. Trevelyan. The contemporary taste in pictures' and absence or sanitary precautions, the narrow-mindedness of the municipal legislation, and tho cruelty of field sports are all touched upon with a firm hand.
In all this the influence of Macaulay is obvious and praiseworthy. But when we come to the rest of the volume this breadth of view disappears. The old conception of history, as dealing with the State and not the nation, is retained, and while giving a certain definiteness of the treatment, renders it excessively dry and uninteresting, while the annalistic form in which Mr. Trevelyan tmts his results unnecessarily increases these results. Needless to say, Mr. Trevelyan makes use of the newest lights, and indeed the early part of his volume might be termed an abstract of Gardiner, while the latter is merely a summary of Macaulay with improvements. He even appears to share Macaulay's admiration of that cold-blooded prig, William III., as witness the eloge with which he finishes his chapter on that reign.
William III. did not seek the Dove or contemporaries or of posterity, and he has not obtained It; but he sought their welfare and freedom, and these he has achieved. For this he sacrificed what little health and happiness he might have had. and for this the proudest of men made himself the humblest of kinge. The full-blooded human life} and ecstatic religion of Cromwell did not fall to the lot of this Invalid. But he stands high in another order of nobility. His Calvinism was the garb in which his age and country dressed the temper of a Stoic, who serves God for duty, and not either for joy or for fear; who seeks po respite from gsuzing steadily on the powers of evil, examines their strength and nature without self-deception, and fights them in the haggard darkness, uncheered save by the hope that victory will dawn on others when he is dead. He took some few pleasures that did not become a Stoic, but he endured for our sakes bodily and mental pain all his life long, and asked no reward of our thanks. He scorned to be popular. He scorned to be cruel. His wisdom was indefatigable. His jpatiencc was like the patience of the gods.	1
Aut Macaulay, ant Diabolus! which colloquially translated might be rendered:
“ This Is devilishly like Macaulay, both in sentiment and style,” This strict restriction to the political history In the latter part of the book Is especially unfortunate, as so much has been done to vindicate both Cavalier and Roundhead in later historical literature. In particular, a full use ot my friend Prof. Firth's monograph on *' Cromwell’s ArmyM might have lent both liveliness and color to Mr. Trevelyan's pages on the Great Protector. While seemingly devoted to statistical inquiry, Prof. Firth’s treat- . ment penetrates beneath the uniform and finds ihe human aspects of the Ironside. Altogether, Mr. Trevelyan’s treatment of j Cromwell Is scarcely Illuminating, either on the military or the religious side. ! Curiously enough, in both aspects Mr. Motley, who in this period at least was j merely an amateur, has more often hit the truth. The great significance of , Cromwell in the civil war was as a cavalry leader.
It is the more to be regretted that this vciurae keeps more to the older lines than to the newer lights, because Mr. Trevelyan is quite aware of the special significance of the period with which it deals. As he points out in the introduction, th«* method of constitutional government , worked out by England through the civil war and the revolution, not alone made its career different from the rest of Eu-
iope. but has constituted its great contribution to the history of the world. All Europe, including England, wa3"as autocratic as Russia is nowadays when that pedant James I. came to the throne of England. At the time this book ends, with the accession of George I., England and England alone had created the form of government which has been adopted by all European Governments, (except Russia,) merely in consequence of its success in England. The period is one, therefore, In which attention may be rightly directed almost exclusively to governmental problems, and in this way Mr, Trevelyan may be excused for not having carried out the promise of his first two chapters. It would be as well, however, if the later and earlier volumes of the series gave mor© attention to the social aspects of history,
and were devoted less exclusively to the ups and downs of party conflicts, with which the latter part of Mr. Trevelyan’fl book is so fully concerned. In a measure the Stuart period is the most attractive of all the sections of English history. There is a contrast of Ideals between the Puritan and the Anglican, a conflict of arms between the Ironside and the Cavalier, a struggle of wits between the politicians of the later age. It is of particular interest for American readers, for, as Mr. Trevelyan very shrewdly points out, it was the policy of Laud that gave backbone and even capital to the growth of New England. A-Ir. Trevelyan's book is full of cunning '* pointers " like these, and, allowing for his plan, is carried out with a skill and ability worthy of his family tradition. but the plan, I must still contend, is a faulty one.
