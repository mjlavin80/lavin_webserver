H. Munro Chadwick has written a book of " Studies on Anglo-Saxon Institutions," which the Macmillan Company is publishing in this country. The book, the author says, “ makes no claim to offer a comprehensive survey of the problems of ancient English sociology.” Only a few of such problems are treated of. His object has been " to call attention to those branches of the subject which seemed not to have been sufficiently regarded by previous writers:	For example, in sketch-
ing the history of the kingdoms I have given special attention to the evidence relating to Kent, Sussex, Essex, and the Hwicce. On the other hand, Mercian and Northumbrian history has been treated of more briefly, because i had little or nothing to add to what had already been said.*'
The book opens with a discussion of the monetary system, of which Mr. Chadwick says in his introductory paragraphs:
The classification of Teutonic society in ancient times may perhaps be most conveniently attempted by observing the gradations In the monetary payments to which persons belonging to different classes were entitled in compensation for various injuries. For this purpose a clear understanding of the monetary system is an indispensable preliminary. The monetary system of early England, however, in itself presents a number of difficult problems. In the first place, the terms in use were more numerous than in most countries. Some of these terms were names of coins, while others denoted units of account, and others, again, units , of weight. * * • Another serious difficulty arises from the fact that the standards of weight appear to have been continually changing. A further source of trouble is the variation in the relative i	value of gold and silver.	* * * Finally,	!
[	there is some difficulty	in ascertaining
the purchasing power of money.	I
He then proceeds to describe the coins, the terms for money, the value of the shilling and other coins, the weight of the coins, the relative value of gold and silver, and the origin of the shilling.	1
Then follow chapters on	the social sys-	i
tem, the earl, the administrative system, the origin of the nobility. &c.
