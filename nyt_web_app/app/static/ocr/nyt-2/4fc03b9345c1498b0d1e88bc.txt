. This la a bold, lively tale of a tall youth and a beautiful, perverse maid, whom the youth loved too patiently to please her impetuous temper. For Mistress Amy Homalyn was a distant kinswoman of'l^er Majesty Queen Elizabeth, and endowed with some of the royal spirit and sharpness of tongue. As a child she teased and bated the tall youth, her playmate, tiU he flung her into the river to tame her. That rude, rash act delighted her, but the offender was too apologetic afterward and lost favor. At Court, whither he followed her, Amy grown up was far from kind. Then came an embassy from Muscovy. Ivan, called the Terrible, had already made an offer of her hand to his cousin of England. Elizabeth had begged him to accept in her stead a young kinswoman, the Lady Mary Hastings, and Lady Mary baulking at the last minute, Mistress Amy volunteered to take the place of the recreant. To Moscow, accordingly, Amy was sent with Sir Jerome Bowes, a most outspoken Ambassador, and the tall youth for Secretary of Legation. The stirring matter of the story is Amy's adventures in Russia, how she '* danced in the cage of the tiger ’—meaning his Muscovitish Majesty—flouted the mad autocrat to his face, answered him hard word for hard word, played chess with him, quarreled with the jealous Maria Nagoy, another candidate for the throne matrimonial; caused fierce Russian boyars to fall madly in love with her.
Much blood is shed. Ivan wields his famous iron-tipped staff, now beating his servants over the head, now transfixing an offending nobleman's foot, now threatening Amy herself. Moreover, the playful Czar maltes the tall youth (of whom he is somewhat jealous) master of his savage wolf-hounds, to which it is his custom to throw dlt-ti i^uished prisoners alive instead of break! a.st. Of course the tall Englishman tames the dogs, and, of course, in the end he rescues and wins the rash Amy. But meantime that adventurous lady's career at the Russian Court makes a most spirited narrative— a narrative into which the author has known how to infuse a certain frolicsome effect, tending at moments to give to Ivan rather the elfect of a creature of comic opera. The story goes as if the writer had enjoyed making it, and had done it lightheartedly. The reader will be likely to enjoy it in much the same fashion.
