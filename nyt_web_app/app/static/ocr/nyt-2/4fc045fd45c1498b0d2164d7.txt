Scandinavian Literature.
-Yetc York Times Book Review:
Any one with a sense of fairness and a reflecting mind, it seems to me, must object to a little notice under the heading " Noj*se High Finance ** in your issue of Jan. 23. It is a review of a Norwegian book by Alexander Kielland, recently translated, and bearing the title '* Professor TiOvdahl.*' To begin with, what is " fiction of the Scandinavian School,” which your revfewer ciafms appeals to a “ certain ” class of readers? The explanation follows, and your acrimonious scribe says of the book that it is •* a story pre-eminently Scandinavian in Its matter, inspiration, and outcome. Nobody in it is happy; few people in it are good. Doubtless that is the way of life in Scandinavia.” " Doubtless,” thought I, as I read this, the reviewer is shooting a
pointed arrow of witty- sarcasm. But no-such is not his intention. The ending of his review dispels all such charitable conclusions. “ It is all horribly futile and Scandinavian,” he declares.
I am a Swede by birth and spent the first twenty years of my life in my native country. The inclusive way in which your reviewer speaks of " Scandinavia " is evidence enough that he knows but little of the difference in characteristics and disposition which exists between Swedes and Korweglans. The idea that Swedish fiction is futile will be easily dispelled by reading one or two of the works of Viktor Rydberg or Selma L.agerlof. In Norway Bjornson has well enough proved that Norse fiction is of necessity neither futile nor always sad and morose. A score of other writers in either country could be brought to the front to contradict the sweeping, and I must say, futile and misleading statements above quoted.
I think I can explain what ails your witty but not very careful reviewer. He is suffering from acute “ Ibsenism.” No one could regret more than I do the dark and abysmal themes of most of Ibsen's plays, and a thoughtless mind might perhaps driven to think that this was the general style of writing in " Scandinavia,” since its greatest living author loves to paint the baser passions of humanity. The additional evidence of one book by another, inferior member of the Norse writing fraternity, would to him probably seem conclusive evidence. I can, however. forgive him this misconception. It is only a lack of judgment.
But if it is lbscn that has colored his ideas of ” Scandinavian ’* literature, what right has he to classify any story, be ;t ever so inferior, as “ horribly futile and ^Scandinavian ”? Nothing- but an ex-
