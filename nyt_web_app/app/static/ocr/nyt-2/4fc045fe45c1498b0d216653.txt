AMERICAN LI T ER ATURE.
Mr. Charles Leonard Moore In The Dial of Chicago pleases himself by Imagining: what a horoscope a philoso-. pher of the school of Taine or of Buckle would cast of the literature of the United States, considering: the environ -i meat In which it was to sprout, and comparing that a priori result withythe actual output. The article is rather disagreeably smart, in addition to being rather disagreeably pessimistic. But the fact remains that we have not begun-to cut in literature the figure that might have been expected of us, and that we are not at present giving any very valuable pledges for the future.
We are too old to be pleading infancy as an excuse for oar Qhortcomings. When we come to think of it, we are, in the way of being entitled to a National literature, ^ust about as old as I Germany. Frederick the Great established the independence of Germany not so long before our ancestors declared the independence of the United States, and it was in his time that modern German literature had its beginnings, and even under the inspiration of his military and political successes. It is curious to think of such an intellectual emancipation being due to a monarch' who himself remained in bondage. For the great Frederick was never in the least emancipated. Though a passionate reader and a prolific writer, modern literature to him meant French literature. His ambition was to be a French classic, and, if he were remembered by nothing el3e than what he wrote, he ivould be remembered by a few searchers of the byways of French literature as a fifth-rate French writer, the German literature which was beginning in his time never having at' tracted his attention. We, on the other hand, who entered into the heritage of a great literature in our own language, have done, upon the whole, curiously little to augment it. The German Intellectual product is only in a small degree literary, being mainly scientific.
[ But even so, no patriotic and prudent American would challenge a comparison with Germany in the strictly literary arena. The mere mention of the names of Goethe and Schiller and an invitation to match them would suffice to put him to silence and shame. After a century and a quarter of political independence we are as much a literary dependency of Great Britain as on the first day.
And, as our candid friend of The Dial goes on to point out, we are growing worse in this respect rather than better. Whom have we now to compare with the Bostonians of the middle of the last century? Who would represent us so worthily in an international competition in which the awards are made by an international jury and Fedlingtonian estimates are not allowed to count? Not many of us may be able to go along with our Dialist in finding Poe '* our profoundest thinker and artist,” or in thinking that Walt Whitman, the emancipated American b'hoy, would have done great things if he had ,iot emancipated himself, among other things, from the shackles of syntax and prosody. But it is true that, when Rmerson and Hawthorne and Lowell and Motley were alive, we made a iminh more respectable showing in L • - ---------------------------------
I such a competition than, we can make now,	•
| The critic whose remarks we are taking/for a. text seems to find the commonplace of our literature in the commonplace of our life, the uniform! Ity and’ the., narrowness of it. Here we 1 fail to follow him. There are Americans who are ready to maintain that the ideal has not only as much share in American life as in the life of any other country, but more, who are yet free to confess that they find much less of it in American than in foreign letters. And there are Americans who find contemporary American life keenly interesting who find contemporary American literature extremely dull. When it is pointed out, even for the thousandth time, that the prevalence and predominance of the mercantile standard discourages the raising of any other, we have to own that the pointer-out is on safer ground, even though it be from commercial republics that some of the greatest achievements of human genius have proceeded. But, whatever the explanation may be, a comparative survey of national literatures must make us moderate our transports over our material successes*-When the persistent foreigner or the candid native asks us about our output of anything beyond foodstuffs and metals and petroleum, and we are unable to specify, it does seem as if there were something else in civilization than % these excellent and indispensable, things.
