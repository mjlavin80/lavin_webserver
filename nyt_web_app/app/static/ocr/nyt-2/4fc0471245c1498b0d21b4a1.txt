lolm Hancock
Kcw Tori; Timrs Booh Rcviac:
In vindicating the memory of John Hancock, J. Henry Cook and Allen C. Thomas, whose letters appeared in The book Review of Feb. 4, performed a public service of real value. Hancock furnishes ■ one of the instances, too uncommon, of men who, emerging from the sloth of luxury, work and sacrifice for the good of their country and fellow-men and thus offset the decay of inherited station and the odium of wealth. This attempt to belittle the merits of Hancock is in pursuance of the pfcayune-souled, detestable habit of judging men by their worst Instead of their best. Man, no less than the devil, should have his due. It Is a shame to remember only that Thomas Paine wrote “ The Age of Reason,” and forget his priceless services in the cause of American Independence. It is a shame to remember only the treason of Bene-diet Arnold and forget that but for his j magnificent valor Burgoyne, and not I Gates, would have been tho victor of Saratoga. I never felt like joining the general guffaw that rewarded the efforts ! o£ Pidgin to prove there was some good even in Aaron Burr, however absurd the i product of those efforts. The practice
•	of magnifying faults and minimizing vir-1 tues tends only to sour the milk of hu! man kindness, with which commodity I the world Is not overstocked at best.
Better the serene smile of optimism than
■	the sneer of pessimism, as a rule. Ameri-[ ca's greatest moral and intellectual force, Emerson, was nurtured in the soil of optimism. To be sure, progress is impossible without a little of the pessimist, ; but it should be for him to confine his attacks to present-day abuses and laches, and not waste time snarling at central figures of a glorious past. The fathers of our Republic were far from gods or demigods. They were equally far from fiends or incompetents.
