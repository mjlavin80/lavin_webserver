might- suspect v that the hidden lesson is that 'aii Inspired prophets are inadmen, hut,If such Is the lesson, it is made plain that (in spite of tragic blunders} the higher hopes of the wprld are bound up somehow with these madmen, and the things they dream and try to do. One may read the book and ponder on the meaning of faith, science, and common sense, • or one may thinlt chiefly of the story—one of humanity probed pretty deep—one somewhat daringly planned, hut one which shows strengths and a seeing eye. ___________________‘

As a study in modern phases this story must be considered something more than remarkable, The phases themselves are more than remarkable, tiie motive almost fantastic in spite of the realistic modem London setting. For the Rev. John Morton is an enthusiast with tbe faith in him that he is divinely appointed to set crooked ways straight. He preaches on street corners, he believes all sorts of good thjngs of his fellow-men, and his faith makes him wonderfully strong and able In the battle with drink, disease, and despair, " those ■ three hammers used by men to beat out the image of their Creator.” He impresses even the worldly wise doctor of the piece, whom he calls “ sham cynic.” Tho mob calls him “ the mad Messiah. ' The tall daughter of tiie Earl of Patringtun, whom he has rescued from under the wheels of a railway train, is almost convinced that he is more than man.

The l.uly was bored and sought consolation, being in foot no other than she who had abandoned the reprobate kinsman on his deathbed, a secret into which the reader is early insidiously admitted, though the Rev. John remains ignorant of it a long time. There is the doctor already mentioned, a detectivc, the young man who consoles, and the Earl’s tall, pale daughter. The yeast of fate brews and works In the whole and makes of these elements a climax so melodramatic as to seem almost inspired. But it is melodrama pathologically inevitable. One
