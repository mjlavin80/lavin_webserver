That nTas a nasty rap which Lord Rosebery gave to the projectors of the Cervantes dinner, to celebrate the tercentenary of " Don Quixote,” in London, Jan. 19. They invited him to preside, but in his letter declining the honor he declared that one who could not read Don Quixote *’ in the original did not know the work at all. Now, presumably, some of the gentlemen who took part in this little celebration know Spanish. Major Martin Hume, who presided at the dinner, is a student of Spanish history who has proved in his books his ability to study Spanish historical documents in the original. But there must have been many cultivated gentlemen in the gTOUP who assembled to honor the memory of Cervantes, who know his work well in translation, who have felt its influence, and who had quite as much right as Lord Rosebery to attend the dinner and express their admiration for a great writer whose fame belongs to all the world.
