Why should any one grow angry thirty- j
nine years after an admitted wrong? Dixon's "Clansman*’ (s a belated shriek. | North and South agree Uiat negro recon- , straction was a blunder in human nature , that spilled lives and left a deposit of bit- ! ter memories. But the anonymous revenges of the Ku-Klux-Klan and sweaty negroes fumbling justice are alike well burled. And the young corn was covering the evil dreams till the ex-clergyman and arch-sensationalist roweled himself j Into a passion to sow hate and reap clrcu- j latlon. It is not that troubled events may i not be cast Into dramatic form. But,
I when employed, the artist will throw them into perspective. It is indecent, and, worse, It Is Inartistic, to exhume 1 sectionalism for the purpose of selling- a . book. Mr. Dixon has whipped himself Into seeing red so that he could write yellow. One questions the sincerity of | the racial appeal that Is based on the things that as a Nation we have put be- j hind us. Why kindle a bonfire in a ; graveyard? “The Clansman’* lias all the'pseudo-fervor of a tract for the times with the animus of a disappointed pen- . sloner. And all this frothing at the mouth is done by a man who has purchased a yacht on the proceeds of his j rhetoric.
Artistically, the book is Impossible. There have been good melodrama novels, I “ Ivanhoe M and “ The Prisoner of Zen-da,’’ to mention no others. Of problem novels we have a few. But when before have we been treated to blue lights and a message combined? Midnight rides, murders. and concert-pitch love are ,
thrown molten Into hysterical theories. The product is neither romance nor New Thought. The two pairs of lovers are as indistinguishable as the woodspeople that amble on palfreys through “ Morte d'Ar-thur." The style Is that of artificially kindled emotionalism, so that even Lin-coin Is made to talk a kind of Osslanic. i Mr. Dixon is to be congratulated on his "Clansman.”	!
