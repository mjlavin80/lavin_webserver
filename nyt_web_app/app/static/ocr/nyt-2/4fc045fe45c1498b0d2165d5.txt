|Sp5=«gpgjN ARTICLE on Dr. Smith's ' stupendous work was pub-jvS|^wra lished in The New York Times Book Review of rojfiaSft i» Sept. 24, 1904, and attention BmmSMbLSI was directed then to the merit of the undertaking and j ^the distinctive feature which makes It I an anthology of historians as well as a world history. The five additional volumes now before us—volumes which but for 1 two to come complete the series of twenty-five—are made up like the others large-1 y by weaving together longer and shorter extracts from the most eminent au-| thorities and most valuable sources for : each country and period. As to the subJect matter, Volume. XIX. contains the
■	history of EnglAnd under the Tudors and Stuarts, from Henry VII. to Charles I.
' and the. days of a victorious Parliament,
In the text are imbedded characteristic and illuminating passages both from contemporaries and from those later fc^sto-rlans and writers nf memoirs who ejjoy most reputation and authority for that time. There are of tne fU-et* Erasmus, Melanchthon, 8*r Thomas More, William Tioper, Reginald Po’e, 1* raneis Bacon, and Lord Clarendon, and of the second, Macaulay, Carlyle, Robertson, S. R. Gardiner, Ranke, Hume, Gibbon, Hallam, Freeman, John Richard Green, with, of course, (when it comes to Mary, Queen of Scots,) Andrew Lang. Necessarily also Horace Walpole, who, however, is mostly Quoted for the next period, treated in Voluipe XV.. ** England from 1042 to 1791,’* that is from Cromwell to the French Revolution. Here the compilers have at their service Clarendon again first of all, then Pepys and Evelyn, then " Horry,” absolutely indispensable, Burke, Bolingbroke, besides Swift and Goldsaith And Blackstone, with the more modern Guizot, Macaulay, Le^ky, Jo 3ay ! nothing of Smollett ar.d Lingard und a host of others who need not be enumerated here, though they are well represented in the text. The names used suffice to show the wide scope of the treatment. Volume XXI. takes up the history of Scotland from the earliest times to the Union fn 1707, citing among many others Tacitus, The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, William of Malmesbury, Froissart, John Knox, Matthew Paris, and Sir Walter Scott.
It is notable that Mr. Andrew Lang’s name is not included among the authori-tics for this Scottish history. The next section of the same volume is concerned with Ireland, tracing the history of that island from the age of legends and St. Patrick up to 1881. Ireland gets in all only about 120 pages. Among the authorities cited are Froude, Edmund Spenser, i the Harleian Miscellany, Gold win Smith,
W. O'Connor Morris, Macaulay, and Lingard. The final 120 pages of the same volume are devoted to tracing the history of England since 1792.
Volume XXII. begins with “ The British Empire,” providing an introductory view of the empire by Lady Lugard. One section deals With British India from Clive to the present, with a retrospect covering in a general fashion the Mohammedan and Mogul Empires. The following section under the name, " The Colo-nlaJ World," occupies itself with Australia, New Zfealand, South Africa, and Canada in the order named. Next comes the history Of the United States, this volume taking it only so far as to cover the earlier settlements in Virginia, Maryland, and New England. Authorities for the empire include Macaulay. Bryce, Napier, Lord Brougham, the Duke of Wellington, John Mill, and Lord Roberts; those for the early colonial history of the United States, Champlain, Charlevoix, Coronado, Hakluyt, John Smith, Las Casas, Thomas Jefferson, Washington Irving, Owge Bancroft, John Fiske, Parkman, and Theodore Roos»”elt.

Two Introductory chapters are provided here, one on " Essentials of American Diplomacy,” by Albert Bushnell Hart;"and one on "Some Aspects of the American Revolution,” by Andrew C. McLaughlin. Authorities quoted are not so numerous nor well selected as they might be, but include William Bradford and Cotton Mather, with Bancroft, John G. Nicolay, Lecky, McMasters, Schouler, and Goldwln Smith.
