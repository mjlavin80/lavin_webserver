“The Growth of the Manor/’ is the title of a new volume by Dr. P. Vinogrn-doff of the University of Oxford, which the Macmillan Company will shortly issue in America. It was planned about a dozen years ago, but 41 various professional duties" prevented the author from following his investigations. The present volume Is based on some lectures delivered In Oxford last Summer, In explanation of the book Dr. Vinogradoff says:
I have tried to present an outline of the growth of the Manor, as a social institution passing through all the stages of English history. Dwelling only on the main frts and the decisive moments, X do not pretend to start an entirely new theory on the subject, but I have had to choose my way between conflicting theories and arguments and to set forth as clearly as possible the leading ideas to which, according to the best of my knowledge, details have to conform. I shall address myself primarily to students of general history and try to make my sketch intelligible to them, but it would be misleading not to state shortly the reasons for taking up this or the other position, and I hope the notes at the close of each chapter may be deemed sufficient for this purpose.
Included In these notes are references to the authorities consulted by the author. An idea of the scope of the book is given In the following extract from the preface:
All periods of English history had their bearing on the life of the Manor. Some
f’erms of manorial institutions may be ound tn the Celtic age; the Roman occupation of the island had undoubtedly a
powerful influence on its economic arrangements; the old English period is marked by the full development of the rural township; the feudaJ epoch finds the Manor at its height; the dissolution of the Manor forms one of the processes by which modem commercial intercourse was brought about, and survivals of the manorial system and of its component are known, of course, about later than about ancient times, and this will make It necessary on many occasions to turn to well ascertained later facts in order to form a judgment about ancient conditions.
