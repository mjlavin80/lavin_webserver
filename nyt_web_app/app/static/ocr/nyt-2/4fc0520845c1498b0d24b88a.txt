The-subject of the volume by, the Pro-i fessor of Paleontology of the University of Cambridge^ tho early history of the , Syria c-speal£tng Church. The task is difficult; and despite the careful study made by -Prof. Bitrkitt the result leaves'much to be desired*.The-data is uncertain-and ! mixed up- with legend and table* The Syrians a-re represented to be distln-^ grnished, for their mediocrity anti to .have i never: given birth to a man o.f marked, j. ability. -Inconsistent compilations called sacred are sometimes impossibly blendet^ and become to the ordinary reader utterly incomprehensible. As it is Edessa seems to have been the first centre of Christianity tn the Syriac-speaking world. It -was the capital of a small principality east of the Euphrates. In time the Creeks called Lhe place Osrhoene. Gibbon has written concerning the city and its surroundings as on the' dangerous verge Ot two contending empires, the Roman and-Parthian. Edessa was captured by the Romans A. D. 21G. Christianity, it is relieved, was planted in the city one hundred years before Roman sway. The story, was that the evangelization of the place vras due to one Addai. who was at the head of seventy’five disciples. The King Abgar favored Christianity. Xt was then that arose many legends, as the finding of the True Cross and of the True Likeness of Christ, and these the author says form M a curious chapter in the history of human credulity/' Christ, it was believed, wrote a letter to King Abgar pralglng
him for his acts, and this letter having been translated Into Greek was used by Eusebius in his Ecclesiastical Histo.-y. Fragments of this missive Jiave been found in the Greek papyri of the fourth and Tifth centuries. The author adds; ■
*rhe letter of Christ was regarded as a charm, and pious folk in England in the time of the heptarchy still copied it out and wore it for a preventive “against lightning and hail and perils by sea and. land, by day and night and in dark places.
The two martyrs. Barsamaya and Shar-bol, then held their sway, Sharbel told i how when in Rome the Christians were persecuted there came an earthquake. The people of Rome besought ihe prayers **f I the Christians, and the earthquake ceased, ; and then the pagans were all converted. | No one can question the value of the earlier Syriac versions of tiie Scripturos. ] But there are many difficulties. What is known as the Peshitta version was first ! published in 1^55, and it was claimed1 *' that the Syriac of the Peshitta is akin ! to the Aramaic of Palestine, but it Is far from being the same dialect.” Aphraates, who taught the Trinitarian doctrine with certain modifications, had peculiar ideas | cn nee ruing baptism. Only celibates were worthy of immersion. This holy man had not a high opinion of women. *’ It was through Eve that Satan cnmc in upon Adam.*' Then he cites from the Bible all the unfortunate women wiy had led away j mankind. This worthy iAtsoq left uut i entirely the religious service in marfflffc as being unnecessary. At the conclusion the author dwells on :m ancient novel of Syrian composition called the “ Acts of Judas Thomas.'* One of the curious features »*f the story is that ihe leading per-
sonago. Judas Thomas, is represented as the half brother of Jesus. Certainly tUOSe St, MargareL lectures have their value, if om>’ to make comparisons between the bi-Uef*4 of to-day and those of thn past.
