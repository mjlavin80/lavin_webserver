2Ceic York Times Book Revicic:
I note that a new book is shortly to appear from the pen of Mile, de la RamSe, better known as “ Ouida.” I want to call tho attention of your readers to a book writti n pome years ago by her that appears to be but little known, but which I consider a most charming and beautifully writu-n work. It is “ The Tower of GaJileo.” It tells of an old booklover, dwelling in a mediaeval tower in Florence. and of his love of books and of his d^voti J daughter iieldeia. It is not a book that the readers of Ouida's novels generally would care for, and others who would doubt k-ss enjoy it may have passed it over, thinking: it was like her other stories. There is a slight thread of a love story running through it, for Bcldeia has a love-. In Tact, I myself am in love with her, nd so will many of your readers be if they read the book, but the main interest centres in the old book dealer, who is so fond of his volumes that he is unwilling to make a sale, when on rare occasions a possible purchaser appears on the scene. Then there are descriptions of the ola buildings of Florence, and the country a^out, all delightfully described.
