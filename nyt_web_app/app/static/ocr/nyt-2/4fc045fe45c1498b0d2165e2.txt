TOPIC S_ OF THE WEEK.
[ELE the question of the unfairness to English authors of those clauses of the United States copyright law which provide for the copyright of English hooks in this country is being hotly discussed | in London, a large number of English books of all kinds are still published here without copyright and, as it seems, without loss to the English authors. This is inevitable, of course, in the case of high-priced works in limited editions. But it applies also to works of fiction by comparatively popular writers. We have seen this week a copy of the American edition of a new novel by a writer of some measurable celebrity. There is a new title on the cover and on the title page, which bears the imprint of the American publishers. Otherwise the book is of English manufacture from Chapter I. to the colophon of the Plymouth printer. No attempt has been made to copyright it, yet we do not doubt that the author will receive from the American publishers as much money in royalties as the ordinary English novel, duly and legally copyrighted here, would make for its author. It is a perplexing subject, and grows more perplexing the more one looks into it with a disinterested vision.
