Henry OTamea and his writ' ings are so manifestly what Mr. Howells calls his enemies,- > (see his articles on Mr. James, North American Review. Volume 176, pages 125-137,) why would it not he better for their own< peace of rnl?id and morals to remove this jarring1 Influence from their lives simply by “ passing him up " altogether? Biit if they will read him, then, In order to place their views in some kind of harmony with what he Is trying for, let them read him decidedly more, so that these will cease to be mere Irritated opinions. The latter, duly subscribed to by the Philistines since the
A
da3's of “ Daisy Miller,’' have been so lone and so thoroughly aired, It would seem that they could no longer be in vogue, especially since in authoritative literary quarters the rank of Mr. James Is pronounced the highest. The Philistine has been treated nowhere so admirably as in " The Author of Beltraffio,** when Mrs. Ambient postpones (to put It mildly) medical help for her sick child, lest he live to grow up and read his father’s writings, which she passed judgment on as immoral! Mark Ambient's own views of art are interesting in that they can be interpreted from the viewpoint that we may in reason believe Mr. James himself regards literature. ** I want to give an impression of life itself. X have always arranged things too much, always smoothed them down, and rounded them off, and tucked them In, done everything to them that life doesn't do. When I see the kind of things that life does I despair of ever catching her peculiar trick. She has an impudent life. If one risked IT fiftieth part of the effect she risks."
Since “ Beltraffio ” Mr. James has risked, and to his great gain and to the great gain of literature. The " risk " has given his three greatest novels, " The Awkward Age,'* ** The Wings of the Dove,” and “ The Ambassadors," (I have not read “The Golden Bowl,”) and life therein Tias been sufficiently u tucked in *’ for delicate art and sufficiently exposed for marvelous realism. Yet someone will Insist at this point, “ What is to be gained from reading him?”
** Gained ? Is it not a gain to have expounded so wonderfully life? To feel so convincingly that you are in an actual world with actual people? Would you not call his correspondence with life, by no means as large as Balzac's, Quite if not more Intimate than that peer of novelists? Balzac was a veritable Tintoretto for canvases, but he dealt with humanity on so large a scale that he hadn’t time to be specific. This is what Mr. James is—M "Oh, I don’t care for these things. rt*s his characters I’rn^ thinking of—such terrible people! Why; do you think they are respectable? I don't.”
“ None? ”
“ Oh, there are the good ones, of course, but there are so many of the others."
" True, if you reduce many to some, and then use It to Qualify ‘ good/ And there are many, to use this hard-working word once more, that are indifferent; there are all kinds; but does it not take all kinds of people to make a world? So, wouldn’t you call this just the very excellence of h!s art, that he can create such a diversity of types, like, for Instance, Kate Oroy and Mllly Theale, Nauda and Mrs. Brook, Christina Light and Isabel Archer, Miriam and Biddy, Maria Gostrey and Mrs. Jim, Madame de Vionnet and Mrs, Newsome, and so on interminably? *’
*' Oh, Mrs. Newsome,’’ you will say.
** That poor, injured woman. And that unmentionable cause of her distress, Madame de Vionnet." (Can’t we almost hear *' tough ” applied to her, one of the masterpieces of his art?)
“ Oh, you can't approve of her,” the Philistine continues.
*• I approve most emphatically of the art of which she is the outcome, and I
certainly approve a fact that it Will b0 difficult to contest—that Mr. Jamea has given an impression of life that In his day has never been excelled in veracity, completeness, and finish.” E. M. R. Appleton, Wls.. Feb. 6, 1905.
