MER1CAN history is the dominant subject in this number of The New York Times Book Review. Mr.	Frederick S.
Dellenbaugh, an authority	on all mat-
ters relating to the Spanish conquest of America,	contributes an admirable	article on
Prof.	Bourne’s valuable new edition	of the Do
Soto narratives, the two volumes of which are filled with romantic episodes as wonderful in their way as the tales of mediaeval knights in the Bast. Mr. Stanhope Sams writes entertainingly and instructively in review of Major Chittenden and Mr. Richardson's new edition of the Life and Letters of Father de Smet, a non-militant Las Casas of the Nineteenth Century, the story of whose labors as a pioneer, explorer, and Churchman in the West forms an important chapter in the history of our country's development. Mr. Robert Livingston Schuyler contributes excellent reviews of Mr. W. M. Meigs’s new Life of the famous Southwestern statesman. Senator Thomas Hart Benton, and a new edition of Mr. Kasson's valuable book on “ The Evolution of the Constitution." In no branch of literature do the readers of The Book Review manifest a livelier interest than in American history. Much of the correspondence on the Readers' page relates to this subject. We are confident that a large proportion of our readers are eager and industrious students of the history of their own country and we are glad to be able to set before them, in a single number, such an array of expert reviews of important historical works.
