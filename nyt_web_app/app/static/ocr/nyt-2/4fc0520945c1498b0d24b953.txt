The editor of The New York. Times Book Review has been asked fop a list ot the literary societies, associations, aiM clubs in the United States; There are many such societies in every large city. It la a poor town which has not one or two. But, so far as we know, there is no authentic list of American literary societies In existence^ We I should be glad to help in the compila-i tion of such a list. To this end the Secretary of every literary society, club, i or association in this country is re! quested to send a postal card to The New Tonic Times Book Review inscribed with his or her name and address and the name of the society he or she represents. Compliance with this request will be erreatly appreciated.
