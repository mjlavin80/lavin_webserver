In a communication to The Satufidxy Review Jan. 28 relative to "My My Laughter ” your correspondent Mr. T>u-pee says, besides other things. John Hancock has long had a glory tha scarcely belonged to him. It is at! tice to the memory of such men as Samuel Adams and Joseph Warren that his name should be linked with theirs in the popular mind/’ and again U ta not necessary to delve further into authorities than to quote tho 'Memorial History of Boston ’ to secure adequate proor^nat Hancock was precisely what Mr. 'niton s characters Fay he was.” Now, while the “ Memoiial History of Boston ” is an excellent and generally tl’ustworthy work. It is “essential- to delve further into authorities to find the truth regarding John Hancock." Indeed, it is morS essential than for almost any other of our Revolutionary heroes, for no adequate biography of Hancoclfr- has yet been written. The main sourccs of information easily accessible are lives of other worthies or general histories of the times. One of the biographies in which Hancock figures most is Wells’s Life of Samuel Adams This, while a valuable work, is to a great extent a piece of hero worship, and is distinctly hostile to Hancock and should be compared with the life of Adams by James Iv. Hosmer in the American Statesmen Series.
But to return to Hancock himseir. it be granted that he was vain, that he had a rather overweening sense of his own importance and of that of the position which he occupied, let it also be acknowledged that some few of his actions are not easily explained, and that perhaps a very few are to be condemned, still, these are but minor blots on a long and patriotic career of usefulness. What are some of the facts of his life? He was sent to the legislature continuously for eight years in troublous times; he was on every important committee; Moderator of important public meetings; representative to the Continental Congress, and President of it for two and a half years, and re-electcd in his absence; Governot of such a State as Massachusetts for thirteen years; Chairman of the Massachusetts Convention to consider the adoption of the Constitution, which was adopted in Massachusetts largely through his influence. Was not such a man fit companion for Samuel Adams and Joseph Warren? But we have contemporary testimony to his worth which is of the highest value. John Adams, who was not celebrated for praising others, and who, in some of the earlier parts of bis tf Diary and Correspondence ” speaks of Hancock in rather disparaging language, has left the record of his sober judgment, from which I quote a few expressions, as space will not allow the reproduction of the whole letter. He
says, 0SIS:)
** I can say with truth that I profoundly admired him and more profoundly loved him. * * * I knew Mr. Hancock from his cradle to his grave. • * * He became an example to all young men of the town, wholly devoted to business. He was as regular and punctual at his store as the sun is in its course. * * * I cannot tut reflect upon myself for not paying him more respect than I did in his lifetime.
♦	* • Nor were his talents or attainments inconsiderable. They were far superior to many who have been much more celebrated. He had a great deal of polit-. Ical sagacity and penetration into men. Ho was by no means a contemptible scholar or orator.” (Works of John Adams, Volume X., 260, 201.)
In the same number of The Times book Review Mr. H. 1-7. Adams and Mr. C. T. Ackerman take practically the same position as Mr. Dupee. It is clear that ihey have relied on the same or similar sources of information. Mr, Ackerman, however, quotes Mercy Warren, but does not seem to be aware 'that she,,waff- full, of preju-
