. The New York Age fairly rages be: cause in his ** The Clansman,” Mr. Thomas Dixon, Jr., compels—" compels '* is a good word—the daughter oC an abolition-fst to fall In love with a ICu-KIux-Klan .marauder. It is true that Mr. Dixon, commits this sin, but tn so-doing; be follows meekly tn the trail blazed by a Republican novelist whose book was sold all over the United States by men of the same blood as the editor of The Age. In M A Fool's Errand/’ by Mr. Albion W\ Tourgee, published In JLS79, the heroine Is “ compelled to fall in love with a Ku-Ktux-Klaa marauder/’ and It (s not her father, but his, who opposes the match, i As far as the membership of the Klan is j concerned, the two books agree perfect-iy. iTheir only essential difference is in their estimate of the black man’s char-1 aeter and behavior. Un discriminating condemnation of "The Clansman ” condemns " A Fool's Errand.”
In the matter of the South Carolina Legislature, Major de Forest, writing in The Galaxy within ten years of the close of the war, agrees with Mr. Dixon and surpasses him in ridiculing the black legislator elected by the	vote.
