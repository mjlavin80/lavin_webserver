“ Th= Doy's Own Book.”

Xm York Times Book Review.
The affectionately reminiscent tone of the letters which have been published regarding " The Boy's Own Book ” seem to point to the feasibility of founding a society, all of the requisite elements being so distinctly present. In some vague way tbe letter writers and we who read are feeling the tie that binds. But this is an age of societies* and abstract sympathy should be made concrete by a constitution and by-laws. The situation offers every advantage, ft would be a small and very select society. Its numbers could never be increased. Like the Society of the Cincinnati, it might be continued by the right of primogeniture, but that is a matter for later consideration.
The qualifications for inembership are Mear and easily determined. The period '<5 us distinct as the landing of the MayFlower. No intricate searchings in genealogical records for a nebulous pedigree; no ha2g.T claim to be enrolled as an Ameri-. can of royal descent; no expense to be marked among " American families entitled to bear arms,” (ten volumes bound in calf.) " We were riot many, we who stood." It would be prima facie evidence against an applicant if his age were under fifty; and at seventy the Registrar, who should be a martinet, would require convincing proof.
In suggesting that the Board of Governors should be composed of those who now have the volume in their, possession I trust that J am not influenced by selfish consideration froip the fact- that the volume lies on nfy desk* The actual ownership of the volume, however, seems to me to be worthy of consideration. The copy that I liave is a fifth edition, published, by C. S. • Francis & Co., in 1833. It has +wo title pages In which on an ornate arch' and pedestal very small boys in very insufficient clothing are depleted as playing a. variety of games.	.
The book is!profusely illustrated, and the snug and smiling faces of the yoiith’ convey apleasing assurance as to the influence of the games. There was not a bad boy in the lot* They all had clean pocket handkerchiefs and hair carefully brushed with a moist brush.
Torp Aldrich’s ** Story of a Bad Boy ” leads me to fear that he was not brought up on this volume. He .could Qualify as to age, but would be'required to.present strong cvidencc asw moralcharacter. ;
