^ Nctc York Times Book Review:
T the beginning of a new year It is a custom of long standing to take an account of our possessions, of various kinds, whether material	or spiritual. Among the	latter, in
reference to some recent statements that have been made, I wish to	express	some thoughts on	the poetry
of	the	present time. As the	love of it
has been a passion with me since I was able to read Mrs. Barbauld, among my earliest childish recollections, and as it has since been a pursuit, an incentive. Inspiration, and delight, it is fitting that X should write-* tribute, if even a brief one, where time and space are inadequate to the importance of the theme. Publishers issue few volumes of poetry for the reason that unless a poet has a name ot worldwide renown people do not purchase it except in rare cases. Many persons are devoid of a tasfee-for it, and unless a poet
comes heralded to them with blare of trumpet his message is unheeded. The great poets have suffered from lack of appreciation in their lives, and from misapprehension, and Tennyson himself, with the sensitiveness which a poet must be endowed with, giving to him keenest enjoyment as well as intense suffering, was no exception to the rule; and the struggle, lifelong, of Richard Henry Stoddard, is well known.
But the true lover of poetry knows his own wherever he can find it, and the name of its writer, if but by a single poem of value, is ever arter associated with that work. The motto for this pursuit is Seek and ye shall find,** and the ]ove of the quest will find its own " exceeding great reward." Children should be taught poetry in the home and in the school, for it should contain, in the most concrete form, thoughts that can best be remembered through life, in this way, and its beauty should be that of a gem in its setting, from which everything superfluous has been cut and no word is out of place.
In his work on the Nature and Elements of Poetry,” the poet Edmund Clarence Stedman stated that the poetic impulse has seldom been more forceful than at this moment, and in this very place, referring to the university in which his lectures were first delivered. And with all our indebtedness to poets of all apes and climes, from whom we draw inspiration to-day, we must not fail to acknowledge our groat appreciation and delight in the poetry of our own time, with which we are so intimately in touch. In niy own case lyric poetry is especially of my seeking. And in this line, what exquisite verse does William Watson give us in his “Sovereign Poet,’' " World Strangeness, Immortality,” and many more or great beauty, Stephen Phillips.
with his fine dramatic work, yet, to my mind, ascends to greater poetic height in his simple poem on " Faith and words seem absolutely powerless to &ive praise to a poem of the depth of feehng—indeed,
A, Dc Profundis- and tra,nsccnd6nt bG&uty of The Wound/* We have Markham, whose noble utterance in poetic form is widely known, and whose description of “ poetry,” in a single quatrain, is an in* spiration.
There are many who disparage the work
Of Ibsen, but have they read the noble
drama of " The Pretenders ” or the beauties of “Brand”?
A volume would be necessary to do even insufficient justice to the poetry of to-da>. In my own possession are countless poems, by different authors, of rare beauty in our modern world. It was in 1882 that Fanny Parnell died in this country, with whose name I shall ever associate her poem, " Post Mortem," and
the thrill that Its note of patriotism ever
orouses m me, in reading it, and a thrill as well for its marvelous beauty. Can on®.	Katharin* Tynan's poem.
