The Fleming H. Revell Company has -just issued the “ final edition ” of a
ivorlc that is calculated to give rise to reflections. It is, to wit, " The Twentieth Century New Testament, a translation into modern English made from' the original Greet, by a company of about twenty scholars representing the various sections of the Christian Church.”
The object of the enterprise is not apparent. There is already extant, and has been for nearly three centuries, an English version of the work in question, of which the English is admitted by all scholars to be much better English than the original Greek is Greek,
. and which is, moreover, admitted to he one of the chief monuments and masterpieces of the English language. This translation has been revised by a distinguished " company of scholars ” in accordance with the advance in scholarship that has been made since the time of King James, so as to secure greater accuracy. But the same reverence which the original translators showed for their original, a reverence which, according to Matthew Arnold, restrained them from introducing inttf their work any of the pedantries and conceits which marked and marred much of the English prose of their period, the revisers showed to their predecessors. They were careful not to 14 modernize ” one of the glories of English prose, nor to remove the archaisms which have been almost kept current and prevented from becoming archaisms by being embodied in the one book with which all these generations of English-speaking men have become familiar. They have changed vhe translation only when it was clearly a mistranslation. They did not have the impudence to revise it in point of English style,
But “ the present translators, who prefer "—and very prudently—" to remain anonymous,” rush in where their predecessors feared to tread. They
have no scruples about tampering Tvith masterpieces nor any doubt that they j can improve the style of the new authorized version. It was once said by the critic of an individual attempt at an up-to-date English version that the two chief objections to it were that the translator did not know Greek and that he did not know English. It does not much matter whether the anonymous revisers know Greek or rot, since all the relevant knowledge of Greek is already at their service in the work of the more reverential revisers. Bui it is clear that they do not know English, in the sense of being: cultivated and fastidious English scholars. For such English scholarship would have withheld them from making iheir attempt. They would have perceived that an English version of the New Testament was not a literary desideratum, but a thing already and once for all done.
AY hen one comes to think of their undertaking as an undertaking to supplant the authorized version, it becomes an undertaking of ** stupefying impudence.” For it is an undertaking to displace not only an English classic, but the English classic, and that not in the interest of accuracy, but in that of modernity. Ben Franklin once made an essay in modernizing the accepted
' version of the Book of Job. ‘ But he did
it in a spirit of burlesque. though his hoax was so successful that Matthew Arnold, following Satnte-Beuve, tcok it seriously. It would have been a joy to the philosopher, If he could have known it, that he had M sold ” a professed critic a century after his own death. But what is the point of doing it seriously? No-doubt such a translation would be an effective and legitimate weapon In the hands of a controversialist who desired to destroy the influence of £he Bible by destroying the factitious veneration that attaches to the received English version Qf it, Cardinal Newman bore testimony, the Kins James version is one of the great bulwarks of what he called “ heresy ” among English-speaking people, and the Douay version cannot at all compete with it in popular affection. Bob Ingersoll would have hailed with glee the appearance of this up-to-date rendering, to wrhich no sanctity ‘^an in any mind possibly attach. But the avowed object of the new translators is not to co-operate with Bob, but rather the contrary. In fact, the, publishers adduce among their testimonials letters from ministers of the Gospel, setting forth the avidity with which young people listen to the reading of the new version. That is extremely likely, if the young people are already grounded in the old version. To whoever is so, and can compare his recollection of it with the new, and who has, moreover, any literary sense at all, the reading of this latter is a continual feast of fun. But it is a kind of fun one is rather ashamed of enjoying. Extracts taken at random w'ould amply sustain this contention, when collated with the received text, but, for the same reason, one is ashamed to cite them. The version is, among other things, a monument to the want on the part of the translators of any sense of humor. -There need, we suppose, be no real fear that this book will make any progress in displacing that of which it is in effect a part burlesque, or that it will be otherwise valued than as a literary curiosity. As Jerome’s Latin is the “ vuJgate,” so this is the vulgarized version of the New Testament. Whoever reads the King James version is cultivating his literary taste. Whoever reads this one, in good faith, is debauching it. The King James version is the work which, more than any other in English, goes to prove Johnson’s contention that " there is in every nation a style which never becomes obsolete, a certain mode of phraseology so consonant and congenial to the analogy-and principles of its respective language as to remain settled and unaltered.” The presumptuous person who attempts to destroy such a literary landmark for the purpose of setting up in its place a specimen of the style of last evening’s newspaper should be told that the judicious look upon his undertaking with ini patience and dipffust.
