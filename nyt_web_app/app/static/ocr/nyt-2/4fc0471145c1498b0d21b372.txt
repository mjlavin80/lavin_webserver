A'cin York Timrs Hook Review:
In tho little country school that I attended in my childhood the teacher offered a prize to the boy who should stand at the head of his classes. I was a very proud youngster when that prize was awarded lo mo. I can see it yet—“The Boy’s Own Book "—a square, thick volume, primed in London, some time in the forties, full of wonders, games, plays, puzzles, riddles, charades, how lo make and' use stilts, Kites, bats, balls, bows, and arrows—a wonderful ijiine of wealth to us hoys. There were cuts Of all kinds. At the head of the chapter on draughts, or checkers, there was a picture of an old man, bald and in knee breeches, and a boy, with a checkerboard between them. The boy was in high glee and pointing his finger at the ancient man, and this was the legend underneath;
To teach his grandson draughts, then. His leisure he'd employ,
T’ntil at last the old man Was beaten by the boy.
Then, too, there was the chapter on “Angling,*’ and the glamour of it rests with me yet—
Wherever by the hanks of Isis or of Cain Roamed the angler.
That's the way it began; then all the mysteries of lines, and hooks, and rods, and liow to make them: and the kinds of bait for fish and pike, and dace and eels, and all the rest.
That book made anglers of us, and had much to do with our practical education along various lines. And I would like to thank tho man who wrote it and who brought so much pleasure into the lives of us country boys.	S.	L.	FRET.
