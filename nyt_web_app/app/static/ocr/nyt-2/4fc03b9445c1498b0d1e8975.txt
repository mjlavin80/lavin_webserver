if etc Torfc Times Hook Ret>iew:
A grain " Job enters.” In the latest issue of The Independent, in an article entitled “ The Political Crisis in England,’* Justin : McCarthy quotes the words. “ by the skin of the teeth," half apologizing therefor by adding, “ to use the somewhat vulgar old phrase.” Years ago I heard a mother reprove her daughter for using the same ! words, saying: ” Don't indulge in slang, my dear.”
Bartlett, in his " Familiar Quotations,"
, stigmatizes the phrase as an " Americanism," but many years ago The Atlantic , Monthly allowed me to plead, through the medium of its Contributors' Club, that the phrase might rather be called an
Uz-lsra, since Job made use of It in his waitings.
An Americanism in Job's mouth Is something of an anachronism, and, funny, but even the arch enemy tn his backbiting " before the Lord *' failed to accuse his victim of slang and vulgarity.
