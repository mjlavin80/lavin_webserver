A c\o York Times Book Review:
The literary treat of the week to me Is The New York Times book Review. It is both instructive and amusing. Hitherto I have refrained from attempting to contribute to its philosophical discussions of current interest. But in my present abnormal condition the hair-raising discussion is too much for my powers of silence. I wonder whether any of your philosophical wiseacres ever had the grip. I have, and one of Its most pronounced effects Is tho setting of my hair on end. True, it is not a yard long, but such as it is, in its normal condition, it is sleek and decorous; but while the fjrip Is on it is
rigid and rebellious, and wilt not down, but even painfully resents the blandishments of-brush or comb. Why drag poor old Job and Homer into the controversy? Had they not troubles of their own suffix cient to raise their hair? The man who in his own day and generation has never had any hair-raising experiences or observations is altogether unfitted to participate in the discussion. Let such a one live and lcavn, Let him watch the next ; impromptu chicken fight that comes un-S der his observation and see if they don’Jt raise hair—or its equivalent. Or let him watch the most amiable feline when interviewed by a bull pup. See its back rise into an arch and its tail Into a battle brush, and say whether or not excitement can raise hair. And then, whether a believer in the Darwinian theory of ancestry or not, let him tell us whether he has attained to such a degree of etherealiza-tion above his feliow-creature3 as never to get his back up—or his hair?
