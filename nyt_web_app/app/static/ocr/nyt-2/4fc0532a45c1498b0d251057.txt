M. Thiers's “ Histoir« du Consuiat et de I L'Empire " was published between 181<j I and 1802, and is regarded in France with the- reverence due to a classic. But fcr all that, as Mr* George says,
" prdbably few books of equal reputation are less read." It may be J-J53* Taine has supplanted Thiers. ** The Moscow Expedition " follows the Thiers text word for word and in French* but is accompanied by explanatory notes in Eng-llsh* Mr. George thinKs Thiers's treal-
■	ment of the Moscow expedition is rather " a prose epic than sober history. He taxes the French historian with exaggeration. The central figure being Napoleon, the secondary pcrsona&ea only seive to throw in*o greater prominence the chief ciaiacter.
According to the best contemporary writers, Napoleon advanced on Russia with an army- ot fully 468,000 men, and «. after the campaign was opened there was an augmentation of 140,000 more men. The force of the Russians will never be accurately given- Napoleon crossed the Ntemen June 24, 1S12. Sept. 15 he entered Moscow, Oct, 19 he left it,, and I>ec.
5	ho slipped away. Finally, Dec, 12, what was left of the French Army reached Kowno. M. Thiers, when discussing the losses of the French, is by no means clear. H* repudiates the statement that two-thirds of the forces perished. The army included men of several nationalities not French, Mr. Geoige say a that all calculations as to ^he losses in Russia must, Voni tiie nature of the case, be Loose approxi mat ions. The Russian offic'al returns give nearly ‘200,000 prisoners, but many of them died in captivity. Thiers dwells on the miseries of the French soldiers, many of them having been frozen to death. He tells, too, how Napoleon lost his temper with his Generals, accusing them of the want of proper precautions. All through the sad campaign Napoleon was suffering from a bad cold.
After the battle of Borodino, the trouble of the French began. Borodino, though won by the French, had barren results.
Mr, Thiers is by no means complimentary to the Russian General Rutusof, for he designates him as " menteur autant que russ^," to be translated " as much of a liar as a trickster." The French triumphal entrance into Moscow was their march to destruction.
Who set Moscow on fire? Thiers declares Lhat it was brought about by the Governor Rostopchin. There is testimony that he had carried off all the fire engines and pumps in use in those times. The accusation Rostopchin denied. But it does seem that the burning of Moscow was his ** deliberate act." After the
*
burning of Moscow, Napoleon saw what terrible results were certain. He tried to patch up a peace with the Emperor of Russia. A French agent was sent to Prince Kutusof. The constant horrors of the retreat Thiers describes vividly. Such few victories as were gained by the French brought no relief. The part taken In the harassing of the French by the Cossacks has been variously described. Napoleon's respect for the prowess of the Cossack was but slight, for he said that they were hardly to be considered dangerous, “ only bothersome."
Wonderfully graphic is Thiers’s description of the starving, fagged-out French seeking some short rest in Wilna. During the long march many of the men had dropped dead, and over their rags of a uniform they wore fragments of th*T silks coming from the loot of Moscow, and shreds of the furs taken from women,
Mr. George disputes M Thiers as to a phrase, “ Napoleon’s prodigious intelligence."
When the invasion had once begun, and the Russian armies were retreating, Napoleon, whose obvious business was to bring the enemy to a decisive battle, had no choice but to fnllnjy them till he could do so. That they gave him no opening for great strokes of genius was no fault of his, but it was fact.
