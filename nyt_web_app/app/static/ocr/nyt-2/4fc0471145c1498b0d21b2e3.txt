In connection with tho story that Custer disobeyed orders when he forced the fight under the shadow of the Rockies and lost his life, let me point out that the history of the Nation shows that some of our most memorable triumphs have been j due to Just such a disobedience of orders. F’arrag'ut, at New Orleans, liad orders to " reduce the forts,” before going up tho river, and some of his bravest Captains opposed Jiis determination to make the dash past. But after *..e battle the American people created the rank of Rear Admiral to reward him for what he had accomplished. Hull, with the Constitution, sailed from Boston to escape positive orders to remain in port. It was an act that would have brought court-martial and perhaps a disgraceful death had he failed; but he brought in the Guerriere. Does any one strive to injnre the fame of Craven at Mobile, wjjere, in bis anxiety to get at the Tennessee, he braved the torpedo line and lost his ship? Our fighting forces have ever had two classes of men. One class would take every responsibility when in the face of the enemy in order to force the fighting. The other class would sneak behind orders from " the department " in order to escape a battle. A most important characteristic of every great commander is the courage to take responsibility and seize the fleeting opportunity to make a fight. It was in the exercise of the discretion that is the right of every commanding officer that Custer attacked the red men. It is worth remembering here that we maintain fighting forces to preserve peace, and that an fene-my would hesitate long before provoking war with an army of Custers or a navy of Farraguts and Cravens. Let the young gentlemen at West Point and Annapolis consider well the monument erected upon the Big Horn and the bronze statue In Madison Square.
