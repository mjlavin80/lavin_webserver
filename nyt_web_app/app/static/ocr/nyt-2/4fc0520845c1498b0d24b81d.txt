BOLAND AND THE ROMANY RYE.—To the many who do-not know, it is not easy to explain tho charm of tho Gypsy. But what it means to, the few who feel It, Borrow long ago left no chance of doubt- I have come under the spell* There was a time when X found my hand's hreadth of ro-rjnnprv-1' 'mid the blank miles round: about "-on the road and m the tents. But when I loot hack, the centre of the group round the fire or under the trees was not the Gypsy, but a tall, fair man, with flowing beard, more like a Viking—my uncle,
Charles Godfrey Ley land, without whom I might never have found ms way *to those camps by the wayside. ■
. He first took me to see the Gypsies after his return to Philadelphia, in the Spring of 18S0. He had already written his first books about them, was already honored as a Romany scholar throughout the learned world, and welcomed as a friend in every green lane where Gypsies wander. I like best to remember him as he was on these tramps, say and at ease In his velveteen coat and soft wide^ brimmed hat, alert for discovery of the Romany in the Philadelphia fields, and like a child in his enjoyment of it all, from the first glimpse of the smoke curling through the trees and the first sound of the soft " sarishan " of greeting. Of his love for the Gypsies 1 can, therefore, speak from my vivid memory of the old days. And as, since his death, all his Gypsy papers and collections have been placed, in my hands,* by his wish, r now know no less well—perhaps better than anybody—just how hard he worked over their history and their language. For if " gypsying" was, as he said, tho best sport lie knew, it was also his most serious pursuit. There are notebooks, elaborate vocabularies, stories, proverbs, songs, diaries, lists of names, memoranda of all sorts; there are great bundles of letters— from Gypsies, from other " Romany i Ryes —Borrow, Groome, the Archduke Joseph. Mr. MacRitchle, Prof. Palmer, Mr* John Sampson, Mr. Hubert Smith, Dr. Bath Smart, Mr. CrrFton. Nothing, 1 do believe, has ever united men as closely as love of the Gypsy—when it has not estranged them completely—and it happened that never was there a group of scholars so ready to be drawn together by this bond. Borrow their inspiration, as they would have been the first to admit.
If the “ Romany Rye ” is, as Groome defined him, one, not a Gypsy, who loves the race and has mastered the tongue, Borrow did not invent him. Already students had busied themselves with tho language: already Gypsy scholars, like Glanvill*s — or Matthew Arnold s?—“ had roam'd the world wits that wild brotherhood." But they had been scattered through tho many centuries since the first Gypsy had appeared in Europe. It was Borrow who, hearing the music of the wind on the heath, feeling tho charm of the Gypsy’s life, made others hear and feel with him, till, where there had been hut one Romany Rye, there were now a score, learning more of Romany in a few years than earlier scholars had in hundreds. and. less fearful than Glanviirs youth, giving the world their knowledge of the language and the people who spoke it. A very craze for the Gypsy spread through the land. I know of nothing like it. save the ardor with which the F61i-brigo took root in Provence. Language in both cases—with the Felibres their own. with the Romany Ryes that of tho stranger—led to sympathv and fellowship.—Elizabeth Robins F-enneil in The Atlantic Monthly.
GREAT AND LESSGR LITERATURE. —Tii the earliest examples we possess of ancient lit* rature we are not allowed e/en u glimpse of the Individualities of their authors. The works themselves, if they had b<nn prized because or the wit, ingenuity, Tortile fatr'y, brilliant conceit,* or any other individual peculiarity—mental or temperamental—of tho men who
produced them, would not have been preserved. In some cases, as in that of the Iliad and Odyssey, th* reputed authorship has been as obstinately questioned as that of the Fourth Gospel and several of the
Epistles. In the very earliest literature the individual was of no acoounf in the
matter of authorship; he was only the collector or editor of spontaneous and unwritten folk-song and legend, or. if he gave these their final shape, was only joint author with his race.
The authors of books which rank with the great works of art. because tlu-> are the product of a high order of rreiLho imagination and .also because of their rx-alted themes, seem to be lifted up rr,w,\-t* us. to shine upon us forever like - ■ • j * r r > constellations. Their works are •.\pn-V-slona of some lofty harmony v.hi< ii has a rhythmic stability as secure ami undisturbed as that of the universt-. -	1	•
But nearly all of what we are woni to call literature has no such lofty ascension, yet is more companionable, consorting with us in our earthly abode, and often disappearing with us—as if It had an exclusive fidelity to the generation it so amiably serves. Even when by some unique quality, giving it a universal appeal—as in the case of the Waverley Novels—it maintains an intimacy with several generations, It Is still an earthly denizen. f .* * The most thoughtful reader finds relief in those lesser iellgtrts which do not
j reach J the' highest* levels'- of exaltation, i Art Itself sometimes stoops—avert ■ statu- <
: ary—to win this less * rapt applause through some individual eccentricity of the artist. This Is a distinctly modern tendency, for mediaeval grotesquery was, as native and genuine in Its Imaginative •genesis as comedy was' in ancient dramatic art.	'	.
Modern prose owes its development and especially^ its variety to this tendency,-which affords.a -field for technique asvthe result of talent on a lower plane than that of pure art, and .which, even in creative work Hke fiction,allows the authori easy descents to the exploitation ■ of his individual traits andT views. Few . novels of to-day or ot the past are altogether the product of creative genius. Both writ-5 ers and readers seem for'the most part to’ shrink with awe- away from the sacred , fire.	.	,	-	> •	_
It is the Inevitable course of develop--ment—a kind of decadence, permitting the existence of a more-cosmic, and humane worid of more varied) beauty and interest, still haunted by the older gods who> In their shy apparitions, gently abate their ancient and overpowering splendors.
.Genius, too. in-our. day is.more evidently., pervasive, even if shorn of its older strength, and at least preserves us from the formal fashions and artificialities of the eighteenth century, so that our llter~ ature has the genuineness and flexibility ' ot a living thing.	:
The vice of self-consciousness, though I more easily fallen into in a literature that gives free play to individual peculiarities i and brings the author and hfs readers j into familiar companionship, is really less I prevalent than it was in former periods. ! The writer who to-day consciously at- j tracts special attention to himself be- : comes an object of ridicule. Wo morr\ ! easily condone tho mercenary motive I than that of vanity, if the entertainment offered is worth what we pay for it. i Thus literature, in its relaxations, takes a range so broad as to include the entire and varied spectacle of our modern life— the spectacle as it appears to one who stays and lets the world come, in so far as it muy, to -him, or as it is seen' by one who goes alt the way to meet the world; as it appears to one who sees only the superficial aspects, or as lt is interpreted by one who studies it. The writers are just Lhe same sort of people we meet in every-day life and are permitted to show themselves as such, with all their indl-vfdual peculiarities—their caprices, extravagances. and frivolities, as well as their wise and dignified ways that count for edification.-H. M. Altlen in Thu February Harper's,
ALLAN UPWARDS DIPLOMATIC REVELATIONS.'*—The standing puzzle for Mr. Upward's reaflers has always been how far to regard his narratives as authentic revelations of fact, and how far as the work of a singularly daring Invention, it was to obtain some light on this problem that an Express representative Invaded the author’s retreat.
" You are the Inventor of this form of fiction—if it is fiction—are you not, Mr. Upward? " was the opening question.
" 1 have never come across anything quite in the same vein," was the answer.
“ I offer my stories to th? public «<? fiction.
'* Rut, of course. I do not deny that many of them contain a considerable admixture of fact. Much of my information has been obtained by traveling abroad. Not much more than a year ago I made a considerable stay in a country which shall be nameless in order to acquire the material for one of my stories in Pearson s Magazine.”
“ May I usk which? "
Tho author seamed doubtful at first whether to answer this question,
*' Well,” he said, “ it was the one entitled ‘ The Peril of Norway.’ I had heal'd Something of Russian intrigues fn that part of the world having for their object the obtaining of a warm-water port on the Atlantic opposite tho Scottish coast. And I wanted to rouse the British public on the question.
“Everything 1 write Is1 written with a very definite purpose, though r do not always expect, or -ven wish, my purpose to be transparent to tho man in the street.
" I agree with Disraeli In thinking thar romance may be made the vehicle of political education. That is why. when 1 have :i topic i wisn to put V-fore the public, 1 sometimes preier to tr«at it in the form of a novel or short story Instead of a heavy article.
” I have btMMi asked tu explain how it is that my stories, whether founded on fact or not, iihvuys read so remarkably like truth. I suppose it is simply because t am alw.iys absolutely sincere in writing. Unless 1 myself can actually see the thing happening I never tell my reader that it happened. Kef ore now 1 have entirely changed the plot of a story at'the last moirvnt because when I came to tho crucial situation i saw that .lie characters could not ael as 1 had intend ed.”— London Express.
GERMAN MUNICIPALITIES. Last wedt I noticed Mr. Lincoln Steffens’s revelations on the government of the Amori-i:in cities, and the story—with all allow-made for exaggeration and sensationalism—is not an edifying one. The book with which we are concerned to-day j is rerv different indeed in plan, treatment, and subject. This substantial volume of nearly nine hundred solid pages, with its appendix, in a second part, of plates, diagrams. and statistical tables, is a somewhat belated sequel to tl*e Deutschen Stiidte-Ausstellung—the German Munici- i pal Exhibition—held in Dresden more than j a year ago. It is compiled with German j thoroughness and method*.- Some five-and-.'
[' twenty eoll abtfratbrs have ^assisted 'Prof.' ‘Dr* Wuttke,- skilled authorities ^all ot, them, burgomasters, directors of statistical 'departments/ medical officers,' professors'at technical academies, “ Oberbaurat •Stadtbaurat Klette,” ■ Director' of the ■Ground Rents arid leaseholds Institute Dr. 'Koch, and ;so oh; The work, therefore. Is. fcrammpd; with information on eyery suti-! Ject .of Interest in municipal'affairs, all; digested and. analysed with scientific -pre-,
-clslon. and the deductions from the facta are carefully- drawn in a series or elaborate essays. There are'chapters on town government;, urban architecture, the control of suburban development; tho police,; the. schools, bridges, hospitals, drainage, poor relief, baths, savings banks; the* housing of the poor, transport and'loco-i motion, water supply, gas works, electric light, and public-.health. And it the reader* ‘wearies.with the task of assimilating the: matter iritlieseclbsely packed pages, lie can turn to the volume of plates, executed in a style .which puts our own official publications to shame, and regale himself 'with’ appetizing 'pictures of tho public works and buildings wltjh which these busy German cities' have been providing
-	thegnselyes. during the past two enterprising decades^
It is a fascinating, but also a rather saddening, occupation. For it must be confessed, with regret, that in this matter of municipal administration neither branch of the Anglo-Saxon race compares quite . favorably with the Teutonic. American energy is partly neutralized by political and official abuses; English public spirit is held in check by Innate conservatism and the power of vested interests. The German municipalities have contrived to avoid both defects. Their rulers are not behind those of our own towns in honesty anil zeal; and, on the.other hand, they are us enterprising as the Americans, while they contrive to keep free from the ugly taint of corruption and jobbery. There is no more “boodUng” in a German town than in one of our own great cities. But there Is an audacity, a comprehensiveness, a boldness of conception, and a determination to get things done well and thoroughly, which would make some of the most advanced of our own municipal reformers “ stare and gasp." What we are writing and talking about, as a rather vague dream of the future, the Germans are actually doing, or, in many cases, have already done.—Sidney Low in London Standard.
DIARY OF PRENTISS GINGHAM.— (The late Prentiss Gingham, during the thirty years of his literary activity, wrote GOl)* books,' 100 plays, and hundreds of short stories and poems.—News item.)
Monday.—I am going to start in to-day
and try to do a big week’s work, so as to
catch up with my publishers. As It Is not
quite time for luncheon I will dash off
that poem that war running through my : mind during exercises this morning. This afternoon I want to begin a book.
Tuesday.—Have worked all day on my book and only finished It this evening. But I will have time yet for a story or two before bedtime.
Wednesday.—Entertained this evening, and so 1 only got to do a play, a story, and a poem during the whole day. *
Thursday.—Got along well to-day—began and finished a booK and jotted down notes on a play.	,
Friday.-Haven’t done much to-day. Needed exercise lifter the strenuous work of yesterday, so T hunted and fished this afternoon. But, by working late, I finished my play.
Saturday.—Here It is Saturday and I have scarcely ft thing done this week. 1 must get a schedule and work by that, | or I will never keep up with my pub- ' Ushers. I must gtt either a stenographer !
or a literary iimanuensia. As for to-day.
I have only written one play and outlined a boolc. 1 believe I am spending too much time writing this diary. I must drop it, as the time 1 spend on a daily record coaid easily be turned into a poem or a story.—Homer Crov in The Editor, (New York.)	*
(’llJLDUKX'S BOOKS.—While Mr. Walter Slehel complains, in The Monthly Review, that children are nowadays spoiled, Mrs. Dodd, in The National, rejoices in their "mancipation, particularly as regards juvenile litcratme. Certainly it dues make for thinking, when Hannah More writes to little Macaulay nt age of eight: “I think we have nearly ,ex-I ™'Ud the epics, What say you to a little ‘rood pros**? Johnson's ' Hebrides' or Wallon’s * Lives.* unless you would lik> ii neat edition of Cowper’s poems or ‘ Paradise Lost.’
Think of childhood with this pabulum for its mortal indigestion, and (by way of recreation) the 11 Fairchild Family.” “Sanford and Merton," and “The Children's Miscellany.'’ wherctrom Mrs. Dodd
quotes the following admonition to a little girl who has only given part of her money to the poor: “ Proud and unfeeling girl,” says her dear mamma, “ to prefer vain and trifling ornaments to the deiight of relieving the siok and miserable! Retire from ray presence f Take away with you your trinket and nosegay, and receive from them all the comforts which they are able to bestow.’’ Now. as it is quito certain mamma did not bestow all her mu tie y on the poor, we are justified in condemning the hypocrisy of an age which could tender such canting trash to the childish mind.
This is the season of children's books, and thvsc thoughts are seasonable. We

, THE “ DON QUIXOTE ” COUNTRY.r I Tho Don Quixote dinner on the loth should 'be a very interesting occasion,
and there will doubtless be come .-men and.
i women of letters present who have trav* eled through tho country- in which the knight of the rueful countenance went i jousting and enterprising. Mr. Augustus
F.	Japcacl, in his admirable little book, “On the Trail of Don Quixote,” published seven years ago, brought his read-
-	iCFrs very near to all that. Windmills, such as Don Quixote defied, still wave their arms on the plain of Monteil, and Mr. Jaccacl was struck with" the thought that ho was not so mad after all when he charged these structures whose successors, “ set irregularly on the crest of a hill, look V'e nothing one has ever seen, more liko a collection of queer primitive toys stuck there by the caprice of a lunatic.” M, Jaccacl fell in at Argamasitla with a- lazy fellow, a connoisseur of bull fighting, who delivered himself at some length on Cervantes’s work. And really, for a lazy fellow, and a connoisseur of bull lighting, he delivered himself very well when he said:
“ Yes, Sphor, Don Quixote was a funny chap. It's a great book, though, and known to the whole world, even to the heathen and the English, and the others.
I read it, and found It droll reading, but the rest of It I did not get. There Is much in It for persons of learning. They all say who know that the science of the world is there, and that when you understand it you can get as rich as you want." We fancy that most of our home and visiting millionaires have got as rich as they want by not rending - Don Quixote." However, the peasant felt something beyond :
“ There is something in it I can't get hold of, which makes priests and the like read it over and over again,"
We are not sure that the most accomplished critic can really take us much further than this.-London Globe.
THE " HYPERION ” MANUSCRIPT— Tho manuscript of " Hyperion ” recently bought by the British Museum was probably intended for the printers; but in writing it out Keats was inspired with so many improvements that another copy had to be made. The manuscript, therefore, is of extreme interest as an example of the manner in which he brought hi* work up to its highest pitch of ex^ cellence. The poem, before these alterations, was supposed to be finished, and the alterations are nearly all matters of detail. The manuscript, therefore, does not reveal to us the workings of Keats's mind in tho first heat of inspiration. It does not show us the poem growing under his hand. The corrections in it are all afterthoughts, heightening touches, or the removal of superfluities. But Keats was one of those poets, like Milton, who are often best inspired by what is still latent and imperfect in their own work. Words themselves were an inspiration to him; they suggested thoughts and Images, and often the thoughts and Images so suggested to him were his very finest. The revisions of “ Endymlon" proved this,
and this manuscript proves it once more. Many of his best poems, as. for Instance, the "Ode to the Nightingale,’ are made up of a train of images, each one leading into the next, and all connected together by the general mood which ho wrote to express. Poetry of this kind is much more .susceptible of improvement in detail than pure songs or rushing lyric passages, such as Shelley's, in which the first failure or success is everything, since the particular Idea or emotion by which the poet is overpowered in the first heat of composition, if not realized at once, can never be recaptured. Keats was never, in his best work at any rate, po*s-sessed by some single idea or emotion. His inspi ration was always general, stored Up from many rich experiences of life and books; and the subject oc each particular poem only served as an opportunity for the exercise of it. So when he came to revise he could easily recover the mood In which he first wrote; he could regard his own work both as a critic and as a poet; he could see clearly Where It failed, and could supply the Inspiration to mend it.
The revisions of this manuscript make the poem an Infinitely fWer thing. Keats worked upon it, as Titian worked upon a canvas put aside for a time, with freshening touch after touch, bringing every part up to the same brilliant height of execution, and at the same time removing everything that seemed discordant with the whole. Some of the removals seem almost remorseless. Thus, after the twenty-first line occur the following lines in tho manuscript which were never printed:
Thus the old eagle drowsy with great grief	*
Sat moulting his weak plumage, never moro	-
To be restored, or soar against the sun. While his three sons ”pon Olympus stood.
These are lines of which most poets would be proud, but perhaps they seemed to Keats to express the image of the eagle with too much detail and violence; perhaps,. too, he thought they were superfluous. At any rate, he cut them out.— London Times.
