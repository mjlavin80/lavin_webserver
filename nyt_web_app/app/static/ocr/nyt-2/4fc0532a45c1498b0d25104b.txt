I A’ctr York Tltnes Book Review:
I have read the '* appreciation by a reader ” of ** The Sea-Wolf," dated Jan. 10, 1003, and published some time ago In your book Review. What an enthusiastic tribute! I read “Tho Sea-Wolf " myself and thought it a most wild and improbable tale. There was too much repetition of the psychological distinctions in Wolf Larsen’s ethics, or lack of ethics; too many conversations between the aenemic author and the vigorous man of action, conversations which have so palpably an ulterior motive. Perhaps if "The Sea-Wolf" had been a short story it would have equaled those in ** The Faith of Men," but there does not seem to be material enough in it for a noyel. And how the “ lady " is dragged in I The story would have been much stronger without her, and with all its faults a great relief in these days of the overworked love story.
Now, the story has some good points. Being written by Mr. London it cannot but be Interesting, and the commendable part is not the psychological part, as It Is to Mr. E. F. Allen, bat the way In which Mr. London has surmounted obstacles. He has made Wolf Larsen Interesting,
almost lovable; it surprised me that
Maud (waa her name Maud?) didn’t fall in love with him rather than with the puny specimen she chose. He has made a story practically without plot absorbing fn its Interest. And finally he has made the reader feel a healthful disgust with
the “ I ” who tells the story—comparable
in its effect to Booth Tarkington's “ Cherry.”
“ The Sea-Wolf '* is not the best that Mr. Jack London can do. Several people might have written ‘‘ The Sea-Wolf/* and there are stories of Mr. London's which no one else could have done. Let us
have more of these.
