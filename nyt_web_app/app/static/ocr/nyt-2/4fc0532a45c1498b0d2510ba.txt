It Is often said that the English interest in Dante began in the nineteenth century, it is perfectly true that of nearly 300 English writers influenced by Dante forty belong to the sixteenth, fewer than thirty to the seventeenth, and not quite a hundred to the eighteenth century, while all the others belong to the first forty years of tho nineteenth century. This list Is given in Dr. Paget Toynbee’a forthcoming hook on “ Dante In English Literature from Chaucer to Cary/* Besides Cary there have been more than 200 English translators of some part of Dante's writings since Chaucer’s day.
