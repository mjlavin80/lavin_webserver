The memory of Francis Asbury is still cherished in the United States. Coming to America in 1771, for forty-five years he worked for the betterment of mankind. What John Wesley was in Great Britain Francis Asbury was to America. Mr. Ezra SqiHer Tipple, who edits Asbury's journal, calls him " the great itinerant of early Methodism." No other man was so constantly in the saddle. From Maine to Georgia, to Kentucky and Ohio, and
back to New York, “ year after yeSr he 1 ^wung around his immense circuit, a man without a^ home.” It Is in the journal Asbury kept that the only record of early j Methodism in our country can be found. ^ According1 to his own account he was 1 born in Staffordshire, England, in 1745. Ho tells how when he was seven he read the Bible, but that hia schoolmaster “ was a great churl " and beat him cruelly. When he was fourteen he became a Methodist, and before reaching the years of manhood he became a preacher of the Word of God. At a conference iield in Bristol where Wesley presided it was proposed that preachers should be sent to America. Asbury offered his services and 4.hey were accepted. He set sail from Bristol in September, 1771, and arrived in Philadelphia Oct. 27. Mr. Tipple's *' Heart of Asbury's Journal " is made up. of extracts taken from the journal printed in Asbury’s lifetime, which first appeared in 1807.
In Philadelphia, he writes. " Satan strives to sow discord among us.” Going to Trenton, he preaches in the neighborhood. but " there were some fine women who behaved with airs of great indifference.” On his way back to Philadelphia he finds himself in a company “ so stupidly ignorant, skeptical, deistl-cal, and atheistical that I thought if there were no other hell I should strive with all my might to shun that.” When in Baltimore, 1775, he hears “ alarming military accounts from Boston, New York, and Philadelphia.” It was the beginning of the Revolution, In 1785 he visited Washington.
We waited on Gen. Washington, who received us very politely and gave us his opinion against slavery.
When in Virginia he offended a distiller by offering to pray for him.
He said he did not desire me lo trouble myself about his soul. Perhaps the greatest offense was given him by my speaking against distilling and slavehold-inff. but why should we not speakV
In 17&4 he tells how he had ridden 1,000 miles In the last three months. In 1795 he lauds the new way of reaching New York by Newark. “ It is the nearest way," he writes, “ and preserves the traveler from heat in the Summer and cold in Winter, and delays by winds and other Incidents.'' He describes a touching scene In Virginia. All the money he had was $3 and he was about starting on a journey of 2,000 miles. A poor black woman who supported herself by picking oakum brought him a French crown, begging him to take the money. Asbury dedined. He died in 1816 and his grave is In Mount Olivet Cemetery. Baltimore. J
