If the ICickelburys had their fun on tiie Rhine so had the author of " Two Years in Three Continents,*' in which he sets down his experiences, his impressions, ( and his observations. The book is replete with humor, and is all the better because it is so thoroughly American in ciuallty. Mr. Condlt’s descriptive powers are excellent. Books on the beaten track of travel are frequently tiresome, but in this the good spirits of the writer always predominate, and it is easy reading. The contrasts he draws between the lands of Iowa and Illinois and the Siberian steppes are understandable. You may read almost anywhere that the bronze Daibutsu in Japan sits at a height of 49 feet i inches above the jrround. Baedeker will tell you that, but you don’t know that in the island kingdom you can enjoy “ sweet corn on the cob for dinner, and buckwheat cakes for breakfast.” Do you
not understand at once what a wonderful progress Japan has made? Mr. and Mrs. Condit made their start in Ireland. Ail the capitals of Europe are visited and their signal features described. Thenr come Hussia and the Orient.
