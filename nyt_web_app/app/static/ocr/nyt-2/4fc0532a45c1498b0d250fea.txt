Once a gun Is fitted lo you, stivk to It to the end, for a good weapon from Hu? hands of a skilled maker should last any sportsman a lifetime if he-gives it proper care. So writes Alexander innes Shami In his little monograph. “ The Gun Room.*' (John Lane,) just rrom the press and fulj of good advicc for the man who loves his gun, his dog, and his tramp over. moors and stubble in search of game. Orica you possess a true' gun, see I hat the ease In the gunroom is practically airtight, nnd treat the gun as carefully as you would . a priceless old volume or a rare old print. The man who trusts any of the three t<> ; a servant will rue the day he does so. for • all need loving care and tender handling. No one ca>n or will so thoroughly npply the brass wire brush to the barrel^ or svo that the implement gets the necessary anointing with vaseline, internally as well as externally, as the man who uses the gun. So leave,the care of the gunroom to the servant, if you will, but, as Eor the erun. let no hands other than your own have to do with it at the close of n day’s shoot-.ing. Mr. Shand would have the gunroom . of the house one of the very coziest nook* in the country house or shooting box instead Of a mere gun closet. The flakiest of tobacco, the most £u-vored of ull the favorite pipes, (he choicest of his cigars, the rarest and ripest of Ihe wine cellar, the smoothest of the whiskies, should alone find a place there in company with the pictures and books that will serv** to bring to memory the pleasures of the cover and moorland: there instead ui in billiard or dining room he would have tho mounted bird or head of deer or other < game to greet the hunter, \vho, .-■et'kin?*. rest, goes there to find it, while fondling his favorite gun. thinking of the execution it has done and dreaming of possible hyg* it will aid in securing in the future.
A companionable little book is this volume. Little in it that is technical, ypt it is full of practical hints as to the care of a srun. It pets right at^.the heart of the man who loves a gun and his gunroom, the sort of book that is as conducive of reveries as it is to putting one alive to the possibilities of making of his gunroom , the coziest and most comfortable sort of :i *
! den instead of a mere armory.
