What manner of man this was. who thus on a sudden in the middle term of life relinquished all the ease and pleasure of a patrician existence to work often eighteen hours a day, not for a vain and brilliant notoriety, which was foreign alike both to his tastes and his turn of mind, but for the advancement of principles, the advocacy of which in the chief scene of his efforts was sure to obtain for him only contention and unkindly feelings; wnat were I is rpotives, purposes, and opinions; how and why he labored,
; and the whole scooe and tendency of this original and vigorous and self-schooled intelligence ■. these would appear subjects i not unworthy of contemplation, and
i	especial/7 not uninteresting to a free and political community.
And the author goes on to give an " unbiased ’’ account of the Protectionist Party from the Winter of 1S45 to the end of Lord George Bentinck's career.
