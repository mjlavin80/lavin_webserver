this title Is somathlne of a misnomer,, far-fetched intits-Application, and pointing especially to a,character by no means the most interesting and significant of the story, although the author chooses that she shall hold the stage when cur-lain '* is called. It is to he regretted that the novel does not bear what would seem to be Its Inevitable name of M The Yellow House,tf for in ■ that home of varied history converge all the threads of an unusually admirable tale.	.
The author has assembled a group of obvious and delightfully human characters, not forgetting that somewhere in the breast of the worst of us dwells an angel, though, good sooth, an angel sadly motheaten and moldy in the case of ** Dr. Macllvert," as of many actual human creatures. "We might lay our finger upon one or two slight slips in consistency, but, upon the whole, each character is singularly true to itself, behaving throughout in accord with the lines upon which it was fashioned.
The distinguished merit of the book, however. Is that the author has a story to tell, and tells it with a downright directness rare in these latter days and as delicious as a draught of pure water after many courses of highly spiced viands. There are none of those adroit subtleties which keep one’s poor wits "gyring and gimbling" until too dizzy to be aware of aught save their own ineptitude. There fdn’t a problem, nor the shadow of one, nor any moral except that which comes unconsciously from observing the lives lived beside us, but we close the book feeling tnat simple goodness is the one thing that really matters and that truth and loyalty are the foundation stones of character.
The author's reticences are ns admirable as her revelations. Nothing is tnoie alluring to the novelist than to pursue to ft§-4^timate some painful situation of sex. In''4* The Celestial Surgeon ” there is large opportunity to do just this thing, but the matter is disposed of briefly and sanely, without evasions, but without the smallest inclination to dandle and caress It. Without pose or consciousness, the story is eminently healthful and clean.
We are by no means sure what the function of modern fiction is supposed to be. Too often, like Pickwick’s “ Fat Boy," it whispers in our ear that it " wants to make our flesh creep,” or otherwise harrow up our souls—quite legitimate, no doubt; still it is a joy to fall occasionally upon a novel like '* The Celestial Surgeon/’ which, without a morbid or perplexing ifne, is full of interest and suggestion, and leaves us on kindly and hopeful terms with our fellows and with
renewed faith in the saving salt of honest
purpose.
