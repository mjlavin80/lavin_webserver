Before the University of Chicago last August Prof. Herbert Hall Turner of Oxford delivered n series of lectures on astronomical discoveries, and these ho has now reproduced in book form. The book is handsome, with dignified binding, good paper, and large and generous type.
Prof. Turner's six lectures form as many
chapters of his book and deal with those subjects: " Cranus and Eros,” "The Discovery of Neptune." ** Bradley’s Discoveries of the Aberration of Light and of the Nutation of the Earth's Axis/* " Accidental Discoveries." *' Schwahe and th^ Sun Spot Period,” and " The Variation of Latitude." lt might seem that these subjects offered little chance for interesting treatment; in many hands they would be merely repeUant. But Prof. Turner has made them interesting, even to a non* scientific reader, and to the amateur of
astronomy the book should prove absorbing.	1
Sometimes astronomical discoveries are made by accident, sometimes as the result of It>ny-continued rtiorts. .But the acei-denis are those that happen to persons qualified to make use of them—just as a trained newspaper man continually hao-pens on "stories" that the average man hears with deaf ears. Tragedy and comedy mingle in the discoveries, to some extent—not high tragedy, not low comedy but aceident with the suggestion of pathos or comicality. For instance: Bode an astronomer of Berlin, worked at and kept in mind for jifteen years the idea of finding a planet to fill the vacant interval among the planets which astronomers had noted, with five friends he had begun his search, when Pia2zi announced that he had discovered Uranus, on Jan. 1, i.o01—the first night of the new century. And Piazzi made the discovery by accident; he was looking for anything rather than a new planet! Just at that time, too, Hegel had published a dissertation oroving that there could not be moro seven planets.
The discovery of Neptune was the result of successful and methodical work. It had long been believed by astronomers that a new planet should be at a certain place in the heavens, and I*e Verrier calculated its position closely. From his figures, Galle of Berlin located it. (Prof. Turner, being English, omits the date; it was on Sept. 23, 1846.) The tragedy of this discovery lies in the fact that a Cambridge student, J. B. Adams, had
been working at the same problem for five yours, and hut for the incompetenry of the Professor of Astronomy at his university would have sained Hie eredlt of the discovery nearly two years earlier.
Kven Ida account of J;>mes Bradley's discoveries of ihe aberration of liijhT and of the nutation of ihe earth’s axis. Prof. Turner makes interesting, though they are tar more technical than the subjects of his other lectures, and his description of various accidental discoveries is only less so. The famous new star in Perseus was discovered by Dr. Anderson of Edinburgh. who used an opera glass. He was preparing to go to bed about :t A. M on Feb. 21. 1001, and cast a last look at the heavens. In that hist look he found Nova persei, whk-h, says Prof. 'Punier, " has taught us mom of the nature of these extraordinary bodies than all we knew before."
Two great discoveries were made " in the teeth of the unanimous opinion of astronomers ” (the metaphor is not ours)— Sehwabe s law of the periodicity of won spots and Chandler's discovery of the variations of latitude; and Prof. Turner’s descriptions of theso fill the fifth and sixth chapters of his book. The latter discovery should be of especial interest to Americans; for Chandler was an American amateur, and his invention solved problems and corrected errors until his time deemed insoluble and incorrigible.
