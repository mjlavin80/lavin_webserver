Veto Vork Times Book Review?
Of courso one may mark one’s own books, and particularly with, lines and crosses, simply to emphasize one's appreciation. In loaning books to- congenial and understanding friends, this aids discussion and thus adds to the enjoyment.
But it has been my experience that ! marginal notes serve merely to epitomize one’s own stupidity. We all develop, and in after years such marginal notes are : apt to either merely puzzle you or make ! you laugh at yourself. And they 'usually i serve to the unmitigated amusement of others who may chance upon them. .They are too often instigated by sheer vanity. For instance, chancing upon a decadent French novel, one of those which open with deeply philosophical chapters, thus warning the discerning that it is going to , be particularly indecent, and taking tta I theme from some of the worst features of the Middle Ages, I find a marginal note in French at one of the profound opening sentences: “ But does not Nordau , say that one of the surest signs of the ! degeneration of the present times is tills i revival of interest in the Middle Ages? M As if Nordau were an authority to quote! And when perhaps that very book was one of the suggestions for Nordau’s decadent view of the present times!
It may be laid down as an axiom that such marginal notes are forever detrimental to the maker, and of great amusement to others._ As witness Philip II.’s marginal notes, ""wliich have perhaps done more to fix his historical character than anything recorded by his contemporaries.
