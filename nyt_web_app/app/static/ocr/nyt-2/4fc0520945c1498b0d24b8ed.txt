Some time after this, when they had recovered sufficiently from their wounds to permit their ao doing* Held and my father made frequent excursions in the vicinity of the City of Mexico. The information which he gathered on these trips Reid afterward utilized when he came to write his novels of Mexico and the Mexican war.
On one occasion Reid asked my father to accompany him to a village some distance from the City of Mexico, and where It was said the oldest church in Mexico was located. As they approached the village they perceived a man at work in a near-by field. Held, who was an excellent Spanish scholar, hailed the man and told him they desired to see the padre, or village priest. The man seemed much alarmed, and started toward the village . on a run. In a short time he returned, accompanied by a large body of the villagers armed to the teeth, and with the padre at their head. Reid and Sweeny j expected every moment to be attacked,
! and in their almost defenseless condition —they had only their pistols with them— ! they would have stood a slim chance. If any, of escaping with their lives. With admirable self-control, Reid addressed the padre and informed him that they were American officers, who, learning that some of our soldiers had committed outrages on the villagers, had come to inquire into the matter, and if they found the reports to be true to do all In their power to have the guilty ones brought to justice. On hearing this the attitude of the padre and his people changed at once from hostility to great friendliness. In order to make a better Impression, Reid likewise told the padre that he and Sweeny were " Chrlstianos," and in order to show his devoutness Reid knelt down
by a wayside shrine, so common in Mex-
lco and all old Catholic countries, and fervently kissed the feet of the image several times. Sweeny, who knew Reid as a professional infidel, could only refrain from laughter at this sudden conversion when he reflected upon the gravity
of this situation. Tho padre now invited
them to his house to partake of refreshment, and they found their host to be an agreeable and cultured gentleman. In the course of conversation Reid spoke of the church, when the padre Informed them that lt was not far off, and on their leaving he instructed them how to reach
it by the shortest route and also gave
them much valuable information relating to Its early history.
On their return to the City of Mexico Reid begged Sweeny not to mention the incident of his sudden conversion to
Christianity, but the story was too good to keep, and finally leaked out, much to Reid’s disgust.

In the last Issue of The Saturday
EtfiVlEW “ El Soltero ” asks “ Why is not some notice taken of Capt. Mayne Reid? ” The question has of late frequently occurred to me. Hi.g novels are extremely interesting and readable, and it seems strange that a writer once so widely read should not still be popular. Much of tho material in his novels, like *' The Scalp Hunters ” and “ The Rifle Rangers " was derived from actual occurrences tn his own adventurous career, as I have reason to know. My father, the late Gen. Sweeny, United States Army, was a warm and intimate friend of Reid. Their friendship began during the Mexican war of 1846-8, in which they served as Lieutenants in Burnett's regiment of First New York Volunteers, and my father has related to me many Incidents of their military service In the “ Aztec land.”
At the storming of the castle of Cha-pultepec, on the morning of Sept. 13, 1847. Reid led a “ forlorn hope,*' and was severely wounded by a musket ball from an
escopetto. Although seriously wounded himself—he had lost his right arm at Churubusco on the 20th of August—my father called to see Reid while the latter was In hospital In the City of Mexico. ** I am sorry to see you so badly* hurt, old man,” said Lieut. Sweeny. " Yes, Sweeny/* replied Reid. MI was pretty roughly used. But,” he added, with a
