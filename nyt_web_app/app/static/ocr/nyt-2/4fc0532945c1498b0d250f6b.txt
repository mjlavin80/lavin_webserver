A Collected Edition of Short* Stories and Papers Written in the Later Years of His Life.*	.
SgjjiSSjSpSraN THE four volumes included rami under the general title of BIkI “Stories and Sketches,” Mr. !@u	X*afcadio fleam’s admirers
|giq IjKfig have a uniform edition of the various short papers
-	written by him during the last half dozen years of his life and in part published separately as " In Ghostly Japan,” “ Exotics and Retrospectives,” "Shadowings,” and "A Japanese Miscellany.”
The last-named title would have fitted tho whole series excellently well, for It is altogether Japanese, and the range of topics discussed is varied to a perfectly amazing degree. Bits of antiquarian and ethnological investigation; little papers of research In all kinds of interesting matters relating to the people whom the author loved so well; Japanese stories retold from curious old Tapanese books, with Mr. Hearn's own version of traits and occurrences that have come under his observation; a few of the exquisitely artistic and suggestive tales, impressions, descriptions which no one but a Hearn could write—these fill the four volumes with such a wealth of entertaining as well as valuable material, that, in reading them, one constantly marvels how any one man found time or patience to gather and assimilate it all into such orderly shape. It is here that we gain some idea of the painstaking study, the infinite capacity for details, the special sympathy and appreciation that formed the solid basis of that wonderful power of vivid portrayal and poetic fancy that have made all of Mr. Hearn's work unique and delightful.
If he has idealized Japan and the Japanese beyond anything that they present to the ordinary superficial view, it is not from any lack of exact and intimate knowledge of them, but because his long association with the country and people and his sympathetic study of their literature have given him an insight into their characteristics that no other foreigner has ever even approximately obtained. Practically Lafcadio Hearn became a Japanese, for he lived their own life among them, adopted their religion and customs to such an extent that he was disliked by the foreign missionaries as much as he disliked them and all their efforts, and was shunned by the other European residents of the country. It is to be remembered that it is never of the new, modern, hustling Japan of the twentieth century that he writes, but of the old regime and of as.m^-h of that precious period as has survived contact with imported Western civilization. In his view all that tended to obliterate old Japan was simply- unbearable desecration, and the very evident purpose of all his writings on Japanese matters has been to preserve at least the record of .the vanished beauties and glories of his beloved Nippon. In these books his one pungent criticism of the work of the missionaries Is the little story called " The Case of O—Dai,” which would seem to put the weight of -the argument on Mr. Hearn's side.	'
From so much that is weird, fascinating, exquisite, brilliant, it is difficult to choose for illustration so as to give any ’idea of the riches of entertainment that are spread out before one in the pages of these four books. The chief wonder is how their author has avoided the monotony that almost invariably attaches its unwelcome mark to any such collection of sketches and stories. A constantly varying impression is given that preserves one’s unflagging interest until the last page is turned and the last glimpse into the strange soul of old Japan has been taken. Especially interesting aid suggestive are a little group of essays called " Retrospectives,” and another called " Fantasies.” The iirst are psychological and aesthetic in character—a spot of relief amid the fantastic imaginings of the Oriental mind—and touch in Mr. Hearn’s most characteristic manner upon several attractively subtle questions, such as the secret of our first impressions of our fellow-men, '.he essential qualities in what we call beauty, the psychology of color, (particularly blue and red.) of music, and of the human touch." The “ Fantasies ” discuss “ A Mystery of Crowds ” and some of the author’s encounters with the horrors of the supernatural, and at least recognize, if they do not explain, some of the queer imaginings of childhood ’with which most of us have been at some time unpleasantly familiar.
No small part of these papers is devoted by the author to a, very thorough description of the musical insects of which the

Japanese are so fond,'and lie goes wltli almost equal thoroughness into, the question of fro*rg and' dragon-flies, the nomenclature of plants! and" animals, Japanese female* names, arid Japanese songs. , This part of the book may not make as interesting reading 'as the "tales translated from Japanese story books, unthinkably, ancient, but it represents-a vast amount of patient study and research on the part of Mr. Hearn, and it is by no means dryasdust information. It interprets a very distinct side of Japanese character..
Certainly no one, in view of modern happenings in the Japanese nation, can afford to miss the insight Into the very spirit of Japan, which Is to. be- gained from these books of 'Lafcadio Hearn’s. He, more than any.other English writer, was fitted to be their prophet, and he nobly began his task, even If he did not have opportunity to complete it. And yet the most devoted of Hearn's admirers must smile to-note that he calls Pierre Loti the greatest of living prose writers. The assertion is. full of significance—in regard to Hearn himself.	.
