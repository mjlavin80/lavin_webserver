Mr. Oppenheim's story hinges upon the Kaiser’s famous telegram to Kruger, in<2 involves a monomaniac, an old British Admiral, no longer in active service, and certain facts the veteran has collected about the weak spots in the Royal Navy. It involve^ also the House of Bourbon, and its hopes and the Secret Services of two great European powers, to say nothing of the dread society of Nihilists. We have the impression that the tale is, in fact, not a new one; however, it is not bad of its kind. Mysterious Mr, Sabin la above all a cool hand, and an enthusiast of golf; what else he is it is the business of the story to shadow forth portentously yet conceal jealously till the end ap: proaches. He has a beautiful niece. They dine together at a fashionable London restaurant, where the girl so rivets the attention of three young Englishmen that quests and Arabian night adventures follow. One young man is an artist, one Is a journalist, the third Is my Lord W^lf-enden, son to Admiral the Earl of Derlnk* ham, whose hobby, as aforesaid, is the complete statement ot the shortcomings of his country’s armament. There is a violent young man who attempts murder on the sidewalk, there is a typist who feloniously makes carbon copies of the ' Admiral’s most secret papers, there is the Ambassador of his Imperial Majesty of Germany, there is also the Ambassador of his equally imperial if less enlivening Majesty of all tho Russias. ^nd both Ambassadors are bidding for the possession of the plans which shall deliver England to their masters helpless. Mr. S^bin (whoever he is) is tbe auctioneer. Then there are a Princess and entagle-ments of the tender passion with high politics in which the high politics comes out second best; stoppage on the high seas also, and a German man-of-war firing solid shot across the hows of a Cu-narder—with results annoying to the German naval gentlemen and satisfactory to all good Britons and to ail Americans with proper feelings. It is admitted that Britons and Germans do not love each other; It Is demonstrated that a beautiful young woman likes a bold wooer; it is even permitted the arch conspirator, whose motives and manners are so infinitely superior to his scruples of conscience, to live happily ever after. Not a single person is slain, not a single heart is broken; the war clouds gather omnious but are not allowed to break. Mr. Sabin comes to New England—to the vicinity of Boston— to spend the evening of his days and play golf upon one of the finest private links in the whole world. To be sure, the future of the typist is left indefinite. But she has shown such ability to paddle her own canoe that her helpless beauty will not haunt the reader.	.
