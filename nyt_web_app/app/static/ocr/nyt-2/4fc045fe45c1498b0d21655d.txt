seems able to feel in public* The error of Mr. Maude in the eyes of Max was making his Russian peasants talk like English peasants, not in a general way only, but specifically, and, so to say, technically, using English slang: peculiar to the lower classes. In his defense against this sharp assault Mr. Maude was aided by the nimbler arm and
keener blade of Mr. Bernard Shaw, and the plea of tooth was practically
that it is impossible to set down the talk of the lower classes of one race into the language of another race without misrepresenting the originals. “ I think,” said Mr. Shaw, “ I should make
the Russian peasant speak good plain Cobbett English, but though that would spare Max a jar, there is ho use pretending it would represent the original. It would misrepresent Jt very gravely/’
On the particular pleadings—which
relate to translation for the stage— we are persuaded that Mr. Beerbohin's ideal is the right one. though we are bound to admit Mr. Maude's confession and Mr. Shaw’s assertion that Mr. Maude cannot live up to it. It seems the right of the playgoer to have an Impression of the characters fairly simple and complete. A Russian peasant who talks like a farm lad of Somerset or a larrikin of London cannot give that impression. But when it comes to making him taljt at once in character and intelligently the task really seems almost impracticable. Max Beerbohm says, loftily:
Use just such words as the original author would have used if he were the translator’s compatriot. We need not the letter hut the spirit of the original. Give us but the letter and we can make but faint,, convulsive grasps at the fu-gient spirit.
Precisely. But what are “ the words such as the original author would have used '* had Count Tolstoy been an Englishman? How are you to get at the *' spirit/’ and how are you to make the playgoer, who is not a Tolstoy, her a Beerbohm, nor even a Bernard Shaw, feel the spell of that fugient ” element in the original conception? The unsatisfactory conclusion remains to us that translation—the wisest, most sympathetic, loyal* ingenious, is still in a sad degree treacherous. Lord Rosebery the other day declined to take part in a movement in honor of Cervantes on the ground, substantially, that most English people knew Don Quixote through translation, and did not therefore really know him at all and had no business passing even a flattering judgment on the author. That is carrying the thing to extremes.

If one stops to think, it is almost inevitable to associate translation with treachery, as does the old Italian " tag.” Certainly no one who has tried translation with any seriousness can keep his conscience from the painful contemplation of that rebuking association. Happy is he beyond the common lot of translators who respect their authors and themselves if this bo not the chief impression of his work that remains with him, and haunts and condemns him, even if his work has passed unchallenged.
This is the mood apparently of Mr. Aylmer Maude—this is not^a chance recollection of early Tennysonian verse; there really exists a gentleman of that pathetic name. He is a trans-later of Tolstoy, whose version of the " Power of Darkness ” the Stage Society of London has recently produced, and on whose translation Max Beerbohm descended with, something as
