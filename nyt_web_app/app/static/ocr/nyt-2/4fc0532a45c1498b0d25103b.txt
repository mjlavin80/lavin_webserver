In her final volumes, Mrs. Higgins continues the story of the Bernards of Abington and Nether Winchendon down to the last Baronet, closing with some references to the financial troubles of Sir Francis Bernard-Morland and her father, Thomas Tyringhim Bernard.
In Vol. IIL is told Thomas and John Bernard’s connections with the American Loyalists. John Bernard was the son of Sir Francis Bernard, at one time Governor of Massachusetts. At his death John became the possessor of his father's American property. But before his arrival in this country, In 1799, it was confiscated. In a letter it is stated that Sir John ** underwent a series of confinements and sufferings.” Wben an attempt was made at tbe accession of Pitt to the British Premiership to get back the property, it was too late. In 17S7 Sir John Bernard returned to England to settle some family affairs. A year later he went to France. Ho was appointed, in 1791, to a post in Barbados. In 1799 he waa in England prior to going to Dominica. He remained here for the remainder of his life, traveling occasionally to the other islands around it. He was principally engaged in improving the country, buying and selling lands. The struggle with France, which cut Dominica off from St. Vincent and other islands, had a disastrous effect on Sir John's schemes. He died at Roseau in 1809, but the news did not reach England until five months later.
Among the celebrated men with whom i the Bernards came in contact were Prof. Crowe, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the Rev. Dr. T. F, Dlbdin^ Thomas Young, Sydney Smith, and others. The writers in the family included Sir Thomas Bernard,
, Fanny Bernard JUng. Julia Bernard Smith, and Jane Bernard White. Throughout the work are distributed extracts from letters and writings of not only members of the family, but of others.
The sketches of the Woodbury family , in America were written by the late Charles Levi Woodbury for members of that family only. “ They are the result of much labor and study, diligent searching out of obscure facts, all done In order that others may have a reference which has been verified if tho moro Important work of writing a thorough famIly pedigree is attempted." In the open, ing chapter the author writes about ; " genealogy."
There is some honest science In the effect ! to know your ancestry. * * * Genealogy ! accumulates facts for the scientific study , of man and his prospects. * *	* The
study of genealogy leads us into the history of one's country and the party government thereof, improves the knowledge , of the elemental principles of our insti-; tutions, and trains the mind to appreciate ; the development which earnest and pious ; ancestors have given to the bases of selfgovernment and equal liberty as well as the centuries of a struggle they endured in their efforts.
The first sketch Is on John Woodbury, the " Old Planter," who came to this ; country in 1624 and settled at Cape Ann.
