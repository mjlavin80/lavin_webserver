RABELAIS.
To make of Rabelais not an " extra volume,” to bo carefully concealed from the young, but a fit “ornament for the centre table " and suitable for family reading is evidently a difficult task. To expurgate this earliest and perhaps most characteristic literary avatar of the celebrated " esprit Gau-lois ” will seem to most readers who know it in the unexpurgated form to destroy it. Montaigne himself, who declared that but for conventional prejudices he would have painted himself
" nude and full length,” was a model of discretion and reticence compared with his predecessor. It may be true, as Taine maintains, that “ that good giant, that drunken doctor, rolls himself joyously about on his dunghill, thinking no evil; the dunghill is warm, convenient, a fine place to philosophize and sleep off one’s wine.” But the presentation of the good giant thus disporting himself is a literary spec- j tacle entirely unadapted to the general reader.	!
Nevertheless Mr. Curtis Hidden Page j has edited with an introduction, and
i
Messrs. G. P. Putnam’s Sons have pub- I lished, as the first of a series of “ French Classics for English Readers,” what purports to be Rabelais. It really ought to he so. There must be something besides unprintabilities in an author who has been taken so seriously by such critics as Sainte Beuve and Coleridge. And it really turns out to be so. There was no question of the right English version. Nobody has rendered a foreign classic more sympathetically and more successfully than Urquhart has rendered Rabelais. The fund of high spirits which the author had the Scotch Baronet shared with him. He abounded in his original's own sense, insomuch that, as his latest editor points out, he amplified his original in many places, for the mere sake of carrying the exuberance further and raising the whimsicality to an even higher power. How sympathetic an interpreter he is may be judged by comparing his version of the first three books with Motteux's continuation, which, indeed, would be accepted as a capital piece of work if one had not grown accustomed to the gale of high spirits in which his predecessor worked, and which with him subsided into a moderate breeze. Urquhart is as good a translator of Rabelais as Dor£ is an illustrator, and Dora’s Rabelais was the best thing he ever did, with the possible exception of the similarly minded " Contes Dro-latiques."
There was nothing to be done with such a translation of such a work except to make free excision, where it was clear that modem taste would no longer stand its freedom, and to indicate in notes positive mistranslations. The excision has been ruthlessly done, and thoroughly, with one astounding exception, which the editor even repeats in his introduction as a guarantee of the naivete of his good faith. And tile residuum of Rabelais is really worth having. In a manner, and decency apart, it does more justice to
i
the original than the original to itself, since the wild extravaganza to which Rabelais found it necessary to resort in promulgating his heresies no longer obscures the heresies them-
selves. One perceives more clearly that the ” dunghill ” is in truth a Utopia, and the book a satire upon the actual worKing of the French institutions of his time, a satire sharpened by a continual .comparison of the actual with the ideal. Gargantua’s college is as serious a project of education as Milton's “ tractate.” The abbey of The-leme is a transportation to Utopia of the monastic institutions of France. Neither the law nor the Church, nor yet his own profession of medicine, escaped the satirist, who was by no means a cynic, but a reformer. Mr. ; Page's editorial work is well done, "both in his notes and in his introduction, and one finds that a Rabelais which does not have to be locked up may still be worth reading. E. A. D.
