In permitting his characters, richly endowed with primitive instincts and ideals but deficient In humor and common sense, to step out of the red. green, and gold embroidered tapestries of Arthurian romance to Which he has hitherto confined them and into a prosaic modern English countryside, Mr. Warwick Deeping has do no wrong, both to those passionate lyrical personages and to hlmSGlf. In “ Utber and Igralnc," and in ** LOVO Among the Ruins," his previous novels, the stage setting, the mellow influence of a remote age, lent enchantment to a certain barbaric squandering of language and color and passion and voluptuous feminine charm, as it dimmed the plain, matter-of-fact aspects of the deeds and words of his men and women. In the cold light of to-day these passionate pilgrims are apt to look absurd, and, in spite of the author's entire solemnity and their own, they do look absurd. Gabriel Strong Is the son of a tea merchant who has grown rich and set up as a country gentleman. Gabriel is a dreamer, an idler, a vaporer, thouch tiie author approves his vapors. Partly lo please himself, partly to please his father, partly to save trouble, he makes love to and marries a fine sleek tiger-cat of a woman, and as soon as it is too late repents. For he has seen a white maid bathing in tho opalescent sea. he has fished a pale-blue ribbon out of the green river for her, he has looked into her deep eyes and Icissed her cool hand. She is a pure child of nature, largely though slen- j derly beautiful In body, and equally beau- ' tiful in soul. Sho is the daughter of a besotted, opium-soaked old miser, and is called Joan Gildersedge.
Gabriel decides it will be right to Jove Joan in tho spirit if he swears to touch not so much as her finger tips—and ho tries to carry out that programme. The result may readily be imagined. Joan, a poor, lonely, unguided, hungry woman j thing, and Gabnel. a moral weakling. Yet i the author finesses the trick, if we may bo pardoned a card player's term, Meanwhile the sleek, handsome wire gets bored, goes off elsewhere for amusement, annexes an accomplished military gentleman, and tho gossips of the village get busy Witli the greenwood meandcrings of Gabriel and Joan. Hence the name of “ Tho Slanderers.’' Mr. Deeping is somewhat crass and crude In his methods with these slanderers. They are the parsonfs wife, the doctor’s wife, the members of church guilds, and the like charitable organizations. And theso poor women are allowed no virtues at all to temper tho malignity of their tongues and their feminine proneness to chink evil of other women. You get the Idea that Mr. Deeping imagines religion is a mere'cloak for hypocrisy or a grindstone for sharp knives to slay the reputations of Indiscreet Idealists. Perhaps he would have you see the difference between the children of pure romance and the children of the little world of to-day.
In brief the first are, as he presents them, wasps, and the second sentimental idiots and muddlers. Really the trouble with Mr. Deeping Is the lack of enough humor to adjust his burning cthlcal sentiments, his opulent fleshly imaginings, to each other and to the meridian of average sanity. The story is dragged violently by the hair or its head into an ending which satisfies—if it does nothing else—the average reader’s supposed demand for a happy outcome, tout It Is distinctly disappointing in spite • of patches of purple; language. You cannot:put into..stained glass.colors.
