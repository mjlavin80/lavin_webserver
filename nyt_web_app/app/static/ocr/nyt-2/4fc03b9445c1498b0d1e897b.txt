Mr. Stephen Gwynn’s biography of the author of “ Lai la Rookh ” and " The Irish Melodies,*’ which Mr. Krans reviews this week, has set the literary gossips to marveling: that no one reads Moore nowadays. Is that true? Except in Ireland.’* remarks Mr. Sidney Low in The London Standard, ** his popularity has apparently departed." Other English reviewers are of the same opinion. Tet that man of positive facts, the bibliographer of The London Academy, Mr. Walter Jerrold. points out that within ten years twelve reprints of Moore’s works have appeared in England. We fancy that the present generation knows the “ Irish Melodies ” tolerably well. Mr. Krans, who is the author of an interesting and lucid book on the so-called “ literary revival ” in Ireland, takes Mr. Gwynn to task for omitting a philosophical consideration of Moore’s relation to that revival. Mr. Gwynn is himself one of the leaders of the Celtic revival, and the author of some interesting books on Ireland.
