CKONED according to their endurance, their superabundant energy, and their absolute disregard of mere humanity, some of the sixteenth century explorers seem to have been no ordinary mortals at all, but rather fragments of the untamed majesty of nature. Their brilliant accomplishments partake of the ruthless power of the elements-' suggest the play of the awful forces that meet us In the tempest, the tidal wave, the terrifying lightning. Outwardly no more than bone and sinew as other men are, their mental structure was fashioned on a build so independent, so colossal, so adamantine, that they must be placed in a class by themselves. Most men, at least under stimulating circumstances, are capable of heroic deeds, but in the face of unrelenting and . overwhelming discouragements to prolong these heroics through weary months, or even through years, is not common. Columbus, Cortez* Pizarro, Coronado, De Soto were of this iron mold, and to-day, four centuries after their owners returned their illustrious dust to the warring elements they so much resembled, their names thrill the world with the full power of fresh romance. Their memorable deeds were epoch-making, and they fascinate us. Where In truth or fiction can there be found a story more dramatic than that of the marvelous De Soto, one' of the foremost figures of his time? Two volumes recently added to the Trailmakera Series, and dealing with the exploits of this noble Spaniard, are a boon alike to the student, to the ordinary reader, even to the romance-loving boy. The story of De Soto appeals to them all, and it would be difficult to discover another that can attract so varied an audience. No embellishments are needed to flavor the facts of De Soto’s life.	.
In their baldest form they suggest the wonder * days when knights with charmed lives performed the impossible. And even at the last De Soto's career was * terminated by no commonplace snuffing out in the midst of luxury. Far from the moat advanced fringe of civilization, in the very heart of the wild land he 7-was first to traverse, it was closed by that famous \ dramatic incident shrouded by the mystery of night— the secret burial beneath the booming torrent of the '.i Mississippi, In color it was a burial worthy of DeT*i Soto’s remarkable exploits. Unlike the previous vol- / umes of this Interesting and valuable series, the De Soto is more than a reprint in accessible shape of rare books in English, for it presents matter never ; before given in our language; nothing less, in fact, than a large part of the very important diary of ; Rodrigo Ranjel, the great explorer’s private secre- ' tary. Prof. Bourne of Yale, in studying the history of the De Soto expedition in connection with the preparation of his “ Spain in America,” discovered that this narrative of Ranjel’s had been bodily incorporated in Oviedo's " Historia General,” and he skill- ■ fully proceeded to extricate it, with the valuable -result that he presents it to the public for the first ; time in these -volumes, of which he is the editor. It ; forms one of the most important contributions to the literature bearing on the exploits of the Adelan- ■ tado of Florida, and bestows additional lustre on this excellent series, so admirably chosen and directed v by Mr. Ripley Hitchcock. Unfortunately, the narra- , tive breaks off before the death of De Soto, but so ;; far as it goes it serves to corroborate the standard narrative of the gentleman of Elvas, which rightly ! takes a first place in this work.	^
There are in addition the narrative of De Biedma, * a letter of De Soto, some fragments from De Oarmona.'V and Juan Coles, and the well-known life of De Soto -hy Buckingham Smith, as well as an editors,intro- v duction of great value. These united tell and retell^ the 'wonderful story with considerable detail/ , and-v; the reader over and over again marvels at the un- j limited courage and the sublime fortitude of. this.^ famous Conquistadore. From start to finish Da Soto'S S
life was a romance. Of noble origin, his .love of i: adventure led him to the New World as* a^rly

he “was one ot^the first settlers In ^icarag&a, -where he speedily became a.
. leading force. Appointed a Captain, he • lived 1 associated with Compafion and Ponce de-Leon. Companion died early, but Ponce in his later-search for the fabled fountain linked his name with Florida almost as firmly as with De Soto's. At this time the three were wealthy, and De Soto took a very prominent place in the exploration of Central America. Prom there with Pizarro he went to Peru to win a share of those vast treasures of gold accumulated by the unfortunate Incas. In Peru his activity was scarcely less brilliant in results than that of Pizarro himself, whose Lieutenant General he was made. In the celebrated attack on the Inca-warrior Atahualpa he was one of the foremost in : that marvelous piece of daring strategy, when the little band of Spaniards struck with such certainty and swiftness that 2,000 of the <>nemy were "annihilated even before they understood
-	what was happening. For his .services in Peru, De Soto received a third portion of the divided Inca treasure, a share which amounted to the large sum of 23,532 pesos, each of the value of an ounce of pure silver. This with the rest .of his spoil made a grand total of ISO,000 cruzados, about $90,000 of our money. It was an enormous fortune for those days. Though a man of severe bearing, headstrong, and ruthless in the execution of his plans, he felt sympathy for the defeated Atahualpa, and during his confinement played chess
and dice with him.
De Soto, if he could get there, was ever in the thick of the fray, and he was the leader in one of the fiercest battles the Spaniards had in Peru. Silver was so common a rcptal that at one time he had his horses shod with it. while he was in Peru another man, destined to be closely associated with him, went there with Pizarro’s rival, Alvarado. This was Luis de Moscoso de Alvarado.
When De Soto returned to Spain he was made a Knight of the Order of Santiago. He lent the Emperor money; he had a .fine house, “ with a Superintendent of the household, an usher, pages, equerry, chamberlain, footmen, and all the other servants requisite for the establishment -of a gentleman." A sort of Count of ■Monte Cristo he was then. At Court he •was attended by four wealthy gentlemen, three of whom had acquired their fortunes in Peru, and had returned with him. One of these was tho Luis de Moscoso, before mentioned. All went about ‘elaborately dressed, though this display was foreign to De Soto’s usual desire. -Moscoso was a particularly gay courtier, -but nevertheless a man of strong will and resolution. De Soto then married Dona Ysabel de Bobadilla, daughter of a deceased nobleman.
But he was not satisfied to remain amid these luxuries. Narvaez had failed in his expedition into the unknown realm, and De Soto was desirous of renewed conquests. The Emperor therefore created him Governor of Cuba, and Adelantado of Florida, a land vaguely defined as extending from the river of Palms, the present Rio Grande, eastward to the Island of Florida, with the new land adjoining. Within four years of the time of his landing he was to receive 200 leagues of shore of his own selection from his conquests, when he was to be Governor and Captain General, with the dignity of Adelantado for life and High Sheriff in perpetuity for his heirs. It was a tempting prospect. About this time there came home that celebrated survivor of the disastrous Narvaez expedition, Oa-beza de Vaca, who had crossed Texas and after years of wandering had reached the Mexican settlements. Cabeza had come back to secure the government of the wild country he had seen, and he refused to divulge his knowledge of it because of a compact with Dorantes, one of his companions, but he “ gave them to understand that it was the richest country in the world." De Soto proposed that Cabeza should accompany him, and it was agreed, but they fell out over a financial detail. Cabeza then had a talk with the Emperor. This, magnified, leaked out, and the resuit of so much mystery and veiled assertion was that De Soto had a host from whom to choose his recruits. Many of these were dainty gentlemen who incurred his wrath by appearing in showy silks at the f»rtt review. Six hundred he finally accepted. Then he bought seven ships, with the necessary supplies. All dreamed of coming back with great fortunes, and their visions wore not unwarranted after Mi-xico and Peru. Everything favored tho iofey view.
In April, 130S, tho expedition sailed from Spain. DoiVi Ysabel accompanied her husband as far as Cuba, where she tarried waiting for his successful return from the " land which appeared to them to be the richest of any which until then had been discovered,” but when he said good-bye to her on that 18th of May, 1539, and turned the prow of his expectant fleet toward the shores of Florida, it was their farewell for all time. The Captain of Nicaragua, Lieutenant General of Peru, Governor of Cuba, and Adelantado of Florida was simply marching to his burial place in the, unknown region where Coronado, as well as he, was to find disappointment. On the 30th of May the army landed in Florida with 213
•horses. Moscoso wa&Master of the. camp and set the men in order. “ A • few .days later a scouting party came upon a dozen j Amerinds, whom ‘they immediately at--! tacked. The Amerinds fled, wounded, but one cried out in Spanish, " Do; not Trill me. Cavalier; I am a Christian! Do not slay these people, they have’ given me my life!” Jt was Juan Orths, a survivor of the Narvaez expedition, who was then on his way to join his countrymen whose arrival had been made known to-him by his sav- ; age friends. He became interpreter to De | Soto, and was so useful that when he died i in the Winter of 1541-2,'De Soto was at j a loss to proceed without-him, -	.
At the end of three '/ears of wandering and fighting, and Wi+hout d?Soav*ry of a single scrap Of gold,. Do Soto found himself in severe straits, beyond the Mississippi. T^vo hundred *nd fi"ty cf his :r>en and 130 * of his’ horses tetc. dnad. Still he was undaunted; He pl^Dn^d to j leiurn to Cuba to spend i/iore money for a further equipment to enter the regions beyond where Cabeza de Vaca had been. But the attempt to follow down the great river was a failure. Vast bogs, swamps, canebrakes, overflow, la jk of food, all combined against him. And the gallant leader was ill of fever. He grew despondent as his waning strength became more and more appirert. But to maintain command. 0l the Amerinds he ordered an attack on the near-by town of Nilco. Taken by surprise the people were slaughtered, as so many others had been along the previous route. " The crics of the women and children were such as to deafen those who pursued them. About 100 were slain. Many were allowed to get* away badly wounded that they might strike terror into those who were absent.” But De Soto, the invincible, was now face to face with that adversary whom none can master. He realized that his end.was near. He asked his company to nominate a successor to himself, and they left the nomination to the fast-sinking leader. He proposed Luis de Moscoso, who was elected unanimously. Many hoped that Moscoso would be desirous of returning to the gay life at Cour*- and thus speedily extricate the followers from their precarious position.
To conceal De Soto’s death, which occurred the next day, May 21, 1542, Moscoso had the body secretly buried, but, fearing discovery, he dug it up and in the dead of night took it, wrapped in blankets full of sand, in a canoe to the middle of the river, then In flo*=d **xid rw*_£ a league broad, and diopped it into the stream. The Amerinds were tnen told that De Soto had ascended to the skies, as he had done on many other occasions. This trick was resorted to because it was feared that the discovery that De Soto was but an ordinary mortal, and not the son of the sun as had been proclaimed, would precipitate the masses of the Amerinds upon the explorers and destroy them.	■	.
The next thing was to get out of the country. Moscoso at first proceeded westward, hoping to find the way to the Mexican settlements, but t».is was a failure. Finally returning to the Mississippi, they there built seven brigantines under the direction of a Genoese. -ron was obtained from the chains used for their slaves, from bridle bits, &c.; sails from shirts and Amerind blankets; cordage from the bark of trees. On July 2, 1543, they sailed 250 leagues down the river Mid entered the Gulf, where they coasted westward to the river “ Banico.” Fifty-two days after leaving the Mississippi they reached this river and were among their countrymen, who received them with enthusiasm. It was supposed that the whole party had been annihilated. Three hundred and eleven out of the six hundred got back to Mexico.
Thus the great expedition which was to raise De Soto to the pinnacle of fame came to an ignominious end, but as an example of human endurance and resolute endeav-o-* it lias few parallels.

T*'e mission'■ry pru..t whose life and j work are lure recorded, chiefly in h's own simple words, will probably 1 id in universal affection ond honor a plav;e at least equal to that held by the iliustri-ous Las Casas. His labor was performed ! without the accompaniment of martial triumphs that gave immediate fame to the splenuid achievements of the groat Spaniard. Father De Smet toiled as arduously, agonized as terribly, and conquered as gloriously in the same cause, but his life was spent in such remote wildernesses that its light, like that of a distant star,, has been long in reaching us. It has now reached us, and in a great radiance that will endure as long as mankind cherishes ideals of heroism and devotion to duty.
It has been said that Father De Smet '
oijly 'Wbitemn who *v;er won': t&o** general and profound love of the-Indians;. However this may bet it is* certain that the'Indians loved and /honored, him more than. any other white man of his day, that he wielded more influence over them, than any other, and that no other man in the history of this country devoted himself with so much heroism and ao' much sacrifice to the service of the Indians, Often it happened that he the only white man the Indians w'*o.d permit to approach them, aud -services were more than ‘or^e rtooijnized by the United f>*^tes	’yunent	as	absolutely
indls^ns^We in the work of pacifying
Cle tr.oes.

' The puiity o.! their lives the Cleanliness rp-rigi'tness cf their souls e«»j’9 them to preserve to the close of their lives ^he oi»™ingtlme freshness of th^1/ earlier ve^rs/1 The "springtime freshness ” of ti»e ■missionary’s *3eal was such that he b^fran his labors for the Indians when* he was only twenty-two years of age, and lid not cease until death found him engaged, though ill and feeble, in recording «:e results of KJs ^alf century of work. Tne greatest oi«rf/"'rt,ines he suffered, the greatest pain he endured	due to the
action of tl.e C'jurch axil of the Government in limiting or destroying the fruits of his labors among the Indians.
It is interesting to note that Father De Smet’s first missionary work was due to the suggestion of John C. Calhoun, then Secretary of War, in April of 1823, that if the Church would establish a novitiate near St. Louis it should be given a tract of land for the purpose. In the band of twelve devoted souls that started almost immediately to seize the golden opportunity was young De Smet, a native of Belgium, born in 1801 in Termonde. In 1838 De Smet was sent into more active work than the . station at St. Louis offered opportunity for, and became a missionary among the Potawotomies, who occupied the country ! In the vicinity of the site of the present town of Council Bluffs, Iowa. But he was soon to go further into the boundless and unknown regions of the West. The event which finally decided his career for the rest of his life was one of the roost , remarkable in	history of Christian
missions. l*’or the fust time, it is said, the Indians came to the -»**te man seeking his religion. In 1831 tli«»?e came out of the darkness four Ir.aians belonging to either the Flathead or Nez Perc6 tribe —for even this interesting fact is not yet determined. They appealed in vain to the whites to send missionaries to in- : struct their people. A second &nd a third embassy followed, but in vain. Still a fourth .came to St. Louis in 1630, consisting of two Indians—Pierre Gaucher and Young Ignace. Father De Smet calls them Iroquois, who had been' for twenty years living among the Flatheads and Nez Perc§s. This time the embassy did not fail. De Smet volunteered to go with the Indians to their people in the Far West, apd accompanied Ignace the following Spring, Gaucher having gone back to tell his people the good news. Ignace led De Smet along the Oregon trail, which the Indians called the Great Medicine Hoad of the white man. Afterward they plunged into the trackless wilds, finally arriving in the month of July, 1840, at Henry Lake, the source of Snake River. Such was the dramatic beginning of the most remarkable missionary career in modern times.
In the thousands of letters that Father ‘ De Smet wrote to his superiors in the Church or to friends in this country and Europe, and which are gathered together here for the first time, he has shed new, and often unsuspected, light upon every aspect of Indian life. So fully and so well has he described the life and customs of the North American Indians, their mental and spiritual no less than their physical^Hfe, that w re the Tioes and re-finants of nations i.ow iwept a«;ay s. complete knowledge o1' *neir characteristics ai d stage *»f culture eou'd he had L*om *hese v ^ij.nes. It s*-.eu.s to htive heen K-fhei'De	tp'uijn that *li^ In-
Uians of histhue, a* ? i^t ij the Nort'.wc^t, "vere practically the mi.no ueo^ie vhom '* -ie first white men found o l L'-ese ._h -/es, a id were in practically the same stu-e of c’dt'ire as they had been in for cer-tni-ies. He cc*-ms to imply as i^uch in his re-rr.d.rV'S a^jut permanent fo^ms of pottery and the persistence of tribal character-»^ *cs. He found the tribes in the North-•vc-st maKi-ig the same sort of pottery ps is d ’'S	supposedly indent mounds
-,‘\d found in the cave dwellings of a supposedly prehistoric race.
O; co.use the most valuable part of this boolt is that which deals entirely with Indian life, and the euitors are to be congratulated upon their success in keeping this essential and vital part continually the most prominent, although, it must be said, that a little too much space is given to travels in Europe and elsewhere and to matters rather remote from the real work of the missionary. Too much room could not have been allowed to the invaluable facts and comments that enrich the great mass of Father De Smet’s letters dealing with the Indians;
. hut- Ms: travels. In- Europe have only a ; crubflfrdinate interest, often- very jremote.
' J AmonV-tha most, interesting and.valua-ble accounts of Indian life with which
-	the volumes abound are those of -the daily life of the Indians, their customs,, their methods of hunting and fighting, their, educational system, or, rather, their system of trainings youth, their cannibalism, and their religious Ideas. As to the religious culture of the Indians, however, the value . of the views of the great missionary is seriously damaged by his opinion, expressed on Page 1,003, that the religious system of the Indians, "is far superior to that of Hindustan or Japan.” This may be due, of course, to mere ignorance of the htxh s*ate Of ethical culture, higher than that of Bvrope at the time, in Japan and _n 'u»any coitions of J.&a:a; but the assertion Is most un^vrluimte.
A .lenm^e lnst*njo of ^^rJbalicsra is given, un Pages 509-510 Father De Smet says that a cfc-<*f told him that one of the members of his tribe was so reduced by extreme famine that he ate successively his wife and-four children. The implication that the Indians practiced cannibalism to a certain extent seems irresistible.
As to the capacity of the Indian, Father De Smet is of the opinion that it has been very greatly underestimated. He asserts that what many writers have taken to fce mere instinct, the faculty that enables an Indian to pass through trackless forests hundreds of miles In extent and emerge inerr-intly at a selected point, is the rc<w\lt of long and patient training begun in' infancy. Their religious Ideas, we have seen, he ranks very high, and he records it as his belief that the simple open life followed by the savages results In courage, honesty, fortitude, a fair degree of practical morality, and perfect physical and mental health. While on one of his many journeys to Europe a friend asked him how he could live among the frightful savages In. America. " PYight-ful savages! ’* he retorted, *’ I have met more savages in the great cities of America and Europe than I have seen in my life in the plains and deserts of the United States;’’	..........
There is an interesting suggestion that Father De Smet may h?ve influenced the decision of the Mormons to settle in Utah. Li Oe Autumn of 1840 he met the advance guard of the Mormons near the frontier of Missouri. The leaders asked him to tell them-about various portions of the Far West, and he described in enthusiastic words the section of country about the Great Salt Lake. " Was that what determined them ? ” he asks. It is not improbable that his information influenced the decision of the Mormons as to a site for their colony. The most valuable service that Father De Smet rendered the Government of the United States was, perhaps, his work in pacify. ing the hostile Sioux in 186S. As to this the editor remarks:
Father Eie Smct's work on this occasion ; was now done, and he at once set out for home. His achievement was one of the most remarkable* in the history of our Indian wars. He was sixty-eight years old and suffering with bodily infirmities which in a few years were to end fatally. He made a journey of 350 miles through a rough and unknown country to a large force of Indians who had sworn death to any white man who might fall within their power. There was no other man who could approach them. Yet by virtue of his great reputation among all the tribes, their absolute faith In his word, and their belief that he had their inter-1 ests at heart, and, we may add, his de-, vnut trust in the Lord *wtrom he served,
! he did this remarkable thing, and brought about a peace in the most hateful and difficult situation that our Gox'ernment had been called UDon to face in all its troubles with the Indians.
One of the essential qualities of the successful missionary is an exalted optimism, and Father De Smet possessed this in a remarkable degree. He felt that almost everything was possible with the Indians. This was doubtless largely accountable for the wonderful influence he had with them. They always felt that he beMeved in them and trusted them implicitly. Only twice did his general optimism yi.-'3, and then only for a time. This happened during the depressing period of Know-Nothingism, when he despaired of his adopted country and thought that he foresaw the beginning of the Dnd. In a letter to a friend in Europe hi, wrote:	,
1 can.iot :ay much of the United States. Tn’s *• ast la'id, with all its advantages, must grow threat and mighty, * 9 * but the American liberty and tolerance, so highly boasted. exVfs ■$ in this great Rapubllc than in the must oppressed country of Europe.
And in another letter:
Let me say, entre nous, this country is mure lung rapidly toward anarchy. T d^re say we are already there in some degree.
*	*	* Liberty here Is a perversion of
the word; it is'license pure and simple.
It Is gratifying to Know that a larger view and a fuller experience corrected these opinions and banished these gloomy fears, and that the great missionary was restored to perfect confidence in the hlgt. desdnies of his country.
To sum up the achievements of so vast and so fruitful a life as '..hat of Father De Smet is impracticable. Even the four large volumes, nearly every page devoted to a record of this work, are manifestly only a summary. The reader can see that no record is made of much that was done

and lived, and thnt he has here only the best gleanings of a harvest too abundant to bo gathered. He made journeys that took him over 1SO.OOO miles, and his years of artivro labor were almost exactly half ji renliiry. He worked as no man had ever worked in the service of the Indians, bat ho did much more. His writings have contributed, perhaps, a greater fund oL information concerning the American Indian than had boon contributed by any other work in any language. He cleared up disputed points about the geography of the vast regions of the West, added new facts concerning the soil, the water courses, the mountain ranges, the boundless resources of the country, and of the wonderful opportunities it offered to settlors. He knew of the presence of gold in the mountains twenty years before it was known to other white men. but kept its whereabouts a secrct because he felt that the gold seeker would destroy tlfe Indians. As no other man has so fully and so deeply understood the Indian, so no other has contributed so much information about his life and customs or served the cause of justice so well in uprooting the prejudice against the aborigines of this country. The North American has noL only been at last faithfully portrayed, but he has received his meed of praise and the final judgment upon hiss character.	STANHOPE SAMS.

SENATOR BENT ON.
THE I JFK OF THOMAS HART BENTON.
By William M. Meigs. Philadelphia:	lhe
J. B. Lippincott Company.
There	was distinctly	room	for	a one-
volume	biography of	Senator	Benton.
Almost	the only small	book	on	his life
readily	accessible was	Mr.	Roosevelt's
biography :n the American Statesmen Series, and this, like the other volumes in that series, is brief and makes little pretense to much original research. At the eame time It gives a picture of Benton superior to any which can bo found In Mr, Meigs's book. The greatest praise that we can award tho latter is to say j that it is tho result of a painstaking and 1 laborious Investigation and that it will | be of considerable value to students of history. The material, unfortunately, is | put together with very little literary skill, and the style Is certainly not such as to attract the reading public. It is highly regrettable that Mr. Meigs cannot make us take the interest in the character Of his picturesque subject which he tells us he himself feels.
Thomas Hart Benton is perhaps, of all our statesmen, most closely associated with the great Southwest. He followed the frontier westward from the Carolina uplands across the Mississippi to St. Louis, and soon became the leading citizen and^ favorite eon of Missouri. His public, career began when Missouri’s first Legislature sent him to the United States Senate, where, he used afterward proudly to say. he had served six Roman lustrums.
It is probably as Jackson’s lieutenant in the Senate that Benton achieved his greatest fame. The point of time when he first came to Jackson's support was when ( the election of 1824 was thrown into the ; House of Representatives. In earlier years they had had a very bitter quarrel, , but in December, 1823, Jackson took his seat in the same House with Benton, as | Senator from Tennessee. Benton, in ope of his letters, tells how the quarrel was finally made up:	.
He asked me how my wife was, and I asked him how his was. Then he called and left his card at my lodgings—Andrew Jackson, for Col. Benton and lady; forthwith I called at his and left mine—Col. Benton, for Gen. Jackson.
Missouri’s vote in the House was* cast for Adams, but Benton and Jackson remained friends. It was in the bank contest and questions growing out of it that Benton rendered \most conspicuous service j to Jackson. Mr. Meigs shows the inherent absurdity of the contention that Jackson ! opposed and finally destroyed the hank for purely partisan and political motives. The opposition of Benton and the President was. at bottom, the opposition which . a/new and growing region like the West was sure to feel toward the moneyed interests of the older East.
One of Benton's finest characteristics was tils intense and unvarying love for the Union, a quality which in some respects raised him above any one of the great Senatorial triumvirate-rClay, Calhoun, and Webster. Calhotin loved tie Union, but he loved something else better; Clay, for motives of expediency, was . willing to truck and huckster to sentiments of sectional, animosity* and even Webster In his early career defended public opposition to the Government, even when that opposition savored strongly of disunion. But Benton, himself a slaveholder and a Senator Jroin a slave-bolding State* at all times and os ail occasions and abpvo all things ttpheld the Union. It is vastly to the credit of one whoso interests* and associations were with the South that when lie believed the Southern pro-slavery t*ropsganda was dangerous to tho Union be opposed tt as strongly and for tKs same reason that be had opposed Kortham anti-dl&very ftgjtaHan. He appears to have been no friend to apal-
icy of compromise; that of 1833 he con- j ■*taruU' uiiu i-*d *.0 "n cj-t-promise btf- ; tween two politicians,’* lCi<*y iud Cal- 1 houn.] “A compromise made with a j State in arms is a capitulation to that : State." And many years later he ridiculed Clay’s Omnibus bill as a medley of fine old bills which, when separate, had had no special virtue, but had now become remarkably sweet smelling by being bundled together. Perhaps Benton’s most significant action in regard to the compromise of ISTvO was his opposition to the fugitive slave law. He undoubtedly saw that it would do nothing to ailay scctional discord.
From 18i‘0 till ISjO Benton's hold on the Democratic Party in Missouri was almost autocratic. lie had no rival. His fall from power was caused by his stand on the question of slavery in the Territories. He believed in the Constitutional power of Congress to prohibit it then, but his constituents decided differently, and he lost his seat in the Senate. In 1STi2, however, the Democrats of the First Missouri District sent him to the House of Representatives at Washington. Benton fought against the Ivansas-Nebraska, bill, and was one of those who thought the Missouri Compromise almost sacred; he also denounced and ridiculed Senator Douglas's pet doctrine of popular or “ squatter ” sovereignty. He characterized the whole scheme as a “ bungling attempt to smuggle slavery ” into the Territories.
Benton lived until 1S5S, some time after the direct sequence of events which led to the civil war had begun. On the evening before his death, he is said to have expressed his understanding of the terrible dangers which threatened the country. With him the last of our great statesmen of the Middle Period may be said to have passed away, and left the future, with clouds and dullness resting upon it, for a younger generation to deal wit.	Lt.

This is a new edition of Mr. Ivasson’s account of how the Constitution was formed. Tho original edition was published in memorial volumes, and at a very high price, in connection with the celebration at Philadelphia in 1887. which commemorated the first centennial of the formation of the Constitution. To the public the older edition is practically unknown, and hence some description of the book may be helpful. The history of the Monroe Doctrine contained in this volume Is new and is drawn mainly from the original sources on file in the State Department.
The object of the book is to show tho failure of the Articles of Confederation and the necessity which was' generally felt for a more effective central Government which would be National rather than confederate, and act directly on individuals rather than on States. The most Interesting and valuable part of Mr. Kas-son’s work is that which describes the debates on the various provisions of the Constitution. As good an idea is given here of the pains and labor which went into making the Constitution, perhaps, as can be found^anywhere, unless one goes directly to that storehouse of information, the Madison papers. The debates show that ipany provisions of the Constitution which seem to us matters of course and beyond dispute were arrived at only after much weary discussion and compromising. The more one studies the Constitution- the more one is impressed with the almost Insuperable difficulties winch confronted the Fathers In welding thirteen sovereign and not always friendly States into one Nation.
Mr. Kasson’s account of the Monroe uoctrlne fills some fifty pages at the close of the volume. From the date of Its promulgation to the present, the Monroe Doctrine has remained the dominant note in our foreign polity. The note was really struck as early as 1811 by President Madison, when he learned of British designs on our southeastern boundary. In a mes- ] sage to Congress he said: “ I recommend to the consideration '■'f Congress the seasonableness of a declaration that the ' United States ccnld not see without se- : rlous disquietude any part of the neighboring territory in which they have In different respects so deep and so just & concern pass from the hands of Spain Into : . those of any other foreign power." A | study off the diplomatic correspondence • which resulted in the “doctrine” of 1S23 convinces us that John Quincy Adams was really responsible for It. He was at tha time Secretary of State, and the two great principles of the doctrine, that . America was no longer op in to European colonisation, and that any intervention by a European power In the affairs of the ! Western Hemisphere would be regarded na M the manifestation or an unfriendly disposition toward the United States/ were really his# .	.	-	■	-	■	_
i Mr. Kacson cites modern Instances or the application of t&a Moa P«c trine and shows the crowing importance of its principles, whicn should operate as pow-ekoUy with, other American countries as wltlTt&fc United States. * IV I* &
