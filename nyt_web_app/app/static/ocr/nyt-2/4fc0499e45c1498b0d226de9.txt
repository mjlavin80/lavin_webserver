The title of the new physical culture book by H. Irving Hancoclt, author of the series on Jiu-Jitsu, which G. P. Putnam's Sons have in active preparation for early Spring issue, has been changed from “ The Case for Physical Culture ” to “ Physical Culture Life.” The purpose of the present volume is to present "in a clear and succinct way ” the aims and methods of the physical culture movement that is going on in England and the United States. Mr. HancocK writes in his introduction:
The physical culture life is not a complex one. Only obedience to the simple and readily ascertained laws of nature is sought. Be simple, natural, and sensible, and it is easy to get on the physical culture road and to keep there. Many fads in physical culture are advocated nowadays, and wi^h all the eagerness and self-conviction that are an essential part of faddism. But fads are invariably extremes, and the truth lies in the mean between the extremes.
* * * No fads will be found between these covers, unless, indeed, it be a fad to study how to conserve one's health and energies. The author, in studying the problems of the care of his own body, has always endeavored to keep vigilantly away from fads; and he has exercised lhe same care in behalf of his readers.
• * * There is a goal in sight for the physical culturtst. and that goal is the finding and continued possession of normal health until extreme old age ends in dissolution. There are simple and sensible rules for living that all may understand and follow. Tbe writer has endeavored to make them plain to his readers. * * * Should the charge of enthusiasm be made against the author, it is to be said in mitigation that fidelity to physical culture begets enthusiasm for the life.
