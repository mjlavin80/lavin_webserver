|	" The exeat Influence of the work of Charles
Dickens as a social reformer" was the avowed subject of the various speeches at the dinner of the Boz Club in London on the evening of Dickens’s birthday, Feb. 7.

The Chairman remarked that though Dickens was undoubtedly a political reformer, yet I he was not a politician, and never made but one political speech. The Lord Chancellor, however,
