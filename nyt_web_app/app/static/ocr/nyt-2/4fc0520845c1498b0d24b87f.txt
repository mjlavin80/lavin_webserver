The storied exck veness of London clubs has been somewhat relaxed lately; hence the publication of a. few books of historical g-ossip and anecdote concerning some of the ^Ider and more revered institutions cf this sort. The latest of these is Mr. Percy Fitzgerald's gossipy book about the famous Garrick Club, which has just been published in London. Because of its -association with the dramatic stage and the stories of the artistic treasures displayed behind the forbidding: facade of its house, not far from Covent Garden, the Garrick has a measure of fame with the multitude which some of the clv.'^s housed on Pall Mall neither enjoy'nor envy. Its collection of pictures is valuable and the chance to view is is eagerly seized by outsiders. An invitation to dine or sup at the Garrick is to many a Briton a noteworthy event long to toe remembered and talked about. Mr. Fitzgerald’s book seet^s. from the London reviews, to have all its author’s literary, characteristics. Many of the great English actors, painters, and poets were members of the Garrick. Many of the

best in those branches of art still frequent the clubhouse; Interesting gossip about these is always readable. One does not look to Mr. Percy Fitzgerald for anything more.
