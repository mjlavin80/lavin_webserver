The relations between novelists whose books are illustrated and the artists who make the pictures are not always cordial, and with very good reason. Many a good story has been more than half spoiled by a careless, self-satisfied artist, who has transformed blondes into brunettes, old into young, a bald head into curly pate, with a few strokes of a superfluous pencil. In the recent dispersal of a collection of autographs in London some letters came to light Of I Charles Dickens to George Cattermole, who illus-; trated “ Bamaby Budge ” and The Old Curiosity | Shop.’* which show that tbe relations of conscientious i artists with great writers may be most cordial. Dick-I ens described vividly to C&ttermole tho passages he i desired the artist to illustrate, such as the destruction of the Maypole Inn and the capture of the Emma and Dolly Varden, and he expresses his complete satisfaction with Cattermole's work.
