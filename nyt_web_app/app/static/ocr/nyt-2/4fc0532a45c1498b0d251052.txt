With tho development of that most excellent game of cards, bridge, (or bridge whist as the uninitiated still call it,) there is growing tip a literature of the game which is worthy of note. Mr. El well’s books on the subject doubtless wiil hold their place in the esteem of American players. His " Advanced Bridge ” (Scribners) comprehends all the latest developments of bridge, and is a wise and conservative monitor. The obvious trouble with the multiplication of books on the game is that it tends to confuse the judgment of a player who is also a theoretical student.
Some of the best players, we Infer, bother very little with theories and care nothing at all for the literature of bridge. These will not find edification in the announcement that Edmund Robertson, an English bridge enthusiast and theorist, and A. Hyde-Wollaston are preparing a formidable work on “ The Higher Grammar of Bridge,” full of rules for the guil- | ance of advanced players and excursions i Into the domain of mathematics. A fore- j taste of the quality of this may be derived from their little book on ** Bridge Developments.” (Bren'tano's, 51.25.) The j . mathematics in this are highly interesting ! to a mathematician, but we doubt if it will help an ordinary player to know that his chance of holding all thirteen trumps is one in 635,000,000,000. There is an excellent chapter in this book on 41 The Rules of Bridge,” and it has a good glossary of bridge terms. Its chief point, however, concerns the so-called Robertson rule for a no-trump declaration, for which the honor cards of the pack are given arbitrary values, aces seven points, kings five, queens three, jacks two, and tens one. If the game is against him the dealer is advised to declare '* no trumps *’ with twenty-one of these points, taking the chiLOce that his partner will have on average hand of eighteen points. If the dealer ha,s twenty-five of these points he is urged to declare “ no trumps ** no matter how the game stands.
We find in this book also this rule:
*■ When the dealer's hand totals up to six or less by the Robertson rule he should declare spades, and not leave it to his partner.” We find practically the same rule in a booklet published by W. R. Jenkins, " Simple Rules for Bridge,*’ by K. N. Steele* accompanied by this sensible note:
** The above rul<- is not popular at clubs/* We fancy it > ■ -v>t popular among bridge players ;tn' *!;vrc. “Foster’s Bridge Mitxims," < P-ri.-ntano’s, $1,) a useful book for beginners, and a handy one to have about even if you think you know tho game, contains a safer rule for the dealer:
“ A black suit should not be declared unless the score is sufficiently advanced to , win the game with average assistance I from the Dummy."
