The- "wider: ajid Cnabre. ;sf grfflcah t com-'; paiison of - the n^tureand value of the-publications of the' respective countries can only be made on much more extensive data.

THE iVI A K. I ISI	OF	BOOKS	.
Bookmaklng in the United States has been prosperous and increasingly active, according to the careful statistics j gathered by The Publishers' Weekly j and produced in its number of Jan. 28. j The total output of new books and j new editions advanced from 7,865 in 1903 to 8,291 in 1904, an increase of 420; but the increase in new books alone was much more marked, being from 5,793 to 6,971, or 1,178, while the new editions fell off about 750. This is a fairly favorable showing for the mental fertility of our writers and the demand for their product.
There are some curious variations in the different classes of books. One might suppose tfiat the greatest increased activity had been In fiction, which still stands well ahead of all others. Buj. while the number of new works in fiction increased only 181, the number of works tn theology and religion increased by 440, or nearly threefold; literature and collected works increased 306, or nearly doubled, while books on fine arts and illustrated books increased about 50 per cent. There was also an increase in poetry and the drama from 421 to 530, or more than 25 per cent. Of course it is to be remembered that the works of fiction undoubtedly represent far wider circles of readers and stand for a much larger share-of the book trade, and also that the variations from year to year may easily offset each other. But it remains true that the relative advances we have noted have a distinct significance and an encouraging one.
Another interesting table prepared by The Publishers’ Weekly shows th* total number of new books by American authors, the number of books by j English and. other foreign authors pub- i lished in this country under the terms of the International copyright law, and the books by English authors imported in editions. The books by American authors number 5,978 out of 8,291, or 72 per cent. The number of books published under the international copyright was 1,288, or about 15 per cent., and the foreign books imported in editions were 1,025, or about 13 per cent. This would certainly indicate that the international copyright does produce a perceptible effect on the International market and justifies Itself, so far as it gees.
An analytical table quoted from The Publishers’ Circular of London shows that the total number of new books and new editions produced in the United Kingdom was 8,334, or almost exactly the same as in the /United States. But this was a slight falling
off from the figures of 1903, while the number of new books was some 500 smaller than in our country. Considering the difference in population and in the distribution of wealth, the comparison is not in itself very flattering, but it means something, of course, that we have caught up with our elders in the matter of number and have slightly passed them. The comparison is less favorable with France, which keeps at about a total of 10,000, exclusive of pamphlets and like minor publications.
