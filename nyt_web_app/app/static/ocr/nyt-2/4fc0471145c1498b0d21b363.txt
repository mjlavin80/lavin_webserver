Nor. York Times Book Review :
Far from taking the air of a commentator or that of a critic on Dante, I would like to contribute an explanation of tlie
two verses of Dante's Divine Comedy, referred to by your correspondent in Thu
Book Review (Jan. 28) on “ Dante and Virgil.” As a matter of fact I do not possess an Oxford text of Tutte le Opere di Dante Alighieri, but other Italian texts, which, if not as elegant as the Oxford text, can surely vie with it in correctness, for I must say as a foreword that if I shall judge that text by the three verses reported in these columns—one Saturday, Jan. 21, M E caddi come corpo morto cadde,” which should be 'cade,' and two In to-day’s, (Jan. 28,) ** Tu sc* dolo comi da cui i ' toIsL Lo bello stile che m*ha fatto onore," which should be “ Colul," l should think that text is not a marvel of typography in correctness, but of course I shall doubt it only wrongly reported. .
As for the two verses In Dante's “ Divina Comedy/’:
*' Tu se’ solo colui da cui I ’ tolsl,
Lo bello stile che m’ha fatto cnore/'
it seems that commentators «.nd critics have touched upon them quite lightly, taking it for granted that students and
readers of Dante would readily understand their meaning.
" The beautiful style which has done me honor ” indirectly refers to his previous works, Vita Nova and the Canzoniere, (at least in part,) and are not to be taken as self-praise. The phrase also directly refers to that new style of language which
lent itself so beautifully to the art of writing lyric poetry In which the books were written, known then as •* Volgare Florentin,*’ which we now call the Italian and Dante Its father. And why could ho not say so without the least shade of selfpraise. inasmuch, as he only ulluded to the new style of writing: in which tils
works were written, and which even if his later Divine Comedy had never seen the light, his " Vita Nova and Canzoniere" alone would have been enough to render him immortal and place him even far above Petrarch? (See Cinguenfe-Historie litteraire d'ltalfe primiere partie. Chanter VII.)
Of course, Dante in saying *' Lo bello stileM did not mean to refer to “ La Divina Comedia,” which he had just commenced, much less to the '* Egloghe Latlne,” which he wrote only at least after his first two, (Cantiche,) that is *’ Inferno and Purgatoris," as may be inferred and seen by the passage, (Eglo-ga I.:)
Quum mundi circumflua corpora cantu
Astricolaeque meo, belut inCera regna patebunt
Divincere caput hedera lauroque juyablL
Nor are his Eclogues a palpable imitation of Virgil’s, for they are purely his correspondence with his friend—and we may not suppose for a minute that when he needed to answer his friend he looked up Virgil's works, as if he had not known

-nough l^tiin :m well as "tho beautiful -'Wle."
" Del hei ];»iieso la. Gave il Si suona," «Tuf. t\, XXXI11., Verse SO.) and then l ^ never attempted to imitate Virgil in
■	fyle, as ho only refers lo him in manner of admiration as that of a scholar to nis preceptor in matter of beauty, and nothin matter of imitation.
Virgil had hi.** style in Lyalin, and Dante wanted to create one, which he did. (See also Purs:.. XXIV., Verse CVT.)
*' Di qua dal doice stil ivjovo ch‘ i ’ odo,” ai.J also in his profession of faith, where he says, not in self-praise, but only in stating: tho true facts, as he couJd veTy well do for himself:
“Jo scrissj gia d'amore pifl' volte rime Quanto pin seppi dolci e belle c vaghe E in pulirle adoprai tutte mie lime ”
And in hfs crotic and philosophic ‘'Canzoniere/' perhaps the most beautiful among those who wrote
*’ Riroe d’amore usar dolci e leggiadre.”
I could go ahead and say much more, but not to tax the indulgence of the readers 3 will end by saying again that by “ the beautiful style/' Dante meant to say and refer to *' the new sweet-blended style of writing lyric poetry/* and lo what wc now call Italian language.
