TIBET UNVEILED.
Reviews of Important New Books on the Lhasa Atission by Perceval ' Landon and Edmund Candler.*
CHARAC TER I STIC ALLY British presentation ol a most interesting: and sorae-what delicate subject, Mr. Perceval Land on* s story of the so-ealled Tibetan “ Mis-sipn *' of Col. Sir Francis E. Tounghus-band, with Ills elucidation of the history and modern circumstances which lead up to it, is a book of extraordinary Interest
and value. Mr. Landon accompanied the . British Commissioner and his little army as special corespondent of The Times of London and The New York Timb3. Much of the news of the •expedition therefore from day to day was furnished by him, but this voiume contains things which the press reports did not and could not contain and forms a very complete record not only of one side at least of a most critical diplomatic situation, but of what Mr. Landon himself counts as the last . journey of real human discovery which the world bad to offer the adventurer— ih’e lifting of the veil of mystery from the j most jealously secluded region upon tho j habitable globe. Col. Younghusband has j provided an introduction in which with ! characteristic official caution he declines, while commending his competence as a reporter of what happened, to “be re-i sponsible for any political views ** which . the author may tuvc expressed.
H is hard to do justice to such a book in the limited space which The Book Review allows, V.t some extracts may be culled which will at the same time give the reader glimpses of the vast amount of information which Mr. Landon lias collected, and exhibit his method and his point of view, already described in one w&rd as intensely British, both ill its excellencies and in its shortcomings; both In the humors which it has, (this is not a solemn book altogether.) and the humors which it lacks. To begin with, of course, there is the story of that busy and mysterious Russian subject, Dorjieff, the man who brought home to the English Government the danger of leaving occult Lhasa and iis god-king (for as such the Grand or Dalai Uma is loyally esteemed) unwatched, Mr. Landon exhibits the goings on of this Dorjieff and the machinations of tho Russian Government, not at that time so haunted and terrorized as now. The Lama, he explains, figured it out that, since China, his nominal suzerain, was a broken reed, he needed a mighty ally. Russia was far away. India was near. If he roust have a friend the Dalai Lama, full of Oriental wisdom, preferred a distant one, hence the success of the plottings of Dorjieff, himself a Mongolian Buriat, a teamed Lima, and Professor of Metaphysics at Lhasa, though also a- Russian subject. Through him Czar and Grand I*ania exchanged quite informally and unofficially gifts and understandings. The Czar sent the Lama the robes of a Bishop of the Greek Church; the Lama announced that the Czar was an incarnation of a very illustrious person in the Lamaic pantheon. There was talk of sending a royal Grand Duke to reside in the holy city.
Mr. Landon, with becoming generosity, writes:
Throughout this book I do not wish to suggest that Russia, in attempting to gain influence at Lha&i, was guilty of anything which reflects the least discredit on her statesmen. On the other hand, it was a far-sighted and, from many points of view, an entirely laudable attempt to consolidate the Central Asian Empire, which she believes to be her rightful heritage. The only reason why the British found it necessary to intervene was that theequally justifiable policy which they had themselves deliberately adopted, and their own vastly greater interests in Tibet clashed all along the line with those of the Muscovites. On either side it has been a mere measure of self protection; we happen to have been better placed to achieve our end. What the Russians did In allowing Dorjieff to represent them unofficially in Lhasa we should have been glad to he able to do. and it is a deplorable thing thru the millions of Northern Buddhists under our sway do not produce men of ihe capacity which Is exhibited by a l>orj:eii. If these men were to be found 1 rm.-y v*. rhould have used them willingly hmjf a^o.
At ail events: Uii.'* )>orjieff, in spite of
the opposition of (lit* Tsong-du, or Tibetan National Council, was no confident that he ventured the prophecy that "the Spring of llntf would sec a body of Cossacks in Lhasa.’* But, " he seems to have taken pains that this boast should reach Lord Curzon's ears. It did, and the fat was in the fire."
That is. Col. Younghusband’s mission was organised, and when the Tibetans, who bad taken some small but actionable liberties with British Indian boundaries, refused to treat with that officer at
*THE OPENING OF TIBET, An Account of Lhasa and the Country and People of Central Tibet and of the Progress of the Mission Sent There by the English Government in the Year 1903-4. Written, with the help of all the principal persons of the mission, by Perceval Landon, special correspondent of The Times. Introduction by Col. younghusband. svo. Pp. •4W. New York: Doubleday, Page & Co. 53.S0.	’
Kamba-Jong, *‘a small , post some £ifteen miles north of the true frontier/’ it vas resolved (as a diplomatic move Impressive to the Oriental mind) to go deep Into Tibetan territory, first to Gyantse, and, if the Tibetans remained still unimpressed, to push on to Lhasa and do the treaty making there. The mission was at JCamba-Jong in July, 1903. When it set out for Gyantse in October it was accompanied, as the world knows, by a considerable military escort, artillery, Royal FusIIeers, Sikh Pioneers, and Gurkhas, with hospital, ammunition, and postal columns under command of Col, {now Brigadier General) Macdonald. The successive steps of the advance and the long wait of three months at Tuna while transport was being organized and supplies Jbrought up were chronicled at the time in the daily papers. It is kll given here in more detail and with many excursions Into Tibetan matters of every sort from the flora and the roads to international politics, from the terrors of mountain sickness and the utter unwashedness of the people to the deepest mysteries of Lamaism. Mr. Landon describes, too, the attempts at negotiations, the scramble up the steeps of tbs Himalayas, the fights at the wall near j Phari, at the Karo-la, and especially about j the jong or castle at Gyantse, where for I a time the mission and the vanguard of j the escort were besieged in their camp I by thousands of Tibetans curiously armed | with matchlocks, rifles, and jingals, or ; Asiatic cannon, and where hundreds of Tibetans and some few of the invaders i were killed, the Gurkhas of the native Indian army in particular making some verv hazardous and’ spectacular assaults upon Tioetan fortifications.
The following passages have been ! chosen (not always with entire fairness to their fellows) from a quotable multitude. They are samples and illustrations merely. There's no attempt to weave them into a sequence:
It cahnot be claimed that Tibetan ladies look beautiful. It is, of course, difficult to say what the effect would be if some of them were thoroughly washed. As it is they exist from the eradlo, or what corresponds to It, to tho. stone slab on which their dead bodies are hacked to pieces, without a bath or even a partial cleansing of any kind. One could imagine that they were of a tint almost as dark as a Gurkha, but this is by no nnrans the case. At times, also, accident, perhaps, in the shape of rain, has the effect of removing an outer film of darkness, and then it is quite clear that Tibetan girls, until they are two or three and twenty, have a complexion.
For this dirt the author is able partly to forgive the Tibetans on account of the cold. Even an Englishman, he admits, must in Tibet give up his daily tub. Phari, 15,000 feet above the sea, “ is the highest town worthy of the name in the world; the cold is consequently fearful.” By common consent of the mission headquarters mess (made up of men of wide experience in Oriental towns) Phari was the very filthiest place on earth. And:
Cold is admittedly an excuse for dirt, but it is not cold only that palliates the filth of Phari. At this altitude the least exertion brings on breathlessness and apathy. To put on a pair of boots and gaiters is often a serious exertion for a new-comer.
A jong-pen seems to be a sort of ecclesiastical castellan. As the expedition approached Gyantse the local dignitary of that title came out. He " put the situation elearly enough.”
On the one hand, he said, if he were to surrender the jong to us his throat would be cut by the Dalai Lama; on the other hand, he said, with naive simplicity, that as all his soldiers had run away, he was not able to offer any effective opposition to our occupation of it.
While tho mission was besieged in its quarters at Gyantse. though almost nightly assaults were delivered by the Tibetans, and the jingals on the walls of the jong (which they had recovered) were constant-1y spitting lumps of lead and even pure red copper into the British lines, the mail runners were hardly interfered with, and the telegraph wire remained uncut. The engineer in charge of telegraphs (Mr. Truninger) had explained his wire to the Tibetans. “We are,".said he. J‘in a strange land. Therefore we lay this wire behind us in order that when we have done our business wiLh thy Dalai 1-ama we may find tlie road by which we came and as quickly as possible got hence.”
As to the l^amaio religion, Mr, Landon declares that in the form in which the common people use it, H is so fur from being Buddhism undefiled that Buddha himself would not know it fur his own.
Tinder a thin mask uf names and personifications sugr-ested by the records of the master or by the reforms effected by Asanga, a system of devil-worship pure and simole reigns in Tibet; the monkish communities spare no effort to establish their predominance more firmly cach year, bv fostering the slavish terror which .s the whole attitude toward religion of the ignorant classes of the land.
Mr. Landon found the Tibetans a courteous race. The peasants and the rural population generally, he asserts, noemed well enough disposed lo the English. It was the Lamas only who were implacable.
Of the language, ho says it is entirely distinct, both from Hindustani and Chinese, an agglutinative monosyllabic tongue of which neither structure nor a fairly large vocabulary is difficult to acquire. Incidentally th«s literal translation of the Tibetan word for bribery (not a rare word) is “secret push/’ while to
express weight they hitch two opposites together and say u light-heavy.**
As to Lamaism and how King Srong-tsan-gambo (seventh century A. t>.) imported the Indian faith Into his country and identified Buddha himself with his capital city there IsTi most interesting chapter, in which this gem occurs:
It is said that in old days Tibet was a country of ravines and mountain tops and torrents, varied by huge lakes. Buddlia in person then visited the’land, and found *the' inhabitants1 were monkeys. He questioned the monkeys and asked them wliy they were , not men and good Buddhists, They answered, not without reason, that with the country in its existing state there was no opportunity for the development of their own bodies, let alone their religious impulses. To this Buddha replied i " If you will promise to become men and good Buddhists. I will give you a good and fertile land to live in.’* The agreement having been struck, Buddha then and there drained off the waters from the land, which Is now known as the plain of thfe Gyantse, by an underground tunnel through tbe Himalayas'into the. Ganges near Gaya, The Tibetans on tbeir side kept their promise, and though, of course, they knew not Darwin, became both men and. as they assert, good Buddhists.
Sometimes Mr. Landon packs a j^sal I" to a phi'ase. He has been describing a delightful abode, almost like an English farmhouse, and lie adds:
This quiet little elysium was owned by the Jong-pen of Nagartsc, a man of great Importance and brutality. Upon our arrival all his servants and serfs Implored us as one man to take this opportunity of cutting off his head.
Just outside of Lhasa tho mission met envoys of the hierarchy to whom were exhibited among other things a gay illustrated paper showing King Edward and , the Kaiser walking together. The envoys were informed that the man with hair on his chin was the august Emperor of India. They were much interested. Mr. Landon "tried to explain” who the 1 Emperor’s companion was. He bade I the Interpreter inform the Tibetans that the German Emperor was a very great sovereign and the King’s nephew. This was the interpreter's report of how he did it: j
Sir, I toM them this was the nephew of the Emperor, and a great and mighty monarch possessing^ wide territories. And 1 said that because of the especial love with which our Emperor regarded him, he had of his goodness granted unto his nephew all the wide territories which he possessed.
“ This,’* adds Mr. Landon with admirable gravity, “ was not exactly what l ! had meant, but it was too Jate to correct the impression."
The next two chapters of the book contain the description of Lhasa, o£ the Lama’fl palace, the Fotala towering upon its eminence out of a frame of green parks outside which He the dirty lanes of the holy city, the Jo-kang or cathedral, contemptible without, wonderful within, the sacred way or Ling-kor, winding about the Potala in a circuit which passes now through the park and now through the vilest parts of the town. Upon this ; way the pious go round and round with tireless turning of prayer wheels; but Mr, i Landon Is not clear that they always go j in one direction. Of the Potala, a mass of i white walls crowning a long precipitous ehoulder-shapcd hill, within these walls and over passing them others of red color topped with roofs of gold, the numerous excellent photographs give a much better idea than any of Mr. London's descriptions. Many of those pictures are as near perfect as photographs can be, some taken in the colder regions have suffered, but always the printing processes have been excellent. They form an indispensable illustration of the text.
Finally Mr. Landon describes his own hurried journes' made by relays from** Lhasa back to India. He covered the distance In, eleven days and three hours. The mission remained to complete the tnsaty formalities, though the Dalai Lama had run away. Appendices to the book include notes on natural history, (Mr. Landon has had- much to say of flowers and shrubs by the way.) an illuminating article on the present condition and government of Tibet by Capt. O’Connor, the only man in the expedition who was a master of Tibetan speech; an account of the return of the expeditionary force, and a list of the diplomatic a.id military oflieer3 oi rnj^ion and es;*ort r.ith Cm honor/ eonfenvd upon th<m by the <.lov-ernmr-nt.
EDMUND CANDLER'S BOOK
IHE UNVEILING OF LHASA. By Edmund Candler. With illustrations and a map. svo. ci.uh. Decorated cover. Pp. him. Mew York: Longmans. Green Jt tV>.
In his volume bused upon the Ham*- * pulition. Mr. Edmund Candler (who was the correspondent of The Daily Mail) has supplied another interesting though somewhat different account of the Lhasa mission. He, too, deals at length with the predetermining causes, mutter* diplomatic and historical, and follows the doings of Commissioner and troops. lie, too, sets forth the favors shown by the Dalai Lama to Russia, and his contempt for England and English interests. Lord Curzon sent that theocrat in 1001 a dispatch complaining of restrictions on Indian trade. This dispatch the Lama returned unopened on the somewhat quaint ground that " tho Chinese (his suzerains) did not
permit him to. receive communications from any foreign power/’ There had been also a certain Tibetan mission In St. Petersburg in 1901 with autograph letters and presents from the Dalai Lama to the Czar. The English on that occasion were told that the Lamas had traveled many thousand miles only to Inquire concerning the health of the Czar, and that jho Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs “informed the representatives of the Dalai" Lama that his Majesty was., in . good -health." Mr. Candler sees behind it an‘ Insidious Russification like that going in Persia and Turkestan. The war betwtv.a Russia and Japan, of course, 'made It more convenient for the English to advance their claims to the recognition of Tibet, upon which Russia certainly had designs.
That introduces Col. Younghusband and his mission, liis fruitless negotiations at JCamba-jong, and the advance, the details of which need not be repeated. Mr, Candler describes the difficulties of the way t£nd tbe achievements of the supply and transportation department in the face of obstacles almost beyond exaggeration. He describes also tiie lirst fight with Tibetans.
! It was on this occasion that the Sikhs and Gurkhas displayed that coolness and discipline which won them a European reputation. They had orders not to fire unless they were lired upon, and they walked right up to the sangars until the muzzles and prongs of the Tibetan matchlocks were almost touching their breasts. The Tibetans stared at our men for a moment across their wall, and then turned and shambled down sulkily to join their comrades in the redan.
Mr. Candler was writing a dispatch, the Gurkhas and Sikhs were busy dis-, arming Tibetans; suddenly, there was a 1 rush of the supposed captives, and he received several sword slashes. He writes:
M After a time tho blows ceascd; my assailants were shot down or had fled." After this silly rush the Tibetans made little if any resistance, yet they suffered a loss of seven hundred men. The enemy had shown no soldier-like qualities, and were badly armed. Their guns were worthless, and so were their swords, for the record shows that during the whole campaign there was only one death from a sword wound.
At the Karo-la the Tibetans showed some pluck and were better armed. Yet the author writes:
I was sorry for those Tibetans. Their struggle was so hopeless. They were 1	and	8imPle, and none of us bore the
slightest vindictiveness against them. Here was all the brutality of war and none of the glory and incentive. * * ■ They thought our advance an act of unprovoked aggression, and they were fighting for their homes.
j To certain emissaries of the Grand i Lama who urged the English to turn back on the ground that otherwise they (the envoys) would lose their heads, Col. Younghusband replied in kind. The Commissioner solemnly declared that " he had orders from his King to go to Lhasa; if he faltered his life was at stake; dccapi-; tation would await him on his return.*’ That stopped palaver.
, At last Lhasa is sighted. Mr. Candler writes:
i A few hours ago we caught the first
■	glimpse of the Potala Palace, a golden L dome standing out on a blu/f rock in the centre of the valley. The city is not seen i from afar perched on a hill like the great monasteries and Jongs of the country. It is literally ** hidden. • * • Trees and undulating ground shut out the view of the sacred city until oms is within a mile of it. To-morrow we camp outside. It is nearly a hundred years sincc Thomas Manillas, the only Englishman (until today) who ever saw Lhasa, preceded us.
*	* * The Lamas have opposed us with all their material and spiritual resources. They have fought us with mediaeval weapons and a medlCy of modem firearms They have held services, recited mantras, and cursed us solemnly for days.
Lhasa was found to be squalid and filthy beyond description. “ undrained and unpaved.” The monks looked at the strangers sullenly. On the faces of the common people you might read only " indifference and apathy.” Mr. Candler declares that ever since the middle of the seventeenth century the record of the Tibetan hierarchy has been one of ' bloodshed and intrigue. The regents who held actual power invariably assassinated the Dalai Lamas. When Lhasa was reached the thirteenth incarnation had tun away, and where he had gone was not discoverable.
ill Lhasa Dopuiig. (or De-bung,) is tho largest of the monasteries, containing, it was reported, lO.OOO monks. The English forces wanted provisions, and, understanding that there was plenty at the Depting, sent a polite request that some of the stores might be sold to the mission. This request was refused, the Abbot making all kinds of excuses. Gen. Macdonald pushed forward a force of British and native troops, and then "a ill in line of red-robed monks was seen to l**sue from the gat^ and descend the hill, each carrying a bag of supplies.” Nothing could exceed the sullen looks of the monks. The author writes:
How they hated us? If one of us fell into their hands secretly. I have no doubt thnv would rack him limb from limb, or rut him into small pieces with a knile. The D-*punsj incident showy how difficult was lo make any headway with the Tibetans wiinout recourse to arms.
In tin* filial settlement the Tibetans showert the most “astute evasiveness,” After a palaver lasting an entire month i Col, Younghusband drew up an ultimat-i uni, the gist of which was that the “ mis-slon would enforce compliance.’' At last >he Tibetans gave in and tle-ir submission was complete. There is something like a doubt on the part of Mr. Candler as to the honesty of the Tibetans. Will they keep the peace?
