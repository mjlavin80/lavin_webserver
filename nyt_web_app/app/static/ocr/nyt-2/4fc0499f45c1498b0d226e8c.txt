New York Times Book Review:
It is a great surprise to me to read of any one ridiculing fine editions as Mr. J. A. Judson does In Thb Book Review. It would be well to remind Mr. Judson that though we are satisfied wlih the more commonplace editions for ordinary reading, we bibliophiles all have at home our little sanctum where we may revel In the glorx* of the publications of the *' Private Press,” on hand-made paper/ printed from' full-faced black type, and simply and sometimes flimslly bound in,
plain gray boards* Each one of these books is a treasure to the bibliophile, and it must be remembered that the edition Is limited for his own use only and not for general circulation among the 4‘ common herd."	.
The more limited the edition Is the more the pleasure to the owner, and *wg might also mention that the followers of the Bible do not all come from “ JLunnon, dontcherknaw/* -	•	.
