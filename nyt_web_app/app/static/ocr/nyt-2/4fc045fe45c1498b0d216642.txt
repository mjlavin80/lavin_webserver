The Bookseller’s Point off View,
New York Times Ifooh Rev lac:
I desire to call your attention to an article in a New York newspaper on '* The Bookseller’s Important Work*” The sentence which especially attracted my attention was the following: " We all want money—in reason—for poverty Is slavery, and It means fear and dependence."
That's It, ** we all want money,” and I wonder how much I could borrow from the writer of that article, or, better still, how much would I need to show a profitable business at the end of the year were I to conduct my business on the philanthropic basis of trying to elevate the standard of reading among those who have been my customers for years. 1 know of no more certain method of committing ** commercial suicide '* than to follow out the instructions laid down In the said article. Recommending fiction especially would be precisely like ordering dinner for another person to eat—about one chance In’ ten that you would order something to suit. I am constrained to. believe that If such a policy were carried out. about the only comforting thought of the bookseller at the end of the year, would be the same as the man who had been poisoned by a mistake of the druggist—1. e., the poison was chemically pure.
** Every man thinks his own crow is the blackest.” Let us suppose we recommend on encyclopaedia—to a customer. He buys it, takes It home, and shows his neighbor (who has a different one) his bargain. The result, nine times out of ten, is that the neighbor will convince _your customer that he has been swin-1 died, or at least befen persuaded to buy an inferior work, because more profit would be made by the dealer than there would have been had he purchased the kind he (the neighbor) bought.
Our instructions to clerks are TJrohlbi-tive against the recommendation of books in general. We allow them to say whether or not the book has met with popular favor, tell how It sells, &c., but never to recommend. If recommended, it may call to mind Mark Twain's famous maxim, “ If there were no differences ol opinion, there would be no horse races.” I do not wish to be understood by the foregoing as being personally in favor of the Immense amount of rot that issues annually from our presses; far from it; i am taking the stand that I do from a commercial point of view only.
One more point to show the fallacy of that article. The reading public Is fickle: a Churchill, a Tolstoy, a Dixon, or any other of our great writers of the present day might launch a work to-morrow, equal in mental merit to any of their previous stories, and the sales may never reach mediocrity; we booksellers do not have to tax our memories to any extent to recall cases where we have given large advance orders for new publications, based on the reputation of the au, thor, only to find the sale nominal; yet, though the work may have been highly | recommended by critic, publisher, and i merchant, it failed for somo unknown reason to *' go."
“All honor,” says the article, "to tho bookseller that takes a high and gener-| ous view of his work In life.’* So say I, but how often have we read of persons in history who were highly honored, and yet starved to death. *	>
Considering the close competition and , other drawbacks ever present, 1 would 1 prefer to have inscribed as an epitaph on my headstone, 41 HJc jacet a successful book merchant*’ R. E. SHERWOOD. New York, Feb. 23, 1905.	.
