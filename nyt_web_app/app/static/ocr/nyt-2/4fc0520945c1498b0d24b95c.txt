MORE complete or less v/el-come metamorphosis in stylo, subject matter, purpose — everything Tor which the name of George Gissing has always stood in ibe minds of those who counted lilm among the strongest of the iytter-'2ay novelists—than is to be found m hfs posthumous historical novei, " Veranilda,” It ■would be as hard to imagine as it ts to understand why a man who could do such vigorous work in his own proper sphere should voluntarily turn to labor so little congruous with his special talents. There is, no doubt, a place for the historical novel; there is no doubt that in the making of It can be used much research, much erudl tf on, much skill in the painting of -tne scene and the filling of it with the varied forms of life that shall make it give the Impression of reality. But no one will contend that, as at present pursued, it is a branch of the novelist's art in which Lhe divine fire of genius is demanded or is apt to manifest itself to any noticeable extetvt. Certain it is that there is nothing in ** Veranilda ** to suggest the author of ” The Year of Jubilee,” “ The Oharla- i tan,” ** The Paying Guest," or any oJher j of Mr. Gisring’s previous books—nothing, that is, except the perfection of its style and the conscientious attention whicn it shows even to the least important details. And it Is to the point to note *iiat Mr. Frederic Harrisoxi, who writes the introduction and there expresses the
-	judgment that ** Veranilda ’* is “ far the most important book which George Giss-ingr ever produced that it is " composed In a new vein of his genius, with a wider and higher scope, a more mellow tone i than the studies of contemporary life which first made his fame'*; that it *' contains his best and most original work,” also confesses that he does not like the earlier books and has not even read all of them.	j
The confession explains the judgment in the case of Mr. Harrison, and it also explains the quite contrary opinion on the part of those who do admire exceedingly Mr Gissing’s earlier work, that his lasting claim to fame will be entirely independent of the excellencies of Veranilda." If he had lived there is every reason to suppose that this “ story of Roman and Gotli ” would have taken its very obvious place among his books as a relaxation, an experiment to see what he could do at the popular game, and that having shown that he could do ii very well he would have resumed his really serious purpose of making studies of contemporary life among the British middle classes.
In view of Mr. Harrison’s pronounced | laudations it would perhaps he too shocking to regard ‘‘Veranilda” as grim joking on Mr. Gissing s part at the expenst of the numerous producers of this kinc of fiction. Still the thought can but intrude upon the astonished minds of those J who compare to their utter disadvantage these pages of lugh-steoning narrative with the utpo, clear cut, illuminative and suggestive manner of his other stories. Hardly any theory seems too wild to his old admirers tc account for his flying off upon such a tang. nt as " Veranilda.” and they surely will refuse to look upon it (as Mr. Harrison suggests) as in any sense a culmination of his genius or his work. That would he to ignore the fact that i'-is entirely outside of and unconnected with thr whole spirit and trend of his life work, as harmoniously and consistently shown in all the previous products of his pen.
Really great novelists have been known to resort to such appeals to the popular taste for the sake of generous financial returns which they sometimes involve, but no one who knows anything of George Gissing’s life or aims would for a moment ascribe such a motive to him. In the course of his introduction Sir. Harrison relates an Incident which illustrates In a really remarkable manner the old-fashioned devotion and singleness of purpose, the artistic conscientiousness with which Mr. Gissing pursued what he looked upon as his destined calling, and it also effectively disposes of any theory that he produced Veranilda ” to make money. Mr. Harrison writes:
It was in 1SS0 (he was then but twenty-two) when he sent me his first book In three volumes; a book that wry few have ever seen, and which (sic) he subsequently declined to claim. Crude as it was, I recognized his power and did what I could to help him with work and Introductions. Mr. John Moriey, then editor of The Fall Mall Gazette, was willing to employ his pen. Gissing, however, though sorely pressed at the time, resolutely declined to engage in any miscellaneous work of journalism or criticism, but devoted himself with fervor and self-reliance to imaginative composition. A really brilliant scholar, and a writer of most graceful verse, for many years he accepted day pupils preparing fbr school, while he labored at night at his ideal creations.
Such devotion to art and denial of self are so little the fashion nowadays as to
make Mr. GissLng's attitude toward his work of novel writing and the success-^ in spite of sorrows and sufferings—which it won for him weH worth dwelling upon. He is an example to inspire those who feel the buddings of genius within themselves, even If he did die at forty-six.
But, apaTt from Mr. Harrison's esti- I mate of the valUe of " Veranilda,” as compared with the rest of George Gis- j blng’s work, one can subscribe to all he 1 says of it. It Is a romance of Rome in the sixth century, the age of Justinian and Belisarius, and deals with historical , personages and actual historical events, i If the epoch is one of which the ordinary reader knows almost nothing, it Is, according to Mr. Harrison, almost equally unfamiliar to classical scholars, so that the minuteness and fullness with which Mr. Gissing has depicted characters, scenes, and events is the result of an immense amount of painstaking study on his part of ancient and modern documents and of the antiquities and topography of Rome and its vicinity, This story affords scope, as no other did, for what Mr. Harrison- calls “his poetical gift for local color, his subtle insight into spiritual mysticism, and, above all, his really fine scholarship and classical learning.” That Is, it affords better superficial scope, but K is absurd to suppose that all that was in him of knowledge and power and insight did not go just as fully to the making of those wonderful studies of human nature as he saw and knew It in the London of to-day. They have not always been agreeable or encouraging: reading, but they have always borne the guise of absolute truth, and the truth about remediable evils in our own lives is of more value to this generation than the truth about ancient Rome in her decadence.
Mr. Gissing did not live to finish “ veranilda.’’ or leave any adequate materials to show how he had meant it to end, but not enough is missing seriously to impair its interest or value. "What is published Is in no sense a fragment or a preliminary sketch, but is finished and polished In Mr. Gissing’s best manner. The great regret is that we do not know how he himself regarded “ Veranilda.”
