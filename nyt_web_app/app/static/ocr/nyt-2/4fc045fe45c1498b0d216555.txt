1 Will it not always be t£at the “ man j behind the gun ** decides the fight rather , than the armor before the man? Mr. [“Edward Fraser s Famous Fighters of the Fleet" gives glimpses of naval ac-j tions in the days of the old English navy* It does, indeed, seem nattering to us that our own Capt. Mahan is accepted r.s an authority in England on such subjects as naval warfare. Capt. Mahan described the English fleet beating apparently purposely before the | French ships, but this fleet saved I’Jng-! land. The world has never seen a more impressive demonstration of sea power , upon its history. Those far-distant storm! beatep ships, upon which the Grand Army j never looked, stood between it and the I dominion of the world. - Nelson at Trafalgar did quite as much as was accomplished fa ter by Wellington at Waterloo. The present and the past are contracted i in the opening thapfer. The* Monmouth | of to-day. one of England's cruisers, is ; of 5,800 tons. Her engir.es are of 22.000 1 horse power. If the Monmouth were to j let fly both broadsides, the weight of her projectiles would be two-thirds of a j ton. tier speed is twenty-three knots an
j hour. The luunc the vessel owns is an | old one, and distinguished for having | been represented in not less than thirty former action. It was the Monmouth j that captured the French ship Foudro-zant. Compared with the ordinary man-of-war of to-day that Monmouth ; was an insignificant craft and the' Frenchman was the superior in guns. It was a dogged fight, and' IfcT. du Que.^ne vvas both brave arid able. The Captain of the Monmoulh was killed, but us he died he said to L.ieut. Ciirkett, the second in comnjand:	“ Fight the Fou-
drcyant to the hut, and sink alongside rather than quit her.” On the English ship 24 per cent, of the crew were killed or wounded. The Foudroyant became a mun-of-wur in the English Navy.
‘ The Formidable is another name famous in Kn^ltsh naval annals. The first Formidable was^ji Frenchman captured by Hawke In the Seven Years’ War. The Immediate successor was an English-built craft which became Rodney’s flagship; and with her he won victory when op-; ! posed to De arasse. A famous fighter was Cn.pt. Fauiknor of the Zebra, wha i 1 Carried by storm the French fort in the ‘ West"Indies. There is a picture of Tur- 1 ner’.s, one of his best, which shows the 1
Temeraire onher way to the. ship breaker.* i wherevshe was to -h&.converted into jimk.-.Turner -ealled.his, picture-!’ Tho Fighting; i .Tx-m^rairc togged- lo' herrjhist' berth to be* i . brokeiv^p.” ■T+ie‘‘TCto^rftir© *wfis'bid It irf \ U78& and ^la^^ed:ra,n^l7fl8r 'iShe:^ wm : a;;J
