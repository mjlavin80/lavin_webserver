j In compiling the '* History of the Vic-I toria Cross,” w,hich E. P. Dutton & Co. j are shortly to bring out in this country, j Philip A. Wilkins has aimed, not to draw upon the imagination, but to adhere to ; the official reports given in The London
, Gazette, disptaches from the various seats of war, and to information received by him from officers and men from all parts : of the world. The volume contains an account of the 5li0 acts of bravery for which the Victoria Cross has been awarded, and portraits of recipients.
The list includes men who served in Crimea, Persia, India, China, New Zealand, Japan, Canada, Africa, Afghanistan, Egypt, the Nile expedition, Burma, the Punjab frontier, Khartoum, Crete, Ashan-tee, the Boer war, Somaliland, Nigeria, and elsewhere from l&H down to 1D03. Mr. Wilkins describes the decoration as follows:
The decoration of the Victoria Cross was instituted in 185G and the award made retrospective to the commencement of the Crimean war. In shape it takes the form of a Maltese cross, measures 1-2-5 inches square, weighs about 4'M grains, and is or bronze, being cast from cannon taken by the British Army at Sebastopol. It is attached by a " V " to a bar, upon which is a sprig of laurel. On the obverse the royal cross, surmounted by a lion, occupies the centre, with a scroll underneath bearing the words, “ For valour." The reverse is quite plain, with an indented circle in the centre, in which the date or dates of the act of bravery are engraved. At the back of the bar is the name of til© recipient, and the whole is suspended by a riband, blue for the navy, red for the army. The warrant authorizes a bar to be attached to the riband for any further act of conspicuous bravery on the part of tbe owner of the cross, but no such bar has ever yet been issued, ali though statements to the contrary have j frequently been made.
In appendices are given the Victoria : Cross warrants, extracts from reports of ! engagements, &c., and from diaries, press reports, &c. On the front cover of the : volume is stamped a fac simile of the i Victoria Cross.
