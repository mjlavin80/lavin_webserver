' Two new volumes in the series of Dictionaries of Quotations published here by j E. P. Dutton & Co. are about to appear. They are “ Famous Sayings and Their Authors,” by Edward Latham, author of " A Dictionary of Namea, Nicknames, and Surnames,” &c.; and '* Dictionary of Battles from the Earliest Date to the Present Time," by the late Thomas Har-bottle.
The book of saying’s includes historical sayings in English, French, German, J Greek, Italian, and Latin, translated Into ! English. It has been the compiler’s object to bring together, in their origina.1 language, '* what he hopes may be considered a fairly representative collection of historic sayings, real or apocryph tl. Improved or altered, rightly or wrongly attributed, as the case may be; answering the questions by whom said, and under what circumstances; giving authorities as far as he has been able to ascertain them, varying versions, and by means 01 frequent cross-references enabling interesting comparisons to he
made between them/' An Index c*f ;
names and places has been provided.
Thomas Benfield Harbottle died before h*.s “ Dictionary of Battles ” was sent to press. Its printing was therefore attended to by P. H. Dalblac, who collal>-orated with the late writer in the volume in this series containing " French and Italian Quotations," and who compiled the " Dictionary of English Quotations," also tn this series. The late Mr. Harbottle was the author of the “ Dictionary Classical Quotations,” a ** Dictionary of Historical Allusions.’’ and other volumes.
