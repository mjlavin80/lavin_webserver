BOOK on tbs larger wild birds, which will be published presently with profuse illustrations by Houghton, Mifflin & Co., is furnished with an introductory letter by President Roosevelt. The title is “ Wild Wings/* and the author, Herbert K. Job. Doth land and sea lure’s of North America are included in th*' scope of the volume, which will be very attractive to bird lovers.
Another " nature book" of a rather different Kind, to be published next month, bears the stinging1 title “ Wasps: Social and Solitary.” To this John Burroughs, the President’s friend, has contributed an introduction in which he
speaks with lively enthusiasm of the results of the labors , of 1 the authors, George W. Peckham and Mrs. Elizabeth G. Peckham. The book will be furnished with T.any pictures. Mr. Burroughs, by the way. has gone to Eermuda, where Miss Mary Johnston is also at this time.
A third nature book, a quarto, with illustrations by the author's wife, is “ Orchi-dacea; Fascicle I.,'* by Oakes Ames, issued from the Ames Botanical Laboratory at North Easton- This will appear in April with Charles S. Sargent's M Trees and Shrubs,” Part IV., completing the first volume. In March will appear his “ Manual of Trees of North America," with 644 illustrations.

A noteworthy paper in The Atlantic is Mrs. Pennell's gossip over A Bundle of Letters.” written by and to the late Charles Godfrey Leland, with unpublished epfsties from Hoimes, Boker and Bret Harte, Browning, Lord Lytton, and the Rye among them, and the history of the Rabelais Club, which Leland and Walter Besant founded. The publication of these letters in book form is postponed until Autumn, when they will be illustrated wiih portraits and make the proposed " Life, Work, and Letters ” two volumes instead of one.

Morley Roberts in his “ Lady Penelope, ' to be published almost immediately by M...srs. Lu C. Page & Co., introduces a heroine who has so many lovers that she calls them “ the horde.” She nevertheless sets herself to improve each one of tfc-m, and such is her horror of the publicity of a fashionable wedding that she vows not to tell which one she marries. Marry one of them she does, and the consequent confusion of counsel and the worse confusion of her talkative aunt’s comments is highly amusing. The motor car is the genius of this story, whirling the characters into mischief and out of difficulties with a celerity untrammelled by the law. Nowhere is there a hint of the sombreness of Mr. Roberts’s earljer " Rachel Marr ” or of the salty flavor of “ The Promotion of the Admiral.”

Mrs. Mabel Loomis Todd, the author of *' Total Eclipses of the Sun,” intends to observe the eclipse of Aug. 30, visible from Labrador, Northeastern Arabia, Asauan. Northern Tunis, and Algiers. This will be her fifth voyage for a scientific purpose, for she observed tbe total eclipses of 18S7 and 1896 in Japan; the eclipse of 1900 in Tripoli, and, in 1901, made a voyage around the world to observe the total eclipse in the Dutch Kast Indies. The expedition will probably result in a book to be published by Messrs. Little, Brown & Co., who have issued Mrs. Todd's previous works.

Among the essays to be published in March by Messrs, Houghton, Mifflin & Co., is " Essays in Puritanism,” by Andrew Macphail, who includes Margaret Puller, Walt Whitman, and John Wesley among his subjects. Which of the three would be most astonished at being classified with Jonathan Edwards and John Winthrop is a nice question. Possibly the author accepts the theory advanced by Mr. Arlo Bates in his novel, *• The Puri- ; tans," that the descendants of Cromwell's associates pui u© their lives, good j or bad, with the grim intensity of their i forefathers. C. Hanford Henderson's “The 1 Children of Good Fortune ” may be trusted to exhibit no Puritrn sternness, for his is the gospel of serenity, grace, simplicity, even in self-sacrificing labor for humanity.	.

The first of the Atlantic 11 Letters to Literary Statesmen * is addressed to the President, and warns him thus: ** If you propose to use it (thr Republican Party) it intends to use you, and where you think you have wing's you may any day find that you hav#> a weight." Aleephron's next victim will be Mr. Balfour. A paper by James Sully on Sir Leslie Stephen, and “ The Close of the Victorian Epoch/’ by CoL Hlgginson, har-
