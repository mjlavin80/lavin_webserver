From lime to lime some one frantically denounces the marking of books. Last October there was a feverish bit In the *' sage and serious Atlantic Monthly, ; and ever since the genial work of de- 1 nouncing readers who “jnark ” has gone merrily' on. Do all your readers look askance at the markers?
Far be It from me even to seem to uphold the man who marks a book that is not his own. Let him be anathema—especially if the book is the common property of many readers, a book in a public library, for example. But if the book is your own, if you are a man to whom the possession of a book is a genuine joy, if you buy books not primarily for neighborhood circulation but for the solace of your own fireside, why in heaven’s name shouldn’t you mark your book?
That there are reasons v/hy the marking of books Is sensible and reasonable needs ; no demonstration to those who have the habit. For one thing, it helps you to find the place. “ But you should be able to find the place without such aid. You should be so familiar with your books that you can turn readily to all your favorite passages.” Do we not all recognize the voice? The words are not those of the consciously dishonest, and yet how many of us can truthfully say that there fs any considerable number of books every part of which comes swiftly to hand? Henry Esmond, for Instance—I talk o£ the substantial you see; the other day I wanted to find the passage in which Dr. Swift mistakes Harry for Mr. Kemp. 1 found it ■ quickly, in half the time I should have needed had there been no cross in pencil at the top of the page.
Aside from helping: one to “ find the place/’ book marking institutes a kinship, no less delightful because absurdly one-sided, between author and reader. If you enjoy intensely the reading of books the chances are that you have a sneaking wish that you could write them; a wish which as long as you do not attempt anything so Quixotic is harmless. Meanwhile you are not wholly without the^ means of comfort: you can play at the establishment of a personal understanding between the author and yourself. The results are as obvious as they are soothing. You are turning the pages of Sir Thomas Browne. You have not, more's the pity, read Sir Thomas much of late. Suddenly you come to a page from which a passage flashes out at you through graphite lines —“ Quietly rested—under the drums and tramplings of three conquests." Now you remember. You read it first on a tedious train; you recall just how you felt at the time; and you realize thcLt, somehow, never since has the stately music" of the “ Um-Burial '* wholly left you. There is “ something between ” Sir Thomas and obscure, inefficient you.
Yes, I believe in marking books. Evidently some people do not I shan’t mark the volumes of their libraries and I - am
very sure that they shall not mark mine, but shall I not take mine ease in mine inn?	'	H.	B.
