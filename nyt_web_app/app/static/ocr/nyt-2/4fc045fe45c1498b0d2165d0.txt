The Author off “ Ben-Hur.”
The death of Gen. Lew Wallace, the author of the wonderfully popular *( religious ” romance, *' Ben Hur,' in Indianapolis, last Thursday night, has been the occasion already of many newspaper articles, facetious and otherwise, recalling the vogue of Gen. Wallace's masterwork. It is perfectly true that ‘‘Ben-Hur’’ appealed chiefly to tne unsophisticated and Unliterary. People who had read much else of worth rarely read *' Ben-
Hur." But the enormous popularity of the book certainly did no harm, and it probably prepared the minds of countless thousands of young persons to appreciate books of larger literary value. We ar^ inclined to think of the " Ben-Hur ” epoch as distinctly a bright spot in American intellectual development. Gen. Wallace was a kindly man, of varied abilities; a good soldier and a diplomatic officer of no mean skill.
