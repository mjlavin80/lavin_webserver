Kew York Times Booh Review:
I am surprised that the recent discussion by readers in your columns of the cavalier treatment accorded John Hancock by Dwight Tilton In the novel " My Lady Laughter ” has not inspired further support of the position of Mr. Hamilton Osgood. To his query whether Hancock was not *' a credit to his city, his country,
and himself ’* I give a most cmphatic affirmative, For any one who is in aouut and who wishes authorities, let me direct attention to the following: Sanderson’s Signers of the Declaration of Independence,” " Works of John Adams," Volume X., Pp. 259-261; Charles Francis Adams's *' Memoir of Hancock,” in The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography. Volume I., rage 73.
There Is no doubt that Hancock wa3 a man. There were few deities even among the patriots. Washington himself had faults, we are told. The trouble is we elevate our heroes to the ranks of the superhuman, and then, as does Dwight Tilton in " My Lady Laughter/* blackguard them if we note a commonplace trait, Hancock was a great man, even if, being compelled to wear clothing, he preferred that it be handsome instead of the ugly brown affected by Samuel Adams.
