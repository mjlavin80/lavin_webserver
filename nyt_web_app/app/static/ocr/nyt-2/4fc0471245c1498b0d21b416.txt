WITH KU^OPATKIN.
Tbe Narrative of a War Correspondent Within the Russian Lines.*
CORRESPONDENT who has seen service in many wars, a trained newspaper writer and keen observer, Douglas Story has given us an interesting work in “ The
Campaign with Kuropat-
kin,” even if the title is somewhat misleading. Mr. Story might have added us a sub-title: “As much as I was able to see of it.”
Many things have happened since Mr. Story's book was finished in manuscript,
notably the fall of Port Arthur, the later Japanese victories, and the outbreak of the internecine trouble that is threatening the Czar's rule. Mr. Story wrote in the mood to insist that, no matter what vie torles might come to Japan, the result in the end must be the same—Russia’^ triumph. He holds that Alexieff stands for a policy of inflexible fixity of purpose, of unbending resolution, to acclaim Russia’s inalienable right to an open port on the China seas. It is no selfish policy, he says, but one inspired by Russia's interests with the interests of the other powers. He asserts with great positiveness that Alexieff will retreat from nothing that he stated prior to the outbreak ol hostilities, and, not to be flippant with so important a subject, this would appear to be the only thing from which he has not retreated.
*• I have his Excellency’s authority for stating,” says Mr. Story, “ that that policy is a permanent one, wholly unaffected by the incidents of the war. I seek no better guarantee.”
It may prove interesting at this stage, while we are on the subject of Alexieff, to give a hint of how the Viceroy is regarded by Mr. Story, especially in view of the widely varying reports that have come to us through the medium of the newspapers. Mr. Story says that Alexieff, in whom reposes the trust ot the empire to keep the gate open, is a man born to the position. ” Vested with unlimited power, he lives the life of an ascetic.” ‘‘A	bachelor,	his	life is dedicated to the	service of	his	country	and
his Czar.*’ " A sailor,	he	lives in	tho
cabined confines of a railway car. A maker of Captains and a dispenser of positions, he is simple of habit and devoid of ostentation.” Mr. Story, moreover, calls him “ reserved, deliberate, judicial, a man of invincible resolution, of wide sympathies, and catholic understanding, whose world interest extends to the uttermost
ends of the	earth. A	patriot, but	no
Chauvinist.’’

of discussion among the correspondents in Hongkong on the eve of the war, or rather the sum of their opinion, albeit probably tinctured with tfts writer’s prejudices, will be read with interest. The forces at the command of both countries are carefully analyzed. Mr. Story adverts again in this part of his work to the alleged hopelessness of Japan’s position:
Eventually, if, by a miracle. Japan did force Russia backward out of Manchuria, she would have achieved merely a land frontier constantly menaced by a malignant foe upon the other side. She would have fought a war and made an enemy. To advise such a course seemed little the office of a friend. There was an impression abroad in the Japanese press that Russia was merely bluffing; that when i Japan sent her ultimatum she would ; withdraw from Manchuria; that Russia J feared Japan. If the granite boulder 1 feared the lashing of the rainstorm there would have been justification for this confidence. For once the copy book seemed right—Discretion was the better part of valor. Japan’s success appeared to lie by the graded paths of diplomacy, not by the bloody field of battle* Russia did not want war. She despised her enemy, Japan had a firm friend and powerful ally in Great Britain. Russia was without a friend in the world. She stood alone.
In telling how Japan was jockeyed out of Manchuria Mr. Story refers to the attitude of the United States in the strugJSe* He shows how in the opening of Siberia a great avenue was thrown open to Western trade, how American locomotives, bridges, j and steel rails were rushed Into Asiatic Russia, and how for a time American traders coined money in Siberia.
Even on the brink of war the United States Government was averse to pronouncing any actual opposition to Bus-
sian expansion toward the Sea of Japan. The sentiment of the people, however, was less commercial than that of the Government, and Americans were declaring in no uncertain voice from the platform and in the press their National sym-
Sathy with Japan. Had the United States een willing earlier to forego the profits of her enterprise to join Great Britain in protest, the situation might never have been strained. As matters were, Great Britain might count upon the co-operation of the United States in whatever policy she might consider the exigencies of tire-' situation demanded. The United States had not forgotten her interest in the Philippines, had not forgotten that she might yet evacuate those islands and turn them over to the local government of the Filipinos, had not forgotten that the Philippines were excellent coaling stations for a power located in Manchuria and Korea, had not forgotten that Russia was an aggressive power, inspired by a wolfish land hunger.
The “ pushful correspondent,” as Mr. , Story calls him, has few friends in Japan, ! and his row was a hard one to hoe. There were forty of them in a single hotel in Toklo. There was not a vestige of news. The Japanese were eiJent as Sphinxes, patient as the Pyramids, impenetrable as | Sahara. Feb. 25 Mr. Story tells of an | “ extra ’’ published in Tokio representing : the news of the week, the pabulum of j twos core hungry correspondents.	j
** We have reason to believe,’’ said the ' “ extra," “ that another naval engagement took place at Port Arthur, probably on the 23d. The authorities are on the tiptoe of expectation as to the result,"
It is quite possible that something of Mr. Story’s feeling of ** soreness *’ against Japan arises from just this attitude of Nippon to the correspondents, and he gives
utterance to lt when he says; “ With time all this will react on Japan. The empire, sooner or later, must depend upon the great English-speaking nations for.protection from the glacier power of Russia. When that day comes she will turn to the men whom at the commencement of the war she was thwarting and obstructing, and she will marvel at their unresponsiveness. Japan acclaims to the world her civilisation and her progress. They are but the lacquer of her barbarism.” Mr. Story also remarks plaintively that “ a war east of Sues is no war for a hustler.”
Mr, Story says of the correspondent that the multiplication of telegraph lines and the Spanish-American war destroyed the liberty he once enjoyed. He says there Is a power for harm in the unthinking and unscrupulous correspondent that may wreck the prospects of an army and sacrifice 10,000 lives. Kitchener, Yamagata, and Kuropatkin all recognized this, he says.
Those df us who tafce our functions seriously, who realize that war correspondence is as much a profession as that of the soldier or the engineer, resent the Intrusion of the callow sensation mongers vomited from a hundred yellow journals.
He does not decry the value of enterprise, however, for he proudly published a letter from CoL Pesteech of the staff of Viceroy Alexieff, In which the Colonel states that he has the honor to inform Mr. Story that he was absolutely the first of all the correspondents to be permitted to join the Russian Manchurian Army.
If Mr. Story is to be believed, we in this country entirely overlooked the importance of a personage who lately visited our shores. Prince Pq Lun, the heir apparent to the Chinese throne. The Prince was wined and dined, ^ojad even robbed, and on on® occasion In this city a college professor walked him up four flights of stair? to a Harlem flat to view some Oriental art treasures, Mr. Story me* the Prince In Shanghai. He was then on his way to the St 3 Exposition, of, him Mr. Story s^y*^ / - ,f .....
He was.; intMselVrehmssied in;hlfr fiMt'
a gentleman, remarkably acuto. fxtrom?-Iy observant, and somewhat diffident of manner. He typified the new generation in Cathay. He was no moral or physical wreck, as is his brother, but a man strong and independent of ch.ir:ioU*r. well able to consolidate the million interests of China in one national ambition when once he is given the chancc.
Events in Manchuria cannot but have an enormous effect upon the future policy of such a man as Pu IjUh. Tho Yellow Peril is not a peril of advancing hordes, it is a peril of invading brains, invading industry, invading compttiilon. Vit/tory for Japan would be a grievous blow to our industrial development in Canada and Australia. There was more than met the ear in Prince Pu Lun's parting remark. " I draw no distinction between Chinese and foreigners; a gentleman of intellect is at all times a pleasure to meet." China has long since departed from her arrogant assumption of intellectual and social superiority, but it is not until now that tbe foreigner’s claim to civilization has been accepted in the Forbidden City. Once China steps down from her affectation of supereminence into the paths of equal competition the Western World will have grim cause to dread the Yellow Peril.
Not the least of the entertaining features of the book are its many illustrations from photographs taken in the field by the author.
