About an Old Bo ok.
I Hew York Times Book Review:
1 ,/llJ you kindly throw some light on the identity of an old book which, through j the loss of its title page and the f*rst ?I‘	* pages of text, offers no means of
I Identification, except the nature of Its matter? It is a small book in three parts. The title pages of the second and third parts read, " Instructions or Advice to His Grandson.” The first signature Is” incomplete; otherwise the text is complete. The binding and type are very crude. The "advice" of this “grandfather ” is not religious, but rather of an ethical nature. The second part begins with this quotation from Aristotle, “ Homo est sociale animal.” *	•	*
“ And he that is not sociable is more than a man or less than a man." The second part begins: "The last part of our discourse will concern your actions. ‘ Vir-tutis laus omnis in actione consistit* The world is a stage, and every one is to act his part before that great spectator, God Almighty." At the head of each page is the caption “ Institutions.1'
One chapter begins: " Sir John High-ford, an eminent man In his country, had for his tutor the famous Bishop Jewel; my father. Doctor Cole, an excellent Governor." Then, again: "The Right Hon. the Lord Viscount Scudamore is best able to direct you, (when you can have access to His Lordship.*’) The author speaks of the Queen, Elizabeth of England, in the present tense; and of Sir Charles Candish, the Marquis of New Castle, his son; Sir Kenelm Digby. and Sir Louis Dives. Who were they, and when did they flourish? Mention is made particularly of the use of arms in defense and offense. He says:
“ I hear now the single rapier is In use altogether. When I was young the rapier and dagger.*’ When was the " single rapier" adopted in England?
He speaks of " our colonies in Virginia and New England." The “grandson’s" grandfather was (on his mother’s side) Sir John Scudamore. Can anything be learned from this? I have had the book a long time; my father had it before me. Throughout its pages in faded Ink are marginal notes. One made In 1837 advises me to " preserve this book for its age," and another says, *■ John Clare, his book, Jan’y in, 1C68." ROSE LANGE.
