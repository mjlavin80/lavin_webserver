cw Yorl; Ti flics Boofc Review,
Having a keen sense of humor ko that I can on joy anything from Thackeray and Dickens up to Mr. Dooley. I ran t repress a smile at the correspondents who see
humor in "Alice in '\onde^nd - Don Quixote.” I was pleased to read nf Che " real child ” who would have none of the first. And as to the last, I have noticed a tendency to brutality even in the most well-bred admirers of Don Quixote.” I was urged to read the book as the " funniest ever.” I read and saw the lesson, but could not laugh at the* poor, bleeding, half-witted fighter of windmills. As soon could I make game of the at-flicted, the lame, blind, and crippled. I don't say the book isn’t great. I grant it everything but being humorous. To a nation of bullfighters it no doubt screamingly funny.	TILLIE SLOWBO\.
