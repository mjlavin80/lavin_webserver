DRAMA 11ST VERSE.
Poetical Plays by Dr. Garnett, Maurice S .muds, and G. Constant Lounsbury.*
R. (JAKXISTT'S play. which seems to have Lecn intended purely for the .study, revives the somewhat shadowy ti-n-(lition of Shakespeare's school teaching, inut the better defined story of his p» ai-hiug proclivities. Tt matters of course	very little whether these accidents of	his life have been truthfully reported.	It even matters very little
whether	he taught school at nil or
*	poached on Sir Thomas Lucy's grounds-. All that is deeply interesting about him
-	his attitude toward the problems of life, hi.- knowledge of human nature, the kind of men and women he loved and the kind he hated, the things that amused him ■ and the things that saddened him—all ; tiiis and much more we Irani from his | works. If any play or novel or biography could interpret the personality that finds such ^multiform expression there, without distortion or prejudice, with the merest touch of illumination it would be read by the devoted as a veritable message rrom I lie heaven where his spirit abides. And anything written about liis name and devoid of this illuminating: gleam is more or less to be deprecated. Dr. Garnett’s respect for the great Elizabethan is not to be doubted, but his drama lends to it no emphasis. It contains agreeable lines, but it is not interesting in development, nor is there any reality in the general effect. Moreover, the figure of Shakespeare is trivial and his speech frequently is elaborate and dull. In no respect is he realized with the distinction and art demanded by a subject so far from the ordinary. The device of introducing famous phrasea from tlic plays is the opposite of happy, and while the phrasing of single passages occasionally suggests the Shabespcitran model, the idea beneath the phrasing is frequently unfortunate. For example, do we any of us conceivc of Shakespeare as a, victim of
■	self-esteem, and prepared to explain the extent of his talent to a gaping group of half-grown boys? YeL this is the tone in which he is made to address ltis scholars:
*	* * I oft must bite my tongue Lest she move laughter, clothing daily cares
In language of immortal poetry.
But see what gift is mine. I do but take The speech familiar of uncivil men,
And that which had .offended in their mouth
In mine is music, losing not at all The grace of truthful semblance, even as silver
Purged of its dross, is silver all the more And though my pen not yet hath labored much,
No thing it could not render to the life This narrow spot hath yielded it.
As appreciation this certainly is not exaggerated. but it should hardly come from th-; Ups of the humblest genius in history.
Benvenuto Cellini is certainly a much less trying subject for a playwright, and Mr. Maurice V. Samuels has succeeded in endowing the old Florentine society by which he was surrounded with animation.
“ The Florentines ” is a little drama of many merits. The characters move like creatures of flesh and blood, an3 if the frank and simple tlieme is alien both to the literary and the art feeling of the twentieth century, it must be remembered that Cellini’s century produced better art and better literature than jjurs. Mr. Samuels has interpreted the incidents and mental attitude of the historic persons introduced with sincerity and insight, and has made his play express a personal idea. The promise of larger things is in his thin volume.
*' Delilah ” is, of course, a Biblical drama, without special distinction, but with melodious passages and dignified wording. No innovations on the accepted narrative have been attempted, and the lack of novelty in this direction is not unplensing.
