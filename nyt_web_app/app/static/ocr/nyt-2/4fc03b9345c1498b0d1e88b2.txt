Failure of Education.
From a lecture by Marie Corelli on ** Work." delivered at Nortbampton, England.
Much of our modern work Is scamped or badly done. We are so anxious to catch time by the forelock that we - almost tear the forelock off.	_
Compare our modern villas of lath and plaster with the warm thick walls of the sixteenth century manor houses. Put side by side the flimsy modern chair and the serviceable oak one made by our forefathers.
Although we have plenty of British schools of art we have no great British artist, such as Gainsborough or Romney. We have no Scott, Thackeray, or Dickens. These belong1 to a day when education was not compulsory.
