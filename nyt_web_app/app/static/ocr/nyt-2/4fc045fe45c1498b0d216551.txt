That Passage in O ante.
I.

A more careful study of the Latin 1 Eclogues of Dante shows that they (two In number) are written in reply to one Johannes de VirglUo of Ravenna, two by : the latter and two by Dante, and, according; to so accessible authority as the Encyclopaedia Britannica, as late as 1318, so that this late date is not in favor of my query if these Viclogues were referred to as “ lo hello stile.”
" The most interesting passage in tho * Life of Dante" by Boccaccio is that In . the first poem, where he expresses the hope that when he has finished the three parts of', his great poem, his gray hairs may be crowned with, laurel on the banks of the Arno.”
You may imagine the avidity with which I sought for this passage, only not to find any allusion to the three parts of his great poem. I find:
Et patrio redcam si quando, alcsandre cunos Fronde sub inscrta.
But not what Boccaccio states.
The Encyclopaedia further states that “ The Purgatorio was completed in 1318, as we learn from the Latin poem addressed to Johannes de Virgilio, which t speaks of the Inferno and Purgatorio as completed, the Paradiso as yet to be written. The date of the poem is 1318."
Well, the verses lie before me. I cannot find these references after several perusals. They must be hidden in ome allegorical manner.
I find the verses of Johannes de Vir-gllio more attractive in style than those of Dante in reply, and especially note his rendering of a familiar scriptural injunction into spondaic hexameters:
Nec margaitas profllga prodigus aprls! Which is being Interpreted:
Neither cast your pearls -(prodigal) unto swine-	CHARLES	H.	WARD.
