I	** A. Rebel’s Recollections.'*
A fourth' edition of this book, by George Cary Eggleston, the well-known author of “ Dorothy South,” “ A Captain in the Ranks,” " The American Immortals," &c., Is in the press of G. F. Putnam’s Sons for publication probably March 7. Mr. Eggleston has 'written a new preface and an additional chapter on “ The Old Regime In the Old Dominion." In his preface he tells how the book was written.
While editor of Hearth and Home, in 1873, Mr. Eggleston met William Dean Howells, when the latter was editor of The Atlantic Monthly, and “ now recognized as the foremost creative and critical writer of America.” In the course of their conversation Mr. Howells suggested that Mr. Eggleston write his reminiscences of life as a Southern soldier for The Atlantic. When the book came out, in 1874, there were nine chapters, two having been added to give " freshness ” to it. The book was well received by New Englanders. In 1875 he wrote the paper on the old Virginian life. This article was to have filled only six pages of the magazine, but, writes Mr. Eggleston, “ then for the first time in my life I had an experience which has never Since been repeated. Mr. Howells sent the article back to me with a request that i should double its length." Some years later, at a reception given by the Authors* Club for Mr. Howells, the latter said to Mr. Eggleston:
It was you and I who first conceived the idea of “ War Papers ” as a magazine’s chief feature. We were a trifle ahead of our time, I suppose, but our thought was the same as that which has since achieved so great a success.
This incident occurred at the time when
&	series of war papers in The Century Magazine were attracting some attention.
