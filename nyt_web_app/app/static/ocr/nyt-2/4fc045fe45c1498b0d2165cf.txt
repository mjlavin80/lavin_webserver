OPTIMIST.
New York, Feb. It!, 1005.
Henry James.
\ew York Times Book Review:
Your champion of Henry James In issue of Feb. 11 advances for him none but the most threadbare defenses of all realistic-pessimistic literature. But (Henry James , has not even the courage and sincerity 1 which usually mark its exponents, and , being an American, he has not their excuse—their raison d’etre. If he stayed {it home he would meet decent, sane, and sound people in majority at least.
If it comes togi discussion of the rela-tlve merits of pessimistic and optimistic literature—whether a novelist should devote his art to showing what tffe world is or to showing what It may be, if we would only try, I for my part vote the latter, and am happy to believe that an overwhelming majority of Times readers, and of all Americans, for that matter, would vote with me.
When Justin McCarthy discussed his first anonymous novel with John Bright, the latter said to him, in his gentle way:
" But, my boy, you should write novels only about good people.*’ McCarthy pretended to d^mur to the dictum, and seems to still so pretend. But McCarthy has oven improved on the advice then received.
I have not read his novels, but have read his historical and biographical hooks.
Writing of actual men and women, they
all appear on his pages as good and de-lightfull is.zrot the world better for that brilliant -galaxy- of men- and women,-> showing so, convincingly ..their ;best. side,
