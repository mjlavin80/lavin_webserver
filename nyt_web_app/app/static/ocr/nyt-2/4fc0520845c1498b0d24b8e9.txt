T Is a homely and pitiful story of enterprise, disappointment, and starvation that this survivor of an amateur exploring expedition of three has to tell. Its manifest moral la that ft does not do to start wrong if you would go exploring. Had the members of the ill-fated party but started right, Leonidas Hubbard, Jr., might now be alive to write u*e story. But starting	and ending wrong—as a
party ft explores—the duty of telling the bus tell to Mr. Wallace. And be has to'd the story simply and without umwos-sariUy harrowing details, its mistakes not glossed over, and its actual heroisms painted not too vividly.
Already the story of the death of Hubbard has been told at length in the news columns. But tho pathos of it all has been reserved for this s'mple and touching chronicle. Hubbard, >ouvg, ambitious, a clover wr’t^r, Intrepid—as previous eTeeurdon.3 <nto the wilds had proved-waj overwhelmed with the cull to tne wilds. One ’Inter night ha induced Wallace to go with him to the unexplored regions of Labrador, where, so far as was known, white men had never been. If they had been there they left no chronicle behind. That vast and seemingly useless territory was still as unknown to the civilized world as it was when Cabot first discovered its bleak and barren bluffs. It still remains so in spite of Hubbard’s efforts. He had a glimpse of the objective point, Lake Michikamau. The historian of the party was even denied that.
Labrador's Summer lasts only about two months, July and August. On July 15, 1003, with about a quarter of that Summer vanished. Hubbard, having bidden his wife good-bye, started with Wallace and George Alson, a guide, or woodsman, rather—for there were no guides to that country into which they were going -left tbe last of the H id«3on Bay Com-£i_*\y’s outpo^+g ard bade civilization farewell. T*-e three trimed thenwelv^s to an eighteen-foot canoe, weighing about eighty pounds, laden with what ceems in the reading a scant supply of provisions, with ample arms and ammunition, but lacking a gill net—they had neglected to take one from New York and could find none In Labrador—though they had rods, lines, and flies. They pushed out into Grand Lake on their search for a possibly mythical Northwest River and for a great lake, Michikamau. which, according to tbe Indians, was a great feeding place for caribou.
Their first objective was the Nascaupee River, at the h°id of the lake. This was *o	fcnein to the North vest River,
and that In turn to Lake MichiKam^u. Information as to where the Nascaupee emptied its cold waters into Grand Lake was indefinite and largely from hearsay. But they msde for it—and paj^ed. Its mouth was In an arm of the lake and partly hidden by an island. About this they had no information. So two miles beyond it they pitched their first camp, and the following morning made the mistake that cost them so much by entering the mouth of a smaller and very minor feeder, tht Susan River. Their exploration of mU-takes had begun.
Heading almost due west, it took them but two days to discover that their information about the river was much at variance- with the river Itself. They struggled on up stream, however, in a torrid heat of 90 degrees at midday und a frigid one of I*) degrees at midnight, fighting Labrador flies so small they could not be seen with the naked eye, and “ bulldog flies as big as the top joint of one's thumb.” On the third day they began to drop part of their provisions, having made l>ut two miles' advance the day before. From that time on troubles accvmula*td. Fis*1 cf si2e were scarce and of game there *as practically none. And it was on the fish and game of the region they had counted for sustenance.
It was only on the seventh duy o'lt that thev shot their fi.-st spn,ce part.-Vl™, an I rax unitt they : ad been on the irail nineteen days did th:y get tlieir first Canada geese, four of them falling to the rifles of Hubbard and the woodsman Meantime Wallace and Hubbard had both fceen sick, and all had suffered the pangs of hunger, as it became apparent thus early that their scanty supply of
food must be hoarded with the utmost care.
Hubbard gave expression to a strange i feeling that had been growing on him , and me in the last few days, it was almost as if the solitude was getting1 on our nerves.
“It’s Queer, hut I have a feeling that Is getting stronger from day to day that we are the only people left in the world Have you fellows experienced any such feeling? ”	y	* cn
’‘Yes,” said I, “I have. I have been feeling that we must fcrever be alone going on, and on, and on, from portage

to portage, through this desolate wilderness.”
11	That's it exactly/’ said Hubbard. *' You sort of feel that as you are now so you always have been and always will be; and your past life is like a dream and your friends like dream-folk. What a strange sensation it is! M
But the roast goose made them happier. They pushed on, defying the pangs of hunger, buoyed by hope that Michikamau and friendly Indians and food were awaiting them but a few miles further on. There were the roughest of portages, scoutings In which two of the party were lost in the woods and had to remain away from camp over night, hunger such as none of them had ever known before and that was only appeased by talks of meals and Broadway restaurants. But the river must lead to Michikamau! T*idt ^ope braced them to their work. Dass were growing shorter, nights longer and colder, clothes were hanging in rags already, game was almost impossible to secure in either woods or waters. But there were recompenses.
It was a glorious evening. A big moon rising over the bluffs beyond us trans-foi:ned the river into a silvery thread stretching far down through the dark valJ?y. Behind us the black spruce forest made our roaring fire seem more cheering in contrast. A cold east wind had driven aw'iy the flies and the mosquitos. Supper eaten, our cup of contentment was fi’Il to the brim. After all, the wilderness was not so inhospitable. Who would be anywhere else if he could? Not one us.
But inhospitable it proved, for at the end>-of the river they ran into an unknown range of mountains which they named Kipling, in compliment to Hubbard’s favorite author. The river was lost Then came another long portage, a welcome-sheet of water which the^ named Lake Disappointment, because It began nowhere and ended in a swamp. Then a yeary portage of a week’s duration, another lake, ar.d an abrupt wall of mountains. One of these—Mount Hubbard lt is now called—Hubbard climbed through the snow, and from its peak saw Lake Michikamau, to reach which water he and his companions had suffered such privations us th’jy had never expected would fall to their lot.
With the goal in sight, but clothed in rags, with only emergency rations left, Winter closing in rapidly, and de-ith by starvation seemingly beckoning them whichjv^r way they went, the trio finally turned back. That is, they decided to do so on Sept. 9, the day on which Hubbard had sighted Michikamau. But they were wind-bound on the lake shore until the 21st. Then they started back for home. The sufferings the/ had undergone on the trip out were as nothing to those they had to encounter on their return. Fish had gone to the deep waters; game had
entirely left the woods, life was sustained only on pea meal served by the spoonful, boiled bones and skins and leather from their moccasins. Then snow came to shut them into the wilds. The story of that trip back is like those so often told by arctic explorers. Their fin-U miJtake was made in sticking to the trail they had made going ovt instead of following a river that might hi/e been followed safely back to Grand Lake.
Hubbard collapsed completely on Oct. IS, and sent his companions out to try and reach Grand Lake and men who would come to his rescue. The guide managed to do that. Smoke-blindness and snow-blindness coupled with exhaustion overcame Wallace, who was to have gone down the river a few miles to find some flour that had been thrown away on the out trip and bring it back to Hubbard. Prostrate in the snow he was found more dead than alive on Oct. 30, on which day the rescuers also found the dead body of Hubbard in his tent. And that was the end of the exploration of the wilds of Labrador.
Wallace tolls of his long illness, his ultimate recovery from the terrible exposure to which he had been subjected, and his return to New York with the body of his friend, and yet, he says in closing his story, “ The smoke of the camp-fire is in my blood. The fragrance of the forest is in my nostrils. Perhaps it is God's will that I finish the work of exploration that Hubbard began.’’
