CARRUTHERS GOULD Is the most conspicuous and most successful political cartoonist of the present hour In England. Li ley Sam-bourne, Raven-Hlli, anti the others of the contemporary Pur.cl: set may surpass him in draughtsmanship and artistic finish, though that if ar open Question, as all of Mr. Gould's
wgi K Is done for printing on fast newspaper presses. But there is not a political cartoonist now in England who has not felt Mr. Goulds pervasive influence. His is the Joseph Chamberlain they all de-pi jr. Tht sharpl* convex countenance of tlmt powerful and picturesque twentieth
century statesman,- the grotesquely concave features ot his newly developed ally, Alfred Lyttelton, of the Colonial Office, are bettor Kncwr throughout the British islands because of the amusing caricatures of Mr. G'ould. ICo other pencil has
sc aptly <Up*cted the polite anti amhiblo lethargy of Mr. Balfour. His Duke of Devonshire- is f:;r better known than the fleah-and-blood Duke (of Piccadilly and I'astboume) cr any of his counterfeit presentments by fashionable photographers. Mr. Gould's cartoons, which appear daily in The Westminster Gazette, have made that evening paper's wide repute. They are copied everywhere. Tories and Liberals alike enjoy them, though their enjoyment may be expressed in different terms.
It is a pity that skill and humor so apt and distinctive as Mr. Carruthers Gould’s should not command a wider market. But none of his efforts to get away from his restricted field has been successful. Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Balfour are to him as tht head of King Charles was to Mr. Dick. They are always cropping up in his pictures. His burlesque Froissart, his up-to-date Alice in Wonderland, his ornithological fantasies deal exclusively with the current trend of British politics.
The measure of interest we all take in English politics in this country is much larger than that of the mass of Englishmen in American politics. They care nothing whatever for our parties or their platforms. They all know, now, the name of the President of the United States and that of his Secretary of State. They are aware of our Ambassador at the Court of St. James's and they know dimly the outlines of our foreign policy. We, on the other hand, are generally alive to what is going on in every department of English activity or lethargy. We know the names of the men who are doing something at St. Stephen’s and along Whitehall. But we are not interested in their personalities we do not bother about the details of their work, and though we may comprehend, in a general way. a cartoon by Carruthers Gould much better than any Englishman could possibly comprehend a cartoon by Kemble or Homer Davenport, yet we do
not feel its humorous force and have no will to do so. Wherefore Mr. Gould’s work will remain caviare to the general here unless he can adapt hfs humorous fancy and his graphic skill to other subjects.	^
This is a pity, for the folio of Mr. Gould's collected cartoons for 1004 Oust published in London l>y Edward Arnold and in New York by Longmans, Green & Co,> contains many comic pictures of a ran* quality. The subjects include Mr. Chamberlain’s fiscal policy, Mr. Lyttelton's scheme of Chinese labor in the South African mines, and the Licensing bill of Mr. Balfour's Government. As a jruod Liberal, Mr. Gould hotly opposes all these measures. Mr. Chamberlain is always the protagonist of Mr. Gould’s comic drama. He appears as Britannia, in short skirts; as the preposterous Mad Hatter of Lewis Carroll, (to the Dormouse of the Duke of Devonshire and the White Rabbit of Mr. Balfour;) as a ferocious and uncanny "looking dog following Balfour’s footsteps; as a golf caddie, tan impish youngster, but very like the great man in some of his moods,) who has usurped his employer's place at the tee. He appears as Robin Hood " holding up " the fat British manufacturer, and as the Mad Hatter again, hiding on the outskirts of the Fiscal Wood, from which the Devonshire lion emerges yawning, but roaring, too. He is Napoleon before Elba, (with apologies to Meissonier,) and Napoleon on the Bellerophon, (with apologies to Orchardson.)

growing man. A pathetic picture now is Mr. Gould's excellent drawing of that stanch old Liberal, Sir William Harcourt, as a crusader on a white horse, returned at last from the wars. Sir William has Fincc gone far from the sound of the »trife, leaving a name without a blem sh.
