KISH history and topography are the subjects to which Mr. C. Litton Falkiner devotes his attention. The period Is mainly of tho seventeenth century. Very wisely tut mthor will have nothing1 to do with the theological controversies of the time. He says: ** It Is, of course, possible that the impressions of tho seventeenth century writers should fail to be colored by tne contentions of the time. Most, if not all, of these accounts reveal tho prejudices of the writers.”
“ His Majesty's Castle of Dublin," as It was called, first attracts attention* According to the Irish State Papers, mention Is made of. It in me reisn of King John. Prior to 1204 little or nothing ia related concern! the castle. Supposably. It was erected as a fortress by the Danes In tho middle of tne ninth century. Nothing is learned as to Norman rule having to do with c..e castle. The first document extant Is an order fr m King John, who commands that a castle shall be built " In such a place as you may judge best." wherein the trc nsure may be “ safely kept,” A sum of iwO marks was to be appropriated, to be in part collected from the Dublin people. As this was a demand for money on tin* Dublin citizens, as an offset the Kin*” established a fair at Donnybrook. A fairly imposing structure was built, and in time .ne castle held within Its falls the exchequer and treasury of Ireland and the mint of Dublin. But in process of time the building waa neglected and here were several fires. After the departure of James II. it ceased to be of any service as a royal residence. Many alterations have taken place, and what was once a fairly imposing mediaeval structure ia now an " unimposing group of modern buildings."
Mr. Falkiner calls the Phoenix Park " the greatest and most abiding monument of the extraordinary revival and extension of the Irish capital which followed the Restoration, and which in a lew years transformed Dublin from a mediaeval city into a modem metropolis." As

early as 1174 the Knights Hospitallers had a priory on the grounds. After Henry VIII. suppressed the Knights, Queen Elizabeth deemed it a fitting place for the residence of the Chief Governor of Ireland. The surrounding grounds were extensive, and the result was the creation of a park for deer. As to the name, Phoenix, there has been much wrangling concerning it. The supposition Is that it is Gaelic, a corruption of the word ** Fionn," which means a spring of clear water. .The author next describes the Irish Guards, and then follows a history of the counties of Ireland, their origin, constitution, and gradual delimitation. What to us Is of the greater interest are the accounts of tho Irish people by contemporaneous authors. Fynes Moryson describes Ireland as he saw it at tho close of the reign of Elizabeth:
The City of Dublin, called Dlvelln by the English and Balaclcigh (as seated on hurdles) by the Irish, is the chief city of the kingdom and seat of justice, fairly built, frequently inhabited,* and adorned with a strong castle, fifteen churches, an episcopal seat, and a fair college, (an unhappy foundation of an university laid in our old age,) and endowed with many privileges, but the haven la barred and made less commodious by these hills of sands.	~
Describing the climate, Moryson says that It is milder In Ireland than in England, “ which notwithstanding .is more to bo attributed to tho inhabitants than to the air":
For Ireland being oft troubled with rebellion, and the rebels not only being idle themselves, but in natural malice destroying the labours of other men, and cutting up the very trees of fruit for the same causp, or else burn them; for theso reasons the Inhabitants tako less pleasure to till their grounds or plant trees, content Lo live for the day in continual fear of like mischief.
The old story of no snakes in Ireland is repeated with an embellishment;
I may not omit the opinion commonly received that the earth of Ireland will not suffer a venemous snake or beast to live, and that the Irish wood transported for building is free of spiders and their webs. I myself have seen same (but very few) spiders, which the inhabitants deny to have any poison, but I have heard some English of good credit affirm by experience the contrary.
The convivial habits of the Elizabethan Irish are dv/elt on:
At Dublin and In other cities they have taverns wherein Spanish and French wines are sold, but more commonly the merchants sell them by pints and quarts in their own cellars. The Irish aqua vitae, commonly called usquebaugh, is held the best in the world of that kind, which is made also in England, but nothing as good as that brought out of Ireland. And tho usquebaugh Is preferred before our aqua vitae, because the m*n£-ling of raisins, fennel seed, and other things mitigates the neat, and makes it
Luke Gernon's ** Discourse of Ireland,"
it is believed, was written about 1619. Ger-non was a florid writer. He begins callIng " on this Nymph of Ireland," whose flesh is of a softe and dclicat mould, and 1 her blew vaynes trayling through every ! part of her like ry volet ts.” Describing tli<i dress of the Irish women, lie writes:
In Thomond they weare Kerchiefs hanging downe to the middle of their backe-The maydes weare on the forepart of theyre head about foure yards of coloured
less aflame, and yet refreshes the weak stomach with moderate heat and good relish.
Moryson takes note of tho dancing in Ireland:	j
i They delight much in dancing, using no arts or show measures or lofty salliards, i but only country dances, whereof they i | have some pleasant to behold, as Balrud- ! ; cry, and the Whip of Dunboyne. and they dance about a fire commonly in the midst I of a room, holding withes in their hands, I i and by certain strains drawing one an~ ! other into the fire, and alxo the mata~ chine dance, with naked awords, which they make to meet in divers comely post-1 area.
There were plenty of wolves in the tlmo when Moryson was In Ireland. There are documents of the Cromwellian period concerning the wolves, which show how terrible must have been the desolation of the country brought about by the civil war. Sir Josias Bodley paid Ireland a visit in the years 1C02 and 1G03. This gen* tleman was certainly a roysterer, and found many of the festivities In Ireland precisely to his taste. At a feast given him Sir Josias must have imbibe*! more than was good for him. Thoroughly intoxicated. ho writes: “Being drunk Is nothing else than being sometimes rationally mad. Even Hippocrates himself, the prince of physicians, recommends amongst other things that contribute to health an immoderate potation of wine at least once a month." Tho abundance of wine and potent drinks In Ireland delights the Englishman, and he praises a "strong ale compounded with sugar and eggs to comfort and strengthen the stomach." The gay Englishman was of course entertained in the house of a well-to-do host, for he enjoyed " pipes of tho best tobacco to , drive away rheums and catarrhs." In opposition to those who decry tobacco, Sir Josias writes:
Almost all have but one argument, that would make a dog laugh and a horse break his halter, saying that neither our . sires nor grandsires took tobacco, yet they lived I know not how long. So indeed they lived until they died, despite tobacco; but who knows if they might not have lived longer had they used tobacco? And if one who now uses tobacco die of any disease, who knows if ho might not have , died sooner if he had abstained from tobacco?
