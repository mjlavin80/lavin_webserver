Lord Rosebery's remark touching Cervantes and " Don Quixote brings forcibly to mind the truth that those who. know nothing of French are equally Jg-norant of IVIolifere and his plays. MoUfire is so peculiarly, so thoroughly French, that I cannot conceive how his rare humor, his satire and caustic wit, can be turned into English Dr how these quali-i ties in his plays can be appreciated by any one who cannot read (rim In the orlg-Inal. And It seems a strange thing to me ; that Moliere, who is really the French ! Shakespeare, comparatively harmless and Innocent, and yet profoundly instructive, should be so little read as he is to-day.
I There is nothing in French literature SO ! amusing, so full of real humor, real human nature, and yet so wise and instructive, as Moltere's plays. Just call to mind Le M6decin malgrg lui,” “ George Dan-din," “ Les Fourberies de Scafin,” V Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme," and *' Tar-
tuffe.*’	‘	t
I have always thought that Shake- I [ speare’s plays sounded and read quite as fine and forcible in German as In Eng-li3h. But Shakespeare was Titanic in thought and expression because he was Teutonic in race and speech, and the prototypes of many of his characters may be found only in the Nibelungenlied, though he probably n^ver heard of it. No wonder, therefore, he is even better known In Germany than in England. But Cervantes and Moliere were of the Celtic race-bright, lively, humorous, laughing philosophers—like the race to which they belonged. English humor and character are quite different. Robert Hall thought it . worth while to study Italian in order to read Dante in the original. Much more is it worth while to study French in order to read Molifire in the original; for while not one in a hundred can appreciate Dante, every man of common sense can appreciate and enjoy MoIiSre, whose piays are full of real humor, real human nature, and real life. Moliere, like Shakespeare, drew from life, from the people he saw and knew, and painted men and women as they are. To know Moii£re is a liberal education ROBERT WATERS.
