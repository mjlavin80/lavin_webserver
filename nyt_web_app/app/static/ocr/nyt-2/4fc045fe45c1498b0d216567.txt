over forty, yet I find interest in some of them yet. I find his "Plant Hunters" and Its sequel, " The Cliff Climbers,” just as good now as then. His " Boy Hunters,” ** Ran Away to Sea,"	'* Ocean
AVaifs.” and *' Afloat in the Forest," are quite interesting. He is a little too didactic,, too fond of pointing the moral, but you can skip.
I am amusing- myself by buying: the books I read when a boy, to see how 1 like them now. On the whole, I find most quite sood, though some are fearful —** Eric,’’ for instance. What has become of “ Sintram and His Companions ”7 I have been huntfng for that for a tons
while.	El	J	SO./1.*	KUO.
