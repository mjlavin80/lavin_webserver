Upon the delicate shoulders of Marie Doro fell the difficult task last evening of attempting to carry to success as completely artificial and hoplessly impossible a piece of theatrical carpentering: as one could readily imagine. Illuminative as the pun upon the play's title would bfc, we refuse to be the ones guilty of perpetrating it, though, for sake of record, it may be suggested that “ Friquet/* although it deals largely with life in the circus ring, really belongs to the curio hall. It is occasionally funny where it is intended to be serious, and for the actors it is likely to prove serious where, by all intents, it should be funny.	’
Paul M. Potter is reported to have made the English version of the piece, which on the programme at the Savoy is credited to Pierre Berton and “ Gyp,*’ from one of whose stories its incidents have been taken. Those incidents* however, have been common property for so long that any claim of originality in this case would be the height of folly.
** Friquet "—so called because she was picked up by a circus clown from the highway, where the tree sparrows were pecking at a crust of bread in her hand— is rescued from her hard life by a kind-hearted “ gentleman,” who afterward proves himself a scoundrel. The revelation of his true character does not come to the girl, however, until she has fallen, in love with him. Incidentally she has refused offers of marriage from two other " gentlemen,*' each of whom has informed her 1
that he has an income of 100,000f. a year. The man she loves has been using Friquet as a blind, while meeting clandestinely the woman in whose care she has been placed. This woman is parried to another extremely unpleasant person, who persists in pursuing Friquet. He finally follows, her to her dressing room in the circus, after she has returned to her old life, broken-hearted at the perfidy of the man she loves. There Fri-> quet kills him. A moment later she is called to the ring, and seeing the man she loves in the audience she falls to her death from a trapeze.	'
In one scene Friquet has a boxing match with a groom who is jealous of her because she is able to manage a horse that has defied his skill. She knocks the groom out with bare fists, and he becomes her enemy for life. Later she discovers that the man who has befriended her has come to a secret rendezvous with her rival. The. woman’s husband, led by the groom, arrives and threatens to batter down the door. The guilty pair do not know of the girlfs presence,, but when discovery is inevitable Friciuet, comes forward and sacrifices her good name to save the wife.
It is possible that an exceptionally gifted actress might create enough interest in the rdle of Friquet to justify so long a run as the play is said to have had at the Gymnase in Paris. But, making allowances for all the differences usually noted between an original and a translation, it is difficult to see in this work any other explanation for popularity. The character of Friquet provides opportunities for and demands, indeed, broadly diversified acting. Marie Doro has the charm of an exquisite, flowerlike personality, and in the suggestion of girlish delicacy she is ! momentarily appealing*	i
In occasional passages where the de-m&nds are in harmony with her naturaf endowments she may be said to be sue- i cessful. But in the effort to convey an'! idea of a girl reared in the rugged sur- i roundings of a circus tent she labored hard, with a result wholly artificial. She is entitled to sympathy. Her equipment and experience are sucli that the result should have been foreseen.
The acting generally was unsatisfactory, although William J. Ferguson and Frederick Perry managed to do themselves credit in very bad parts.
