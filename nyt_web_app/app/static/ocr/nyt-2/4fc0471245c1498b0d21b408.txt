Soldiers went about unmolested in every part of the Lhasa bazaar. Officers were admitted to the most sacred shrines. Capt. O'Connor, my right-hand man in dealing with the Tibetans, was received not only with real ceremony but with real warmth by the Tashi Lama at Shigatse. And, Last but by no means least, Tibetan wool merchants are already making arrangements for trading with India,

published by Doubleday, Page & Co.— “The Opening of Tibet," by Perceval Landon, with an Introduction by Col. F. E. Younghusband. who headed the British mission to the Forbidden Land.

Mr. Landon gives in *• The Opening of Tibet ** an account of Lhasa, the history of Tibet, the folk-lore and manners of the Tibetans, and the present relations with the rest of the world, with which he became acquainted as the representative of The London Times with the mission sent by the British <Jovernment to Lhasa, The book is profusely ilustrated with reproductions of photographs and sketches and maps. In his introduction Col. Younghusband speaks of the conduct of the natives toward the *’ sahib ” intruders:

Nor does the breaking of a despotic Government mean the downtreading of the people. From the first the Tibetan neasantly showed good-will toward us. They were especially anxious to trade— no keener traders could be found.
