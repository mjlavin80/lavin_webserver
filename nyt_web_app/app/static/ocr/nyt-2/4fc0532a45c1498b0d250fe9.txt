KLOKENGE NIGHTINGALE.
LORENCE NIGHTINGALE was born in Florence in 1820. Her parents were lingHsfc
. people temporarily residingIn
the Italian	city. The	real
name of	the family	was
Shore, Nightingale having been adopted when the estate of an unde was bequeathed to William Shore. Florence Nightingale’s'father was a well-to-do English squire. When Florence was still a little child, the Nightingales_ recurred to their home in Devonshire] at Lea HalL, Subsequently Lea. Hurst was their residence. Florence had a sister who became Lady Verney. The two girls received the* best education, and" Florence was familiar with French and German, ^nd quite perfect in Italian. The author tells how Florence In her early life showed her vocation:
Her	dolls	were always	in a delicate	state
of health	and required	the utmost	care,
Florence wouid undress them and put them lo bed with many cautions to her sister not to disturb them. She smoothed their pillows, tempted them with imaginary delicacies from toy cups and plates,
*	and nursed them to convalescence, only to consign them to a sick bed the next day.
Most touching is the story of how she cared for a dog- who, having, it was supposed, a broken leg, was condemned to death* Florence nursed the dog, whose leg was not broken, and returned him quite sound to his master. That was her "first aid to the injured." Among her nearest friendg were her pbny and* the stable cat. Her love, of animals was so marked that it remained with her
V	through life and nmde her very sympathetic to invalids who craved the company of some favorite animal." During the Winter she was always busy visiting the cottages and attending to the sick. There had been two distressing cases of illness in her own family, and her nursIng faculty had been then more largely developed. Even at an early age the girl saw how necessary was a proper training. Sympathy alone would not effect a cure. In her “Work and Duty” she wrote: " I would say to all young ladies who are called to any particular vocation, qualify yourselves ror it as a man does for his work. Don’t think you can undertake -it otherwise." It was not
preaching she advised, but practice. It |
was the nursing of the poor in her own ! neighborhood that first made the impres- | sion on her mind of how much the trained j .Uurse was wanted.
It was just alout this time that she met Elizabeth Fry. " The one was fast drawing to the close of her great work for the women prisoners, and the other stood on lhe threshold of a philanthropic career to be equally distinguished." Mrs. Fry had established a small training home for nurses in London, and was a friend of Pastor Fliedn^ the founder of Kaisers-werth and of the order of Protestant Deaconesses. r.irs. Fry told Florence Nightingale of the admirable work carried out by Pastor Fliedner, and the result was that the English girl enrolled herself as a voluntary nur.^c in the novel institution. Before leaving for Germany she spent some months in the hospitals of London. Edinburgh, and Dublin. Next sh^jiwnt abroad, and saw the workings of the hospitals in France, Germany, and Italy, and the "comparison was not favorable to England."
-	When Florence Nightingale first entered on her career the " profession of nursing iiad a stigma attached lo it, for the reason that no decent woman cared to enter it. The women who attended the patients in the hospitals were of the coarsest type, not only untrained but immoral and intemperate.” fW a decent young woman to becom- a nurse made it not unlikely that she would lose her reputation. It was on the Continent that Florence Nightingale found Those devoted Catholic women who ministered to the sick. At Kaisers-werth there was a Protestant sisterhood who were “ working on similar lines to Sisters of Charity, and here the English young woman found the ideal of trained nurses which-ehe had been forming in her own rnind." The coming of an English Friioiein, a lady of wealth and position, must have caused a flutter of excitement among the mcdest sisterhood. But Miss Nightingale was quickly at home, and was	to learn. After leaving Kaisers-
weith she went to Paris, and remained for some time with the Sisters of St. Vincent ae Paul. She studied surgery in the hospitals and visited the homes of the French poor.
Returning home, j he became acquainted with the humane work carried out by Hr. Sidney Herbert, afterward Lord Herbert of Lea. In London there was ihe Harley Street Homo for Sick Governesses. That institution, from want of funds and not the less from careless management, was going 10 ruin. Florence Nightingale took charge of if. induced subscriptions, and with gold management made it prosperous.

she, wept, to-Lear:Hurst, to :r^riiji -Her health. As’neighbors tlicre were Mr* and . Mrs. Sidney Herbert. They knew of the work Miss Nightingale was.- carrying out! In 1852, Sidney Herbert was. appointed Secretary of WarN^n Lord Aberdeen's Government. The war with Russia he-gan in the Spring of 1854. .After the bat-tic of. Alma came, the news; “of the ! wounded lying upca^e&. foiy the^slek an-tended, the dyin^‘upconsolable.” In the | midst of the nation’s rejoicing over vie*
I tory a cry of indigriation arose on behalf of the soldiers. There had been gross neglect in the war administration, and the commissariat had broken down. Stores there were in abundance, but they were rotting on the shores of the Bosphorus. It was William Howard Russell who, in The London Times, directed public attention to the want of clothing, food, and tin care for tho sick and wounded. He made an appeal to the English people, and asked whether there were no devoted women who would go forth and care for tbe disabled soldiers. The appeal brought about an inuri&ailon of answers, but there was no organization and “ no leader." ’ It was in a moment of inspiration that both Mr. and Mrs. Herbert thought^ of Florence Nightingale. Certainly it was a bekj^heasurc. The impediments which were sure to he put in her way were many, for If the whole charge were to bo placed In the hands of a woman she might liavo been strangled by ** red tape.'1 Nurs-i ing was one thing, but the administv&r | tive power something else. \Oct. 15 £Jid-I ney Herbert wrote offering Florence Nightingale the position. A letter in which she offered her services crossed that of Mr.Herbert. One week after her appointment as Superintendent of Nurse^ at Scutari she was on her way. The undertaking was new, and much at variance with English customs and tradition. There were even some stupid ones who because Catholic Sisters accompanied Miss Nightingale raised the dull cry of “No Popery." There were thirty-eight nurses in the company, In November they arrived in Scutari. " The Lady in Chief," as she was subsequently known, had control of all the hospitals, some eight in number, in which the sick and wounded soldiers had been huddled. Tho day after her coming the battle of Inkerman bad been fought. Conditions were found to be horrible. Invalids took care of other Invalids and " the dying nursed the dying.**
In the overcrowded wards tne men lying on the floors were tormented by rats and vermin. Aside from the want of Unt and bandages, there was insufficient food. They were Augean stables. Florence Nightingale became the nurse in its widest sense. She was &ok and washerwoman. She cared for the wounded. Her presence acted like magic. There were attempts at interference, but such things the lady put out of the question. She broke down the rules as far as the furnishing of the necessary material objects her patients required. She fought the red tape. It might have taken some days before the slow officials could inspect something wanted at the instant, and Florence Nightingale was peremptory in taking at once what was necessary. By her own individual exertions, aided by her helping nurses, she saved many a life. When order had been restored and men were no longer dying like sheep with the rot, she cared for the wives of the wounded men. Then she went in May, 1855, to Balaclava, and. living there in a wretched hut, did all the good she could.
When the facts of her devotion were known every one who spoke English was loud in her praise. The wretchedly exposed quarters at Balaclava must have made her ill. She returned to Scutari. There was plenty to do there. With the peace of March at). 18T>0, her labors for the moment ceased. Before leaving the Crimea her last work was the erection of a monument to the dead, for which she provided the means, in England all honors were showered on her, but, alas, her great work of nursing reform, with the exposure at Balaclavjf, had ruined her health. Had it been possible she would have left for India so as to care for the* soldiers who were repressing ihe Sepoys’ mutiny. It was hoped that she might take charge of an institute for nurses, and a sum amounting to £48,000 was subscribed. But her health did not improve, and all she could do was to become one of the administrators of the Nightingale fund. When hi 1801 "our civil war broke out her counsel and advice were asked, and the formation or Red Cross Societies was an extension of ihe work originating in the mind of this loving woman.
The author tells us that for the last nine years Miss Nightingale has not left her house in London, but at eighty-four the lady retains the distinction of manner which gave her such influence In the pas', and now and Again a flash of the old shrewd wit breaks out when views with which she if? not in agreement are advanced.
