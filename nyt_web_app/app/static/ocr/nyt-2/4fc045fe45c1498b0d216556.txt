LTHOUGH pedagogues make vast claims for the moralizing effects of schooling, I cannot tind a single criminologist who is satisfied with the modern school," says G. Stanley Hall.
" Whoever indulges in the luxury of children enters the teaching profession," writes Ella Calista Wilson, This may have been said before, Mrs. Wilson, in her “ Pedagogues and Parents," says it with emphasis.
She sets forth the fact that fond mammas and proud papas cannot shift the entire responsibility for tho education of little Johnny and little Susie to tho teacher* She does not believe parents are infallible. She tells with a twinkle the tale of an “ exclusive " Boston mother. This mamma feared the contaminating democracy of the schoolroom, but she tried to bribe a kindergarten teacher to come after hours and ** ' give the gist of it ’ to her one little boy/'
Because the author puts the blame for failure in education upon parents as well as teachers, and because she has not the slightest air of appearing to know it all, she is worth listening to when she shows the laughable and lajnentable insufficiency t ne average public school.
Mrs. Wilson evidently believes it is wiser to laugh than to weep. Her stories are not less suggestive for being funny. She finds an excellent moral in the two little girls, beloved of New England story-tellers, who feared they might be late for school. " Let’s kneel right down here and pray that we may not be late," proposed the one who had “ been corrupted by adult sophistry." “ No." responded the other, who was ** Nature's u\vn," " we’ll skin right along and pray as we go.*'
The book begins with a brief history of educational ways and manners, from Kousseau back to the Dark Ages and forward to our own glimmerings of light. It is not a treatise, its historical chapters " meander and are cheerful and chatty. Of the ideals of the past it gives amusing glimpses. Milton's conception of a course of study for the young and tender is reproduced:
“ First, they should begin with the necessary rules of some good grammar, (Greek or Latin, be it under-’ Ktood, 1 then some eysy and delightful book of education would be read to them. I ill Greek,] whereof the Greeks have store, as Cebes. Plutarch, and other Socratic discourses. Also some few in Latin. In this manner the* .re to be inflamed with the study of. learning and ttw admiration oG virtue," They are also to be taught the rules of arithmetic, and, soon after, the elxn^nts of geometry. ‘After evening repasts, till bedtime, their thoughts will best be taken up in the easy grounds of religion and the story of Scripturc. The next step would be the authors of agriculture, t.’ato, Yarro. and Columella, [all in the Latin, of course.! for the matter is most easy, and if the language be difficult so much the timer. It is not a difficulty above their years." After learning the use of the globes and all the maps, with the old nan/es and tlv* n«-*w. they might then, reading Latin fluently by this time, * 9 he capable to read any compendious method of natural philosophy. *	*	*
Afterward come physics, trigonometry, and from , thence to fortification, architecture, enginery,, or navigation. * * ■ * Then also those poets which are , now counted most hard will be both facile and pleasant, Orpheus, Hesiod, Theocritu^Arastu^, Nicander, ' Oppian, Dionysius, and, in Latin, Lucretius, Manlliuai, and the rural part of Virgil.	v
The author pokes a little sen tie Tun at our •* committees,’* the Committee of Fifteen, for instance, who prepared and published a model course of study for elementary schools, and she makes the pertinent comment that at great educational meetings, in the prep-aration-of study courses a'nd the regulation of school life, parents, save as they ar<ralso pedagogues, have** no part.	^
Here is chance for discussion. Shall the mechanic and the artist, the housewife and the home manager secure-a school board and take no further concern-for the education of their children? Do parents give _ far closer supervision to* the man who builds their . houses or digs their gardens than to those who make or .mar their children? A teacher in a New York City; ’ high school said to me In 1900: *' I have taught in this school for eight years, and In all that time I can remember but qpe parent or guardian who ever visited ' my classes." Yet if parents were to inundate the.

to believe that what produced anything1 so ^ admirable as themselves is good enough for their children?
V It is my own experience that there are proportionately as many parents open to conviction as there are teachers. There is . A little town in Wisconsin where they have swimming lessons as part of the
-	public school coursk There were parents who " pished ” and “ pshawed” at the beginning:. Now they take a visitor ' straight away to the big pool and say,
*’ We want you to see our children swim! ’*
4* Lose time? ” said one of these men.
“ Our children gain time by this. They work better and faster for It."
The schools of any community reflect Its conglomerate life. If they are bad altogether or bad in spots, it is not the board and the teachers-alone who are to blame. Fit yourself, is Mrs. Wilson’s plea to parents, to take an enlightened interest in your child’s classroom. All real educators, she insists, from the old days to the new, have been trying to give the individual child a chance, yet every effort they have made has been fought by the public with the same desperate and conscientious doggedness that has opposed the" growth of religious thought. The most vital and hopeful effort being made to-day is the attempt to raise the standard of the teaching force. The old contest is on again. In the Quincy chapter of the book, a description of the first considerable experiment in common-sense education in this country, is this significant statement:
The results of Col. Parker's work might have been much greater than they were had it not been for the usual drawback in such cases. He never ceased lamenting that he could not find teachers nor train them fast enough to intelligently carried out his ideas.
Mrs. Wilson's account of the puzzled normal student, earnest but not quite equal to “ relative values as acquisitionai, assimilational, and expressional," and the methodology of each " makes one wonder if there is not too much about concepts and precepts and too little about some other things in an ordinary normal school course. Hot many teachers glibly “ perfect ” in pedagogy know the difference between tone-deaf ness end ob:	stinacy, between willful sloth and dis-
eased incapacity? Ferhaps the best-trained elementary teachers in this country i	to-day are those of Indianapolis. Forty
:	years ago Superintendent Shortridge se-
;	lected a group of the schoolgirls who
|	were of unusual ability and encouraged
them in choosing the most advanced courses of study then open to women. One of them became the supervisor of elementary schools, another the head of the training school for teachers. For three decades Miss Nicholson in the training" camp and Miss Cropsey in the field have worked to make teachers as an artist works to make pictures. Now pupils taught by well-trained teachers are themselves teachers and supervisors; and that is why, in spite of handicaps under which most of us would sit down defeated, the schools of Indianapolis are an object of educational pilgrimage.
This city is of all those that I know the most successful in eliminating the weak teacher. Compare this careful and personal study of a teacher s innate and acquired fitness with the notebook and “per cent." process of producing teachers. " The other children are all at work. We want to make a lady of Nellie: she is to teach," pleaded a mother when Nellie failed of high school promotion. “ She must be promoted, because we need the money," the mother concluded. Yet the ^schools are not established to provide income for the teacher but instruction or
the children.
Examinations that require of the would-be teacher the power to think as well as to memorize are helping the cause in New York City, but even this effort to rescue thousands of unoffending children from the blunders of dullness has been fiercely assailed. No examination that was ever invented can keep out the untruthful and the vulgarly commonplace. The instructors In a big city high school are always meeting a would-be briber among these embryo pedagogues. In a Manhattan high. school one ill-advised damsel remarked confidentially to the teacher in her “ weak subject,” “ You pass me and I'll pay you whatever’s right." Just before examination presents ranging from long-used and ill-cleaned side combs of dazzling ornamentation to the simpler and more pleasing nosegay are offered to the instructors of the “ shaky ” future teachers. ”Are you going to mark me failure?" demanded one such girl of a long-sufferIng pedagogue. “I am,” replied the
•	teacher for the third time; “ that is all your work has earned."
tl I gave you a spoon two years ago," retorted the girl wrathfully. *' I should like it back.”
She got it, in its original wrapper where it had lain undisturbed since the perplexed teacher had accepted it rather than offend an obnoxious pupil whom time might improve.
It is such teachers as these girls become who say an example is wrong because it is not done by their individual rule- who cast tbe blight of their own unimaginative, barren presence over every subject offered, till the child’s mind, at first restless and unsatisfied, hardens Into
imitative dullness’' and becomes/ “backward." .	vV.V s'.' ^	-
There has been lately.a-vastdeal of discussion ovei* the backward childreij of the New York City .schools. The‘;'irahappy phenomenon has been attributed to over-lmmigration, to " fads/* to ftills.V I can testify that long, long before tho new course of study was Introduced, Before ever a " fad ” showed its vituperated head, this portent of aged school children was a matter of amazement and trouble to teachers. If the majority of New York parents, instead of trying to gratify the ambition of those who want an “ easy and genteel" job, will mightily uphold an effort to give children the best, there will be fewer of the backward. The teacher who talks kindness in the class will not leave starving goldfish and tortured tadpoles to stew in glass jars behind sunny glass windows. If so small a creature as a toad or a frog were always well treated in schoolrooms the barbarism of our streets would be lessened. A teacher affects a class as a bit of colored matter changes the hue of water, nnri cruelty is the sign of the undeveloped. Says the author of " Pedagogues and Barents
The course for us to pursue is not too much to punish and correct faults, but to ignore these and induce virtues. Only of inherent cruelty and cunning would we make an exception. These two vices should be regarded as diseases and should have active warfare waged against them. If you know of a boy ora girl who sneaks through the world by ‘ ways tha, ate dark and tricks that are vain, spare no pains to keep your child out of his company: you don't want him on the other end of the log in your child s university. No more ao you want the boy who can deliberately pull the hind legs off a frog because he has heard they are good to eat.
Even in the chapters cn character training Mrs. Wilson is not dry. Her earnestness is full of the sparkle of anecdote, her quotations are apt.
With a plea for less of the rigidity of death and more of the elasticity of life in schools, Mrs. Wilson does not anywhere deny the need of active effort on the part of the child. It is the dead system that produces lazy conceit and shallow pertness, 44 Pedagogues and Parents ’* Is a book to set tongues and pens to wagging:, a book to read from preface to finis with the relish of combat or agreement. Whether you deny or assent, you are bound to laugh; vide the heading of the chapter on individuality:
A farmer in Bungleton had a colt That couldn't be taught to moo.
And he kept his cow under lock and bolt Till the smith could make her a shoe. His ducks wouldn't gobble, his gees& wouldn’t quack;
His cat wouldn't bark at all.
" I’m clean discouraged," he cried •* Alack!
