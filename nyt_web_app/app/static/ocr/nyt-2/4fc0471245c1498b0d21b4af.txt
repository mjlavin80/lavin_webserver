The two volumes by Prof- J. Henry Middleton, on ** Ancient Rome in 18S5 and " Ancient Rome in 1888,” have been revised, greatly enlarged, and combined by him into a two-volume work entitled “ The Remains of Ancient Rome,’’ which Is about to appear in this country through the Macmillan Company. Prof. Middleton deplores the disappearance of many beautiful places of ancient Rome, and writes:
No words nan adequately express the distrust which must be experienced both bv the antiquary and by the beauty in any form who now visits this unhappy city. The injury done in former periods of destruction was but superficial r compared to the ruin which is being wrought by the present scheme of the '* piano regolatore,” which aims and is partly succeeding in leveling the seven hills and filling up the intermediate valleys; changing the very face of nature, and utterly destroying the character or the former capital of the world. It should, however, be remembered that a great proportion of the injury which lias been done to the remains of ancient ana mediaeval Rome and to the natural beauties of the place has been the unavoidable result of the fact that Rome has again become the cQpitfil of Italy,	tliot	In
number of inhabitants it is now considerably more than double what it was in 1870.
There are now in the Eternal City nearly half a million people.. The book is an attempt to describe the buildings of ancient Rome with special reference to detail i and methods of construction. A list of the authorities consulted on the archaeology of Rome has been included, and Prof. Middleton has something to say in his introduction concerning the inscriptions, coins and medallions, catalogues, j early works on Roman antiquities, and the ] museums of Rome. The numerous illus- j trations include photographic reproduc- ; lions of sketches, statues, &c„ plans, and maps.
