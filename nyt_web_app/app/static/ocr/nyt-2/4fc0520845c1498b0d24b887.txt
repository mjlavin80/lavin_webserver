| Nothing could be moi-e tenderly hcauti-j ful than the opening chapter of this, Mr.
; Phillpotts's strongest story. With a touch | as artistic as it is loving, lie paints the early Spring upon his own Dartmoor, and ! makes tho landscape a setting for a chprming picture of youthful wooing. Pol- ' lowing this come liis peasants, with their simple faiths and racy tongues, a sturdy j folk, delightfully original and untrammeled. Shoulil the reader, perchance, have missed the dedication frankly declaring the tale a ", tragedy” he will fancy himself launched upon hours of pure enjoyment. But, with swift movement, the tragedy is soon upon him, a tragedy as grim and inexorable as any ever told by ancient Greek. It is the world-old 3tory of the polygamous male ereatur2, and of the conscciuenecs of a wife’s discovery. Mi*. Phillpotts is not dealing with men and women to whom the divorce courts offer a remedy, but with peasants of strong elemental passions; those who strike swiftly, who suffer keenly, whose broken lives can never again have their fragments pieced anti fastened together. There are no evasions, no subtle analyses in these simple natures; sin, virtue, remorse—all are direct, dynamic.
The leading characters are few—the hus-tand, too catholic in his affections; the wife, hard, but great of soul; '* the secret woman”: two sons just entering manhood, the one with something of his father’s complexity of uattire; the other, 11 his mother's own boy." These work out a drama as tremendous as the human soul7 itself, a drama in wlilph no single passion fails to assert itself. And Mr, Pbiil-potts has told it, all surpassingly well -only too well, for. like Tolstoy’s “ Anna Karenina," his book is a haunting presence, long after the spellbound reader has closed its covers.
lie knows liis Devon peasants, and it* is with humility that we enter cne or two protests against his portrayal; but, making all allowance for human weakness, the sin of Anthony Red vers docs seem, under the circumstances, a hideous dissonance in his life; while the shamelessness of “ the secret woman", the obliquity of moral vision in both, perceiving no harm in -their relation so long as it kept the commandment, “ Thou shalt not be found out," and the wife's attitude toward tho unrepentant partner of her husbands guilt, are all alien to human ^nature as we know it. The vacillating weakness ot Jesse, dominated always by his egotism, is natural enough, though we feel that the author, like certain other masters of fiction, is rather cruel to his own creations. Usually, however, he has tho large tolerance which belongs to the “ tout comprendre." No one has shown better than he that ihe defects of one's qualities are not more inevitable than the qualities of one’s defects—that, even as the sterner virtues are wont to cast their shadows, so is the sunshine of amiability likely lo shine through certain rifts of character. In hjs initial chapter, as he describes a storm-swept moor, he writes:
*' From the south one. roaming pencil of light passed ten miles off, and fallow land shone out, as though a ruby had been flung down there amid the welter of-cray rain and flying cloud.'' So, amid the storm of sin and of tragedy, has Mr, Fhlllpots flung down a more abiding ruby, the love of n, son for liis mother. Often
has the mother’s love been crowned by pencil and by "‘pen; but we can recall no such picture of filial affection as Mr. ''■ptiiilpotts has here given—the tenderness of purest, passion, the sublimation of ,manly devotion.	'	j
One may wish the theme less painful, our keen jdy in the‘perfection of literary workmanship less marred by the con* tinual constriction of heart to which the author compels us; but there cannot be two opinions as ; to the Intorcst and . the power of 14 The« Secret’ Woman*” It- is not only its author’s masterpiece,7 but it 4s far In' advance of anything, be. has yet mitten'—And 'that-- is. tov give .
