I have read with Interest your notice of Messrs, Chancellor and He wes's “ History of the United States *’ and also let, ters regarding the book which have apI peared In your paper. My own experience I with tiie work may be of interest to your , readers.
[ The first volume, which I believe Is i the only one yet published, came Into my ! hands at a time when I was making | Bome special studies in Colonial history,
! and I had occasion to verify many of
its statements and to compare It with a
i number of other works covering the same
| period. The Chancellor-Hewes book does
i not assume to be a source book In history
or to produce original documents. References to authorities and documents are
not a feature of its pages, but I was impressed by the fact that the authors had been in close touch with the best authorities and had weighed with fine discriml-i nation everything bearing on the history j of tbe period covered by their first vol-1 uzne.
Another feature of the book as I read It is a rare balance and perspective. Deal- I ; ing with affairs of our own times and looking on from an outside point of view, | ; It is easy for us to see the intrigues of
j England and France In the history of j
E^ypt for the past fifty years; to see Russia and England checking and coun-ter-checklng each other in Afghanistan and on the borders of India; but we do not so readily see the large parts which outside people took in American affairs all through Colonial times and even well
into the first half century of the republic. Even England, the mother country. Is set aside as a casual looker-on except when she decided to levy a tax on tea; yet as a matter of fact nearly everything of importance was an episode or reflection In miniature of transatlantic history. Friction and dissent but emphasized the solidarity of England and her colonies, for were they not truest reflections of 1 conditions at home? Cavalier and Puritan were equally English. Pennsylvania Quaker and Maryland Catholic were first Of all Englishmen. Whereas we have accustomed ourselves to look upon our early heroes as doing their parts on harrow rustic boards, Mr. Chancellor somehow makes his Colonial characters tread a larger stage and take their places in the
greater world play, its tragedy and comedy.
Of course one cannot forecast how the plan outlined at the start will carry through the ten volumes, but the first volume, covering a most difficult period, justifies a fair expectation of Increasing interest as the work progresses, for lt seems to me to be a broad, manly, and thoughtful attempt to give our history a world setting and to depict with accuracy and fidelity the men and events of our early days.
These are the things that seem to be of most interest In a reading of the book, and they are the things which we most heed to emphasize in our attempts to comprehend the history of our country.
