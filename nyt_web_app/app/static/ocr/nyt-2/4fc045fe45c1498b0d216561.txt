yew York Times ISook Review:
I was fairly surprised on reading :n Tub book Review of Feb. 4 the comments oC I-I. C. White as to the identity of Dr. Charles Alexander Eastman. Mr. White, if one can judge from the sarcastic reference he makes to “ books of professional naturalists " and to " sophisticated ” productions, seems to think Dr. Eastman's books too well written to be the " real thing.’* But we take pleasure in assuring him that they are the ** veal tiling,” and that Dr. Charles Eastman is a full blood of the Sioux Indian stock. And what is more, he* is a highly cultured Christian gentleman, a college graduate, and a university man—but does not wear feathers in his hair or a gaudy red blanket, as our correspondent appears to think he should in order to show himself senuine.
The writer of this communication is proud to say that he is personally acquainted with Dr. Eastman. It was over twelve years ago that he first met that gentleman at Pine Kidge Agency, S. D., where he was filling the position under United States employ of Agency Doctor among his own people; again, it was only a few years later -when lie ran across him in St. Paul, Minn., while he was acting in the important capacity of .International Secretary of Jndian Young Aleh’s Christian Associations, a work which took him from Maine to California, and from Winnipeg to Mexico; and later still it was a ■“call upon tbo doctor and his poet wife, Elaine GoodaUf, at their home opposite tn© Congressional Library, in Washington.
®Phat Dr. Eastman is thoroughly _ac-quainted with the life of his own people goes without saying, but that he does not sit with crossed legs in the opening of a teepee, writing with blue pigment on the wrong side of a cowhide, is his own good fortune, and should not be^equircd of a thoroughly civilized red man.
If one is at all skeptical as to the pos-sihility of a hative American, when placed under proper environment and -given a fair chance, easily showing himself the equal in every’ sense of the very best class of educated -Christian white men, let him take note of Dr, .Charles Alexander Eastman, or Ohiyesa, his real name in the Lakota Yapi. and then see if his prejudiced opinion docs not need to be modified. ,
If Mr. White desires any further pvi-dence as to the genuineness of the Sioux Indian's authorship of ** Indian Boyhood and ‘‘Red Hunter and Animal People,’* the writer of this letter-will be -only too; glad to furnish it, or , he is quite , sure that any of Dr. Eastman’s myriads of friends throughout the United States and Canada would enjoy availing themselves^ of a like privilege.
