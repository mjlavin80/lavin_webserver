HE report of the Librarian ot Congress for the last fiscal year, to one phage of which we have already referred In this page, Is a forcible	reminder of how greatly	the
dlgnJty and Importance of the great National Library haa been Increased. Mr. Putnam has put It where it ought to stand among such institutions, and his administration of it is a model of enlightened and intelligent public service. The distinguishing characteristic of it is that, as a whole and in all its departments. It is carried on with	a	definite policy, with foresight,	and
in	a	scientific spirit. That spirit is	not
that of a closely guarded scientific factory, nor yet of the red tape binding of a Circumlocution Office; but It Is the spirit that makes a great library an institution of the greatest value and convenience to the greatest number.

Mr. Putnam has precise and comprehen-j sive ideals toward which he is intelli* gently working; ideals that appear in various interesting comments throughout the report. He would make his institution what the librarians of the United States in one of their meetings declared that it ought to be—'4 the one National library, the only one in the country destined to be encyclopaedic and universal in its comprehensiveness.” It must, however, specifically devote a large part of Its resources to acquiring historical material relating to the United States. Yet this is to be done in such a manner as to assist, and not to block, the efforts of local institutions in accumulating data purely local. Mr. Putnam looks forward to a readjustment of manuscript historical collections that will effect a final location of such material “ logically sensible, historically appropriate, and calculated to enaMe it to perform under the most favorable conditions the functions pertaining to it,” In other words, purely local material will be lodged and kept in the places to which it belongs. In this the National Library is to do its share, and has already made a beginning by parting with some of its collections, with the authority of Congress, that would have greater usefulness elsewhere. Such a policy carried out with discrimination Is certainly an important means of making the National Library truly National in its spirit.
If Mr. Putnam finds occasion to lament the departure of valuable assistants trained in his service, he finds consolation in the Implication that the Library may thus become a training school, and association with its great collections and bibliographic apparatus may give a prestige and a special qualification for responsible work elsewhere. Herein he perceives the further possibility of valuable service to the country at large, and again the National Library is doing a National service.
The development of the division of manuscripts in the Library has apparently greatly stimulated the generosity and public spirit of people possessing manuscripts, and has resulted in gifts of valuable papers unprecedented in all its previous history. This naturally brings up the question of what the policy of the Government should be as to the publication of papers generally valuable to historical students. In this, as in other matters, Mr, Putnam has mature and definite ideas which he discusses most interestingly. Fortunately the Library possesses
authority and, to a certain extent, financial means for publishing such of the manuscripts as may seem to deserve it, and the Librarian concludes his remarks with the pithy and characteristic statement. " It will begin with those that most obviously require It.”
Congress has not been niggardly toward the new administration of its Library; indeed, Mr. Putnam's well-considcred and clear-sighted methods have commended, perhaps, an unexpected loosening of the pursestrings for a governmental expenditure that might not be expected to make a strong appeal to its Imagination. No doubt he would be glad to have more money than he has, but his requests for more are extremely modest. The tone of cheerfulness and positive optimism that pervades his report is one of its delightful features. The general impression it gives is that of a thoroughly equipped and completely organized Institution doing its work with enlightened scholarship and businesslike methods.
