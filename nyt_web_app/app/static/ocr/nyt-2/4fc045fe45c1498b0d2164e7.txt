Xcv> York Times Book Review:	.	*
Immediately after writing and posting for the columns of your esteemed publication a letter about Joseph Conrad andjila ■* Nostromo,” chiefly laudatory* the writer became aware of his essay of appreciation on Henry James in The North American Review. It seemed . hardly worth while to recall the laudatory letter, but the mere fact of the publication of that essay threw new light on the wordiness of “ Nostromo." A perusal of the essay confirmed the impression. It must be that Conrad also, having by this time said all be had to say that was 'worth saying, intends entering upon the same futile word play Henry James entered upon some ten or twelve years ago. As a warm admirer of all that is worth while in Henry James's books, I dare assert that the only trouble with his later novels is that, from the point of view of all honest persons—let them differ in all oth6r qualities—there is too little, if anything, in the books at all worth understanding. The most charitable view of Henry James's attitude to the public for the last decade is to suppose he says, as J. M. W. Turner said of hts later paintings, “ They buy my trash.” There is a demand, and he is willing to supply it. But your correspondent Emma Carleton, in your issue of Jan. 14, 1903, has said all the best that could be said on that subject. As for the mere art of his books, a breezy Westerner denounced them as "full of Canadian isms.” The Henry James cult recalls forcibly the fable about the Emperor’s new robes. M. U. O.
