Carlyle’s “ French Revolution.”
The Macmillan Company is about to add to Bolin's Historical Library Thomas Carlyle's history of The French Revolution,” in three volumes, edited by John Holland Rose, Litt. D., author of ** The Life of Napaleon I.," &c., who has provided an Introduction, notes, and appendices. In the first dozen pages of the introduction Mr. Rose discusses Carlyle's own estimation of his history. Speaking of tho '* worth ” of the work, he says:
When we compare Carlyle’s work with that of other writers, » • • we are at once struck by its superiority in width or balance in some cases, or by the human
interest with which he everywhere suffuses his subj-ct. * * * Carlyle hated all details, ami hiii work consequently rests on slight foundations at many critical points, but it shows us the workings of tho human heart as no historian of institutions and no microscopic analyst, like Taine, ever has done or ever will do. * • * He was filled by an overmastering longing to sound the depths of human nature, to note its passions and meannesses, and see how they wrought woe for the generations to come, or to exult over its noble impulses that raised even the weak to worthiness, and the truly great to heights of heroism or self-sacrifice.
There are many notes throughout the three volumes which the editor has inserted only to correct or supplement Carlyle’s narrative by the aid of modern sources of information. Carlyle’s text is everywhere reproduced verbatim as well as his footnotes. Numerous illustrations and plans have been incorporated, while the frontispiece portrait in each volume is In photogravure.
