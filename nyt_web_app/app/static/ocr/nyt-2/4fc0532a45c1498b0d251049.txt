L
NDOUBTEDLY It *ls very French, this book of M. de Noussanne’p about the -Emperor William IT.; undoubtedly there are in it very lively passages; but that the author really exhibits the real William as he reilly is, 13 unlikely. For there is obvious malice, obvious Gallic animus, obvious Indulgence of a spirit of levity and mockery, obvious ^ hospitality to anecdotes in which the Kaiser is a figure of comic opera. Jff. de I Noussanne’s theory is, indeed, that William lg a kittle cracked. He declines to accept him seriously as a great monarch, or even as a sane man. Thousands of incidents in William’s highly embellished career seem to "him to prove that the most versatile and busy of monarchs is what the French call un malade—one mentally deranged—after the same fashion (though the manifestations are not exactly the same) as Nero and Caligula. Yet, as the translator, Mr. Waiter Littlefield, remarks In his preface, it is quite possible to accept all or most of M- do Noussanne’s incidents and reiuse Ills conclusion. Mr. Littlefield, whose translation is at many points very happy and who has caught the spirit of the whole excellently, regards the more serious parts of the book with perhaps a little too much favor. Those serious parts are often suggestive, but they hardly carry conviction. For it is evident always that the facts are less considered than the author’s preconceptions and preferences, lie -floes not like the Germans and hardly seeks to conceal his contempt for distinctive German qualities.
Let us turn to some of the most pleasing of the bits of malice with which the book is spiced. First in M. de Noussanne s preface, this:
He has charmed, hypnotized, - and affrighted Germany, which since his first joyous exhibitions of power he has put in the fluttering and dramatic situation host elucidated in familiar language by caving that a hen has hatched out a duck.
I say this neither in irreverence nor frivolity. It is my sincere impression, set forth without circumlocution.
Then there is question of the Emperor’s taste in language on great and shining
occasions;
For example, glance at this telegram which he sent to Nicholas U. at the end of a visit that a Russian squadron paid to the German fleet at Danzig:	‘The
Admiral of the Atlantic greets the Admiral of the Pacific.” The Kaiser, wishing to please his departing illustrious guest, divided into two parts—Atlantic and Pacific—SCITthe oceans of the world, and like Napoleon on the shores of the Niemen he gave the Orient to Russia and reserved for himself the Occident! Would you like to know what reply Nicholas XI. made to this extravagant salutation? He simply signaled from the top of the mainmast of his yacht the Polar Star " Bon voyage! ”
M. de Noussanne devotes a chapter to the manner in which *' this young man " got rid of Prince Bismarck. It is, of course, founded on the narrative of Dr. Blum. The imperial traps are exposed and how the aged Chancellor fell into them.
Of his Ministers since, M. de Noussanne thinks but meanly—Caprivi, von Hohen-lohe, even von BiilOW, '* to whOTQ Wfi Majesty has already offered the title of Prince in order to thank him for the clever way in which he has extricated the imperial infallibility from certain difficulties." Then this for the Kaiser:
if he realizes that he has committed a personal blunder he never sees it revealed in all its enormity. He imagines that a word iKcourtesy, a turn of the head, a smile art sufficient to consign it to oblivion, and. since he does not remember it (he was never blessed with a long memory.) he is actually astonished to find that it continues to be retained in brains so badly organized that they do not imitate him.
Follows a fling at the imperial latinity as displayed in congratulatory telegrams, and then comes a chapter, somewhat impassioned, on imperial treatment of the p0jes_“ polish names of towns and villages changed to German, and finally, to crown this odious series of persecution,
the youngs girls of Wreschen and Guesen beaten until the blood ran by the cruel German jschulmeister under pretext that they had refused to speak German." Then and passim are remarks on the law of ]£se majesty. But M. de Noussanne thinks the Poles have won the battle or
are winning it.
The next chapter concerns William and Hocinlism, to whieh the author thinks the Kmperor bus ?iv^n at onee too much and ton little, and given it all wrongly. There U in this chapter also a comprehensible raiment of the alignment of German piirtiep on economic subjects—a statement for which many befogged readers of foreign news will be glad enough. In the same connection is a discussion of the

Kaiser's attitude toward,Herr Krupp, the cannon maker—living and dead.
% M. de Noussanne declares that William's left arm Is indeed somewhat crippled, but that fiis left hand is perfectly available even for piano playing. .Then he sur-
■	veys the wide field of Imperial photo-| graphs and portraits and traces the evolution of the present Imperial aspect.
In 1894, after a series of national tribulations had passed over Germany, the definite type of to-day was adopted; the points of the mustache were trained under the eyes and directed toward heaven.
I This innovation was performed with the i collaboration of the Court barber, Hapy,
I who from his first appearance followed | hl^ august master everywhere he went n ; order to preserve the ferocious appearance of the imperial mustache. Hapy i and his apparatus for preserving the con-i tour of mustaches (fixe-moustaches: es ist errelcht) soon became celebrated.
Then is related the story of a certain photograph of the Kaiser “ which has ' only been seen as a rare privilege.'* In it the monarch appears seated on a . throne in an ermine cloak with sceptre and orb, " while on his head reposes a . stuccowork imitation of the crown of ! Charlemagne.” This photograph is an " indiscretion,” for William has never been crowned Emperor. An enterprising American has purchased the plate.
There are chapters on William as a family man, as guest and host and landlord, as he moves about town or on his travels, as head of the army, a3 4aanrt master, mu* slclan, painter, patron. Incidentally this:
A Frenchman who visits Potsdam has the felicity of hearing the palace guide designate the works of art in the following termsr “ Picture by Professor Meyer! Picture by Professor Watteau! " Tbe appellation “ Professor " Watteau certainly has unexpected charm.
Then we have William as ” Preacher and Poet,*' a most enlivening and even informing chapter, and another chapter on William and love, with an inquiry as to whether he ever visits Paris incog. Yet perhaps the most striking of all the chapters is entitled "William II. and God.”
Providence is his friend and ally, and God one of his most eminent contemporaries, whose affection and devotion toward him have been «ftquired in an altogether particular manner.
M. de Noussanne is of opinion that this God—the Kaiser's God (unser Qott)—is queerly mingled of Jehovah and the ancient Teutonic deities Wodin and Thor; that he has little in common with the God of the Christian dispensation. At all events he is a God of armies and of battles, a God to whom the German nation Is a peculiar people, whose mouthpiece in some sort the German Kaiser is. Naturally M. de Noussanne does not think the Germans a peculiar people in the same sense in which the Kaiser takes lt; he finds the queer jumble of the Kaiser’s notions of religion, aa a sort of heritage of his royal ancestors and appanage of the Crown, monstrous but amusing, as he finds also William’s idea of “ tradition," the notion he has of himself as the direct , heir of Charlemagne. Chapters on the future of Germany are perhaps somewhat thrown out of focus by the unexpected events of the Russo-Japanese war. But they are interesting, especially as they regard a possible conflict with Great Britain or the United States, and the fac tors which must be considered when Em peror Franz Josef dies and it comes to a question of the partition of Austria-Hun* 1 gary and the consolidation of all the German States under one monarch, who shall be no other than William II., King of Prussia, and already called *' German Emperor.” M. de Noussanne shows how many Interests must be conciliated in order to bring about such a consummation; he even suggests that France would have to be propitiated by the return of the lost provinces of Alsace and Lorraine. By the way, he does not look upon any permanent alliance of England with France as likely even on tne oasis of a com* , mon dislike of the Germans. And lie does not suppose even as a contingency an American*English combination against the Kaiser's ambitions. With a true continental eye, he is apt indeed to overlook America in his calculations.
