[ The Harpers will publish on March 2 a new story by Elinor Glyn which "will bear the title •* The Vicissitudes of I Evangeline." Evangeline, it appears, is an orphan who expected to have a fortune left her. Instead, the fortune was left to a young man who was invited in a codicil to marry the disappointed girl, who is represented as a most distracting young person of the latest advanced model.
