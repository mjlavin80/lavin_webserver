*' Reminiscences of the Hoboken Academy ’’ is an attractive little 16mo. volume in brown paper covers published by 33. Steiger & Co. of New York. Robert Waters, Superintendent of Schools, West Hoboken, N. X, is the author. Mr. Waters was Instructor in the institution (founded and largely patronized by German-Americans) from 1868 to 1883, and what he has here set ■ down is intended especially for the eyes of those who were students or teachers in Hoboken Academy during those years. He tells in a genial sort of fashion of his own coming to the Academy after years.spent In Germany, and of his associates in the Faculty, especially the Directors, or heads of the school. Of these the first was Mr. Klund, and the second, whom Mr. Waters knew most intimately and affectionately, and to whom he devotes most space, was .magnus Schroeder. Of Mr. Schroeder’s abilities as a teacher, of his charm as a man, the writer speaks with great enthusiasm. He was, however, a masterful man, who came into conflict with the Board of Trustees, and, though formally sustained by tne action of the shareholders, resigned to avoid further friction. Mr. Vaters, describes with some liveliness the meeting or uie shareholders in the gymnasium of the school and the speeches made, pro ancl^ con. Then he passes to Mr. Schroeder’^ after career as tutor in New York, and to his death, to tho in- j terregnum In the Academy . which fol- j lowed, and the administration of the next j Director, Joseph Schrenk. He speaks, 1 too, of the various able women who were at different times teachers in ttie' school and adds reminiscences of boys he taught, with some account of high positions they have since attained. Altogether it ia a most pleasing little book, which, while It must appeal especially to the writer’s old friends, students, co-workers, to the alumni of the institution, has a quality which will command from outsiders also a friendly interest.
