" The Companion to Greek Studios ” differs in scope from other books of the sam« class; for, besides a survey of Greek life, thought, and art in their different branches, it includes a chapter on the physical conditions of Greece, another containing chronological tables of politics, literature, and art, and a chapter on certain branches of criticism and interpretation. While each article has been intrusted to a writer who has made a special study of the subject, it lias been the aim of the work to give the substance of our knowledge in a concise form. ,On this account the discussion of controverted points and technical details has been Tor the most uart omitted. For thr* same reason sources and authorities have not usually been cited in the text, unless the reference has been necessary to establish an argument, to justify an important theory, or to remind the student of the "locus classicus ” of the subject. It is hoped that the full table of contents and the indexes of proper names and Greek words will increase the value^ of the book for purposes of reference. Bibliographies have generally been appended to each article to help those who seek further information. Plans, views, and reproductions of ancient works of art have been i carefully chosen and inserted in those ; articles in which illustration seems most necessary.
This, from the preface to “ A Companion to Greek Studies,” edited for the syndics of the Cambridge University Press by Leonard Whibley of Pembroke College. England, gives an idea of the aim and scope of the volume. Among the contributors are H. F. Tozer, H. B. Tri^ram, R. D. Hicks, Sir Richard Jebb. Henry
