iSIl jg interesting but incorrect.* "His views are patriotic and caleu-v la ted to appeal to the liasty popular judgment, but they are unsound. JHis. illustrations are unfortunate, in that two, cases which -he .cites are- in no. way^-Tinal-; ogous to the Custer affair, and the other * - j _ » * -’only confirms my.* view. According to! one of our best: naval historians, (Mr.* John R. Spears,) Capt Hull disobeyed no orders in sailing- from Boston to meet the Constitution! (See Spears’s History of! Our Navy,” Volume II.* Page 74.) From, this it is seen that Capt. Hull .had an idea—undoubtedly well founded—that if *he remained-In port long* enough for or-.ders to reach him from the Navy Department he would be prevented from going to sea. Therefore he stood not upon the order of his going, but departed, Immediately. * The orders he had ari'tlcl--pated directing him to' remain In port reached Boston several days after he had gone. This is. very, far from dlsobelience to orders, and I take the liberty of differing with the unknown but"“good naval, authority ".ctuoted by Mr. Spears who -declares that Hull would have ho&n hanged or shot for salting without orders if his ship had been captured. Whether he would or would not, however, has nothing to do with the Custer case.
' Farragut at the mouth of the Missis--slppi was in an entirely different position. -He was not placed In command of a portion of a naval force which was supposed to do a certain and definite thing in the carrying out of a larger general plan 1 of some superior officer. His was an Individual operation. He was on the ground, and to him was committed the doing of a certain thing. In the exercise of his discretion—a discretion every Commander in Chief reserved for himself—hr felt at liberty to disregard the orders of the department as to details bo long as he accomplished the desired end. If one of his division commanders had disobeyed orders, gone off on his own hook and done something which was neither contemplated nor desired, and which would have broken up Farragut’s plan, that would have been a parallel to Custer's action. Farragut* s course was not* ! Therefore there is nothing to be drawn from a further consideration of the battle of New Orleans,	.	j
As to Craven at Mobile, it is Tin pleasant to have to say ko, but the bare, naked truth is that (’raven's action Is more like Custer's so far as the differing circumstances permit a resemblance. ' Craven did deliberately disobey a direct, explicit ' order of Admiral Farragut. What were the consequences of that disobedience?
First, the loss of his ship. Second, the terrible catastrophe which was distinctly visible from the Brooklyn made the Captain of that ship stop right under the guns of Fort Morgan, The Brooklyn swung toward the fort, so that every shot: raked her terrifically. The whole van of Farragut’s fleet was thrown into confusion. The fate of the battle trembled in the balance. Had a commander less great than Farragut been in charge the result would have been a disastrous defeat. The action of the Brooklyn immediately consequent upon Craven's disobedience, compelled Farragut to hazard his own ,sfiip (disobey his own orders!) by crossing the torpedo line and by his example pull a victory out of the jaws of defeat.
It is not generally known that there was a distance of a mile between .the Hartford and the rest of the* fleet after Farragut darted ahead! It took that long for the other ships to get in line and go ahead; so that, to put the matter plainly. Craven's disobedience of orders nearly lost the battle. Farragut’s manoeuvre was no mere reckless dash; it was generalship of the highest order, and more than anything else in his career stamps him as a captain of the first rank.
Of course, It was Craven's zeal, his bold desire to close with his gigantic enemy, that led him to disobey his orders. In the light of his courage, his self-denying courtesy, we can afford not to dwell lop particularly upon his course. In this connection f uuote the following remarks of Admiral Farragut. given on Page 42^ of the life of the Admiral by his son:	.
"General orders required the vessels to pass Inside the buoys uext to Fort Morgan. When the Tecumseh re-ached that point, it looked so close that .poor Graven said to the pilot; 'The Admiral ordered me to go Inside that buoy, but it must be a mistake.’ He ran just his breadth . of beam too far westward, struck a. torpedo. and went* down in two minutes.
Alden saw the buoys ahead and stopped his ship. This like*to have proved fatal -to all of us. I saw the difficulty, and ordered the Hartford ahead, and (he fleet .to follow. Allowing the Brooklyn to go ahead was a_great error. It lost not only "the Tecumseh, l>ut many \‘aluable lives,; by keeping us under the fire of the forts! tor thirty minutes; whereas had I" led, AS 'I intended to do,-1 would have gone inside the buoys, and all would have followed, -me.” .	-	.
