E had already admiringly reviewed -fDec. 24, 1904,) Mrs. EUa Calista Wilson’s thoughtful and suggestive little book called " Pedagogues and Parents,*’ but the originality of view and fresh observation in Miss AdSie Marie Shaw's' article on the same subject amply justify its publication. Miss Shaw is herself an educator, and as a writer on modern educational methods she always commands attention. Certainly the subject itself must claim the sympathy of every progressive American. No truth is more easily demonstrable than that all educational reform to be effective must begin at the beginning with the lower grades. It is undeniable. too, that until the parents co-operate intelligently„-with the pedagogue the work of the best-managed schools must be sadly hampered.
