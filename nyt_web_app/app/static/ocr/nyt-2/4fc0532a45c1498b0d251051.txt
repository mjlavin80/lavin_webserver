An Appreciation by Judge Shackleford of Prof. Howison’s Volume of Collected Essays.
yeta York Times Book Review:
T IS a matter of gratification
that “ Tho limits of Evolution/' by Prof. George H. Howison, Mills Professor of Philosophy In the University Of California, published by the Macmillan Company, has reached its second edition. The first edition, which was published in April, 1901, was reviewed in a number of the leading English and American philosophical Journals and attracted much favorable comment. The second edition differs from the first in that the text has been carefully revised, though no changes have been made which affect the substance thereof, another preface of some nineteen pages and five appendices explanatory and defensive have been added. The book is a collection of essays or addresses, all of which have been delivered on different occasions between the
years 1881 and 1900, though revised and in part rewritten for publication In their permanent form. The titles and the or-
„er in which they appear are„aslif°u°Yf; <‘The Limits of Evolution,’ ‘ Modern Science and Pantheism/'" Later German philosophy.” " The Art	Rep-
resented in Poetry/1 “The Right. Rete-tton of Reason to Religion, Human immortality." and " The Harmony of Determinism and Freedom. ’
The key to these essays is found on tne title page, where they are spoken of as ** illustrating the metaphysical theory of personal idealism/' In the preface he fully explains the sense in which he uses the words, " personal idealism,” and also gives therein a precise summary of the doctrine which he Is seeking to develop, the several essays taken together covering. as he says, “the three chief fields of human concern—Science, Art, and Religion.” To the casual reader it might appear that the essays are somewhat fragmentary and disconnected, but a careful examination dJUdoses that there is a thread of unity running through and binding them all together. It would seem, as war said by a reviewer in The Monist,
“ that no one can be pardoned for miscomprehending his philosophy," and yet accomplished reviewers as the scholarly J. M. E. McTaggart in Mind for July,	and the literary editor of The
New York Tribune In its Issue of Keb. jL3, 1902, did fail to comprehend it and singularly misrepresented some of Prof. Howison’s ideas as set forth in these essays. To both of these reviewers Prof. Howison has replied to Appendices D and E and has also in Appendix A reprinted an article from Kantstudien, so there fs certainly no room now for any misapprehension. Appendices B and C consist of articles reprinted from The International Journal of Ethics for July, 1903, and from Mind for April, 1903, the latter of which differentiates Prof. Howls cm's system from that expounded in a boob bearing the title of “Personal Idealism/* by eight members of the University of Oxford and published in 1902, some fifteen months after “ The Limits of Evolution ” had been given to the public- As , Prof. Howison had also used and defined personal idealism In the memorable philo-rophical discussion which took plac& before the Philosophical Union at Berkeley, Cal., in 1895, between himself. Prof. Hoyce, Prof. Joseph Le Conte, and Prof. Mozes, afterward published in book form j under the title " The Conception of God/’ | and as the words are used by the Oxford professors to cover a different system it is a matter of regret that they did not select another title, thereby avoiding confusion in the philosophical world.
Space limits forbid here any extended discussion of the system of philosophy ur.folded in these essays. A pluralistic system is opposed to the current monistic system, though tho pluralism radically differs from that expounded by Profs. James and Schiller, and is by no means in full accord with that of Dr. McTag-gart. The first essay vigorously combats th*3 all-embracing claims made by many of the advocates of the evolutionary hypothesis and demonstrates that evolution fcns certain well-defined limits and cannot cross the chasm between the phenomenal and the noumenal ” or explain the origin and existence of the human mind. One of his conclusions therein is
is follows: " Tnless there Is a real man underived fro? nature, unless there is a ?piritua,l~or rational man independent of the natural man and legislatively sovereign over entire nature, then the Eternal is not a person, there is no God, and our faith is vain."
The second essay is a convincing refutation of the pantheistic system and skillfully points out the defective reasoning of the higher pantheists. Though not so intended, in reality It is a reply Picton s strong book “ The Religion of the Universe," which was published last year. The third essay contains the fullest and most satisfactory exposition we have found of the philosophic system of Hartmann, Diihring, and Lange, and the fcurth essay, one of the most charmingly
written of all, contains an exposition of
Prof. Howison's system as applied to art. The other three essays, as their titles readily indicate* deal with religion and are possibly more thought-compelling
than any others in the book. They presuppose, as do all of the essays, not only a serious -reader, but one •with a trained mind and well grounded in the different systems of philosophy. We fully agree with the literary editor of The Tribune
that at times " Dr, Howison calls us up to speculative heights, where -the rarefied metaphysical air makes breathing laborious/’ but we	dissent from	the	statement
that ** the ladder we	are	offered for a
climb to this	position	will	not	reach it.”
The ladder	provided	is	of	sufficient
length, only its thought-rungs are difficult to mount. However, the style of the book is most pleasing and. the BngJl^h pure, though the thought is condensed and is not always easy to grasp. In the essay entitled •* Human Immortality/* which Is in the nature of a reply to Prof. James’s Ingersoll lecture of the sama title, Dr. Howison begins with Prbf. James’s conclusion and carries the argument further and to a more satisfactory end, at least for one who is deeply interested in the Immortality of the individual solf. In the concluding essay he comments upon Prof. James’s essay on the '* Dilemma of Determinism/' and. as is
well said by Dr. McTaggart, Ws "delicate and courteous humor In the remonstrance,” in which he here indulges with his friend, is most admirable. He registers an emphatic dissent .to the *r Radical Empiricism of Prof. James and to the claims of pragmatists generally. In the matter of their u reformation of logicu he thinks they have left "the track of truth.” The reader will no doubt And many things in the book with which he will feel disposed to quarrel, but he will probably find It difficult to put his finger upon the flaws in the reasoning or to show wherein lt is fallacious. The book is dedicated to “ All who feel a deep con-j cem in the dignity of the soul," and we i are confident that it will appeal strongly to such readers. It will also be of especial interest to students of Kant, as the essays are based upon the system founded by the great KSnlgsberger, though they pass beyond Kant, ‘ ‘ closing the chasm left by him between his noumenal world of morality and his phenomenal world of science, and so opening the way for a genuine fulfillment of his permanent insights/’ The most reverent spirit pervades all the essays and together they constitute a strong argument against the current materialism and agnosticism.
We would have been pleased If Dr, Howison had included in this volume his essay on “ Catastrophe and the Moral Order," published in the first number of tho Hibbert Journal, and wo regret exceedingly that his address read at the International Congress of Arts and Science in St. Louis last September by Prof.
C.	M. Gayley, in Dr. Howison’B absence, could not have been included. In it he still further elucidated his system* and it elicited most favorable comments from those who were so fortunate as to hear 1L It will be published foter.
We bear In mind that the essays contained In this volume form only a partial fulfillment of his promise, contained In his introduction to “ The Conception of God,” '* to offer, tn a separate writing, and at a date not Coo remote, a thorough affirmation of the theory,” which bfrd only been suggested by him In his paper forming part of that memorable discussion. which this paper referred to as " A battle of the giants" ana The Tribune characterized as the “ most noteworthy nhilosophlcal discussion that for m^ny a day has taken place in this country/’ In speaking of the essaya in tho present volume Dr. Howison hlmaMf states *frn* they fulfill his promise “ only partially and provisionally; the full statement or his case is still to follow/* but In the preface to this edition he encourages us to still hope to have furnished by his pen "tbe systematic exposition of personal idealism/' as developed by hi™ Wo agree with the statement of Dr. Alfred Caldecott, in his “ Philosophy of Religion in England and America," that Dr. Howison has already demonstrated that he holds “a powerful brief for the ethical type of theism/' and we eagerly await the full development of the system. Of him his colleague, the tote Prof. Joseph Le Conte, himself one of our foremost scientists and a sfcilled dialectician, has said: “ I never knew any one who could compare with him as a dialects-
clan.”
It will be remembered that Dr. Howison’s seventieth birthday was celebrated on the 29th day of November last, at the University of California, and a Festschrift was issued by the university press containing contributions by his former pupils. May he have many happy returns!
