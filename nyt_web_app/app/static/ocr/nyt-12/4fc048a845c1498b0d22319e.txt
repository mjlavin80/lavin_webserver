HIS is the second volume Issued of a series of six which is to deal with the history of England up to the battlo of Waterloo in sufficient detail for accuracy and t borough ness, and yet not too minuto in treatment for readableness. The first volume issued was that of Mr. Trevelyan on “ England Under the Stuarts,” which was in many ways a tour de force for mastery of tiie subject and vigor of treatment, Mr. Innes's work has not the brilliance of Mr. Trevelyan's installment* bat it Is thoroughly adequate for its purpose, and shows even greater signs of sound judgment. If it is not so readable, it is perhaps more trustworthy.
Mr. Innes had an almost unique opportunity in dealing with the one heroic period of English history. Its theme is practically what we call the Elizabethan period, In which the English genius flowered Into its most consummate forms in its most characteristic directions. The monarchs that dominated the period, Henry VIII. and Elizabeth, are in many ways typical as Englishman and Englishwoman—hard yet capable, Intensely selfish yet equally intensely patriotic, brave yet cunning, masters of compromise yet capable of a directness almost brutal, sensual yet reverential. The Tudor monarchs were representative above all of those qualities which have led Englishmen to material success, and If the monarchs represented this side of English nature, the divines and the poets are typical of the higher England, of delicate perception in things spiritual, and of broad toleration In matters of right and justice. Mr. Innes has to deal with the England of Wolsey and Burleigh, of Drake and Raleigh, but he also has to treat the England of More and Hooker, of Ascham and Lyly, of Spenser and Shakespeare. In a measure he has been as successful in dealing with the latter as with the former, and gives a picture of the whole period which for the first time brings the threads together that connect the whole of the sixteenth century in English history.
There are two main lines of inquiry which have particularly attracted Mr. Innes’.s attention and have enabled him to give something of unity to his description. In the first place, the foreign policy of England during this period is explained by him in sueh a way as to collect together many internal events which otherwise would be extremely obscure. The courtships of Queen Elizabeth, which at first sight have so grotesque an appearance, are shown by Mr. Innes, following the initiative of Seeley and Major Hume, to be most subtle expedients Of the Queen to enlist the allegiance of Spain, France, Scotland, and the Netherlands, according as the exigencies of foreign policy required it. So, too, the somewhat mysterious appearances of Henry VIII. as a war lord in France, and his almost equally mysterious disappearances In that capacity, are carefully explained by Mr. Innes as due to the waxing’ and waning of Henry's alliance with Maximilian or Charles V. The dynastic considerations w'hich led to fixed lines of foreign policy are also carefully explained by Mr. Innes, who nevertheless explodes the old-fashioned theory that Henry VIII.'s marriages were due to the need of a son and heir whose legitimacy would be undoubted. Even if Anne Boleyn had borne him a son, his legitimacy, Mr.. Innes points out, would have been far from undoubted, having in view the attitude of the Pope.
The other line of inquiry which binds the book, together into one Is tho ecclesiastical policy of the Tudors after the New Learning and the New ligion Uad raised the relations of Church and Statfe-^ in a new* form. Here Mr. Innes brings out clearly what Bishop ot Creighton, Mr. Pollard and other re- ' cent inquirers have brought out In more detail^* the essentially political nature of the English Reformation. Neither Henry nor Elizabeth desired fundamental dogmatic changes in the English enurch. Their main object, and the main object of their people wTas to cast themselves free from Italian domination in matters spiritual. For that purpose it was necessary to Identify Church and State

:much more closely than it was possible r under the mediaeval papacy, and the re-1 jsult was a Constitution similar in many remarkable ways to the Russia of today, (or perhaps one should say, of yesterday.) As Mr. Innes puts it: " Luther’s was a Religious Reformation with political consequences; Henry’s was a Political Reconstruction entailing ultimately a reformed religion/1 Prom this point of view Mr. Innes relates the various steps by which the King was placed in the position of the Pope as regards the Church. The “ submission of the clergy,” the Annate Act, dealing with the financial side of the problem, the Ten Articles, the Six Articles, the suppression of the monasteries, and the King’s book—all these j stages are elucidated from this stand-point—till we s^p the reign ending with Henry, the former defender of the faith,
! the main object of it at the close of his reign.
In the three following reigns there is I continual conflict betWecn the older I system of belief and the new, or what | one might call Italian Catholicism and ; Anglican Catholicism, till toward the
•	end of Elizabeth's reign a new feature i is introduced by the Calvinism of the i Puritans, which had an entirely new | political ideal, rather republican than papal or royalist. All these changes and conflicts are sketched by Mr, Innes with considerable skill, and the larger canvas on which he draws his picture makes the outlines c.earer than in such books as Seebohm, valuable as that is; or even than Froude at the other end of the scale. Me. Innes, it is pleasant to observe, does more justice than has hitherto been dono to Froudc s vividness and mastery of detail. He allows for his inaccuracies, of which too much has been made, but scarcely give3 sufficient discount for his prejudices, which are still more important a drawback. Mr. Inngs is peculiarly free from the latter danger. His judgments of character are singularly sane. He has an account of Mary Queen of Scots (poked away for some mysterious reason into an appendix) which is about the soundest thing written upon this very Intricate and delicate subject. Mr. : Innes points out that political assassi- j nation was not regarded as reaMy immoral by the ethics of the time, and that Mary in this regard is rather supe- 1 rior to Henry VIII., the Guises, and most of the Pcotch nobility. As regards her complicity in the attempts on Eliz-! abeth, he remarks that "in a caged ! captive much may b? forgiven that in | others may not be forgiven,” and he | further claims for her that “ she never | betrayed, never disowned, never forgot i a faithful servant or a loyal friend."
I	Yet notwbhstanding this, he defends the Englirh action in removing her from the scene where her life was a perpetual menace to the liberties of the nation. Her death, he says, was the only solution of a situation in which the enemies of the nation were continually making use of Mary's existence to undermine the royal authority. It Is this sane judgment wlii^h characterises Mr. Innes’s treatment of difficult and disputed questions, and ma’.ics his book so valuable an introduction to the study of the whole period.
It is provided with the necessary genealogical tables, which aro so frequently needed to understL-id the judicial murders of Henry's reign, where
i
so many of iho nubility had claims more or lc:-s remote to the throne if Henry had n > If'gitinrite heir. Tho removals of liuckingham. Norfolk, Somerset. and Lady Jan:* Crey can only'-be explained by knowing their relation*; to the royal frmiiy, Mr. Innes's book also contains a series of historical maps, giving information ncccssary to enable the reader to c.s, opiate the local condition of affairs, and finally a select j bibliography giving both the Quellen 1 and the modern ntiihoriti^R on tho various divisions of his subject. The selection is excellent, lhough the bibliographical descriptions ^rc rather poor. Mr. Innes occasionally adlr a descriptive note to the bo;*ks. It would have been well. I think, if he had done so in the case of Seeley's “ British Policy. of which he ha,s obviously made great use* As an old pupil of Seeley. i may be personally prejudiced in his favor, but it seems to me that the c‘earn ess : with which the rplation nf foreign poli- ! tics with domestic affairs is given by ! Mr. Innes is due entirely to the epoch- ! making work of Sir John Seeley.	|
If the other volumes of th» series are executed as weil as the two already at hand, the reading public will • at last
have an adequate history of England,’ not presented dlsconttnuously -like Traill’s " Social England," where 4* too many cooks spoiled the broth”—I cay this, even though I was myself one of the scullions—and not attempting to &rasp too much in one hand as In Green'b “ Short History/’ where the treatment Is incomplete, because It is impossible for one man to control the whole of so large -a subject* Prof. Oman's series, of which Mr. Innes’s hook forms the fourth volume, steers, and steers successfully, a midcourse between these two extremes.
