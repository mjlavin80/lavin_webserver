| Architecture is a difficult art* and it is less popular in England than in other countries. The reason is, T believe, that writers have dealt with . architecture either as an affair of dates and/Technicalities Or as a vehicle for moral disquisition. The first method has little Interest for the layman, and the Litter none nt all for the artist. The result has been that architecture, considered as an art. has dropped out of the main stream of educated thought, and has lost touch of that intelligent interest which is freely 'accorded to the sister artfi. The problem for the ' critic is, I think, to find in architecture Hie personal equation of tho architect, to read his personality in his works, and to find a clue to his works in his personality. After all, the vital interest of architecture is the human interest.
And it ia to this interest that Reginald Elomfield, A. R. A*, F. S. A., addresses himself m his volume of “ Studies in Architecture,” which The Macmillan Company will shortly bring out. Some of the j "studies,” or essays, as the author calls i his chapters, have already been published 1 in English periodicals. He writes on Andrea Palladio, the architect of Newgate;
; Philibert de 1'Orme, the Italians at Fontainebleau, &c.
It has been Mr. Blomfield's object to show that architecture is "an expression of the human ;n tel I thence, conditioned by the same la;vs and capable of tho same critical analysis as any other imaginative anti intellecTual effort/' and not " a mystery to be jealously concealed from the vninitiated.*’ The volume Is fully Illustrated with photographs, plans, drawings,
, &c., by the author.
