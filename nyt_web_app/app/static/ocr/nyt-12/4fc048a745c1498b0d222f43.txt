FIVE BEASTS^
&nimal Biographies of English and / American Make.*
TMAL heroes have been fashionable now for so long & time that the fashion is already visibly waning. Animal heroes, os one may have observed In reading the many books about them, are usually very human, even when they are denizens of the wild. "When they are domestic creatures—that is, creatures which hacrot domestic scenes, whether man v*iD or not— their humanity is'emphasized. So already series to which the first two titles in the list below belong, there has been an autobiographic book about a very human rat and one about an equally human dog—both books excellent reading. Now fellow two more volumes. One is about a cat, the very type of domesticity and re-I*orted human to the point of being womanly also. The other celebrates ^a black bear, who, in spite of his habitation remote from man, seems to the eye which does not wear Thompson-Seton glasses much more human than bearish. This statement fS far Trom fmplylng that the story of the cat's life by her imagined self or the story of the bear’s life by his imagined self, is dull. Quite otherwise. Both are marked by an evident knowledge of human traits, foibles, tricks, and a humorous appreciation of real values. Not ODly so, but Miss Hunt has quite evidently kept cats and observed their ways lovingly, and Mr, Robinson, one guesses. Is not Ignorant of bears- He has met quite possibly his automobile-coated hero at bome In his beirshlp’s own place.
Mr. Robinson’s book is really the story of a black bear from cubhood through a vigorous youth and middle age to his declining years, spent in a cage in a zoological garden* Miss Hunt’s book, as befits the symbolical value of the house-woman's companion. Is not so much the story of a cat as the cat's story of the women folk with whom she lived, and whose sentimental attitude toward herself she Inwardly despised while she endured it for the sake of the loaves and fishes. Of' course, it Is a story for girls, as the bear story ts a story for boye; rather tame boys, perhaps, and* of course.
It deals with a cat and hnr family of kittens and with Auntie May, who is still young, and a love affair of Auntie’s. To be sure. Miss Hunt, who has evidently, in spite of her love for cats, a robust sense of humor, arranges it so that the youns man who loves Auntie May shall hate cats—hate them so that the very presence of one in the room makes him frantic. And Auntie May, when It comes to the test, prefers her man to her cats.	*
The scheme of the feline autobiography involves a description of the coming of a litter of kittens to a handsome a««I petted Persian, and the tale of th*' bringing up ! of the interesting raraliy un->r the joint management of the mother and the mistress. One of the kittens is the autobiographer, There is a little girl and a sick sister, and a visit to a country bonse and | a trip as far as Paris to enlarge the scene.
The bear lives in the western regions of north America, and leads what It is the mode to call " the simple life.*’ He has ; adventures with forest fires, fights with 1 other bears, and becomes aequMnt-ed with ;
men in mining camps. After he has brought up a family or soveral families , | he Is trapped and caged and becomes fat I and a philosopher. -	I
I For the stories of the greyhound, the donkey, and the monkey, theue three ar-s | made in America as the others In the tight little Island across the sea—and are ! presumably attempts at utilizing the ' same idea. They are, however, lacking in 1 the qualities which give the English autobiographies charm. Tn the first place the authors have not the same literary skill. In the second place they seem to lack the ' sure knowledge of human nature and U*ast habits which vivify the work of Miss Hunt and Mr. Robinson. In the third place the sentimental aspects of the thing are allowt*d to overgrow everything I else like rank weeds. “ Pup " Is a dog noi rightly doggish, set among humans who seem to have been born in what our persecuted youth knew as “Sunday School books." Tlie same ly true of Neddy, the , donkey, who way brought up In a gnul ! rich family and ran away, only to be stolen by a cruel ped<31«t\ Worse Is trUO of *' Yoppy,” (how else with such a name!) the monkey, who was trapped in his native Sou Lit America and thereof ut was by turns a musician's pampered pet and an organ grinder's assistant In Amer-iCL.

Briefly, tho first two "books are good reading and wholesome; the second three poor reading and unwholesome. It la all a matter of knowing how.
