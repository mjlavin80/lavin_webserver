Aaron Martin Crane’s Boole—A. Manuscript Edition of Thoreau— Some Late Poetry.
1GHT and Wrong In Think-ing*,f by Mr. A.Lron Martin Crane, to be published by Messrs, Lee & Shepard in a few weeks, begins by considering the effects of bodily art ion, intentional or not in- ! tei.tional, upon the mind, and Che mutual relation of mind and body, and then proceeds to the more serious matter of con-trilling both mind and bofly. whether by simple inaction or by the substitution of a new activity. The " worry habit," Its lessons, and the method of overcoming it, occupy much space, and hypnotism Is set in its proper light. The story is more than once used to convey a lesson, and the entire book is. -written so forcibly that the reader feels that ha shall live with more comfort for himself and greater profit to his fellows if he heed its suggestion.

The Manuscript Edition of Thoreau, of which Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co.. will issue fiOO signed and numbered twenty-volume sets, takes its name from the page of Thoreau’s manuscript bound in every set_ Its illustrations are to be actual photographs, with frontispieces In water color, and the binding is to be three-quarter French levant. The device of inserting a page of author's manuscript in a book w,is received with much favor In the case of Emerson, but the number of persons who fancied that “ Manuscript Edition " meant an edition in manuscript was surprisingly large.
Messrs. Houghton, MiTfiin & Co, have added a new department to their book roOm, beginning with a group of this season's books bound in morocco from designs by Mr. Philip Dana Mason, who is now In charge of the fine binding department at Riverside. " In Our Convent Days** in nuns gray; “The Life and Death of Cardinal Wolsfcy ” in red; " The Hotel de Rambouillet ” in old blue, pi! curiously tooled in gold, hardly seem the same books as those in the pretty, modest cloth of the ordinary edition, and please those who do not lik^e being compelled f.p buy an old book when fain to make a,-sumptuous gift.	^	'

The new Beacon Biography. Mr. Thomas Sergeant Perry’s 11 John Fiske,’* is one
-	of the brst', if not the best in the series, thanks partly to the author's skill, but even more to the homogeneousness of Fiske’s life. Other men have more or less diversions or foibles; make a merit of having “ a vocation, an -avocation, and a third.1' Fiske worked, and that was almost his whole story. Moreover, his extraordinary frankness and independence set him apart from the misunderstandings and entanglements that occupy so much space in most lives, and this adds to the
extraordinary unity of the book. Thu other volumes are faceted gems; this Is a pearl. Good as it is, it will hardly increase the steady demand for the historian's. work, for that rests upon a solid foundation, but (t is worthy of a place
beside it. Tho Beacon Biographies, It will be remembered, are published by Messrs. Small & Maynard. '

A somewhat droll proof of the dominance of the spirit of reconciliation appears in the open declaration that much
of the’material for the statements In regard t6'‘American Tories In Nova Scotia, published in “Amy in Acadia,” came from family papers and letters belonging
V	to the author, Miss Helen Leah Reed, who, although born in Annapolis, Nova Scott^fis of unmixed American blood, her ancestors on both sides having lef,t “these colonies'* rather than takev.up arma against their Kln£. Fifty years ago such an admission would have in-: 3ured the sale 6t the book;. how? even'

“ Ramona " Is In its third Pasadena edition, and Mr. Seth IC. Humphrey's “ The Indian Dispossessed M Is selling Ear more rapidly than a serious book is expected to sell in the holidays. This is true of Judge Noyes's “American Railroad Rates,’* with Its plan for Federal regulation. published by Messrs. Little, Brown & Co., and ** President Roosevelt's Railroad Policy/' the Economic Club addresses issued in book form by Messrs. Ginn & Co., but every exchange editor knows that whereas sports, society, and even religion have their stated times* railways, like death, “ have all seasons for their own."

If one Kiys, “ Here Is a new poet,” the scoffers cbme from East and West and from Beverly-by-the-Depot, each one pro-clafining, '* By-my definition, which is the one and only, this is no poet at all," and so one is brought to confusion, and therefore all that shall be said of a tiny book just'published by Mr. Alfred Bartlett is that its author. Miss Sara Hamilton Birchall, can sing. The title of this group of some twenty pieces of verse is “ The Book of the Singing Winds," and some are songs of the woodland, some are songs of the sea, and some are songs of haunting, of the thought that lurks just beyond the limit of perfect definition, but every one sings, as he who tries to read them without rhythm will find. One wonders what will come to the little book and hopes good things for it.
More than one New York name appears on Mr. Richard G.. Badger's holiday list of verse.

Whiffen, are the work of New York teachers.
