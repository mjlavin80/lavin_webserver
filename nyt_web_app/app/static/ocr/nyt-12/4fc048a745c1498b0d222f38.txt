Bellini’s “ La Sonnambulawas produced at the Metropolitan Opera House last evening for tho first time in fourteen years. . It brought to the opera house a very largo audience, because - it wa3 the opportunity to hear Mme. Sembrich and Mr. Carueo and Mr. Plangon in music that demands the wonderful sort of vocalization that they almost alone are able to present in ltf$ greatest perfection in these latter days. Their singing was greatly enjoyed.	j
The opera is one that has of late years completely dropped’out of the repertory o? living music, but it brings bock to an older generation the great singers not so 1 very long ago. In it Mme. Sembrich appeared when the Metropolitan was first opened twenty-two years ago, and she first revealed the magic of her voice and ritylC,
It was last hea*d there in 1SJU, when Marie Van Zandt sang the heroine’s part; b^ut it has been heard since then in New^ York, for at Mapleson's last disastrous season fit the Academy of Music* La Sonnambula *’ wag one of the beacon lights that conducted him to final collapse. But, then, he had no Sembrich,
no Caruso—his principal singers were a Mme. Huguet and a Mr. Betti,
“ La , Somnambula " is an extremely gentle opera tb ears attuned to the musical and dramatic pungencies of the modern Ita.li.an school. It flows serenely and
mellifluously without seriously running the surface, even, of tho emotions or the sympathies, and without violating any of the suave conventionalities of it3 kind, j Its music has very little connection with] any of the doings' upon the stage, which
are £rroUD«<i to give opportunity for its
proper course* ft® the flings* in th<? proper Italian opora should be.
There aro songs and duets of the loveliest treacle sweetnesB, and these Mme. Semtrich, M*. Caruso, and Mr. PlahQon sing- with the most delightful finish and charm.- All these three singers were in their best estate and they made the faded tunes i’low tike silvery streams. Mme. Sembrlch’s voice was of its most velvety 1 smoothness. Some of her upper notes were here and there a bit unsteady, • but such legato and sustained power as she showed axe now the possession of a dwindling- few.
Her Amina has grace and “ sensibility ”
and charm. Mr. Caruso’s peasants are all one type, and his ISIvlno does not depart from ft. He sang most beautifully all through the opera. He showed a marvelously smooth and pure mezza voce in the first act; his opportunity for mock heroics came later, but he did not indulge eyen here in till the excesses of sentiment and expression that it seems hard for him to keep away from. Mr, Planqon sang the music of Count Rodolpho In his most polished style; and as such it was good to hear. Into .this trio of euphonious voices Mme. Jomelli’s acidulated soprano voice came,with a certain intrusion.
