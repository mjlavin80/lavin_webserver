In one of the reviews of " Tha Gara-bler,” by Katherine Cecil Thurston, reference Js made to the flnaJ *J tragedy,** meaning tho drowning of Larry.
Having road “The Gambler” ag It appeared as a serial In Harper’s Weekly, I thought it possible X had missed a number, for I could recall no such catastrophe. But on examination I find In Chap-* i ter 43 this incident. Glodagh has just re-coived “the first letter from Gore—th.a ! letter she had been waiting for.*’ She turned and looked at Larry, her face radiant once more.'* Then she gives him a message to Burke, and that is the last reference to Larry. 4 , Doea the novel in hook form differ from the serial? I trust some one will inform ! me.	ATjTCE	V. WILSON1.
