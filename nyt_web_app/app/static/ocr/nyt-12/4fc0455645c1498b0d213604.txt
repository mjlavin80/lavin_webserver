A rtr 1'orfc Times Saturday Review of Boolta?
It miglit be interesting to your readers to know that, the late Mr. H. W. McVIck-ar’s book “ Reptiles," just published and reviewed in these columns last week, ia the first story he had ever written, although his genius for drawing had been well known for many years.
His health was very poor, and his am-bitlpn was to retire from business, and while traveHng about in search of a climate thf^t suited' him, to be able to improve his time by writing and illustrating his own stories. He had a marvelous courage and perseverance in all things, but. alas! was not spared even to correct the proofs of his first attempt.
A FRIEND.
