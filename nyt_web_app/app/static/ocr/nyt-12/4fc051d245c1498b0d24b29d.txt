Hew Tori: Times Saturday Ilevicio of Books:
In Richard Butler Glaenzer*s very interesting communication on Oscar Wilde he seems to think a good deal of Oscar
*	Wilde's worth was from the fact of his being an Irishman.
I think Mr. Glaenzer is mistaken, for the following reasons:
-	The lawyer who prosecuted Oscar Wilde was an Irishman, while hia friends on ail sides were English. They were the English who booiAcd him and made him " Oscar Wilde.” His English friends
■	stood by him in his hour of trial, the English who contributed to his comfort in his last days, and it was an Englishman who paid his funeral expenses.	,
This was the usual course of Irish genius. No Irishman, with the solitary exception of Edmund BurKe, ever practically supported it. In fact. Goldsmith himself says in his Memoirs that he had written over a hundred letters to Ireland and had. never. had one reply.
If not for Oscar Wilde at all, the son of “ Splranza ” should at least have had the sympathy of the Irish people.
