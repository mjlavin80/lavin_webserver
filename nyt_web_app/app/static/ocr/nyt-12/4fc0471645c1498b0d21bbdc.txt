German Liberty.
Xlcw York Times Saturday JCcvictc of Buuks:
I have just read witli great pleasure Mr. Wolf von Schierbrands review of Poultney Bigelow's fourth volume of " Th© History of the German Struggle for Liberty," and wish to add something relating to the flight from Berlin in 1S4S of the Prince of Prussia, later Emperor William I., a story which as a boy I had from tho mouth of one of the two brothers who assisted the Prince. My informant was Mr. Alexander von SchleJnltz, then Governor (President) of the District or Bromberg. Province of Posen, my father being a member of the Privy Council-
Mr. von Sehleinitz and his elder brother, later Minister of the Imperial Household, were well known and liked in Berlin In 1&4S, and when the Prince was in dangler they resolved to help him away, The danger may be imagines when I repeat a popular street song- of tho day, saying:
m Kom me doch, kom me doch, Prinz Yon Preussen,
Wir wollen Dich mit Steinen schmeissen, Kom me auch nach Berlin.
(Come, come. Prince of Prussia, We’ll hit you with stones.
Come to Berlin.)”
The brothers von Schleinitz persuaded tho Prince and the Princess to dress themselves as plainly as possible, come to the rear entrance of the princely palace in their carriage—the livery of the Schieinltzes was well known and passed everywhere—one driving, the other as footman, and with their passengers drove to Spajidau, about five miles trom Berlin, a railway station on the road to Hamburg.
Poultney Bigelow is mistaken about the bread called Commisbrod. This is bought from the soldiers, to whom it is furnished, by many a well-to-do and even rich household, as a piquant luxury.
B.	PET? NOW.
