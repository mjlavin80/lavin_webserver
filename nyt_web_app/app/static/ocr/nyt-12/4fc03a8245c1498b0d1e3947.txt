DME Ume ago the Professors of Literature in the University of Warsaw attacked the local novelists with accusations that, with the exception of Sienkiewicz, they had produced nothing new. Sien-kiewicz, however, instantly disclaimed the unique praise, and pointed to Waclaw Gasiorowski as a living denial of the professors' censure. The most recent and famous novel of this hitherto— to foreigners—almost unknown writer has^ been translated into English by Count dc Soissons, and is. appearing this week front tho Duttons with the title " Napoleon’s Love Story."	.
As probably cvory^ GttHlorowHki’d one at all acquainted Novel on with Polish history Walewska. may surmise, the author finds his subject in the romantic relations between Panl Walewska and Napoleon. Ever since stories began to accumulate around this epl- : sode in the life of the beautiful Polish lady the always entertaining and attractive phase has been that she was forccd to sacrifice herself, impelled by the patriotic Inspiration that through her influence with the 11 Little Corporal ” her native land might be saved. Gasiorowski takes a different view. Through his pen the heroine is a frail, fair, proud creature who believes herself the possessor of dominating intellectual qualities which she docs not have. Her domestic life bc-' ing uncongenial, she becomes a ready tool "or the Warsaw Court, which Is also mistaken as to her ability. She does not, however, take the irrevocable step unwarned of her certain failure. The story is written in a rapid, somewhat spasmodic style, and there are plenty of dramatic scenes both in dialogue and action.

Ilallam Murray new volume of wain	ter color sketches,
India and Ceylon, made along the
** highways of a fascinating land," Indja and Ceylon, A. H. Ha 11am Murray, the artist and author of "On the Old Road Through France to Florence,” &c., has attempted to " recall pleasant memories to those who have already fallen under the spell of its potent charm,” and also to awaken ip the minds of others " the determination to become better acquainted ‘-with the great empire In the East.” Mr. Murray has especially tried to give " typical views of typical placos,” an J, although not neglecting
striking scenes and buildings, ^c.f he has paid , particular attention to the plctur-esque side of travel in India. Speaking’of the effect of this “ Highroad of Empire,'’ tl>e author says in his preface:
The appeal which India makes Is as many-sided as It is universal and. Irresistible. with its glorious architecture," 'Its
unique landscapes, Its rich historic associations, and above ail Its .-strangely Interesting people. whose customs and character have :ome down unaltered through the centuries, and are now submitted to i he impact of new Ideas and neWifondi-tiony, to. them doubtless in great part incomprehensible. The effect of this col-I llslon of new and old, of Eitst and"West,
is partially hidden from us by the appar-
c*nt indifference of a. calm .demeanor, which at once conceals the tremendous capacity for passion that glows beneath an impassive surface and heightens the mystery that surrounds a fascinating people.	* .	.	.

about to appear in this country through Longmans, Green & Co. In one volume under the title, “ A Staff Officer’s Scrap Book,** written during- the war, and representing the H facts as they appeared to the First Japanese Ai^ny while the wounded still lay bleeding upon the stricken field." '
There are Impressions of the Japanese *Army, Its leaders, some acquaintances, the march from Tokio to the Yalu, the battle of the Yalu, an account of a visit from the Chinese General, entertainments for the attaches, and " snap shots ” and Impressions and opinions of other battles In which the *First Army engaged 'and Hamilton’ witnessed. The earlier portion of the book contains some opinions of the Japanese Generals, and the author says of Oyama:
When first I met the Marquis Oyama
*	• * I experienced a sensation of relief at having at last struck what seemed to be a point of resemblance between our own well-tried, no-damned-merlt system, and the method of filling the very highest appointments in Japan. I .confess, in fact, that the great Marquis' Impressed me rather as .**trSs grand seigneur of the Satsuma clan, with many widespread connections 'in political power, than as one who* would even for moment pretend to
,bc„. an .exceptionally studious,, scientific

Ideal Chief- ot Staff, with all. the energies,..aptitude. and experiences , which , should-be Implied by that nigh title, there ~js riosort of :doubt that^he does * possess ’ some of the -very Tlirrerentr-butequally
valuable qualifications for a command. Ordinarily, nothing puts "him out of temper, but when he does^ get angry he frightens every one. * * * In action Marquis Oyama Is singularly imperturbable even for a Japanese,
The volume is. fully illustrated with scenes of the war, plans, and maps. It may be added that it has been written in the form of a diary.
Under th.> title,
England in the " The Empire and the „ Eyes	Century/*	E.	P. Dut-
of Englishmen, ton & Co. are about
to issue a volume of essays on British imperial “ problems and possibilities ” by various writers, with nn introduction by Charles Sydney Goldman, authqr of " With Gen. Frcnch and the Cavalry in South Africd," and a poem by Rudyard Kipling, called " The Heritage.'1 The purpose of the book is sot forth in the introduction.
Tha present volume is intended to give,
within the compass of a single book, tho current views of representative men anrl women upon those spccial departments of Imperial development with which they are severally qualified to deal. Its purpore Is to give an authoritative account of the British Empire, as it appeared to contemporaries at this particular moment of its history. * * * The one link of connection is that ail are believers in constructive imperialism. In their view of the empire they represent the revolt from the old unfruitful attitude of apathy, ignorance, and vague sentimentality. They dcsin to see a self-conscious community rather than a collection of indeterminate atoms. They believe that • * * the administration of an empire is as much a spierice as any other branch of politics, and therefore demands exact knowledge and serious reflection.'

This is the title of a
“The Work volume by Prof. Arthur of S. -Hoyt of the Auburn
Preaching-.” Theological Seminary, which the 'Macmillan Company Is shortly to publish. While setting forth the opinions of preachers and writers on the various .topics *he discusses, the author also makes an attempt at interpreting " preaching as a living message.’*	’
Preaching fhe says] must be a living voice; like any other form of public speech, it must be sensitive to the* life of the age. The active, practical spirit of the age. the scientific temper seeking for deeper realities, have made men impatient of the. stately and formal correctness of the plder sermon and critical Of any fixed form of the schools, asking for directness and helpfulness, and, above all, the personal note in preaching. * • • It is right, therefore, that an effort Should be made to voice the best pulpit life of to-day; to study and express its ideals and principles of effective speech.
The book has been -written for the use of the student as well as the theologian. It treats of the importance and Ideal of preaching, the preparation for preaching, and the different parts of a sermon, preaching with manuscript, “ extemporaneous " preaching, the elements of effective speaking, &c.
