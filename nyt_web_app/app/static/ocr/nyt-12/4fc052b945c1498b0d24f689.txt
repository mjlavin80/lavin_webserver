NDER the title ** The Companionship
of Lfooks and other Papers " (Put
mini's) there have been collected into a hook a large number of miscellaneous essays from the pen of Frederic Rowland Marvin. The author confesses that the various writings have little or no relation to each other and have been conipf s**d at odd timc3. Some of them, he adtix, have already been published- Some idea of how unrelated the papers really arc may bo gathered when you learn that In one of thorn the author reproaches Stevenson fur his •‘brutal"’ letter about Father Damien and the Rev. Dr. Charles McEvcn Hyde, in the next he writes of modern builders of air castles, (Frances and Sylvia Wright. John Cleves Symmes,
the Brook Farm enthusiasts, and others.) in the next about Persian Hafiz, and *m tin* next about the tomb of Abelard and Heloise.
Mr. Marvin is full of wonder at fatev-enson for finding in Father Damien a man with all the grime and paltriness of mankind, but a saint and hero all thG more for that"; and while he does not accuse R. L. S. of being an " actual hypo-critp " he does say that it would be impossible for a man of " calm mind to “ exalt over the clean and orderly home of the missionary, the pigsty in which iie declares he found the leper priest.’
But Mr. Marvin writes also of Paolo and Francesca—retells their tragic tale; he writes of Dante, of Dante's *' Three Indies,” of the catholicity of culture of forgotten American poets, of art and lire, of the modern view of death, of success, of the religious significance of precious stones, of stat?e fright, of clear spiritual atmosphere, of Bismarck's contempt ror the Parisians, of riddles and enigmas-
It is a frightful hodgepodge of subjects, but one may find a number of things oi more or less curious interest in the heterogeneous mass. The hook is meant for persons of idle <vnd discursivB mind, or course.
