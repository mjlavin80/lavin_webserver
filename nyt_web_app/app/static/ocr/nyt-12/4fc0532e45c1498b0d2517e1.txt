CAROLYN WELLS is likeiy to be as successful with her new Satire Anthology as she was with her Nonsense and Parody Anthologies. Her new volume ts a, very clever compilation, covering a vast deal of ground and containing, if not nil tbe satire that one
might have a right to expcct, certainly more than are brought together in any other collection.
A short Introduction is an essay on satire, wherein Miss Wells discusses the nature of satirical poetry. She says:
It is often asked why wc have no satire at the present day. One reason is doubtless to be found in the acceleration of tho Pace of life; fads and foibles follow one another so quickly that we have time neither to write nor read satiric disquisitions upon them. Another reason liet> In the fact that we have achieved a broader and more tolerant human outlook. Again, the true satirist must be
ftossessed of earnestness and sincerity. It <* a question whether the mental atmosphere of the twentieth century lends to stimulate and foster ihese qualities. These explanations, however, seem to apply to American writers more especially than to Rnglish. The leisurely thinking Briton, with his more personal viewpoint, has produced and even now producing satires marked by strength. honesty, and literary value. But America la not entirely unrepresented.	.
l*owelI, who has been dead more than j fourteen years, is mentioned to show ! that America is turning out #ood satires; and his "Fable for Critics" and his " Pious Editor's Creed " are selected for like purpose—and both were printed first more than sixty-five years ago! We fear that Miss Wclis “wrote sarcastic" or satirical. We think the fact is that it ip ea-*iW-r to gather the British satires of the day than to find the Amerijan. In iSngland, one need search in only half a dozen papers; Punch, one or two papers like The Sphere or The Spear, and keep an occasional eye on the literary papers. Here, on (he contrary, there are as many satirists as there arc cartoonists; and every paper has one or. the other, and many of them are turning out satire every bit its good ;ts the best of the modern English. No; not quite so food-for much too much of it is written in what is known as dialect, though no man above, on, or below the earth ever used It In con vernation.
Apart from this matter of nationality in satirical writing, we are much pleased with Miss Wells’s book and its introductory essay. She mutilates Nothing to Wear," however, without even a dash to show that it is Incomplete; she leaves out Swinburne’s famous parodies on f.x other* poets and on himself—did she use them in the Parody Anthology? She leaves out Goldsmith's “Retaliation**; was it too familiar? Bret Harte, too. is unrepresented. On the other hand, she has dru*vn on some unexpected writers for unexpected pieces—not that tho writers were unknown as satirists, but that one hardly ldoks for new faccs in an anthology; he liis to be content as a rule with authors a$ second hand from earlier anthologies. So we find F, C. Burnand represented by " Uis 'art was true to Poll." anil W. S. Gilbert, with selections from his operas rather than his Bab ballads, only one cf which fs drawn on, and James Jeffrey Roche, with his " The V-A-S-E." Punch is used one*. rvnd---Ur° very little at all; yet not so long ago, to name but one, there v/us-a capital poem on the dinners of society and the people who attended them.
But it is ungracious to find fault where there’Is so much of good. We are elacf to get the anthology as it stands; we hope for another volume as well ag for I more parodies and nonsense verses.
