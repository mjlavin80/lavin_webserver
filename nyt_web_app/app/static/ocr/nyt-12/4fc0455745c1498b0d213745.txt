“ Tin* sU.ry of Cambridge," by the Rev. Dr. Charles W. Stubbs, jDoan of Ely, is being published by the Macmillan Company in th*- Mediaeval Town Series, with illustrations by Herbert Railton. Apart from telling the history’of tho colleges in this English town, the author writes in his preface, it has been possible for him " to do little more than to disengage the leading lines of academic history and to marK tho influences and tendencies which seem most to have governed the results
as we sco them in the uroversity life of to-dav." While looking out for details, he ha's kept *‘ an open oye for picturesque and an open ear for humorous '* material. References and stories, &c., are also told bC some of the &rcat men connected witla Cambridge town a ad its colleges.
