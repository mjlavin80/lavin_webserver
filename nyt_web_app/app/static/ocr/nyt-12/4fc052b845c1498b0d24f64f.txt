IT Is good news that henceforth the American Jewish Tear Book is to be a permanent annual publication,
; along with Whitaker's Almanack, the World Almanac, and the Almanac de Gotha. Heretofore it has been Issued | merely from year to year, but hereafter It takes its place with the other annuals named, among equally noble brethren. The report of the Jewish Publication Society, wlilch publishes the Year Book, remarks very justly: “ The value of these books will be more and more appreciated a3 time goes on, and they will assume importance in historical perspective.” The seven volumes thus far issued contain an immense amount of information regarding the Jews both abroad and in the United States, and their value Is certain to increase.
The seventh volume contains the usual calendars, an appreciative article on Fenfna Moise, the poetess; a very full and useful biographical list of Jewish communal workers in the United States, and a further list of rabbis and cantors; a list, with addresses and officers, of national organizations of Jews in this country, and many statistics of the Jews here; statistics of their numbers, of their literary activity, of their appointments and honors In the public service, of their gifts and beotifists. An unusual chapter is a list by William Popper of " One Hundred Available Books in English on Palestine,*’ which is of considerable value to any student. The book’s field is that of the Jewish race In the United States, and any one who has eyes to see and ears to hear knows how wide the field of its activity is, and how full any book that covers it must be.
