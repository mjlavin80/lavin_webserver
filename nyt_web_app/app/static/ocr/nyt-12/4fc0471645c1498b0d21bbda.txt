A'ugsburgt. and the University of Freiburg, and later went lo Ingoldstadt, following his friend Xohann Eck. He was‘preacher In the Cathedral -of .Regensburg, and took part (it seems)
, In persecuting- the Jews. At this period t he veas somewhat extreme as a ritualist, but in no 'long time at Waldshut begah to Adrift toward tho newer views. He
“began to confer with the Swiss reformer Swingli*. and presently went quite beyond Swingii and- befcame one -of the sect . whom their enemies named Anabaptists, or Rebaptiiers. Ho taught at Waldshut and at Schaffhauscn tilt he was driven thence by the Archduke of Austria, and after that labored with other Anabaptists in Nikolsburg in Moravia. Bttf thjfr Austrian power pursued Jilin even there; he was arrested, taken to Vienna, tried for treason and heresy, antT In due season burned at the stake, (March 10, 1528.) The story of his life, bound up as it is with theological questions, has nothing In It; except its tragic end, of very human interest. * Like other * reforming priests, he married a woman who, after his death had a great atone tied. about "her neck and was cast into the Danube.
