New York Times Saturday Review of Books:
Those here letters signed Lenox and Newport give me a pain; any cne would think from the fuss made over 'em that th© writers was read swells. Ain't it plain that their poso de nyms was taken to convey that impression? Tho on© feels better because what Mrs. Wharton says is only* too true, while the other pretends to be real mad at having: his set misrepresented. I*U wager neither of ’em has ever sat in a par tear box atthe opra. As one who sits in one of ’em-odd Fridays and has the honor to be well acquainted with the Trcnors, the George Dorsets, and even the Brys and Rosedale, who ain’t quite first class even yet, lot me say—though I hate to give away my friends—that Mrs. Wharton is quite correct. Her book ain’t In the same class with Thackaray’s or George Eliot’s, but she has the up to date society novelists beaten to a frazzle. The only criticism I can make is that she would have been fairer to the smart set if she had run in a few pure, high-minded, cultured representatives lik^ me»ywho are doing our best to discourage bridge and make the ladies stop smoking cigarettes.
