Xew York Timca Saturday Hcrietc of Hoote:
Mr. Arthur Henry is a sort o( composite of Stevenson, Thoreau, Emerson, and Jacob Riis. The chief charm of his " Lodgings in Town ” is in its little glimpses of Now York life and character. The walk from the ferry, the story of the Scotch collie, and various other bits are delightful. He has the faculty—which many novelists lack—of picturing- individuals, in the fewest possible words, so vividly that tho reader longs to know more of them.
I admire Mr. Hcjiry's books, but I think he should label his facts from his fiction. On Page 20^ he states that he consumed eighty'cords of wood in one season at his " house in the woods." Farmers tell* me that the burning of even ono-third of that amount would be a simple impossibility. Almost as impossible is the forced march, “ barefooted and in nigh I attire,” through miles of forest, on that freezing night of the fire. There are other seemingly “ impossible happenings.” Can it be that there is no Nancy—that she has never existed? If so. the designating of a certain well-known *' skyscraper " in one of the excellent illustrations of the book as the one “ in which Nancy's typewriting office was located " is a stroke of genius. Abts, I am afraid there is more than one fairy tale in ** Lodgings in Town." C. P. A.
