TJI1S is a volume of lives of tin* good New England womnn whose mrraory for the most part Is rhfrlshwd ehicfly In Now JCngrland. In -ivrfting' about them, thorefire, the author atFumcs a frankly New HJngrland point of view, judges men, women, and things by New l*3ngiand standards, and takes all his saints seri-
ously. Yet in writing about Margaret Fuller he seems at times Quito human. To be sure, even there the mark of tho theologieal bias is not to be missed, but it ia plain that Mr. Beach ?s aware that the interest of that singular wonrui lies not wholly in her soul.
The list of Daughters of the Puritans includes, besides Margaret Fuller, who is the only one of them with any human shortcoming apparent to this biographer, Catherine Maria Sedgwick, Mary Lovell Ware, Lydia Marla Child, Dorothea Lynde Dix, Harriet Beecher Stowe, aud Louisa Mary Alcott. For the last three, of course, the limits of fame are not by any means the limits of New England, but the author dwells not the less in these c:lsc« upon the aspects which are distinctive of that reg-ion. As a matter of fact, no one of the women except Miss Dix had a life, by count of things lived, interesting Lo any but familiar and loving friends—un-tjer which designation here, no doubt, all good New Englanders of the old 3chool would come—and these sketches deal not merely with the writings of the subjects, but very closely with personal and familiar matters—with the things a faithful and kindly New England pastor, !r one may venture a guess, talks about to the guod women of his flock, the gossip of persons of pure and serious minds on edification and philanthropy bent.
This is not to otame DUt to describe, so that the reader who has no sentimental attachment to Puritans, their daughters, or doctrines may know when he tabes up this book that it is not intended for such as he; so that, on the other hand, the reader who feels the pr!de of the Puritan heritage, loves the color of the Now England atmosphere, though perhaps he has long cea-sed to live In It, may know that this book is intended for him—or, rather, her. For the general reader the atmosphere of humanitarian sentiment (that cf a past age) will be a little too thick for
comfort. It wiil i.o* rciid’ir the ctvrai_mal-ity of Margirr-t Puller or tho experiences of Dorothy	dull, hut ft will l<-ave the
Other-”—^-s persons —quit« dim and cold. Anil \v*- k*:«\v t!:;U ly their t ri* ndd ' they were not so.
