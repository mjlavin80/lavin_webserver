IE Christmas output ot calendars Is nke any other annually rcoccurrfng artistic and literary enterprise—the old fav-Orltes-are-retained arid a special effort*is made tO-36t new tastes, attract new sentiments! to meet new desires by- Itinova* tlon. New native artists are somewhat backward' this year, and there are tfd startling Improvements to bo noted' in local lithography or in the three-color process’.. The color work of - Bavarian $hops still remains- tjneqnalcd in richness of-hue, solidity and consistency of Inks, and in masterly registering1, while among American Illustrators all the old favor-Ites—Christy, F. D. Bedford, R. P. Out- j cault, Marla Kirk; Alice Mar, and others- j are represented by calendars or portfolios of seasonable drawings ‘to which
*
almanac'pa dfe may be attached.
The calendars and booklets bearing1 the Imprint of 15;; P. Dutton & Co. have, As usual, a large representation of American and foreign artistic designs, most of which have been executed at the Bavarian shops. Th^se Christmas and New Year tokens range through almost every conceivable form—enveloped cards and boards, arrangements of folding or suspended leaves, cards, and boards, booklets In covers, boxed and unboxed* together with the usual pad calendar, pictorial or literary, backed by boards, of various emblems of 'form and pictorial or artistic effect. .
Among the favorites which the Duttons issue this year with almanac date for 1806 are their " Venetian ” (00 cents) and "Old Masters’** (50 cents to f!.50) calendars, the latter strong In beautiful reproductions from Fra Angelico, Raphael, and Michelangelo, in a variety of designs. New calendars conspicuous for brilliant coloring are the *' Kainbbw," (€0 cents.) Consisting of a series of seven country scenes, each crossed by the heavenly arch and symbolizing the prismatic colors, printed on heavy cards with embossed floral designs; the “ Sunshine,” consisting of three highly 'decorative panels. with loaves on tho centre one. which
is flanked by chaste female figures robed in purple, gold, pea green, and pints;* M A Hunting Calendar/’ ($’2.50.) with six paintings in color, (1G by 14 inches*) by F, A. Stuart, after old English colored engraving work, but depicting modern scenes and Hg-un?s_'<The Meet, “Going to Covert,"
*' In at the Death,” &c.—all portrayed with, fine action and natural surroundings. There is also a finely pictured and decorated set of attached leaves entitled “Aesop's Fables," (CO cents,) by George Washington Aesop, who gives a. new tvnd
phtireiy.Jaodern Interpretation to some pf the natural history episodes selected.,to . point ‘"morals by the old Greek- “ The Prudent Tiger,*‘ “ The Kind-Hearted Elephant/’ and other delightful caricatures of fhe ancient Aesop’s imagination rev«a* through their new '* morals,” in picture and story, how things actually happen m the real” animal world of to-day where the lion forgets, the dog keeps his bones in spite of his shadow, and where the raven doesn't eat cheese or is eVen flatterer! into IcUing fall what he does eat.
The writings of both Bishop Brooks and
Shakcapture furnish material for entirely new settings. ** The Phillips Brooks Calendar " ($1.25) consists of thirteen handsomely embossed cards, each bearing ap- \ proprlate selections from tho great preacher’s sermons. The over leaf has a striking sunburst design with snow flowers below and evergreen above. “ Gems from Shakespeare " ($1.20) is made up of large cards with proper quotations and designs hung from cords. The upper leaf, through its design of six graceful female figures, symbolizes the specific character of the citations to be found within—Truth, I-ove, Merry, Poetry, Music, and Flowers,
A new " Nature Calendar" (50 et_-nts> has a pad of daily leaves, -with quotations, fastened upon a pictured board, upon the reverse of which may be found convenient almanac information—moons and tides, changes of time, church days, postage regulations, and other data convenient to h ive at one’s desk. There is also a variety of " Poets* " calendars in this form.
The booklets in box or envelope (23 to HO cents) are as dainty as ever in variety | r,f color and charm of design. Old poetical favorites like 11 The Village Blacksmith " and “Abide with Me” (50 ccnt>*) arc, in illustration and page decoration, most excellent mechanical adaptations of, hand illuminating. One set of little 32mos entitled “Fa:th." “Hope,” "Love." "Happiness,” Friendship,*’ (2D ccnts,) &c.. has vellum covers, with holly, mistletoe, and violet designs.
In a neat gray box, with ancient and modern municipal seals in red, comes the ** New York Histuric and Picturesque " calendar, (A. Wessels & Co.) Within are twenty-odd folio sheets on which reproductions of ancient sites from prints and engravings alternate with pho- | tographs of the modern towering city taken by George P. Hail, tho calendar
proper being on the latter sheets^- A certain ingenuity has been.displa.yod In bringing about a^relatlon between -the engravings. and the photographs—the former arc clean-cut printings from - new plates and the latter show half-tope-rcpro-ductlon of photography at its best. On the opening sheets are several pictures of
the approach to Manhattan as it was In the sixteenth century, while the calendar figures'of January are crowned with a broad view of. the Brooklyn BridgS covering about the same sea view. The Stadt Huys in 1602 is followed by a picture of the modem City Hall; a view of the shopping centre (Greeley Square) os It was In 1640 la followed by a picture of Herald Square, and so on. Aside from its convenience as a record of dates, this calendar Is a portfolio of pictures which relates an interesting pictorial story of
civic, social, and commercial development In the Empire City. Another calendar from the same publisher is one inspired by the teachings of Charles Wagner, " The Simple Lire Calendar," ($1.) On grained paper representing linen fabric, we have Inclosed In desighs of old-fashioned garden flowers, an array of appropriate texts rrom Mr. Wagner's " routn " and •* Courage."
As usual this year we have the " Good Citizen’s Calendar,” (Flushing, N. Y.: M. A. Cock. net,) edited by Mrs. Edwin A. Goodridge and issued by the Good Citizenship League. The general design is similar to that of last year—decorated cards suspended by rings from a wand and bearing timely quotations from the writings of those who have distinguished themselves a3 “ good citlscns.” The opening card has a poem entitled ** The New Tear ’* from the pen of Dinah Mulock CraJk.
One of the largest and most artistic calendars for the new year is a series of reproductions from oils by Sarah G. Stillwell (Charles Scribner’s Sons) on huge sheets of crepe pdper, (24 by 14 inches.) ir is u splendid example of lithography. The first sheet contains a large picture of a child’s head; then follow scenes from child life—bedtime, on the shore, among the flowers, and finally there is the little girl in the woods, with wide staring eyes, and arms filled with wild flowers, ail in radiant colors well set off by a background of sombre greens and browns,
Agnes Greene Foster has compiled and classified a number of liiblequotationsrepresenting Promises, Commands, Admonitions, and Answers, which are presented in the form of a *' Bible Mosaic." (San Francisco: Paul Elder & Co. Bound In Strathmore Japan cover, 50 cents; In flexible suedr, ¥1.153 net,) Into one little booklet :-.re gathered all the Promises of the Bible, classified into premises of Comfort, of Love, of Supply, of Safety, &c.; Commands, Admonitions, and Answers are classified in the same way. The text is printed on Japan duplex paper, with decorations in delicate tints. Each booklet has a frontispiece on Japan yelium.
THER.K is a certain artistic and material unity observed In the calendars Issued by Fox, Duffield & O-o^ which ts both pleasing and convenient. With the exception of the large and elaborate " Girl's Calendar," (f2.60,) there are two eat-fa of sljnilar set tings and forms, For exompio, the " Canterbury Calendar ’* ($1.23) and " Babes In Toyland " ($1) consist of six leaves, each with cover hung on a silk cord, having, respectively, scenes Trom Chaucer* a poetical tales, by Walter
Appleton Clark, and colored pictures nf child life, by iiJthel Franklin Betts. The former’s pictures are mural in design and rich in elemental colors; the latter’s are *oft in delicate greens and old rose Then comes a “ Wagner " and " St. Francis '* calendar—the former composed of twelve rubricated designs symbolic of a doaen Wagner operas and showing the motif of eacn; the latter made up of selections of the writings of St. Francis, inclosed in borders of fanciful designs in black, gold, and red, with large red and gold Initial
letters, both by Marion C. Bridgman,
These are all in boxes, while two in envelopes are "The Poets’ Calendar,*' by Harry Smith, i^j ) and "The Omar Calendar," designed by Austin Smith, i75 cents,) ooui made up of six sheets on a card. Harry Smith's calendar contains selections from ShaKeapeare, Thomas Nash, Marvel, G. PeeJe, Herrick, and Campion, each sheet with an appropriate initial letter and border designs illustrative of the months. The Omar calendar Is made up of twelve stanzas of the Persian poem set in designs of a Persian character, printed on Japan paper in two colors. ** The Girl’s Calendar ” mentioned is made up ot four sheets and a cover, upon which are pasted at the two upper corners some new pictures of the American girl, reproduced In the original colors from the paintings of Thomas Mitchell Peirce. The first picture shows tne girl alone in evening attire, while the four following it present her at the Cour seasons of the year. An attractive part of
tnrs calendar is that the pictures can easily be taken out and framed.
An unusually attractive.out-of-doors calendar Is offered by Ginn & Co. From the Lotus Prera of 140 West Twenty-third Street, New York City, comes a dainty block calendar in box. with flyleaf and back in rich Bordeaux card. The title sufficiently describes its character, ** Good Cheer for the New Year—Optimistic Quotations, Thoughts, and Sentiments, for Kvery Day."
