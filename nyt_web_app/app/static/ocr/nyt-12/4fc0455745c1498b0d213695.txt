Hew York Timt* Saturday Review of Books:
TEXT which seems peculiarly adapted to the fierce contest^ waged between " Lenox “ and " NewportM la this:
“ A soft answer turneth away jvrath, but grievous words stir up anger.” I have Just read " Newport's *’	“	peaceful	response	"—ft
moat excellent axticLfe. Ha.d it been writ*-
ten first 1 should never have been moved to my choleric communication—" but grievous words stir up anger ”—and I considered the first attack " grievous.” Now, however, “ tho wrath has been turned away ” by reading the last nyra-ber of Tna New, York Times book Review, for “ Newport ” has expressed his sentiments In a way which 1 thoroughly understand, even if. I do not agree. It seems to me that " The House of
Mirth “ is a great book, or I should never havo taken up the cudgels. There/Vfas a man once. who had a talent and hid it in the earth. I am grateful to Mrs. Wharton that she has not done the same, for It. Is a rare possession. When things liave come to such a pass in “ society" that they are even preached against from the pulpit. I think it is of considerable moment to the “ masses ’* and tne " American people " that they should .not be allowed to continue Ulus. Mrs. Wharton from peculiar circumstances of birth and surroundings is better qualified than any other writer of American fiction to describe this condition of society which exists, and that she has the ability to do 30 no one will question. The financial world has been subjected to a “ housecleaning ” lately, and why not the social? The only way to do it, however painful, is to show things up as they exist. The criticism that there are*no characters to admire in the book and that there are many in society is true tn part Uly Bart's father, about whom little is said, we remember leaves her as an inheritance the best in her nature—that which saves her from going wrong* She is not a character destitute of charm, and she stands out, as in relief, against the background of others of her “ set/1 for she has what they in their dullness lack, ** a vague diffusion of refinement and good taste,*' whicfh gives her an " Idealizing touch-’’ She would have been completely saved if Seldcn had not failed her tho third time, (Page 5^7^ and she had not one person in the course of her life about whom she could say, like Nettie#, the poor working girl; ** 1 knew he knew about me.”
That is Why Lily Bart did not become a fine woman, for she had the possibilities. Selden was, unfortunately, like many good people about whom nothing wrong can be said, " weak." Gerty Parish could not Influence a society from which she was excluded by poverty, which barred thfe door. The directors of institutions (generally the wealthiest members) have had to be examined publicly in order that the masses should not suffer. The so-called four hundred M by reason of their wealth, and therefore influence, (for it entails great obligations,) should be made aware of their responsibility which they so lightly use. That is why, I think, ** The House of Mirth " Was written not to excite interest in its scandals, or to drag tho skeleton from the closeL ** Society embraces but a very small portion of the American people/’ but Its notoriety is widespread, and it is right that those whom the press, and through its medium the masses, ignorantly worship. ** should be declared unto them.”	LENOX.
