SIX QUEENS.
Martin Hume’s Boole About Henry VI11. and His Wives—A New Edition of Pollard’s Fine Book.*
ARTIN HUME In this new volume about the lives of the wives	of the eighth Henry	of England La no mere
collector of scandal matrimonial. He has a theory of his own, quite as tenable as most theories, and he arranges the facts to fit that theory, Henry, according to Mr. Hume, ~ is not the fareeetng statesman, sternly resolved to free his country from tho yoke of Rome,” that some have accounted	him.	He la	“ rather a weak,
vain,	boastful	man,	the plaything of
his passions, which were artfully made use of by rival parties to forward religious and political ends in the struggle of giants that ended In the Reformation." Mr Hume repudiates thus the thoughtless view of " each of the six wives as an isolated phenomenon that had by chance attracted the desire of a lascivious despot, and in her turn bad been deposed when his eye had fallen, equally fortuitously, upon another woman." " I hope to show," the author says, ** how each of the wives in turn was but an Instrument of politicians intended to sway the King on one side or another." -The politicians, of course, were the astute Ferdinand and Isabel of Spain, Cardinal Wolsey, Thomas Cromwell, Charles V.. Francis I., the Duke of Norfolk, Bishop Gardiner, and others less important.
Hent*y's prime characteristic, in Mr. Hume’s opinion, throughout is ** flabbiness." Out* author does not hesitate to brand the great Tudor monarch as a moral and physical coward, a bully, and a windbag. He loved, like all the Tudors, like his daughter Elizabeth, to stand well with the common people; he needed always some strong man to lean upon, and at the proper moment use as scapegoat; he had infinite capacity for posing to himself as a most moral, ill-used man.

II. HOME admits that as a young man Henry was “ a cultured gentleman of headstrong but not un-lovnble charactcr." In the beginning he was " a kind and courteous husband, not more immoral than othftr men of his age and station, a father whose Ioyc for his children was intense." But his character deteriorated as the “ ecclesiastical and moral restraints that influenced him were gradually cast aside.*’ To use Mr. Hume’s own summary at the end of the book:
In his own eyes he was a. deeply wronged and ill-used man when Katharine of Aragon refused to surrender her position as his wife, after twenty years of wedlock, and appealed to forces outside of ISngland to aid her In supporting her claim. It was a rebellious, a cruel, a wicked thing for her and her friends to stand in the way of his tender conscience and of his laudable and natural desire to be succeeded on the throne by a son of his own. Similarly, It seemed very hard upon him that all Europe, and most of his own country, should be threateningly against him for the sake of Anne Boleyn, for whom ho had already sacrificed and suffered so much, and particularly as she was shrewish and had brought him no son. He really was a most ill-used man. and It was a providential Instance of divine justice that Cromwell in the nick of time, when the situation had become unendurable and Jane Seymour’s prudish charms were most elusive, should fortunately discover that Anne was unworthy to be Henry’s wife, and Cranmer should decide that she never had been his wife, rt was not his fault, moreover, that Anne of Cleves s physical qualities had repelled him. A wicked and ungenerous trick had been played upon him. His trustful Ingenuousness had been betrayed by flatterers, at the Instance of a knavish Minister, who, not content with bringing him a large, unsympathetic Dutch
vrow for a wife, had pledged him to an
alliance with a lot of insignificant vassal Princes In rebellion against greater sovereigns who were his own peers. It was a just decree of heaven that the righteous wisdom of Gardiner and Norfolk should enable it to be demonstrated clearly that tho good King had once more been deceived ana that Anne and the policy she stood for could be repudiated at the'same time without opprobrium or wrongdoing. Again, how relentless was the persecution of the powers of evil aga'nst the obe*e invalid of fifty who married, in ignorance of her immoral past, a Mtjht-livcd beauty of seventeen, and was undeceived when her frivolity began to pail upon him by those whoee political and religious views might benefit by the disgrace *>f tho party that had placed Katharine Howard by the King’s side ns his wii'o. That the girl Queen should lose her head lor lack of virtue before her marriage and lack of prudence after it was, of course, quite just and in accordance wittL the law of the land—for all that Hfinjy did was strictly legal—but it was heartrending that a good husband should suffer the distress of having on^e believed in so unworthy a wife. Still! Katharine Howard was not sacrificed in vain; for although the Catholic policy she represented suffered no check, the i Kind's sad bereavement left him in th~ matrimonial market and enhanced his price us a*i ally, for much of the fjtrre depended upon the wife and the party

THE Henry thus sketched Is, In Mr. Hume's view, the key to all the history of the reign—only allowing for the situation in which the schemings of the elder Henry and the sovereigns of Castile and Aragon left him. They, for reasons of state, married a boy to Catharine of Aragon, his brother’s widow, a noble and heroic but obstinate lady, whose charms were fading when Henry was in his prime, and who, moreover, had failed to provide him with a male heir.
Tho politicians, playing upon Henry’s UXoriousness, did the rest.
First the* enemies of Wolsey put forward Anne Boleyn—who was herself no mean politician—then, when Anne forgot to be politic and failed also In providing a Prince of Wales, her enemies schooled demure Jane Seymour in the art of charming a King, and In due time, when Jane’s game had worked, provided convenient means for getting rid of Anne. Jane did her duty, but died of neglect in the midst of the heedless enthusiasm over the heir she had provided. Then Cromwell overreached himself with his plan . for a Protestant alliance with Anne of Cleves to bait the royal beast. For his obese majesty, repelled by Anne's Dutch largeness and rudeness of physique, fled to pretty Catharine Howard, a girl who had been scandalously ill brought up, and was used as a tool by her powerful relatives. Even Mr. Hume shows sympathy for her sad fate. Perhaps Henry chose Catharine Parr for himself—but she was '* politically the least Important of the six."

THE facts, as Mr. Hume arranges and selects them, support his theory very !	well, the narrative as he tells It is
certainly Interesting to an extreme degree. but one cannot avoid the feeling that the author leaves out of account (or at least out of view) a good many deep-lying causes for the change of religion In England. Mr. Hume conveys the Impression that about all that was done in Henry's time In the way of breaking with Rome was tho work of Thomas Cromwell. When the Pope was obstinate about Katharine’S divorce, ambitious Cromwell was
bold enough (as Wolsey had not been) to help himself up by coming to the King's rescue with a short and simple solution of the royal troubles. Cromwell cut the tie which linked England to the Papacy. The nobles let him because they shared in the spoil of the monasteries—but Mr. Hume gives no hint that the slate of public opinion was more or less ripe for divorce anyhow. He Is clear that as to doctrine and forms, barring matters ol Papal interference in England, Henry died a good Catholic and left his people, pretty generally, good Catholics,
As to the wives, Mr. Hume seems to judge them all with charity except Anne Boleyn, whom he makes a very heartless cat. He has most to say of Catharine of Aragon, whose reign was longest and whose political value greatest, perhaps, and he makes all the figures quite human and real, and conveys very definite impressions of them as women. In spite of his pains to exhibit them at large as counters in a game.
Altogether the book is one which supplies the reader with a plenty of ideas and impressions, though there are times when one gets lost in the maxes of tho game Mr. Hume is exposing, and wonders jf the game Is all really there.

THE survey of Henry VIII.’s reign by A. F. Pollard, M* A., a second edition of which Is jtfst issued, offers to the reader whoso interest in the subject has been reawakened by Mr. Hume's book another view of bluff King Hal and another interpretation of the same facts. This book, of course, does not pretend to look at the King solely as a matrimonial pawn; it takes into account the influences neither feminine nor high political which entered into the determination of the career of the second Tudor. Supposing, which is quite possible, that the matrimonio-politlcal key does not quite unlock the true Henry, supposing that the flabby Henry of the six wives Is not all of Henry the King—which is more than likely—you may care to renew your knowledge of his other aspects by the help of Mr. Pollard’s book. How: ever, as that work is not new, we shall not go deeply into It here, merely saying that it is a careful and able narrative of one of the most vital periods of English history.
