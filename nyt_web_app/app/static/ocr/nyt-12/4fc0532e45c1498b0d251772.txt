EANIE GOULD LINCOLN’S new story M A Javelin of Fate." (Houghton, Mifflin,) has for its scene Baltimore and its neighborhood toward the close of the civfi war. and for its incidenfs the usual hazardous adventures that befall the heroes and heroines of civil war stories, in this rase enhanced by the frankly melodramatic secre;s and plottings of a mysterious person from Amsterdam, who sterns to havo a groat deal to do in the story, and yet could bo left out without upsetting very much the doings of the other characters. Tlie same might be said of almost all the rest of the people in the book, since they appear and disappear by ones or twos and carry on their own little separate parts of the narrative 'with apparently only the loosest cohnec-tion with what should be the main interest of the plot—viz*, the fate marked out for the ** mysterious person" twenty years before the story begins. For some reason the reader keeps forgetting that that is the main interest in-*the necessity for keeping track of so many minor ones.
The besr that can be said of 4‘ A Javelin of Fata " is that it contains all the materials of aVgood story, but they have not been well put together. The characters are interesting, every one of them, and thoroughly alive; the various scenes are led up to and described wJth force and vigor; a distinct picture is presented, as the events follow one another, of the way iifo went on In a Southern city in those anxious days, but there Is no one thing that binds them all together and forms their climax. As a fact, one is much more interested in the romance of the little Confederate' bloc&dde runner*, Champe Randolph* and her Union lover, Capt Phillipse, than In the long drawn-out vengeaiicp of Idrs^ yjanslttart that finally missed fire and descended on her own deserving head. If (?tfainpe is truthful portrayal of thp l5|nd,^. of girls who were Baltimore ielleX’jji 1SG5, it ia no wonder that her particular brand of. belleshlp .has been famous' ever since In. jsfcng and'Vo'm&rice;t,JShe i
