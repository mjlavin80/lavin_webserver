HE only indefinite thing | about Mr. Bliss Carman’s new volume of essays, i
“ The Poetry of Life/’ Is | its title. It is not. as one might Infer, a nebulous piece of moralizing upon- the beauties of life and the poetry therein, but a concrete, hard-hitting discussion of poetry itself in Its relation to modern life and the commonwealth; a book, indeed, in which the whole attitude of contemporary life toward art, not poetry alone, is examined and a penetrating study given to the causes of its general disregard— one had almost said disrepute—among us.
Few books of permanent interest possess also the quality of timeliness, a claim which may be made for Mr. Carman’s volume. Its value is permanent by reason of the broadly comprehensive treatment which he has given to the subject of poetry in its larger aspects, and it is timely by virtue of the indifforenco of this commercialized period of ours not only to the fine arts as a whole, but to their practical use in the ethics of living. Such a volume, then, as this, considering in turn the j purpose of poetry, how to judge it, the distaste for it on the part of some, its rewards, permanence, place of the poet ; in our own day, and its outlook for the morrow, should have a wide influence | in restoring one of the greatest of the arts to its rightful place; for it is one thing to be apathetic, merely, toward an art such as poetry, another to blight It with smiling tolerance. When the j mood of the time makes of its poets I apologists and demands a justification ! of poetry itself, tho creative conditions , are scarcely favorable, and it is an | open question whether the age is un- i friendly to poetry because no great ! poets are singing, or whether no great ] poets are singing because of the unfriendliness of the age.
Mr. Carman considers both sides of the question In cogent, well-knit arguments, which, unhappily, space forbids ua to follow. The point of view is individual and not without Its challenge to discussion, as when he holds the moral obliquity of the time responsible for the fact that America is producing for the most part that which is mediocre in art. Mr. Carman regards poetry in its ideal nature as the expression of beauty, sincerity, and elation. Of beauty first, because "*the beauty of the world so outreaches and overcomes all its ugliness, is so much more prevalent and vital and persistent.'* Of sincerity, because one’s art is his representation of himself to the world, "and any deliberate failure to represent him faithfully is as monstrous and unnatural as it would be for a man to disavow his own flesh and bones." 5o trenchant, indeed, are Mr. Carman’s strictures upon affectation In art that their reading would be a wholesome rebuke to the horde of poHasters who have learned the trick of word and form but have nothing to offer of significance to their time, or, rather, who are so concnrned with prettiness— beauty is too big a word—as to forget that poetry has greater ends.
Mr. Carman by no means hits in judgment upon his fellows, but speaks of art in its broadest sense when he says that “ insincerity in life may be mean and despicable and indicate a petty nature, but in art insincerity is death/' ltf>r does lie inveigh against the beauty of technique, wiihout which ; no art can exist, but against adorning the altar and forgetting tlie god. To I be an artist t-no must live, must have , something more than fancy to offer his ; eager, questioning **ige. " I cannot be; lieve,” says Mr. Carman, M that any great prophet or poet ever trod the j earth who did not know the pinch of life at first hand, its actual bleak necessity, its terrible pathos and tremendous joy. its wonderful yet elusive significance."
i The inspirational quality in poetry, which Mr. Carman terms “elation," is rightly made the end to which beauty
and sincerity are the means, though he interprets the term broadly, showing that great tragedy belongs also to the poetry of elation, because it “ leaves some exit for the distraught, Indomitable spirit,** whereas much of modem tragedy falsifies life by ending in hopeless finality. Poetry upon death, too, should possess this power, as the 14 Book of Heavenly Death/’ recently selected and published from the work of Whitman, a great, buoyant, splendid chant, lifting one into joy and acquiescence.
Mr. Carman traces the course of the poetry that survives, and points out that the ages discard all that does not make for strength, hope, and light; since that alone which can help the spirit of man on his difficult trail, will
he make use of: that only, to him, Is good. He lays, indeed, great stress upon the ethics of art, and if one impression remains more strongly than another from the reading of the book it is of the burden laid upon all art, and especially poetry, to do more than delight the senses. Unless its material be all that pertains to life—aspiration, strife, defeat, the thousand ideals and emotions of our complex nature—the poet has failed of the highest, however his numbers enchant you. One brings away, indeed, from the reading of Mr, Carman's book, not only a heightened sense of the joy and completeness of life and the practical office of the arts in effecting this completeness, but much that he has taken as his own in the way of spiritual stimulus and quickened ideals; for " The Poetry of Life " is a book to use as a spiritual mentor and frierrd, a book into which , a philosophy has entered that leaves one nobler than it found him.
In style Mr. Carman's volume Is lucid and direct, with a certain thoughtful, unhasting note, though one misses, to a I large degt’ee, the magic of word, the freshness, delicacy, and color which imbue his verse. I am not sure but he is at his best as a critic; the chapter upon Swinburne comes near to saying a final word upon him, so does it cut to the quick in its analysis, and yet with what poise and justice! It is a catholic sympathy, too, that can pass from Swinburne to Riley, and give the measure of letters to his “ untarnished spirit of kindliness toward this great, foolish, distracted world or extend Us fine balance of discrimination to Longfellow, discharging the debt of one’s youth and defining with equal fairness his relation to one’s maturity.
There is room for Mr. Carman as a critic, if these exigent days compel him more and more to forsake poetry, as he Intimates in that half-serious, half-whimsical “ Letter to the Lyric Muse from an Imaginary Correspondent,” a bit of self-revelation which leaves one both glad and sad; glad in its avowal of the personal delights of art, sad that modern conditions make necessary other avowals which the chapter contains. Personal reserve is so fine a barrier that the most delicate taste will overstep it nt times, and it is this violation alone which prevents Mr. Carman's letter to the muse from taking its place as an exquisite bit of literature. This criticism, however, is not arbitrary, and is but the exception that proves the rule in the general distinction of his volume.	J- R*
