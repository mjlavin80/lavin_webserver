Nac York Times Saturday Review of Boohs:
Apropos of truthful local color fiction, may a " down East ” reader call atten- j tion to the quaint truthfulness of the j character In Holman P. Day’s recently published novel, “Squire Fhln"? The remark of a friend that the story “ Is a standard, and not equaled by anything offered to readers,” ia a fair reflection of " aown'East” opinion of Mr. Day's btiok, .which-has fairly captured the State of ; Maine, as it doubtjess will other sections. With a prophet so honored In his own country, it Is somewhat annoying to find 'a New York reviewer Commenting upon this, easterly “ David Harum ’* as not true to life* , May not those who live tho life and know the people be the better judges?
