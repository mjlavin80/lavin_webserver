An Attractive Assemblage of New Fairy Tales and Volnmes for Very Utile Folks.
VIII.
GOOD fairy story is “The Wizards of Ryetown/' by j A. Constance Smedley and j X* A. Talbot, illustrated by Anjrusine MacGregor, (Henry Holt & Co., $U».) However nice short stories are there is a pleasure in one long story that runs through from one interesting chapter to the other, and that is what I this one .does. It is the story of a clcar littlQ, Princess Lavender, who lives In a | lavender garden and sleeps in a yew tree, j and of an equally nice Prince Robin, who has a golden armor and a heart of gold,
I loo, the Prince Lavender finds later. In a crown of gold Prince Robin has tucked a -sprig''of lavender to show the Princess that he Is coming back to her and she must wait for him.
That is what she intends to da until the white h^t wakens her with a little verse, which? tells her that the river will take her to the Prince. The river urges i her to jump In, and, being a Princes:*. she ! Is able to swim through the black cavc and on and on unlil she comes to Ryelown. That is where the Prince is, and where ! wicked Julia and the Judge are in the 1 castle. There Is the bewitched forest, and any number of things that are also ! bowltchcd, and little Prinress Lavender I only escapes being put in a dungeon because she is a Princess and brave and cheerful ar.d good. There is the page: | who turns out to be the Prince, the overthrow of the wicked Julia, and finally the new castle, where the Prince Robin and the Princess lavender live as King and Queen, and everything is as nice as K possibly can be. There are any number of little black and white pictures in the text and a full-page frontispiece.	!
Something quite new tn the way of a book Is “Football Grandma; an Auto-baby-ography as Told by Tony." edited I by Carolyn S. Chann’.ng, with an introduction by Tho:r,as Wentworth Jliggln* I son, (Small, Maynard & Co., Boston.) '1 he auto-baby-ography of Tuny begins with tho dai* of his birth and continues through I the long years until he Is half patt three, I stating In regular order all the important events that have occurred. Football Grandma Is a very nice kind of a relative, who loves to play with children any same that they may like, heneo the name, 1 though Tony alwaj s calls Football Grandma " Nana," which is much easier to say. There are stories about the way Tony i went to sleep and the way he did not go to sleep; the things he had to eat and *;he things he did not have; the trips to the beach, about Baby Bess, the good times with “ Nana," and with all this the verses that “ Nana ” writes tn irrprovc the j story. There are the pictures, too, sup- i posed to have been drawn by Tony. They i are pictures of the school slat.c ord^r, but I they look 10 be very good pictures for such a small boy as Tony to have drawn even a1 half past three. That Is the age at which I the book ends, with Tony going into trotis- ! crs, and those, too, seem a lit lie advanced for so small a boy.	j
Four little books about three and a half by four and a half Inchcs In size are brought out by Cupp’.es & Leon. They arc "ay little books, with a gay picture cn cach cover, and others for the i-lustra* ^ lions. " Dolikirs's Party, and Other Stories," is by France* Ionise Heroy, There is one exciting Mnry in prnse In the book about “ Diana's Yellow Silk Waist," and the others are in rhyme ! Here is a wrvo from the parly story:	j
Hut nur £v-r:'.i hi;i I	Tut	out	A 1-grollnn.
An J vent <i't' wi.n that wnnderr.t Mar!.
And i.	.t	minute

By the same author Is " The Fu^ F.im-; tly Lmertatns," another littlr volume of I similar on'.ertainins1 prose and verse. "The 1 ii!'snd\i Mures of a Gin^c.-hread Man and ; Gthct .af(Uie.-s" is by Oliver K. Scott, who ! ali-o v.-ritc.-s M Tnmblcircs ami ‘IVd, and Other Htorlcs." Th y riin p-opo ami verse, and h^re is a sample of Hit- Inner, l which is just thi* kind the children will iike to hear read:
Sianora Fhko i,eg::n now to play Th.j line gran 1 p:../.o in her elegant Way. Un dress w.is pink sill; and 1m r frills and i In-! !>■ \vy

A fiJ ill !'!(;<• vohi'Mc i" lire same si.'re,
and is by Beatrix Puiier. (F. Warne &
Co.. .*>n eenLx.) This is u continuous story
uh in pro:-11. Th^ illvstratums are more
yrtittie and in deli^htfidiy delicate colors.
The:-'' are exec'knt pictures from p!iot0-
graphs in " The Lay <*f I he V.Yc Brown
\Vi‘«. n; A Tab- fur th|j Tattle G:.e-v hy 11.
\V, Phepheard-Walwyn, v.'im is also the
pi it te^rafh-r, (Longmans, Grcrn & Co.
$1.) Tli's is the style of the vrrse, which
is very pretty:	-
There	lived In n beuttiful 'orchard	1
. .	A snowy white hem;	l
In the	heart of a priekly thorn	bush	!
A tsny brown wren.	I
In a ne*st of feathers and hop leaves Slept the brown wren:
Snug in a straw-thatched fowl house The snowy-white hen.
Those are the caning words of the love
story between the hen and the brown
wren,-but both, In the end find that they are best suited to their own kind. There are many pictures, which follow the story carefully. Fine heavy paper fs used in the book. It is bound In quiet, paper-covered boards, ‘
V
ONGS OF THE OPEN/’ Is a large book with fine typographical work, the wo^ds of the songs by Mary Grant O'Sherldan, music by W. C. E. S^e-boeck, decorations by Enos Benjamin Comstock and George Markley Hurst, (Rand, McNally & Co.) There is much variety in the songs. The first is ** The Christ Child,*' “A Moon Child1' follows it. "Bunny Cotton Tall/* ** A Gaelic Lullaby/’ “ A Valentine,” " Songs of j Spring/’ arc others. Each page has around the music a wide marginal decoration tn light reddish brown.
For brilliant coloring and illustrations of adventures with not overmuch refine ment of style, nothing goes ahead of tho pictures of H Anmlng Adventures," drawn by Harry B. Nellson and written by S. Baring Gould, (Frederick Warne & Co., $l,r*0.) A red-nosed Jack Tar, a negro, and a Chinaman have the adventures. They are
Jack, Sambo, and little San Toy,
The mate, the cook, and the cabin boy.
They ride elephants, rhinoceros, “and turtles, catch a IcopWHl In a barrel, try the gait of a giraffe as a steed, are captured by savages, and escape of course. There are some very good pictures with strong colors in " Turvy-Topsy Rhymes *' turned and illustrated by W. Gunn Gwen-net, (Frederick Warne & Co., $1.) Here is one turvy-topsy rhyme:
Once I saw a little boy come hop, hop, hop;
So I cried, " Little boy, will, you stop, stop, stop? *'
And I put out my foot saj'lng, “ Shake, little man/*
But he took to his heels and far away he ran.
The picture to that verse la the best of all from ivn^ artistic standpoint.
"A Gay Dog” is pictured by Cecil Al-
dln, (12. P. Dutton & Co., $1.50.) It Is not
cxactly a book for the infanta, though the
bull terrier, who is the hero, takes to the
simple life at the close of the volume.
rJ!ie terrier first takes a ribbon at the
Miow and is purchased by a young man
with a “ window i:i Us eye/’ and carried
off In a hansom cab as>4L present to a
young lady. Pamroy was her name/'
the terrier explains, ** and her business
seemed to consist In changing her elothes
while I sat by and g-j irded tne door from
intruders. After eneh change a boy called her loudly and sh** rustled off leaving me
■	■lore In the dressing rofwm/’
The gay dog lunts in a drawer for chpcolates. but finds only pink und white pamt, which gets on his nnse and make's him sick. Following this he has exciting tlm-s, gets written into a play, and spoils it from make-believe stage fright, goes to Ascot, soes motorlns, and to the Henley regattas, and ends up in the country, where he tries flying, after an injudicious intimacy with a cow. After this he is left behind by his mistress to rusticate.
S*
GIDDY-GO-ROUND; A Tale of a
Wooden Horse," is a book of pretty pictures in pretty colors by Madeline Hall. The story which gives the excuse for the pictures is of a small boy named Timothy, who is sent to carry a duck to a neighbor. A duck Is not an easy thing to carry, ar.d Timothy finally tries to drive it. Driving is not much Jjetter, but when he tries to catch it the duck objects, and Timothy grows so tired that he lies down to re.n. The children he has met cn the road just before have been gi ing to the fair, and this may be why Timothy seems to join them, rides a wcouen horse, and finds all the fair people only dressed-up ducks. The inside
cover decorations are particularly good (Frtdtrick Warne & Co., KO cen'.s.)
" The Golden Goose and Other Fairy Tahs," is a new book of mystcrv stories translated from the Swedish *bv Eva Mi.rrh Tappan, (Houghton, Mifflin‘& Co., £1.) “ 7’ht* Golden Goose," which gives the name to the book, is little Rose, the beautiful dau-liter of a King, whose stepmother, aTter much crucl treatment, has turned her into the goose.
