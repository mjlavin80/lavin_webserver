ll	Further Consideration of James Rus* '1?^ sell Z^owell’s Place in Literature.
JToo York Times Saturday Itcvlac of Books:
N The Saturday Review of Books for Nov. 18 Mr. Boynton reviews Ferris Greens-lct*s blojjrapliy of James Russell Lowell. He takes as a sub-title a quotation, “ the first American man of letters." To .this title Julia Stimers on Nov. 25 takes exception, it seems to mpf' on a false assumption. I do not think this means to place Lowell above Emerson, or even above Irvins, as a man of letters,
but that both Emerson and Irving, as well as most of the writers of that time, were not in favor, or in style, essentially American.
In the Sixth Blglow Paper, " Sumlhln'
In the Pastoral Line,” Lowell says, and says truly:
Once git a smell o* musk into a draw’
An’ it clings hold like precerdents in law.
Jest so with poets; wut they’ve airly read Gits kind o’ worked into their heart an* head	,
So'st they can’t seem to write but jest on sheers
With furrin countries or played-out idecrs. Nor hev a fnilln' if it doesn’t smack O* wut some critter chose to feel way back:
This makes ’em talk o* daisies, larks, an things,
Ez though we'd nothin' here that blows an‘ wings
(Why, I'd give more for one live bobolink Than a square mile o* larks in printer’s ink.)
This makes ’em think our fust of May is May,	.
Which 'taint for all the almanacks can say.
Hawthorne has a true New England flavor, both in subject and treatment, and Emerson in his point of view is New England, but neither are broadly American. We can imagine a Carlyle with a good digestion and a serene temper, his style uninfluenced by much delving into German literature, writing Kmerson’s essays, and especially his Representative Men.” Irving, with his lucid, dignified style, Is more English than American.
We could not conceive of Lowell as anything but an American. This is especially true of his poetry, but even the scholarly quality in his critical essays has a distinctly American flavor. The conditions under which ho wrote were much more those* enjoyed by English writers than those surrounding our own, it is not given to many men of our nationality to have both tho leisure and the taste, which Lowell had, for browsing along the bypaths of literature, but in spite of these , conditions he ia American to the core. This is not a question of birth or of nationality; it is a question of type wRU
the man, and of flavor with his works. Plainfield, X. J., r>ec. 4. lnuo. s. i>. H.
