CHILDREN'S BOOKS.
A Farewell Glance at the Juveniles of 1905—Books for All Seasons.
F one does not always like the big- books written down for the little people occasionally there Is one which deserves all praise. Such a book as this is “Child Characters from Dickens,’-' retold by L.
I*. Weeden, with six colored plates and seventy half-tone illustrations, full page, text and pictures and head pieces by Arthur A. Dixon, (Ernest Nlstar, London;
E.	P. Dutton & Co., New York, §2.50.) It is a delightful book, and the pictures tell their part of the story so well that every character in the book can be told offhand. There are David Copperfield and Little Em’Iy in the colored, frontispiece, anti no one could possibly mistake them. They are sitting on an old fishing1 boat; there is the old ship house. With a thatched roof, windows and doors cut in the side, standing on the low, level shore, while beyond is the sea, with boats. There ar$ the Marchioness and Little Nell, Paul Dombey, the little doll's dressmaker, Little Dorrit, and any number of other Dickens children, ail pictured in colors or in black and white and looking exactly like themselves.
“ Men of Old Greece ” by Jennie Hall, (Little. Brown & Co. $1.50.) is another of the books that we are sometimes doubtful about, but there seems to be a great dea?l of interest in this, and there is unusual detail about the lives of such men as Leonidas, Themistocles. Phidias, and Socrates. There is a description od- the one-fetory white building in which Socrates as a small boy goes to school, the beautiful court with-its columns of rose and white and the oleanders and palms and ro&es which grow there. The story tells how the little Socrates' was taught to play on the lyre, because a man who knows nothing of music would be cruel j and ungentlemanly; how he learned to write his letters on a wax tablet, and how the schoolboys recited poetry standing always hi graceful positions, because they must have g^ace as well as a ready | tongue to make an orator. There wero 1 the gymnastics also to make the boy supple, for without a supple body he could not well manage his tongue, and the school day finishes with a bath and a rub with olive oil to ease the muscles.
It was the life of the boys of Socrates's days, the days when great men wero born, and' it makes good reading for the boys of to-day. The many pictures give an Idea of the country and the habits of the people of early Greece.
“ The Village of Hide and Seek.” by Bingham Tliobum Wilson, with full-page illustrations in color by W". Herbert Dunton, Is in the nature of a fairy story and takes two little children who have an unhappy home into the " Home tff All the Dolls.” It is a city of tiny pLayuouses ruled by the Queen of Dolls, who is—and this might be suspected—the sister of Santa Claus. Little Maud finds it such a charming place that she thinks it must be heaven, and sho asks Aunt Twaddles about it. That really brings one back to the beginning of the story, for Aunt Twaddles is in the very first chapter.
Aunt Twaddles is a funny woman who lives at the top of the mountain and who Will only speak to the children. To them She is always kind, and the candy she gives them leaves a pleasant taste in the mouth for a whole week. Aunt Twaddles is very fat and as broad as she ie long. But that is only a disguise, for she Is really the Queen of the dolls, and when a little bird drops, a golden key into her hands she opens a rocky side of the mountain and then takes again her real form. Arthur and Maud, whom she has taken with her, see all this and many other things that one must read the book to discover.
A NICE little book is- " Kristy’s Surprise Party," by Olive Thorne Mil* ler, with colored pictures by Ethel N, Farnsworth, (Houghton, Mifflin & Co. $1.23.) There are many stories in the book, but they are held together by a Single thread which gives the name to the book. Krisly is having1 a birthday, and is dressed in her prettiest white dress and blue ribbons in honor of it. She is curled up on the bamboo lounge on Aunt jJU’s broad piazza, when a host of relatives appear, and that is the surprise party. But Kristy doe3 no.t know it for some time, not until, all sitting around, they begin one at & time to tell interesting storhfe. As each one finishes a story a book in a pretty package Is put down beside Kristy. Then Kristy guesses what -it all means, and the stories are told in the book, and when they are finished there is a whole shelf full of birthday books for the little girl.
Another interesting, nattftal story Is “ The' Rainbow Bridge/* by Frances Mar-1 garet Fox, (the W. A-, Wilde Company. $1.25.) It is the history, of a dear, bright, sweet little girl and her many troubles, until finally she finds a dear father aha the very best kind pf a home.
In tho way ot a cook book Tor the children is-41 Three Little Cooks,0 by Lucy: Crump, picturesr-vcry good ones—by Ger-
trude M, Bradley. (Edward Arnold* London. $1.) Thomas, wno has a scientific mind; Ophelia, who is practical, and Heidi, who is a beauty, though only a doll, aro th*e cooks. It starts, in the beginning, when Thomas is making a volcano in a state of constant eruption, and Ophelia proposes that they roast apples in it. That is a temptation, and Thomas’s interest in science yields to the fascination of good eating. But a good, healthy volcano, even a miniature one, is overhot for apples, and they are all, with the exception of one on the edge of the crater, burned to a crisp, and Ophelia^ longs for a real stove. They get one after a time— a dear little tiled Dutch one—but it will cook. * Thomas works down the recipes to the small portions required for it, and , there are elaborate menus prepared and many dainty dishes. There is enough story and enough cooking to make it good* reading and appeUte-prqyoking.
" Little Grandmother Jo " is a nice story of little girls’ life at school a good many years ago, by Amy E. Blanchard, (George W. Jacobs & Co.) Lady Dear ”
Is a pretty story of a little mistress ot a real castle in Spain, Millicent E, Mann, (A. G. McClure: & Co. Illustrated.) “ That Preston Girl" is a larger book, with a story of another girl, a good one, with the story of her life. There is the promise of a wedllng in the end, (W. A- Wilde Company. $1.50.)	“	Mrs. Pinner’s Little
Girl," by Louise R. Baker, is the story of ' a little girl who tries to take care of her little brothers and sisters, and would rather do that than to have even ii pony and a nice little writing desk, (George W. Jacobs & Co.)
