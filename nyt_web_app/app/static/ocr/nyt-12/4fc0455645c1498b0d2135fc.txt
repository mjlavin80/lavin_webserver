THE term “ police power " is of comparatively recent introduction into American legal terminology, but it is being applied now to many subjects which ccrtainly were never imagined by the makers of the Constitution of either the United States or an individual State. In fact, there are at times noticeable attempts to make the “ general welfare ” clause of the Constitutions, under which lhe ''police power" is exerted, stretch very widely to cover exceptional cases, and, conversely, the courts have ruled eften that the term Is of particularly narrow application. The question of “ police power " is evidently unsettled. Prof. Freund of Chicago University has therefore made a distinct contribution to the study of Constitutional law in preparing a treatise on the police power of tho United States and of tho various States. His book Is important to lawyers, and if eny layman should pick it up he will find himself rewarded for reading it
What is meant by "police power"? Mr. Freund's definition strikes us as excellent; It is “ the power of promoting the public welfare by restraining the use of liberty and property/* This law of the police power is practically a growth of the last thirty or forty years, and much of it remains unsettled, but there has been so much discussion and decision as to make a summary of fesults justified.
How widely the "general welfare” clause has been stretched at times may be seen by a short study of Mr. Frgund's book. On the general matter of prohibition (meaning thereby prohibition of liquor selling and lotteries) there is little difference of opinion so far as the right of the United States or the States is concerned; but when the power is invoked to suppress oleomargarine, trading stamps, cigarette paper, (in Indiana.) the education of whites and negroes in the same, even private, schools (Kentucky) there is a decided and proper difference of opinion. Besides these points others arise; the Inter-State Commerce act and the President’s present rate regulation plan are both creations of the police power of the United States, as the law that persons shall not give exhibitions of snake eating is of that of Kansas.
*
On the other hand the police power has been restricted by decisions of the courts holding various acts unconstitutional; as the civil rights acts for the especial protection or negroes and the original package decisions. But the police power of
the Nation or the State touches us in almost everything that we do in greater or less degree. Mr. Freund Is the pioneer commentator on the subject, but his book is none the less acceptable and valuable because it is largely constructive and treats of an Important branch of the law still in process of making.
