fLFRED RUSSEL WALLACE’S two-volume autobiography, M My Life: A Record of Events and Opinions," which Dodd, Mead & Co. are about to send out after many delays, contains numerous letters and extracts from the writings of Wallace, his friends and acauaintances, Including Darwin, Huxley, Tyndall, Spencer, Dr> Richard Spruce, Mxvart, and many others. The author tells all about his literary and scientific work, his Investigations into Spiritualism, Socialism,
&c. In one part of his second volume he recounts his experiences in America during his lecture tour In the Autumn and Winter of 1SSG, when he visited New Tork, Boston, Washington, Baltimore, San Francisco, and other cities and then

ican scientists and others he met* the sights he saw, his audiences, and other things that impressed him. In closing this part of the volume he gives his opinion Of the Americans as a whole: ■
*	* * A nation formed by emigrants from several of the most energetic and intellectual nations of the Old World, for the most part driven from their homes by religious perseculion~Or political oppression, f * * the very circumstances which drove them to emigrate led to a natural selection of the most cnergetic, the most Independent, in many respects the best of their several ‘nations. • * • Hencc. when the march of invention and of science (to which they contributed their share) gave them the steamship and tho railroad; when California gave them gold and Nevada silver; * • * It is not
surprising that these conditions with such
a people should have resulted in that mad race for wealth. * * • But * * • everywhere there are indications of a deep love o: nature, a devotion to science and to literature. • * • There is also rapidly developing among them a full recognition of the failings of our common social system, and a determination to remedy it.
The two volumes are fuUy illustrated with portraits and pictures of the writer's homes, the places he visited, &c.

" Salve Venetia H Mr, Crawford’s Is the appropriate Book	title which F. Ma-
on Venice, rjon Crawford has
chosen to signify that he has done for' the City of the Lagoons what a few years ago he did for the Eternal City in ** Ave Roma Immor-talia.” The work comes from the Macmillan Company in two convenient, handsome volumes, with photogravures and drawings from the brush and pen of Joseph Pennell. The peculiarly isolated growth and development of “ The Lady of the Adriatic ” has given her, at all times, a life and culture both foreign cfcnd J Italian. Although Mr. Crawford's book does full and authoritative justice to chronology and events, It is among the latter that he selects the. significant, the artistic for rhetorical expatiation. How the subject in general has moved him to record both his impressions of the city as J It is to-day and his impressions of her dramatic history is thus set down in his own words:
Venice is the most personal of all cities in the world, the most feminine, the most comparable to a woman, the least dependent for her individuality upon her inhabitants, ancient or modern * * * In the still canals the gorgeous palaces continually gaze down upon th**lr own reflected images with calm satisfaction, and look with calm Indifference upon the changing generations of men*and women that glide upon the waters. The mists gather upon the mysterious lagoons and sink away again before the devouring light, day after day, year after Tear, century after century; and Venice is always there herself, sleeping or wakiug, laughing, weeping, dreaming, singing, or sighing, living her-own life through ages, with an intensely ifttal personality which time lias harjjly modified, and is altogether powerless to destroy.	*

The well-known Amer-Edivard	lean composer and teach-
Alexander er of music, Edward A. HncDovrc'll. MacDowell, who is seriously ill with nervous prostration and is expected by his physicians never again to compose, is the subject of the latest volume in the Living
Masters of Music Series, bearing thejm-print of the John Lane Company and^out this week. The biography is by Lawrence Gilman, who in his preface, written long prior to Mr. MacDoweil’s illness, speaks of the difficulty of writing such a book:
The difficulty of achieving a jujit appraisal of the work 'of an artist whose activity is in any sense of the word contemporary, finds recognition in a conviction which has crystallized almost into a truism. -When the subject of a critical endeavor is not alone a product of one's own time, but of one’s own country as well, the embarrassment of the situation becomes acute. The difficulty for any considerate and balanced observer do^s not Jie so much in the possibility of overvaluation as In the danger of a too cautious and grudging attitude toward excellences which In other circumstances, would be unhesitatingly acknowledged.
Mr. MacDowell is only forty-three years old, but has to his credit over *130 pieces of music, the best known including concertos in A and D minor, the “ Sonata : Tragica," and ** Sonata Clvica ” and the “ Woodland Suite," besides a number of songs. For over eight years he held the
chair of Professor of Music at Columbia University, and is now rated among the greatest composers of the day. He is of Scotch descent, and. was born in this city.
The “ Recollections ” Recollection* of William O'Brien, the
of	Irish author and Mem-
An Irishman, ber of Parliament for
-	Cork, which is appear- i
ing from the Macmillan Company, tells the story of his life from his birth in 1652 down to 1SS3, when the Parnellite movc-nyjnt was in full swing, and he entered on his political career. He writes about the Fenian Circle, the Cork press, his arrest for. so-called political offenses, his organization of the Irish National League, the beginnings of his paper, United Ireland, and his.election as Member for Miillow in 1SS3, when he was very poor in pocket as well as courage; and speaks of many well-known men of the period. Here are his first experiences with the press:
*	* * It would be impossible to give even a faint idea of the virgin raptures of i my first relations with the press. 1 ap- i proached The Herald (Cork Daily Herald) office with the same awe with which I should have entered a sanctuary.	The
powers within were equally unknown^and only less deserving of' reverence.	The
printing machine was a miracle worker, the' editor a veiled prophet to whom I hardly darsd to raise my eyes; the caba-i lisrtic signs of shorthand • • * were the privileged language of a mysterious brotherhood.
Mr. O’Brien is the author of “ When W<j, Were Boys,'* “ Ici3h Ideas," ** A Queon of Men," and numerous articles.	The
present book contains five photogravures, including portraits of the author, Parnell, Isaac Butt, Archbishop Croke, and a view of the Blackwater at Rockforest.
The fourth volume, England of . Herbert Paul's Between '	“ History of Modern '
1783 and 1SS5. England."'which the "	Macmillan company is
publishing, takes in th'e period from 1785 to 1883. It opens with the revival of the Eastern question; treats of the rising of Bulgaria’ which resulted in the war between Russia and Turkey in 1877 and the treaty of -San Stefano in the following year; Gladstone's return to ,tho Ministry "In 1880; the situation In Ireland and Egypt during the next five years; the blunders and misfortunes In the Soudan, which culminated In the loss- of Khartoum and the death of Gordon, and the waning of Gladstone's power until his Government fell In 1885. The fifth and final volumo will deal with home rulb. Speaking of the appointment of Gordon as the head of the mission to the Mahdi Mr. Paul says:
He, it was^sald ♦, • * could tamo the wild tribes, as. Rarey had tamed horses.
*	* • He could bring out the garrisons without shedding a drop of blood. When a sober, rational people like the English go mad, they go very mad, Indeed. This ** clearly supra-rational faith in an elderly engineer/' aa a keen observer called it at the time, Is a case in point, though it may in some degree be explained by the singulax^nature of the man. Gordon had not always been successful. He had failed with the' Basutos in 1SS2 and quarrelled with the Cape “Government on the occasion^. * * V In character pe ,was more like the Galahad of the Round Tablo than any other contemporary or historical person; *- * * But he*was not capable of acting under authorityr or of adhering to instructions, * . . .,	-
