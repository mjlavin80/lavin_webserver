TOPICS OF THE WEEK.
R. HOWELLS is at his subtlest in his dialogue at the club in tlie January Harper's, a report of an imaginary conversation between four or five imaginary personages, including- a painter, a novelist, and a globe trotter who has seen many things. These personages are not all new to Mr. Howells’s readers. If our memory serve, most of them took part once in an equally subtle conversation touching the supernatural, The theme in ** Braybridge'a Offer,” as Mr, Howells’s present sketch is called, is the marriage engagement of a bashful man and a timid girl. “ How did it come about ? *’ is the question before the council of the wise at the club. Kie question is not answered. The one member of the council who puts forward a coherent explanation is obviously a good-humored falsifier. We confess that **Braybridge’s Offer” would have puzzled us somewhat if we had not turned by chance to the Editor’s Study and found therein the key to the riddle kindly provided by Mr, H. M. Alden. Mr. Alden is discoursing on the need of backgrounds in stories* Incidentally he remarks that Mr. Howells’s present story is all background. The theme is “ the attitude of the modern girl in courtship." The question is left undetermined. Mr. Alden goes on to say some interesting and suggestive
things about the recent development of
the short story.
MR, HOWELLS’S subject in his Editor’s Easy Chair this month is fascinating. It appeals strongly to all victims of misfortune or disaster.
11	Was what has happened inevitable? ” is the question here. He cites Moncure D. Conway’s fixed belief that it would have been better for this country if the civil war had never been fought. From this point Mr. Howells proceeds to discuss various historical possibilities, the glory of a Benedict Arnold unvexed to treason, the triumph of a Napoleon unconquered at Waterloo, the success of Burr's Imperial designs. Is it all Pate—that is the real question, and, as yet, there is no answer, although comparatively few or us believe in fate.
THE literature of the art of acting is large, but relatively unimportant. The best descriptions of acting—such as Lamb’s delightful rhapsodies about Mrs. Jordan’s Viola and Dodd's Sir Andrew Aguecheek—convey no practical information. Nobody can suppose that Dodd, for instance, approached the character of Sir Andrew in anything like the spirit in which Charles Lamb wrote of it, from memory, many years after the performance. One thing we know is that to a new generation the acting that pleased its fathers often scem3 mannered and unnatural. To the youthful admirers of Edmund Kean the acting of John Philip Kemble was stilted and artificial. Writing with the memory of Kean strong upon him, George Henry Lewes declared that Macready*s manner was too colloquial and prosaic for the poetic
drama. William Archer's analysis of Mac ready’a acting, based on a careful examination of contemporary evidence, shows clearly that it would have been accounted labored and grotesquely unlike life in the present hour* All of which gives point to an anecdote related by Joseph Hatton in the first installment of his reminiscences of Sir Henry Irving, which begin in the January number of the Grand Magazine. At the beginning of his career, according to Mr. Hatton, Irving was Invited to meet Adelaide Sartoris, niece of John Philip Kemble, and the great Mrs. Sid dons. She asked him'to repeat for her, as he thought it ought to be delivered, Hamlet's soliloquy, " To be, or not to be? '* We quote Mr. Hatton:
She pronounced it a natural and beautiful conception, though it was in complete contrast to that of her revered father, [Charles Kemble.] In the days of the Kembles Shakespearean impersonation seemed to have been subordinated to elocutionary declamation, of which she said, “ Yes, that was fine in its way, but it was recitation/*
This, it seems to us, is a remarkable tale. That a Kemble should have pronounced the delivery of verse by a Kemble “ recitation '* is hardly credible. And was it merely “recitation ” ? Irving’s delivery of thia soliloquy, OS we remember it, was full of thought and dignity, but we doubt If it would be called “ natural ” at this time, when young actors are really afraid to try to speak verse with care for the melody and beauty of the rhythm lest they Incur the ridicule of the multitude they are bound to please.
IN the January Scribner's Mrs. Frances Hodgson Burnett finishes her two-part novelette which has served briefly as a serial since the conclusion of “ The House of Mirth.” " The Dawn of a To-Morrow ” Is violently in contrast with its predecessor. It is full of the old-fashioned ** Christmas spirit,’* spectacularly expressed. Its personages are of the theatrical slums of a long since Dickensized London. The only normal creature among them is a nervous, well-meaning curate, called by nearly all of them the " cur-ick." A knighted, prodigiously wealthy personage, troubled by symptoms of nervous prostration, who seeks the slums clad in mean garments, to end his life there in mystery, Is the protagonist. Mrs. Burnett handles this situation boldly, without apologies. She may well say of it, as Goldsmith said of the scene in Hardcastle’s dooryard in “She Stoops to Conquer": “If they will accept that, they will accept anything.*' But “The Dawn of a ToMorrow *’ is not a picture of life, or a first-hand study of actual conditions. It is a Christmas sermon, made spectacular. It is frankly sentimental. Its squalor is highly colored, and the limelight falls upon it. Its pathos is unquestionable. Doubtless many thousands of people have read it with brimming eyes.
AS already announced, Mr. Winston Spencer Chnrchiirs life of his father, Lord Randolph Churchill, will be published almost simultaneously in London and ^ew York by the Macmillans next week. The book is based on the correspondence and State documents which Lord Randolph intrusted in 1893 to the present Lord Howe and Ernest Brackett, now Lord Grimthorpe. The trustees were empowered to make any use they saw fit of the papers, except that no State document was to be printed without the consent of the rroper authorities. These papers have t»een in the possession of Mr. Churchill three years. He has also made use of ucrapbooks kept by his aunt, Lady Wimborne, containing every newspaper comment and cartoon bearing upon Lord Randolph’s daily life. The book deals largely with Lord Randolph's political life. Half of it treats of the | political crises of 18S5 and 1SSG. All I the more curious will be the publication cf the book at the very moment
i
Lord Eia-p.p.alph’s son, its author, has
conspicuously allied himself with his
father’s old enemies. For Mr. Winston
. \
: Churchill has accepted the position of I Under Secretary of State for the Colonies, under the new Liberal Govem-ment, which, if the forthcoming gen-i eral election favors the Liberals, will
1 place him in Mr. Chamberlain's old seat
i
in the House of Commons, facing the | benches that he has lately helped to 1 adorn ■
IN The Century Mr. Zangwlll has one of his'new Ghetto stories, a tale of lower east side life in Manhattan | Borough, with that hopelessly conceited but half-starved Yiddish poet, Pinchas, whom we have encountered before in Zangwill’s stories, as protagonist. The tale itself, apart from Its study—or revelation, rather—Of types in ithis out-of-the-way corner of cosmopolitan New York, is not much; but the Yiddish poet’s Idea of translating “ Hamlet " without the *' Ghost ” arrests the attention. Truly “ Hamlet ” without a visible, audible Ghost is worth thinking of. It might be visible to the Prince, to Horatio, and the officers, but not to the spectators in the theatre. The sonorous speeches might all be cut out, leaving the plot perfectly clear. Well, it will not be done, but poor Pinchas's idea is a modern idea, and not wholly discreditable. Of course, Goldwater, the Yiddish star, (would not cut out the Ghost. On the contrary, he gave him a comic song.
THE “ Hamlet m of Pinchas was claimed by him as Pinchas’s own " Hamlet.” We have before us a little volume, neatly bound in muslin covered boards, vliich is stamped on the back “ * Hen/ y Esmond,' Moore," This gives one ’tfho picks up the book a kind of shock. Have we another " Henry Esmond " ? Not at all. This is, indeed, Thackeray's ** History of Henry Esmond, Esq.,” edited for school use by Hamilton Byron Moore, of the male high school In Louisville, Ky., and published by Ginn & Co. It contains a critical and biographical intro-I duction and many pages of notes, and the lines of the text are numbered. Doubtless It will be very useful in the I study of English literature, but why put Moore after the title on the cover?
Francois xavier garneau’S (	"	Histoire	du Canada " is about
to appear in a fifth edition In Montreal. A fourth edition was pub-| lished by Messrs. Beauchemin & Valois a quarter of a century ago. Garneau i died in 1866. His son Alfred Garneau,
: lately deceased, was long preparing a new edition of the famous history. His son Mr. Hector Garneau, an advocate i of Montreal, has now taken up the task. The fifth edition will contain much new material gathered by the historian late in Iiis life, and hitherto unpublished letters from Henri Martin, Xavier Marmier. Lamartine. Rameau de St. PDre, Emile de Girardin, Francis Parkman, L. J. Papineau, Morin, Viger, Lafontaine, Etienne Parent and other distinguished men of both continents. The full title of Garneau’s famous work is *' Histoire du Canada depuis sa decouverte jusq’il nos jours.” He published also an abridgment of the history, and an account of his travels in England and France.
IN the January installment of his memoirs, in McClure’s Magazine, Carl Schurz describes his life at the University of Bonn, just before the outbreak of 1S4S. He was then strongly j under the Influence of Prof. Gottfried Kinkel, a lecturer on art, who became a leader in the revolutionary movement, and had much to do with the shaping of Schurz’s later career. When the news came of the deposition of Louis Philippe In France, young Schurz was at work on a tragedy in verse on tho subject of Ulrich von Hutten. He threw aside his pen and joined his fellows, who thronged the streets and Ec X&FS&	his tragedy
again. The students clanked their sabres and talked of liberty. The
" Marseillaise/* then the hymn of lib-
*	/
erty for all Europe, was sung in the streets. These were hours of youthful elation, but presently came news of bloodshed at Berlin. Not ail of Mr. Schurz’s memoirs, it seems, will be printed in the magazine. The passages relating to his classical studies at the gymnasium and his opinion of the value of. such studies, which will doubtless form an Interesting and edifying chapter in the book, have been unavoidably omitted from this number.
