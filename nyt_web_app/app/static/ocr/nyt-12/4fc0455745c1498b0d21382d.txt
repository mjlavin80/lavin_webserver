AN IRISH LEADER.
William O’Brien’s “ Recollections ” Reviewed from an English Point of View.*
By Arrangement with Tbe London Timea.
R. WILLIAM O'BRIEN, formerly editor of United Ireland and from time toVtime one of the many "leaders" of tho Irish Nationalists, has played many parts in his day. He has written denun-clations of his enemies, not always Unionists, in a peculiar vein of vitriolic bitterness and with a flux of words only surpassed by Mr. Sexton, once his Intimato ally and at present the object of Ilia fiercest invectives. He has now and then retired in tho sulks to his tent, but has soon reappeared on the scene. He has tried his hand at novel-writing as well as some other forms of fiction. Lately he has figured In the unwonted character of ’ a capitalist, owing to an alliance which has caused him to be nicknamcd Felix I Austin, and his command of " pecuniary resources ” is supposed to give as much uneasiness to the majority of his party, against which ho has been organizing a 1 revolt, as "the gold of Pitt ” was credited with exciting among the Jacobin " patriots" during the French Revolution. Some, perhaps, will bo disappointed to find that Mr. O’Brien’s “ Recollections ” do not come " within measurable distance *' of his present conflict with the Triumvirate,” or even of the much earlier days of Parnell’s deposition. Wo do not- get his own account of the later stages of tho campaign against Lord Spencer when weapons of calumny were employed for which no parallel Is to bo found in the annals of journalism sinco the extinction of the POre Duchessne, The heroic struggle in Tullamoro Jail for Mr. O’Brien's nether garments, his foundation of New Tipperary, his romantic voyage from Prance to Ireland with Mr. Dillon In an open boat, and many other thrilling1 episodes, are still far distant, and, if the autobiography is continued on anything like the same scale down to the present time, it bids fair to rival-ln length at least-the Memoirs of
St. Simon.
This first installment covers only the opening years of Mr. O'Brien’s political career, which he began as a journalist, and closcs with his entmncc into Parliamentary life, as member for Mallow, twenty-threo years ago. The book thus goes back to a time which may well he callcd antediluvian, for it was In tho period extending^from the formation of the Land League toward tho end of 1879 to the detection and conviction of the Phoenix Park murderers, a week or so after tho Mallow election, that the true revolutionary deluge swept over the country. Much of what happened earlier was never publicly known, and probably it would not be wise to accept the uncorroborated narrative of any of the actors as rigorously historical; much more has been forgotten or half forgotten. Unfortunately, too, Mr. O'Brien is throughout careless about dates, and the index ia of little help to anybody who wishes to follow In a serious spirit a rambling and disjointed story.
With Mr. O'Brien's early carecr we are hardly concerned. He seems to have been a man of strong family affcctions and excitable temperament, on whom sad domestic losses and ill-health, at one time apparently hopeless, wrought in a way which explains, perhaps, his least excusable fits of violence and rancor, alternating with explosions of rather mawkish sentimentality. But his political prominence dates from July, 1SS1, when Mr. Parnell as Mr. Egan, the Treasurer of the Land League, purchased a Fenian paper called The Irishman from Richard Pigott for £3,000. gave it the name of United * Ireland, and made Mr. O’Brien editor. We are told that air. Forster’s remark on reading the first number was, " Who orPearth is this new madman? ” Mr. O’Brien is proud, it would seem, of the tribute, though the aim of what he tolls us of his editorship is to get Englishmen as far as possible to forget what the work of United Ireland really was. An anthology from Mr. O'Brien's writings in his paper, even not including the later attacks on Lord Spencer and Mr. Trevelyan after 1883, woojld form a curious contrast to his picture now of tho high-minded moderation, tho generous tolerance, ^the mellow wisdom, and the practical achievement of the organ of the Land League. One or two examples must suffice here.
Mr. O’Brien complains bitterly that after the Phoenix Park murder "it became the atrocious game of our official adversaries to blacken us with the crimes of the secret conspiracies they had themselves brought into being," and he repudiates indignantly the conclusion to which Mr, Trevelyan was forced, after looking into the facts, that the articles in United Ireland were “as truly a part of the instruments of assassination as the dagger and the mask." He mentions the later

exploits of the “ Invinclblcs,” who wero soon after brought to justice—tho stabbing of Mr. Field, a Dublin shopkeeper, who had acted as a juror in a bad murder ease, and the attempt on tile life of Mr. Justice Lawson, who had presided at another murder trial. These took place In November, 1SS2, six months after Mr. 0‘Brlcn had solemn and terrible warning"’ i of the dangerous responsibility attaching to inflammatory language, in the fact that two days before {ho ghastly crime in tho Phoenix Park United Ireland had raised the cry of " Down witl) the whole bundle of rottenness and imposture,” the Castle, and denounced the '* alien officials *’ as ” toads " . and “ asps ” who should be ! swept out. Yet, just before Mr. Justice Lawson so narrowly escaped with his life, Mr. O’Brien’s paper denounced ” a jury presided over by a Judge who from the commencement of the trial to its closo did not even attempt to conceal his inde-! cent longing for a conviction,*’ while the jury of whom Mr. Field was one was branded as “ shamefully concocted,*' “ indecent ” in its ” partisanship,” accepting “ evidence on which an English jury would not hang a dog,*’ when tho word was passed to convict murderers."
! While disclaiming responsibility In gen* eral terms. Mr. O'Brien does not quote , those utterances which preceded the crimes to which ho refers. He does, however, give us one piece of interesting testimony, the text of the article M Accusing Spirits,” for which proceedings wore taken against him for “ false, mulicious, and seditious libel.” It is a string of frantic imputations against the Irish Government and the courts of law, from Lord Spencer downward, which, even now, its author seems to regard as reasonable and fair criticism. “ We desire to avoid exaggerated ]nngu:t?.T\” writes Mr. O’Brien, H for we recognize ;ha gravity of the subject and our responsibility.” There Is a touch of humm* in this—which, whether of tho conscious or unconscious type. Is not frequently met with in Mr. O’Brien’s new volume—when we read it on the same page with the denunciation of *' tribunals carefully concocted''to convict murderers by hook or crook,” and prosecutions that u bear fin Indelible taint of foul play.'*
" Packed juries and bribed witnesses are the all-sufficient implements of justice”;
“ anybody can govern with a state of siege, or win with loaded dice, or hang with unobstructed hanging machinery”;
" why hold Torqueinada accurscd because he did with hot pincers what Hie great and good Earl Spencer docs with bags of gold?” Mr. O'Brien’s disgusted amazement that the Government should have taken proceedings against tlie publication of such stuff as this reaches a high
pitch of nalveUS Beyond general statements of the lofty morality which ruled the conduct of United Ireland, a proccss analogous to that of the flattering portrait painter who gets rid of the wrinkles, Mr. O'Brien docs not help us to a knowledge of his person al attitude toward his work and his fcllow-workmen. In those days he represents himself as distinguished by a span-iellikc devotion to Parnell, -which did not last. Of his practical good sense he furnishes a delightful Illustration In his account—without a suspicion, apparently, of its grotesque absurdity~-of his magnificent plan, in the style of tho “ Tlireo Musketeers,” for putting an end to tho Irish question, by capturing Lord Spencer and his Chief Secretary, and taking them away as hostages to some remote and unnamed place, while negotiations—which Mr. O’Brien seems to have thought would ba successful—wero carried on with the Gladstone Cabinet. The coup was to he effected by winning over the men of the Dublin Metropolitan Police, who at thia moment had struck on a question of wages, and some of whom had asked Mr. O’Brien to address them. He had no doubts himself that when once he opened his lips at the police gathering he could ” raise to the highest possible pitch tho excitement with which they w'ere boiling over, and, straightway, un*lcr cover of a deputation to the Viceroy/ to inarch my thousand constables through the streets to Dublin Castle, helping ourselves to revolvers in the gunshops on the way.” When Mr. O’Brien says “ my thousand constables," he had not tho least Idea that even half a dozen'of them would follow bis lead in this ridiculous parody of Emir.el’s madcap folly in lfcOS, and, as it turned out, he knew no more about the' spirit of the Fenian gangs, whom, after consultation with Parnell, he hoped to get to assist him and the captives of his elo-auence in seizing the gates of the castle. The Impassive Parnell listened to this bold conspirator, and played with him like a trout, but did not encourage him to hope much from the Fenians. Mr. O’Brien saw leaders of the two sections of the ” Irish Republican Brotherhood,” with whom, by the way, he seems to have been In rather close touch, and was rebuffed. One leader said, In answer to the request for the assistance of fifty or a hundred Fenian stalwarts: "Yes, indeed, and get my men hurt,” white the other bluntly declined ” to give the Parliamentary agitation an advertisement.” When Mr. O'Brien came hack to his chief, whose command of his risible muscle wan certainly phenomenal, Parnell expressed no sui prise, merely observing, *' I think I’ve got time to catch my train at Harcourt -Street/' ’
