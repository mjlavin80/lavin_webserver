THE PACIFIC SLOPE.
Air. Joseph Schafer’s Important New Volume in “ The History of North America.”*
= SCHAFER is picbably better equipped than anybody, certainly as well as anybody, to write upon this subject. The New York Times Book Review has commented favorably upon a short volume of his on the Northwest, fis at once scholarly and interesting. The same is certainly true of the present work. It will disappoint neither the general reader who is looking for a good and fairly brief history of the Pacific Slope, nor the student who is after detailed information. Themis-taken policy of the editor of this History Ot North America/’ unfortunately, prevents the author from giving refer-
enccs.	'
The term Pacific Slope Includes Oregon, California, Washington, and Idaho. Mr. Schafer also deals with Alaska. Upon the ' history of this vast region there is in existence a vast amount of material. But It is scattered about in a number of libraries and partial collodions throughout the Pacific Northwest- The author says frankly that this fact *' has militated strongly against the completeness and unity of the. work." This is the first single volume, however, that can make any claim of treating the subject in a way at all adequate.

THE first known visit of white men to the western coast of what is now the United States was made in 1542 by Cabrillo, commissioned by Mendoza, Viceroy of New Spain. The tirst English claim on the Pacific was established by Drake, who coasted as far north as the southern boundary of the present State of Oregon. He took possession of the region in the name of Queen Elizabeth, calling it Albion. To Capt. Cook belongs the honor of making the first careful survey of the coast from 4S degrees to (5 degrees 48 minutes.
The cornerstone of America’s claim is Robert Gray*s discovery of the Columbia Jtlver in 37PU. Vancouver, wfio had just been co^stin^ in the vicinity, passed by the Columbia, unsuspecting its existence, and thereby missing a unique opportunity of fairly establishing Great Britain’s ciaims to the Oregon territory. Of the events following Gray’s discovery, which helped to build up the United States’s claims, tho most important were the exploration of the Columbia Valley, by Ijfcwis and Clark and the founding of Astoria. Spain slowly relinquished her claim to the coast north of 42 degrees, her final withdrawal being marked by the treaty of JSI1) with the United States. Between California and the Russian settlements in tti" trozen north, England and the United States were now face to face. From 1818 to 1S4(>, the Northwest was *' jointly occupied ” by Great Britain and the United States. In the latter year the two nations agreed upon a line of division. degrees, ond the Oregon country came finally into Our possession,

TO the colonization and early history of Oregon Mr. Schafer devotes a good deal of space. Tiic crania tic story of how the people of Oregon formed a provisional GoV( rnnient "until such time as the United States of America extend ;heir jurisdiction over us ” is ably and sympathetically told. Oregon’s colonial era terminated when Congress organized territorial government. *She entered the Union as a State In 1.S50.	n
The history of Cjilifornia may be said to begin with the founding of the mission at Snn Diego in ITO'.K Soon missionaries visited most of the coast tribes. California was.organised as a province of Mexico when the latter revolted from Spain, and a new era ’begun. A commercial policy, far more liberal than that of Ppain, threw open California’s ports to foreigners. The Mexican Government also took mo.isuie.? to promote the settlement of the country. But there was never a large emigration from M'-xico; under Mexican rule there were probably never above C.OtX) whites in California.
AMERICAN colonization of California began in a small way as early as 1N1XI, and it w:is not many years before the country began to claim serious atl. ntion in the United States. Proposals to purchase a part of it were made as early as lKIt". American immigration increased rapidly, and was viewed by Mexico with the greatest concern. The Mexican war, of course, gave the United Slates its opportunity. The treaty of Guadeloupe-Hidalgo merely recognized an accomplished fact. California was henceforth a part of the Amf-ri^n Republic, The discovery of gold and all its _far-reaching consequences are related by Mr. Shafer. The country increased so rapidly in population and importance that it was able to skip the territorial period, and

was admitted directly as a State In 1830. How the inhabitants preserved law and order is told in Chapter XVHI.
The immense region drained by the Columbia River, with a watershed of about 245,000 square miles between the Rockies and the Cascades, is known as the Inland “Empire. It differs much in character from the coast region. . Mr. Shafer takes up Its history in a chapter on Eastern expansion.
The last of our territorial acquisitions to be treated by Mr. Schafer is Alaska, or Russian America. He writes its history before as well as after 1SG7, when the United States purchased It.
There is not much of an argumentative nature with which the author has had to deal. His work is a straightforward narrative. Upon many disputed points, however, he has been abie to shed new light.
