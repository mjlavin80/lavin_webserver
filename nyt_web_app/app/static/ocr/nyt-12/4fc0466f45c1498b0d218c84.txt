EDUCATION.
I	__________
J An Hxpert’s Opinion of Prof. Paul Monroe’s Much-Discussed Book on Its History.*
Written for The New York Times Saturday Review
of books by
DR. CHARLES ELLIOTT FITCH,
Chief of the Rt'cords Division of the New York State J2dticiitk*naI Department-
late as 18GS Mr. Quick, in his preface to “ Educational Reformers,"	wrote; " On
the history of education,	not only all
good books, but all books, are in German, or some other foreign language." The latter portion, at least, of this reproach no longer obtarns. Histories of education in the English	tongue, comparatively unknown	twenty-five j
years ago, have multiplied during the period, and now form a large, and even imposing, body of literature,	much	of it of American origin-	Meanwhile, 1
chairs	of	pedagogy have been established and
courses of	instruction defined by many of our insti-
tutions of higher education till, from the first permanent foundation by Iowa University, in 1873, there were in 1902, courses varying in scope and efficiency in 247 such institutions, to say nothing of those in teachers’ colleges and normal and even secondary schools Among the textbooks utilized by these schools in the training of teachers and deriv- i ing their patronage mainly therefrom are the histories of CompayrG, (in translation,) Painter, Shoup, Kemp, and others, the respective excellences and defects of which it is not necessary, in this connection, to examine. Generally it may be said that they set forth in brief compass, with more or less distinctness, tho characteristics of the educational devices and systems of successive ages and nations, describing the curriculums and emphasizing the dominant thought of which the schools are the expression.,
with biographies of the loading educators and thinkers of their several times
Dr. Monroe's is the latest and by far the fullest and most ambitious “ textbook in the history of education "—modestly so styled—that has yet appeared. The title is. indeed, a misnomer for this volume of 800 pages, if tested by the definition as •* a book containing the leading principles or most important points of a science or branch of learning arranged in order for the use of students." Even if the last third of the work may be so designated, the preceding two-thirds—the historical portion—cannot be strictly. It is too recondite and cumbersome for the practical needs of students, and probably beyond their comprehension, It is a philosophical treatise, rather than
a textbook, and is not likely to supplant thb smaller and more superficial works which better conserve economy in method and are adapted to the capacity of students. Dr. Monroe's appeal is to scholars, investigators, well-equipped teachers—the cultured classes. He addresses a select circle. The limitation of his constituency does not, however, detract from the merit of his production. It may enhance it; and to the classes mentioned it must be of great and abiding value. It is diligent in research, copious In information, clear in analysis, philosophic in trendy and sound in deduction; and, although there are passages in it that are somewhat hard reading, occasional grammatical lapses, and a needless and sometimes wearisome repetition of certain scientific terms—that of “ content ” being conspicuous in thia regard—it is distinguished throughout for purity, precision, and force of diction.
The treatment of its theme Is the most exhaustive yet essayed by an American author. Dr. Monroe, indeed, disclaims this, but he could hardly have been more exhaustive, except by burdening his text with disquisitions upon certain writers reference to whom ho has omitted, but whose labors are really inconsequential as related to the advances either of education or learning, and by Incorporating additional quotations from the masters. But he announces his Intention later to publish a series of source books embracing these and bearing upon successive stages of educational development, that for the Greek and Roman periods having already appeared.
The plan of the work, as outlined in the preface, Is (1) to furnish a body of historical facts sufficient to give the students concrete material from which to form generalizations; (2) to suggest, chiefly by classification of this material, interpretations such as will not consist merely in unsupported generalizations; (3) to give, in some degree, a flavor of the

original souices of Information; (4) to make evident the relation between educational development and other aspects of the history of civilization: (5) to deal with education;)I tendencies rather than with men; (si) to show the connection between educational and actual work in its historical development; (7) to suggest relations with present educational work- The plan is an extensive one, and, as previously said, admirably executed.
It will be impossible, in a restricted review. to consider seriatim the various features of this plan, but there are a few that maj be noted. The fundamental proposition—that of evolution—is identical with that preferred by that accomplished scholar, Thomas Davidson, In his " History of Education," and the argument is substantially the same, although It is sustained by Dr. Monroe with much more of detail and illustration. Davidson says that ** education is conscious or involuntary evolution. Hence history of education is a record of such evolution and begins at the point where man takes himself into his own hand, so to speak, and seeks to guide his life toward an ever more definite, coherent heterogeneity, which Is ■what wa mean by his ideal end." Monroe more spL^ciflcally says:	"	The	signifi-
cance of Greek education lips in the fact that here first is found a developing conception and standard of life, consequently a conception of education which enlarges through successive periods and in which
change is tolerated and development of the individual provided for." Education, therefore, comprehends not merely the discipline and formulas of the schools, but the thought life, the spirit that per-suidcs the progress of a people, and the history of education resolves itself into the history of the world, not of battlee and sieges, the rise and tail of dynasties, but c*L its soul—the controlling genius of the nations in their respective fields of action; and its worth is in its fidelity to the olden apothegm that '* history is philosophy Leaching by examples." It is upon this broad conception of the scope and bearing of the record that Dr. Monroe proceeds, and how well he accomplishes his task may be seen in the felicity of his generalizations, some of which are here quoted. Thus of Rome:
The work of the Romans was the practical one of furnishing the means, the institutions, or the machinery for realizing there (tt e Greek) ideals. Hence they have ever been looked upon as a utilitarian people, They borrowed the Greek idea of a confederate government and developed it into a universal empire; they borrowed tht* Greek idea of law and developed it into a system of legal principles that even yet guides modern nations in their complicated life; they adopted the religion of a despised sect of a despised race and made of it the religion of the civilized world, the one by which they subdued the savage world. In all of these respects and in a multitude of less important ways the Romans showed their genius in elaborating the institutional organization necessary to make effective the aspirations of other people. If the ideals of modem life are largely drawn from. Greek and Hebrew sources, Its institutions are even more thoroughly Roman in their origin and nature.
Thus of the reciprocal effect of Greek
philosophy and Christian ethics upon the
problem of the individual and society in
the Middle Ages:
However different its solution, the problem stated and the. general principle sought was Isle] so identified with thst of the highest thought of the pagan schools tl-ut a community of Interest was immediately discovered, and a fusion of Greek philosophical thought and Christian teaching was attempted- The unknown God that the Apostle declared unto the Athenians was but a symbol of the Wtfeer-to unknown truth for which the Greek thinkers had for generations been groping.
Thus of the Renaissance:
Educationally, the Renaissance often seems to have been merely a devotion to the study of the literary classics and to the linguistic study necessary as a preparation; but this is not the heart of the matter, at least during the earlier period. The great desire was for a new life. and. in this respect, for a new education, hostile to the old dogmatic scheme of scholasticism.
Thus of the Reformation:
One other great educational influ-, mcc °f the Reformation, calling for more extended notice later, deserves mention here, namely, the establishment of systems of schools based upon the idea of universal education. Such systems of State public schools are wholly due in their origin to the Reformation. Their development and completion awaited the growth of the political idea that the welfare of the State depends upon the education of the individual citizen.
RETURNING to the main proposition that ed-ucation is conscious evolution, and noting also that in the review “ the history of retarded or frustrated development is as valuable as that of healthy or normal ones," (Davidson,) it will be seen that our author traces the progress of education, learnedly and conscientiously, in the impulses of the thought producers—in whom, according to Carlyle, 'Is the soul of the whole world’s history—with due stress upon the efforts of those who have been most efficacious in educational processes, from the animism of primitive times to the eclecticism of to-day. So he reviews the monitions of Confucius, the methods of Socratei, the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle, the activities of the schoolmen, with their monasteries and universities, the classical revival of Petrarch and Dante, the democratic inspiration of LiUther and Melanchthon, the humanitei
of Erasmus, the social realism of Montaigne, the pansophy of Comenius, the disciplinary injunctions of Locke, tho naturalism of Rousseau.
All this is of interest as revealing the expansion of thought through the centuries and the leading of the thinkerB in the advancement of the race, but its value is academic rather than practical. It is In the last six chapters that the chief practical significance of Dr. Monroe's work consists—in which also there is material that may be made serviceable-even in the schools. In these he describes the labors of the sch^lmastera proper—the famous schoolmasters, the	tne

With such conclusions “ heb^a^lJJ!s ill may not agree—markedly, in his mln-fmtzUxg the idea of discipline and macni-fvlne that of culture. The true ideii it is annrehended. is thsit of discipline “s te.'SSSST’Sf’ culture: but whether or not we are at one with him in i it is to be conceded timt his analyses of all educational tendencies are fair and well considered, leaving the practical edu-: £tor to his own deductions ami 0 tge | adoption of methods from •	* *■- thus

TO one conclusion, however, attention may property be called- It is that i	relating	to	the conflict between the
idea of education as effort and that of Interest, and is included in that already rtr i ferred to between discipline and culture.
; The conflict has been fierce and long sua-tained and Is still waged. Our author thus discriminates:	" The Interpretation of
education from the point of vierw of interest is as partial as the old interpretation of education as discipline: consequently, the present tendency Is one of reconciliation, of harmonization of interest and effort, as the basis of educational practice. This is somewhat optimistic, for tbe battle is yet on; but they who are not wholly possessed of the delusion that education should be recreation rather than training and who fear that there is a school of educators who “ would," to quote from John Stuart Mill, " train up a race of men who will be incapable of doing anything which is disagreeable to them," may thank L»r. Monroe for this intelligent differentiation:
" The problem of the schoolroom, then, is neither by authority to hold the child to the mastery of certain tasks which are uninteresting in themselves and from which his attention is withdrawn the men ment the external process is removed ana thus to develop will power and moral character; nor, on the other hand, is it the work of the school so to surround the needed activities or learning processes with factitious interests as to sugar coat the pills of schoolroom tasks.” It Is certainly due to the author to quote his understanding of the permanent problem of
education:	■-
The problem of education is to transmit to each succeeding
ments of culture and of Institutional life that has been found to be of value in the past and that additional increment of culture which the existing genemUon hM .succeeded in working out for this and also to give to each indVvldual the fullest liberty in formulating his own purposes in life and in shaping them to his own activities. •	*	• The problem
of the school is to take the material selected by the educator, to incorporate it into the life of each member ot thecom-Ing generation so as to fit him into the social life of the times, to enab e him to contribute to it and to better it, and to develop in him thai highest of all personal possessions and that essential of a life satisfactory to his fellows and happy in himself which we term character. *	*
To do this year after year with each individual of the group which falls to his or her loL is the ever-solving, but never solved, problem of education.
Which is but another way of stating the truth that education is and must over be empirical—a constant striving toward the attainment of high and yet higher ideals; and he who contributes anytnlng to further the experimental processes, either by enforcing the experience of tbe past, improving existing methods, or broadening a'”ivitles for human betterment, i» a benefactor ol his kind; and, in these regards, Dr Monroe contributes much in his enlightened and enlightening volume.

CERTAIN features of special interest in the arrangement of the book may be referred to properly. Preceding Chapters 111., IV., V., and VI.—the Greek, the Roman and early Christian, the Mediaeval and Renaissance periods—are I chronological survi vs of education therein respectively embracing political c\onts, the names of poets, dramatists, scholars, the-
olotdnns, orators. &c.. educational writings and educational events. The blbll-ograpliy at th<* close of each chapter, save the last, where none is required, is ample, and the topirM questions also, at the end of the successive chapters, are thoughtfully and widely framed. The reproductions of plaU-s. some of them celebrated, of classic and mediaeval schools and associations. with which the book is embellished, are worthy of notice. The index might be enlarged profitably. The typography is clear. It will not tire the eyes
if in'olaces, it taxes the brains of readers. il, iu yi c-IiARIjES EIjLIOTT FITCH.
