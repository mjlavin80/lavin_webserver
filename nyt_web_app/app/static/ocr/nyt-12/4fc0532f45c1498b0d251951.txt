HISTORY OF MUSIC.
The Sixth and Final Volume of the Oxford History, Written by the Late Mr, Dannreuther.*
By Arrangrcment witfi The London Times.
IiE last volume of " The Oxford History of Music" has appeared under circumstances of exceptional tragedy. The first feeling1 which It arouses is one of lasting regret that its pages have never been turned by its author, and that the pen which wrote them Is laid by. No critic can approach the discussion of its contents without an overpowering sense of responsibility and reverence. It compels both, by reason of its breadth of view end its mastery of learning and research, and in a yet higher degree because any disagreement with its method and con-elusions must remain uncontested by a brain whose critical gifts •were of the most brilliant and powerful of our day. But Dannreuther wus not made of the stuff to allow sentiment to override opinion, and as he would have welcomed lively discussion of his handiwork in his life, so he would have protested against any modification of It after his death. He spoke out himself, and would have resented bushed voices in reply. " Auf denn! an's Work/’ says Klingsor.
V	The first point which catches the eye is the concluding paragraph of Mr. Ha-dow’s prefatory note:
When the Oxford history was first planned, it appeared advisable to. end
I with Schumann, and to leave to some future historian tho more controversial topics of our own time. This view it has been found necessary to modify, and the present volume contains reference to the principal works, of whatever date, which in origin or character can be directly attributed to the Romantic movement,
I Modification is scarcely the term to apply to a drastic alteration which brings the history down to the death of Verdi In 1001, thereby necessitating a reconsideration of the title and raising serious misgivings as to its general balance of design. The title itself, “ The Romantic Period,*’ Is open to question. Music has always been in touch with romance, and did not suddenly become so at the beginning of the nineteenth century. If romance in music may be roughly defined as the influence of poetical feeling expressed in terms of sound, or, as Dann-reuther more tersely puts It, M poetical
8 suggestion by musical means,” it was not absent in aay of the periods covered by the preceding' five volumes, but grew
*	and developed side by side with the technique of the art Itself. Who can deny to Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, (witness tho slow movement of tho D major trio,) or to Schubert the highest qualities^ of romantic influence? Nor does this volume deny them. But its title bccomes thereby a misnomer, a concession, in fact, to a popular and unfounded facon de parler, for it arrogates exclusively to the nineteenth century that which Is contemporaneous with music itself. Moreover, its pages in countless instances prove that tho history is one not so much of the influence of romance as of the extravagant culture of overelaborated romance. Having- regard to the apt and fit titles of the earlier volumes, it will be obvious that the proper name of this one is 14 The Music of the Nineteenth Century this wcrald be in accordnncc with Its contents, with one most amazing exception.
The composers whose works form the basis of this history range from Weber to Max Bruch and Grieg. The Jist includes Sullivan, born in 1842; Goetz, in 1843. It covers the development of opera from Weber to Wagner, and of absoluto music from Mendelssohn to Bruckner; but of the great master who kept the true traditions of the royal line of absolute mu-bIc, and who united in himself the mastery both of design and of the purest elements of refined romance, Johannes Brahms,
very moment of i»s most interesting situation.	'
It ought to have at oncc become obvious that if the growth of the dramatic school was to be carricd to its legitimate climax in Wagner It was impossible, without robbing the work of its most interesting and instructive quality, to omit the growth of absoluto music to its legitimate climax in Brahms. Assuredly some chapter has : been left unwritten, for no one who came j into contact with the author could havo I failed to be convinccd of his Immense i admiration for, and innate sympathy : with, Brahms; indeed, the few allusions to him in the book as it stands are sufficient to prove tliis. But the omission is a serious blow to the completeness of the history as a comparative study, and at least some explanation should have been vouchsafed in the preface. In a future volume his presence would be out of place. He belongs to the period of his contemporaries, Cornelius, ICirchner, Goetz, Jensen, Raff, over whom, even in the opinion of those who least admire him, he towered, to "say the least, by force of will and earnestness of purpose^ and his right .place Is in this volume, as was Beethoven’s in the previous one.
APART from this very vital mistake, the History calls for little but admiration. The style is lucid, terse, illuminated by touches of dry humor most characteristic of the writer, (such as his note on Rubinstein’s playing of tho Sphinxes in Schumann's Carneval—1" of course, the breves are nox meant to be played, though Anton Rubinstein used to bang them, slowly, fortissimo—and look solemn,M) and as a whole markedly free from prejudice. Tho system which has been followed of assigning different periods to different writers has its drawbacks. In this period it has resulted in a certain lack of perspective, In the exaggerated high-lights upon some personalities and shadows upon others, and in an apparent intermingling of tho characteristic tendencies of widely different schools of composers, who, while not insusceptible to mutual influence, have in their main lines been wholly distinct. Mr. Dann-reuthor makes it appear that Weber was as much a progenitor of tho absolute music of Mendelssohn and of Schumann as he was of tho Wagner and Marschner operas. Here wo join issue. The genealogies of opera and of absolute music are, with tho exception of an occasional intermarriage, wholly distinct.
The line from Bach to Beethoven, Sehu-, mann and Brahms is a different family to I the line from Gluck to Weber and Wag-j ncr. They were often antagonistic, sometimes sympathetic, to each other. But to class them all together, as the system of tho Oxford History almost compelled Mr. Dannreuther to do (and it ia easy I to see that the task was often irksome,)
: is a little misleading to the student who believes in evolution. He will have to unravel for himself the lines of succes-slon. In some Instances he will get aJ lead that is brilliantly clever, such as the very powerful influence of Bellini upon Chopin; in others he may be misled, such as the very superficial influence of Weber upon Schumann and early Mendelssohn. The two main arteries of music, absolute and dramatic, are not clearly traced, and It is hardly possible that It could havo been otherwise, seeing that the author had to plunge In medias res. * * *
V
IN the discussion of Schumann's opera “ Genovova" there Is a curious misapprehension as to its composer's lack of sensitiveness in stage matters; M to read about brutality Is one thing, to see it presented on the stage with the details emphasized by mu3ic is a very different matter altogether.” This might apply with force to Puccini’s M La Tosca,” but npt to Schumann. Go far from being even unintentionally brutal, it is a well-known fact that he avoids brutality in his opera by refusing from stieer tender-hoartoJncKs to bring the husband and the traitor face to face in the last act. Dorf-fel was present when this scene W’a3* urged upon him; his answer was Invariably “ Ich kann’s nicht." The verdict of Llezt, given in a footnote to Page ' 34, is the truer one. The German stage still preserves it after fifty-five years oC a somewhat fitful iife (as it has preserved '* Euryanthe ”) in spite of the superiority of its music to its drama, and of its composer’s too obvious distaste for popular effcct and foot-light glare.
Upon Berlioz, as upon Wagner, Dann-
reuther’s criticism Is beyond question
sound. Upon Verdi it is equally beyond
question inadequate. To assert that Verdi
consciously affected cosmopolitan lines is
to negative tho wholo trend of his artistic
career. He never looked to the right or left, writing from inner conviction and with spontaneous expression. Jn his early davs vulgarity was as sincere as was refinement of his later years. It is very questionable whether Wagner influenced ' him at * all, as the author asserts. A creative artist of Verdi’s strength, independence, and perennial youth, was much more likely to develop alongside Wagner than because of Wagner. It is right to differentiate his orchestration from Wagner’s, but the scores of ** Othello,'* *' Fal-
staff,” and the "Requiem,” do not justify a suggestion of their inferiority In variety and richness of true color to those of the German master. They are wholly .different, but not inferior.
there is but an occasional passing mention, generally so written as to make the reader search for the chapter wherein his work and influence are chronicled, only to find it non-existent. Tlais lacuna most gravely damages both the value and the balance of the book. It is here that the living hand of Dannreuther is missed, and disastrously, for the sound common sense which was one of his greatest gifts would have enabled him in an instant to —grasp the situation when lie "had the vol-umo before him complete. No one can deny to the " Johannes Krcisler, Junr,,” of Diisseldorf days, to the author of the “ Magelone Lleder '* of maturer development, the closest connection with Romance. The History, then, was designed to close with the death of Schumann, As the book grew such a rigid line became impossible, If only for the fact that most of Schumann's contompc-raries outlived him for decades, (in tne case of Verdi, who was only three years lils junior, for forty-five years,) and to end it in 1850 was equivalent ;o ringing down the curtain in the middle of an act, and at the
