New York Times Saturday Reoiew of lioohS:
In your review of ** B. R Haydon and His Friends," by George Fastan, I find that the author says there is no picture by Haydon in the National Gallery.
A few years ago there were t^*o. While " Curtius ’’ leaped into the gulf in Gate's Arches. Charing Cross, the NUtional Gal-Iciy contained a large ** Raising- of Lazarus," aftd a smaller, about 30 by 40, picture called " Punch."
An interesting comment on Haydon’s failure to honor his country by his art was given to me by Whistler, Dining with him in Cheyne Row one evening, we were speaking of Haydon and Tom. Taylor's " Autobiography."
“ Yes,’’ said Whistler, *' Haydon, It seems, went Into Ills studio, locked the door, and before beginning to work prayed God to enable him to paint for the glory of Kngland: then, seizing a large brush full of bitumen, he attacked his huge canvas and—of course God fled! ”
