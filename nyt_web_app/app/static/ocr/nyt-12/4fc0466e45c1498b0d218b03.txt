| Veto York Times Saturday Review of Boote:
I Robert Clarkson Tongue, whoso poems have just been published in an 44 In Me* i morJam ” volume by his wife, Minnie i Wyatt Ton sue, was a teacher and Epls-I copal clergyman who spent most of his I life in Connecticut. He died in his thirty-sixth year, Dec- 3o, 1001. These poems oC his by no means adequately represent the largeness of the man, as one who was a pupil of his while he taught at the Episcopal Academy of Connecticut, at Cheshire, Conn., happens to know. In short, tli& writing- of verse was but a side-issue in tho life* of this man of broad outlook and truly Christian ana manly character. Had he been able to devote more ot bi3 time and undoubted talent in this direction to the expression of poetry, there seems small doubt that he might have accomplished much more than this volume actually givos. Of his more ambitious flights this represents him at hJs best, perhaps:
.	TBT3 SILENT POET.
Do you	think there are none but	you,	O
poet, friend of ray heart,
"Who look through the veil and tho bar deep into the soul of things;
Do you	think that to you alone, who	live
for the subtle art	.
Of molding beauty to words, the soul of the beautiful sings?
And the sky-glow and the stars, and tho I	glory of sea and earth—
1 Are they meant for Him alono who can |	utter thorn bade again?
I And 13 there no message sent to the one 1	of a common birth
I Who inarticulate utters his cry of rapt-i	are or pain?
i Never a song have I wrought, yet 1 sharo 1	in the mystery
Of night, and the natal joy of life when ; the night Is past.
Never a so«g have I wrought, yet I am akin to the sea,	A
And I hear the voices calling ever out ot the vast.
And the burden of all your songs Is Only an echo, blent	,	„
Of things that I loved before, and	of
measures I sometimes heard.
And held, unknown to myself, in the depth of my being pent,
Till a mightier one than I had quickened them at a word.
And the nasslon that fell to earth and beat like a wounded bird,
And the fledgling song of a soul* that never was plumed to flight,
Utter themselves in you, when the voice of your soul is heard.
And winged by your master-song; ascend to the sun-crowned height.
' No, the poet Tongue never found complete expression for his undoubtedly poetical imagination. Of his more familiar verse, the first stanza of the poem called ** Eastport and Westport ** represents him at his best:
gtrango how it ail comes back to me, Old Eastport on the noble bay.
Just where It marries with the sea,
And Westport miles and mlies away!— So distant, that the spires that rise Along the western reaches far Show dim against the morning skies And melt beneath the evening Star.
To the present writer, at least, there 13 something unmistakably haunting and impressive in that stanza. The first four lines, at least, are worthy of a great poet. This little volume of less than a hundred. pages Is well worth perusal as the partial expression or a fine personality. The book ia published by Minnie Wyatt Tongue, at Meriden, Conn.
