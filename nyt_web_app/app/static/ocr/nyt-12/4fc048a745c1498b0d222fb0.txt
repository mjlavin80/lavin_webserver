TOPICS OF THE WEEK.
and literature, since the Restoration, surely. The pose of superiority to one's fellow-creatures, especially to one's fellow-citizens, ever seems a graceful pose to minds of a certain quality. Gracefulness cannot be secured more cheaply. Mr. George Moore, whose queer new book, “ The Lake,” has made him a *‘ topic ” again,
I has just been telling- a London interviewer that Ireland's condition is now beyond hope. As for the Irish literary revival, Mr. Moore declared bluntly that there was no literary revival.
" There is only one man, Mr. Synge,” said Mr. Moore, " and he has written only one beautiful play, ‘ The Well of the Wise.’ ” Mr. Moore declared he was tired on contending in this matter. He adopted the plan of Goethe, *' who never mentioned Heine.*' Few are so dull as not to see that Mr. Moore was playing Goethe to the Heine of Mr. William Butler Teats. But shed no sympathetic tears for Mr. Yeats, we pray you. He can outdo Mr. Moore in rank pessimism. At a recent meeting in London of the Irish Literary Society Mr. Yeats expressed the opinion that the printed book had made the world ignorant. His idea is that not more than 20,000 people in the whole British Empire get any good out of printed books. Refinement, of old, was taken in through the ear. The mind was elevated by hearing. ” Shakespeare would never have been Shakespeare jf his father had known how to
read and write." Clearly, the printing press must go. This reading and writing will be the death of us all. We have long^ fearod as much. But, after all, Sir Lewis Morris is the champion English-speaking pessimist. Not only are the contemporary novelists, posts, and critics all wrong, but society itself has sunk lower than ever before. Gluttony, he cries, is a beseitin;? &in, and even worse than the alcoholism of former eras. We are inclined to think that Sir Lewis is more than half right, as far as this goes. He is also reasonable enough in his opinion, expressed in his new volume of collected essays j called "The New Rambler,” (Longmans, Green & Co.,) that there is some sort of hope for the future in the steadfast religious spirit of the middle-class Englishmen. But Sir Lewis is too extravagantly severe, too greatly given to hyperbole, to be an effective pleader.
HE most recent work of that most versatile writer, H. G. "Wells, is a preface to a translation of Prof. Gabriel de Tarde’s " Underground Man," which has just been published in London. Tarde’s book treats of an imaginary condition of humanity sim- ' ilar to that pictured in Lord Lytton’s remarkable book, “ The Coming Race,” which, however, was full of optimism and splendid prophecy. The light of the sun flickers out and the ocean is frozen before the remnant of the *ru- •
man race In this French sociologist's book seek warmth, and the. pursuit of happiness beneath the surface of the earth. Mr. Wells's own most recent book is “ Kipps,” a social satire, which is good fun and good sense. The Book Buyer announces that this prolific writer, who is now in his fortieth year, will visit this country before long. He has never been here, and he is sure to have a cordial welcome, for his books have been widely read on this side of the Atlantic. Since "The Time Machine” revealed his extraordinary imaginative gift in 1895 he has published fully twenty books, ranging in quality from the lightest humorous fancy to mature sociological discussion and speculation. “ The Island of Dr. Moreau *’ is a dream of horror founded, remotely on a few scientific facts. Some of his short stories are really worthy of comparison with Poe's, In “ The War of Worlds," “ When the Sleeper Wakes,” and ** The Food of the Gods ” his facile invention rather ran away with him, but "Mankind in the Making ” and “ A Modern Utopia," are books that inspire an appreciable measure of sober thought.
IN The Dial of Chicago Mr. Walter Taylor Field has an exceedingly entertaining and instructive article on the origin and development of Mother Goose, the imperishable patron saint of harmless nonsense, who seems to be more in evidence than usual this holiday season. Mr. Field infers that all modern writers of fiction and all modern poets received their first inspiration from Mother Goose. ** The poet’s first pastoral was ' Little Bo-Peep,’ his first tragedy ‘Ding Dong Dell.’ ” Of course the ancient Boston yarn about a Mrs. Elizabeth Goose, whose son-in-law, a printer named Fleet, made a book of her nursery rhymes In 1720, was long ago discredited. There never was such a book, There never was a real Mother Goose. But " La Mdre Oye ” appears in French literature as early as 1650, and "Contes de ma MSre Oye," including early versions of some of the best-known fairy tales, was published by Charles Per-rault, in Paris, in 1G00. The first printed collection of English jingles credited to Mother Goose was edited probably by Oliver Goldsmith, and published in London, by John Newberry, in 17G0 or thereabouts. This book was reprinted in Worcester, Mass., in 1785. Although Mother Goose herself was of French origin, some of her rhymes are as old as history. “ The House That Jack Built ” is supposed to be Chaldean. " Old King Cole ” is early British. ” Rock-a-bye Baby ” is probably of gypsy origin. Jack and Jill were little Icelanders who now dwell In the moon. Any nursery-bred Scandinavian child can point them out on a clear, moonlit night. “ Sing a Song of Sixpence ” is older than Beaumont and Fletcher's “ Bonduca ” (1G15) in which It Is quoted. “ Handy-Dandy, Jack a-Dandy ” is three centuries older. Mr. i Field objects sternly to modern improvements of Mother Goose. “To trifle with Mother Goose,” he declares, *' is like trifling with Shakespeare.”
WE have no doubt whatever ot the ( genuine utility of Mr. Henry L. Mencken’s little book, " George Bernard Shaw:	His Plays,” (Boston:
John W. Luce.) It is well written and informing. Mr. Mencken is, obviously, an admirer of Shaw, but he is no mere Idolater. His book comprises an essay on Shaw as a dramatist which is re; markably comprehensive in its scope, j and perhaps open to argument as to its doctrine. But it is good reading. Then ; follow chapters descriptive and amiably critical on Shaw’s plays—chapters that will particularly interest people who have no time to read the plays themselves, but wish to be kept in touch with current subjects of discussion. Another new Shaw boojt, a neat paper-covered volume from Brentano'fl,
contains “ The Author's Apology,*' from the published edition of his lately suppressed play, and, by way of introduction, Mr. John Corbin's recent striking article on " The Tyranny of Police and Press/’ which is as one-sided and wrong-headed as Shaw can be at his worst, and, in some passages, is as lucid, sparkling, and readable as Shaw at his best.
WE have already spoken admiringly of the revelation of most
agTeeable traits of character In Mr. William O’Brien's recently published book of " Recollections." The review of that book, which we publish to-day, by arrangement with The London Times, is obviously written from a point of view not generally taken on this side of Atlantic in the discussion of matters relating to the prodigious and baffling ** Irish question.’* But it is, as obviously, an able, scholarly article, of unusual literary and historical interest. Not all of the English literary Journals treat of O'Brien’s book from the purely English standpoint. Irish leaders have been commissioned by some of the London newspapers to review this book by an Irish leader. The Athenaeum says of the book that It Is impossible to end the reading of it " without being conscious of a high level In the tone of personal dignity.”
THE death of Henry Harland, which was announced by cable from San Remo, Italy, last Thursday, is a sad loss to contemporary literature. His comparatively short career had three distinct stages, the “Sidney Lus- j ka ” period, the Yellow Book period, 1 and the later period of slowly written, highly polished stories, delicate alike in subject and treatment, yet lUumlned by the wisdom of maturity. In his ! young manhood, under the pen name of Sidney Luska, he wrote some remarkably ingenious and entertaining stories about Jewish life in New York City, including “ As It Was Written,”
" The Yoke of the Thorah,” and " Mrs. Peixada.” These books struck a new note In fiction, pictured new places, were distinguished by inventiveness of a good order. But he never returned to their manner. During his editorship of the ambitious Yellow Book, a London periodical published by John Lane, he wrote other books of a different quality, including ** Grey Roses.” To his later phase belong “ The Cardinal’s Snuff Box ” and My Friend Pros-pero.” He was a writer of ambition and zeal, culture and imagination.
SIMULTANEOUSLY with the appearance of the last volume of the monumental “ Oxford History of Music,” a review of which is printed on another page this week, comes the belated second volume. This comprises Part II. of ** The Polyphonic Period.” It was written by H. A. Woolbridge, M. A.( and its special subject is ” tho method of musical art ” in the three
i
centuries preceding the seventeenth, the growth of the Netherlands school, starting with Josquin and his contemporaries and the school of Palestrina. Mr. Edward Dannreuther, author of the sixth volume, and one of the most i distinguished Wagnerites in England, 1 died before he could correct his ,
proofs.	j

LIKE the eight-year-old girl who j dreaded becoming fifteen, because then she would have to have beaus, The Washington Post is worrying over the crowding of the shelves of j the Library of Congress, and suggests J the weeding out of what is calls “ our unrivaled collection of literary trash.” | The suggestion brings to his feet Mr. j Ainsworth R. Spofford, dean of Amer- J ican librarians, who points out that I there should be in every country one “ comprehensive library, whose rule of acquisition should be Inclusive as regards its literature." The Library of Congress is, as it was intended, such a library for this country as the Biblio-
th&que Natlonale is in France, and as some five libraries are in the United Kingdom. Besides, continues Mr. Spofford, who is to do the weeding? Where is he to begin ? Pertinent questions, which the authorities of the British Museum library have not been able to answer, though with them the crowding of the shelves la an actual condition. The library In Washington 1s large enough for some years; when it is full it will be time enough to worry about making room for books—not by weeding out old ones, but by building another stack room.
THE University of California is to be congratulated on its acquisition of the collection of books, pamphlets, maps, and manuscripts out of which Mr. Hubert Howe Bancroft prepared his history of the Pacific States. Like the history, the collection is an omnium gatherum. It contains ancient Aztec manuscripts on maguey paper, maps from the time of the Conquistadors to our own, documents and printed matter of all kinds, from the early sixteenth to the late nineteenth century—everything that the industrious undertaker of history thought might avail in his work. Besides these are manuscript volumes of interviews with pion-, eers and pathfinders of the past, news-j paper files, letters, from Fra Junlpero, for example—an immense mass of matter touching on the history of the Pacific Coast. It is all valuable; but some of it Is more valuable than the rest. Mr. Bancroft sold the collection to the university and promptly gave to the institution nearly half of the purchase price, so that the library will be maintained permanently in proper surroundings, and open to students of the history of “ the slope.” The University of California is the proper repository of such a library, and we are glad that It has become its possessor.
