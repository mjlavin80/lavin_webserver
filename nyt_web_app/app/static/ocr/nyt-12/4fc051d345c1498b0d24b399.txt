1 rT''WAS never wild oats, there was never no vice in Maistcr Peter. 'Twas good grain what lie sowed* though it mid ha' felled the wrong side the fence. There! ’Twas wild wheat." Thus does tho old Dorset laborer interpret the youthful career of Mrs. Blundell's licro, whose sowing were it wheat or oats gaye trouble enough to everybody concerned.	.
She tells with much spirit tho story of the obstinate old farmer, who, wishing all ho had " to go in a lump,” left it to his wife for tier lifetime, arterward to hi3 eldest son, Godfrey, depending upon tho mother and brother to see that Peter, Godfrey's Junior by two years, " has all he needs.” Naturally a will so absurd makes a rift In the relation of the brothers, hitherto devoted and harmonious— and this, despite the wonderful tenderness and forbearance of the elder. The author's first chapter, dealing with this situation* is her best. Afterward Godfrey almost entirely drops out of sight, and the reader's sympathies- become altogether alienated from Peter and his love affairs, first with the abnormal kind of young woman who needs a keeper, and then with a docile maiden of the doormat variety. Even if we could be persuaded to swallow the romances, we should revolt from Peter’s idiotic debasement of himself and senseless cruelty toward, his* long-suffering mother and brother.	We have only to fancy such
performances in real life to perceive that Mrs. Blundell's hero, as a hero, la les3 than tolerable—while as for the heroines* It is to yawn! Had she permitted us to stay; on the farm with the mother and Godfrey/ we are sure we should have enjoyed the Dorset life, but we strenuously object to following the erratic leading of M Maister Peter," who may be safely trusted to do tho wrong thing at every turn. EJvideptly, however, his creator does not-agree with us, and we are irate WhQn She,makes his Prue entirely satisfactory, and removes hts excellent brother that he* may en3oy all those good things' of Ufe he so richly deserved to forfeit.
Inconsequent as the story is, it Is readable* Tin (J perhaps* we have found It the
I more provoking, because Indications are not wanting.of'the author’s capability of really good work.
