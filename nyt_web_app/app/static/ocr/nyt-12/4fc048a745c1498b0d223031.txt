New YorJ; Times Saturday Jicvleto of Books:
No doubt there are many books which have to ho passed over, but a recent book by Flctcher Harper Swift, callcd “ The Most Beautiful Thing in the World/' is so engrossing I would like to h<*ar some one's criticism on it. Mr. Swift is evidently a young writer, but the allegory goes deep Into the human heart, searching for what at last is found close at hand. It is published as a child’s book, as it calls forth a King and magician, those beings beloved of children, but seems to me worthy of being classcd with adult reading. It its not a book to he lightly read and thrown down. It leads deep into human passions, and as a matter of psychological study opens to the reader that which we all unconsciously seek In this world.
