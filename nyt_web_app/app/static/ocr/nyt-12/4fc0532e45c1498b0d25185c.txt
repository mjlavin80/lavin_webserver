PERSONS who may like to attach their own almanac data to booklets which have usually appeared in the' fo^m of calendars may be interested in three publications similar in general design, (Boston: H. M. Caldwell Company. $1.25,) the leaves be!ng cut to correspond to more or less fantastic covers, bound together with ribbon. M Automobilia," by Charles Y^lsh, is cut In the form of a miniature automobile, and comes in a bl'ue morocco paper box. The text, with suggestive border designs, covers more or less completely nearly every phase of the subject—the evolution of the auto and history of automobiling, poems, sermons, and anecdotes grave and gay.
As may be Imagined from its title,
" The Lovers’ Garland " is in the general form of a wreath, made by entwined hearts and roses. A foreword gives the history of love poetry, and each succeeding page is divided, so that the upper part contains verses from moderns like Swinburne, Scott, Mackay, &c., while the lower part is devoted to ancient and mediaeval rhymsters. The material has been gathered and edited by C. W. Caldwell.
A Dickens " Children’s Carol ” contains the famous Christmas ghost story of that author, printed on sheets which arc cut in tho form of a huge bell, which, gleaming with gold and wreathed in holly, serves as a cover. The illustrations are delicate drawings, reproduced in tinted half tones from the originals by I- M. Gaugengigl and T. V. Chrominski.
"Christmas Bells” (Chicago: A. C. Mc-Clurg & Co.) contains a number of colored pictures by M. Gibson Pratt, with appropriate lines by Mary Drummond, the pictures representing the celebration of Christmas among Africans, North American Indians, the people of the frozen north, and the Anglo-Saxons.. The final Illustration shows a group of children bound schoolward on a Winter’s day. The cover contains portrait types in color of the four races, and all is inclosed In a neat box, with holly design.
A very slmpieand effective-calcndar has been made by Elia S. Brison, (New York: Tho Triptych, 1 Madison Avenue,) called
-	The Woodcut." Besides the cover, which contains the signs of the zodiac upon a blue background. It consists of twelve
sheets of hea*vy brown wood pulp paper (S by 14 inches) caught together at the top with a thin leather thong. Layh sheet has the sign illustrated In an original manner, beginning with Aquarius anu ending with • jaoricormis. These illustrations are fine examples of broad woodcut work, showing figures, not only illustrative of the signs, but also symbolic ol the various reasons as recorded by months, A blue background hn3 been effectively worked in by mt?ins of stencils.
