A NEW POEM
A Note from Mr. Carman.
.Ncto York Times Saturday Review of nooks:
IN the confusion of good things offered to us In such bewildering abundance
by the Christmas numbers of the magazines this	year,	there	is	one which
seems to me particularly significant and fine, both in what it accomplishes and in the possibilities it suggests for American < verso In the future. It is Mr. Richard Watson Gilder's poem " There's No Place Like the Old Place,’* in The Critic for December.
It would	never	occur	to	Mr. Gilder’s
modest muse, I am sure, to pride herself as having achieved anything phenomenal in these delightful lines, and I should be sorry to embarrass her by overpraise. Yet there arc qualities in the poem which,
I should think, ought to bring welcome encouragement to those who care for poetry and	must	often	feel rather depressed at	the Immediate	outlook for
poetry In the present day. The poem Is not pretentious, makes no attempt at the grand manner, docs not indulge In rhetoric, has none of those ornate devices with which poets are so oft^n tempted to embroider their vapid rhymes. It is neither rugged nor strenuous, nor excruciatingly clever, nor Aslatically luxuriant.
Its scope is the simplest and quietest* possible, its theme one of the commonest of human experiences—an “ old home week " in a New England town. An excellent subject for poetry, no doubt, but one that might very readily be abused, in an effort to do justice to its old-fashioned sentiment.
By virtue of a certain reserve and entire naturalness Mr. Gilder has been equal to the occasion, with the most happy result* His poem seems so completely sufficient to its subject, and yet so completely without strain or pose or effort of any sort, as if a poet for once had been able to secure a perfect freedom of expression and had not overstepped that freedom in the least degree. And that, of course, is almost all that one can ask for poetry or for any art-adequate freedom and restraint.
Tho main point, however, to which It
seems worth while to call attention is not merely that Mr. Gilder has treated his subject with so much faithfulness and sincerity, but that he has given himself elbow room, as it were, and allowed himself a broader expression than the limits of old-time conventional verse permit. That, of course. Is just what Whitman did. But hardly any one seems able to follow Whitman's example without imitating his manner. Mr. Gilder, however, has discarded the stricter meters, and yet maintains a style of his own.
For that reason these long, deliberate, utterly sincere, and almost careless lines ought to give us another breath of hope for American poetry. People cannot ser-m to understand that poetry Is not always dressed in pentameters, is not always decked in rhymes, but has moods when simple garments please her better.
To keep poetry from becoming flat and formal we must keep ourselves in mind, not only of great models, but also of groat possibilities as yet unexampled and unimagined; wc must try constantly to enlarge our hospitality of mind, and not be content with old things under (or rather over) , new names. A poem of as much originality and freshness of technique aa Mr. Glider’s can hardly be marked too carefully.	BLISS	CARMAN.
