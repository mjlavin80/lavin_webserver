F EYV devoted patriots have suffered 1 bo much from the criticism of pos- ! terity as Stephen A. Douglas. On the 1 gteat issue of slavery he occupied a position midway between the propagandif’m of Jefferson Davis and the doctrine of the Republican Party, that stavery was wrong. He didn't care " whether slavery j vas voted up or down." As most of the histories we read deal with the slavery question from the Republican standpoint, i we are likely to form a rather low esti- I mate of Douglas. We know that he laid J violent hands upon the Missouri Compro- j ! mise and popularised, if he did not in- 1 vent, the doctrine of popular sovereignty,
| which meant that the territorial Legislatures alone could decide whether or not | slavery should exist in the Territories, j | How his doctrine worked out on the plains : of Kansas we ail know, and following our historical guides, we conclude that Doug-i las was a vulgar-minded, shallow fellow, whose only real purpose \gas to sccure the Presidency. And yet for years the " Lit-lie Giant was the undisputed master of the Democratic Party; his following and popularity were comparable to Jackson's.
Mr. Gardner has done something toward solving the Douglas riddle.
" Douglas was in no sense a reformer or the preacher of a crusade. He was ready cheerfully to accept the ethics of the time without Criticism or question.'’ Douglas has suffered by being brought into comparison with his contemporaries who were reformers—Lincoln, Suward, and Sumner. H'1 belongs in reality with the statesmen o£ the past generation. In tho debates witn Lincoln he expressed sentiments that' might have been voiced by Clay or Webster. ‘* 1 would not endanger the popularity of this Union, I would not blot out the gr^-at, Inalienable rights of the white man, for all the negroes that ever ex: isted,"
Certainly none of his political actions shocked the moral K*-nsc of the antislavery clem on is more than did Webster's advocacy of the fugitive slave law in the 7th of March speech. And Douglas merely shares the mistake of Webster and Clay in failing to see that no compromise could permanently settle the Question of slavery.
Though he lived in an atmosphere heavily chirgt-d with tlii,^ agitation, wh- n the final cUtsh came it took him unaware. But ihe stand he took here, und at the close of his life, should make Us lr*nient toward his earlier faults. All his Influence—iind it was still vast—was thrown to the side of tho Union. " Every man must be lor the United States or ug-ainst it. There, can fce no neutral In this war; only patriots or traitors.*’
However much lie may have failed to
grasp the moral problems of his age, however great his personal ambition may have been, Stephen A- Douglas was an Ametican patriot.
