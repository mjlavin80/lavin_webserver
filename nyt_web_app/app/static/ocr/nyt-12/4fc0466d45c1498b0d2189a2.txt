A	Glance	at the Literary Product of	the Year—New Books	of Political
Interest.
Special Cable to The New York times. Copyright. 1D03.
ONDON, Dec. 8.—Most of	this	year’s books have	now been published, so it is possible	to pass a faip-	judgment	on the literary
product of 1905. The general opinion of literary experts seems to be that there have been very few works of distinction issued. It has been largely a year	of memoirs and fiction.	The booksellers say they have had a	fair business the last two	months and
expect the usual Christmas rush.
IT	is	thought that the coming general	election will injure the	book trade
considerably in the early months of the new year. In connection with this, it is noted as a curious fact that the three most important books expected in January are all of political interest. They are Winston Churchill's biography of his father, Lord Randolph Churchill; Jesse Collings’s “ Land Reform,*’ and	Goldwin Smith’s “ Irish History	and	the Irish	Questionwhich, I belie vn,	has	already been published in	Now	York.
