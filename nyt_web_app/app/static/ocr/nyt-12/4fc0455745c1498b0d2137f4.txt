Kcio York Times Saturday Rcvictc of lioolts:
I have been much interested in the various letters concerning Edith Wharton’s *‘ The House of Mirth,” which have been printed in the recent issues of Tub New York Times Saturday Review op books. It seems to me that not one of your correspondents thus far has touched upon the real motive of Mrs. Wharton's story. The demoralizing power of great wealth is the keynote of tlie novel.
Wo aro shown that no human feeling— honesty, morality, or love can stand against this “ gaudy gold.” For lack of it Selden cannot bring himself to marry Lily Bart, though ne does love her—with-out it Lily Bart cannot live,	'
The strongest lesson which the book teachcs, to one who reads a book not for the sake of the story, but for the moral which it contains, Is contentment with one’s lot, no matter how humble it be.
Those who devote’their lives to the pursuit of the " golden casket ** known as i “ high- life '* usually find that '
!	*•	All that glitters Is not gold,
i Often have you heard that told.
Many a man his life hath sold.
But my outside to behold."
