ATC1P York Timex Saturday Review of Books:
In a. recent edition of your paper you made mention of the opinion expressed by President Roosevelt as to the publication of stories in whieli animals figure as protagonists. It appeared from this that the President took exception to such stories on the ground that if taken seriously they may do harm. Now to my mind all fiction is subject to the same objection.
As the President is further represented as upholding the verdict of Mr. Burroughs, whieh denies intelligence to animals, a few words on this head might be appropriate. Mr. Burroughs declares In favor of the theory of evolution, and yet denies that animals think—taking his cue from the senseless acts of a few animals and forgetting that the human animal frequently errs in this respect—which is tantamount ta saying that itT is possible for a hen to have twenty chicks, each of which has separate and distinct instincts, all of which diverse characteristics are inherited directly from the same mother. 1 leave your readers to judge the logic oE this conclusion.
