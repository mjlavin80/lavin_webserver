ffcw York Timea Saturday Review of Books:
Ono of your recent correspondents doubted 11 If any child, outside of classic Boston, could comprehend either the language or the point of view '* of Arthur Stringer's "Lonely O'MaUtey.** When It came to my hook table and I discovered What sort of book it was I was so pleased with It as a Ftory and as a study of one kind of child life that I took It home for my oldish mother, who has known a good deal about children’s ways, to read; and when my nine-year-old nephew came in one day announcing his intention to stay to tea and asking would X please read to him tilt supper time, I passed over to him ** Lonely O’Malley ** as being the book nearest at hand that might interest him. He was quiet for half an hour and proclaimed it “ a pretty good book.” but would I read it so he could get it quicker. As the sitting was to be brief I turned to the picturesque and Appealing recital of Lonely’s circus experience, and the young listener was delighted. A week later h& came again to stay to tea* of his o-^n Initiative, and I soon discovered that it was not the supper nor the aunty and gran’ma which bad attracted him, but the memory of Lonely O'Malley. So an episode in tho life was selected by the pictures, and we had another good sitting over the stcrry, which Is ail the better because it Is not a *• juvenile.'* Two or three days later a holiday left us both tree. I had plans of my own- So apparently hO-d. th0 small nephew, for at about 0 o clock in he walked—and he lives two-thirds of a mile away—bringing ids sister, two years older, and a hoy friend. Unsuspectingly I invited them to take off their tilings and stay awhile. All right, they would; and could they take that book of Lonely O’Malley? The sister was going to read it aloud to the boys. So they settled down in a room by themselves to enjoy tho hour they had been given to stay.
I tell this in detail as an Indication of tho extent of tho story’s success as a “ juvenile,** whether it introduces phrases suggestive of President Hall and wanders into psychological realms or not. Tho small boy Is not troubled by a thought he does not understand It slips by him or gives his imagination a pull that ho relishes.
M Lonely O’MalleyM is something far better than a juvenllfe. It Is rich in Story material that* young and old will like; and it Is full of a knowledge of child nature that is mighty appealing to one who knows much of children or who remembers his own childhood.
