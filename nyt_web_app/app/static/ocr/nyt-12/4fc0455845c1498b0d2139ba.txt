CANON AINGER.
A New Collection of Lectures and Essays by the Late Master of the Temple.*
Hy amusement with Tho London Times.
LFRED AINGER, of blessed memory, never forgot in the pulpit that he was a man of letters, or out of it that ho was.4 clergyman. His Christian charity, though wide enough to include Burns, was unable to embrace Swift, and was ever inclined to expurgate Lamb. Perhaps the clerical bias is a little too obvious in the remark that Mrs, Barbauld’s *' theology, or the absence of any, causes her devotional writings, hymns in prose or verse, to strike us as tepid and ineffectual, in despite of her truly reverential nature.” If those familiar lines which Wordsworth envied about life and death and personality are not religious, the word ceases to have any intelligible ‘meaning. Alnger was not without bigotry and prejudice, not by any ' means. It would be difficult to say whether Roman Catholicism or Anglican Catholicism was more disagreeable in his eyea. But as a rule, while always folding up a high standard of .conduct and reverence, he kept hiS private leanings in a Sphere apart from his published writings. He had graduated in the great school of universal sympathy and comprehensiveness. He was a devout student of Shakespeare, Later idols he had— Dickens for one, Tennyson for another. But Shakespeare was his first love and his last/ of whom he never tired, in whom he was always fin dine something new.
A born* actor, who would have achieved celebrity on the stage, Ainger read Shakespeare so that the most familiar scenes were invested with an air of freshness and novelty. Excellent preacher as he was^ he excelled equally as a lecturer, and the best of his lectures were devoted to his favorite subject .In treating of Shakespeare good writers are at their best, as bad writers are at their worst.’ Shakespeare and his commentators, it used to be said before the days of Coleridge, were the best available examples of the Infinitely great and the infinitely little. With Coleridge a different school arose, who realized that to interpret Shakespeare imagination and humor were essential. Of the first six essays in these volumes five are wholly, and all are mainly* Shakespearean. For, though the subject of the sixth la nominally Euphuism, we should take very little interest in euphuism now were it not'for “Love's Labor’s Lost." Alnger was the prince of lecturers.. His voice was exquisitely melodious, and his mobile features did almost as much as his voice to keep him In sympathy with his audience. Hia style was easy, scholarly, graceful, and polished. Subtle ha might be, but he was never obscure, and he plunged Into the heart of his subject without needless circumlocution.
Except Mr. Sidney Lee's exhaustive biography, which proves how little we know, there can hardly be a better sketch of the greatest career in literature Ainger’s -three lectures on the three stages of Shakespeare's art. There are, as we haye all heard, plays like “ Henry VL/* which Shakespeare is supposed to have patched up in his youth from older •materials. It seems a strange employment for a man of supremely original genius. Bat, as-Ainger says with characteristic certainty of touch, * by no surer method could he have mastered the secret pf dramatic effectiveness as he watched' the effect of experiment after experiment upon audiences, and took to heart his failures and successes alike.'* Even Alnger was not Infallible. When he argues that “ Love’s Labour's Lost *' has passed away with the fashions which it indicated, we are Inclined to retort that if has preserved them from oblivion. When he says that “ Shakespeare never thought of posterity/* wo cannot but remember the couplet

.Nothing, on the other hand, can be mute Ingenious than Ainger*s demonstration . that Shylock was at first intended for a purely comic character, and that Shakespeare’s humanity gave It those touches which are now itrf-chief merit, unless we prefer his apt illustration from Henry IV, of the author-speaking for himself.

education. More Latin was taught at Stratford Grammar School, if that were ?11, thftn :an be found in Shakespeare's plays. But that was not all:
Half a dozen years of school, half a dozen years of Intimate contact with" the poetry and poets of the most astounding age m English literature and with the world of soldiers, statesmen, travelers, scholars, and thinkers around him; and the ** quick eye *’ to make all these .its harvest ground. What more should be wanted to equip the man who through thin imaginative act Is to move mankind?
Alnger never seems to bo quite at home with Swift, never quite to know whether he should treat him as a brother-clergyman or not. He cannot find, except in ’ the " Tale of a Tub," a tolerably large exception. " a gram of evidence that Swift had what are ordinarily called religious doubts or difficulties." Surely he must have had thosd scathing lines on “ The Day of Judgment," never published by Swift himself. In which life and death are openly derided. As a satire on hypocrisy they are magnificent. But they seem hardly compatible with any form of theo-~ logical belief. To place_ Swift " among the best of writers of vers de soci6t6 ’* is to underrate him of society verse, as we know it, h& was the father.- His metre he took and perfected from “/HudibraA" He was far more dexterous than Butler in the use of it, and even Praed scarcely equaled, him in the delicate manipulation, of his flowing octosyllables., The lines on his own death, cynical as they are, are' yet almost ggpial in their raillery. »The birthday odes to Stella are delicious. Tho lines on the Legion Club are awful and ominous in their savage fury.
Ainger's admiration of Tennyson was hardly kept on this side idolatry. In comparing him with Sweats he writes:

ts as Tennysonian perhaps as anything that a poet of marked individuality ever produced, and it moves us within its, Limits, but not within* Tennyson’s.
It must have been rather difficult for Keats to be Tennysonian. But really this Is carrying Tennyson worship rather too far. Tho Influence of Keats upon Tennyson is one of the most obvious phenomena in modern literature. But when we are gravely told Keats aimed* at what Tennyson accomplished we can only feel that Tennyson could no more have written M The Odes to a Nightingale ” and ** A Grecian Urn - than “ The Tempest “ or " Measure for Measure,** Yet if AJnger’s enthusiasm for Tennyson sometimes carries hi™ away. It is otherwise with his zeal for Dickens, which was* always ■ according to knowledge. Perhaps there is no better specimen of Ills style than his entirely delightful recollections of the amateur theatricals ot Dickens's home;
What evenings were those at Tavistock House, when the best wit and fancy and culture of the day met within its hospitable walls! There was Thackeray, towering in bodily form above the crowd, even as he towered in genius above them all, save only one; JerroltL with the blue convex eye, which seemed to pierce into tbe very heart of things and trace their subtle resemblances; Leech, with his frank and manly tjeaaty, fresh from, tne portrayal. of " Master /acky M or some other of the forma of boyhood he knew so well; Mark Lemon, “the ffStic and the gentle,'1 (dear to all us younger ones, irrespective of blood relationship, as “ Uncle Mark”;) Albert Sm^th, dropping in late In the evening after a two or three thftnaa.ndthg ascent of Mont Blanc, but never refusing at our earnest entreaty to bit down at the piano and sing us “My Lord Tomnoddy " or his own latest edition of *'Gallgnani’e Messenger*’; Augustus Egg. With bis dry humor, touching from itseontrast with the face of suffering that cave * sad presage of his early death: Frank Stone, the kindly neighbor and friend, keen as any of.us boys for hispart in the - afterpiece: Stanfield, with thj beaming face, “a largess universal like the sun/* his practised hand .and brush prompt to gladden us with masterpieces of scene painting, for the Lightthouse* and. the Icefields: and last—but not hero to be dismissed with- a few Unes only—our bountiful host, like Triplet, “author, manager, and actor,, too/’ organiser, ae-vicer harmonize* of all the'incongxu-ous assembled elements; the friend whom we have so lately lost—the Incomparable1: f jckens.	*	*	-	~
