Poetry
and
Calvinism.
HE frequenter of second-hand bookstores runs across few volumes more regularly than Robert Pollok’s *' Course of Time.” In all shapes and sizes and conditions of shabbiness it meets bis eye—convincing to its popularity with our orthodox The book has still its interest, not so much for anything It contain^^ though there are here and there touches of something almost genius —as for the light it sheds upon the effect of Calvinism on the Scotch imagination.
This religious system Pollok's illustrious countryman, liobert Burns, who died two years before Pollok's birth, had celebrated by rebellion; but Pollok, like Burns a peasant, like him precocious, and doomed to an even shorter life, never dreamed of any attitude toward it but one of complete submission. If he thought the fear of hell “ a hangman’s whip to haud the wretch in order,” he also thought it part of the plan of omnipotence that it should be so. Hence he sings of heaven and hell—particularly hell—with realistic fervor, after the manner of a miniature Milton or diminutive Dantes In castigating what he deems the sins of his age, novel reading does not escape, and the following lines, more limping than limpid, serve to show that complaint of the overproduction of fiction had its origin in days very far from recent:
** The story-telling tribe alone outran All calculation far and left behind,	.
Lagging, the swiftest numbers; dreadful even To fancy was their never ceasing birth.
And room had lacked had not their life been short.”
Why does not some literary man A Collection of	with ample leisure and	a taste for
Unfmaliior	delving in obsolete and	obsolescent
Q,no tat ions	writings compile a book of ** unheeded.	familiar quotations ” ?	Thousands
of lines and passages as good, perhaps, as the bulk of Bartlett’s ** familiar " ones await the patient searcher, and put together they would toake a book of both interest and usefulness of no common order.
** Full many a gem of purest ray serene The dark, unfathomed caves of letters bear.**
But the compiler need not confine himself to forgotten and half-forgotten works. Plentiful gleanings await him in the writings of authors already laid under tribute by others. Shakespeare the inexhaustible would still yield hundreds of splendid lines not to be found in the collections. Chapman's “ Homerr* would prove a mine in itself. The minor poets have never been half worked, and prose writers have scarcely been touched.
Short stories — that one
Gay de 31aapas»ant
_	branch	of	literature in which
and the
Sliort Short story* we incontestably surpass our
English cousins and rival our French friend3—may be themselves divided into short short stories and long short stories. Over the former division, where the art consists in the graphic delineation of character with a few swift pen strokes, in the inclusion of just what is vital in detail and background and the rigid exclusion of all else, that extraordinary artist Guy de Maupassant reigns as supreme master.
From the boulevards of Paris to rural Massachusetts Is a far cry. Between a French man of the world and a New England woman of Puritan inheritance yawns a great gulf. Yet there is something in the best work of Mary E. Wilkins that recalls forcibly that of the unfortunate Frenchman. Both are uncompromising realists—his the dreary, hopeless realism of the Continental skeptic and pessimist; hers the more cheerful realism of one who believes that if all is not well with the world, at least all Is not ill. Miss Wilkins's tales of course lack the Gallic salt of
de Maupassant’s. Her range is much narrower. She does not deal in the horrible or the repulsive, and many topics on which de Maupassant brought his analytical genius to bear are happily taboo to her chaste pen. Of the Frenchman it might be said that, whereas many unskilled story tellers have attempted tlie frightful to achieve only the commonplace, he in depicting the commonplace has many times achieved the frightful. Miss Wilkins is satisfied with the striking. The one shows us in miniature the seamy side of France, the other the homely side of New Kn&land. But just as de Maupassant's sordid peasants and pleasure-seeking Parisians remain in the memory, though perhaps a few hundred words have sufficed to depict them, so do the proud and angular women, tlie obstinate and awkward men, whose portraits Miss Wilkins has painted in space equally small.
This surely is the test of the quality of the short short story.

The occasional slips of the tongue and the pen. those usually faithful servants of the mind, have long been celebrated and, together with the persistent errors of the type, have contributed their share to the gayety of the nations. But sometimes It Is the mind itself that slips, with results equally astonishing. It was, for instance, no mere pen slip but a transitory mental aberration of a kind familiar to all professional writers that led the extremely competent book reviewer of a metropolitan journal to pen this remarkable sentence in connection with some comments on the British capture of Quebec:
General Wolfe, as they floated up the St. Lawrence rapids recited to his officers “ The Burial of Sir John Moore," thereby adding a leaf to the laurels of his namesake, Charles Wolfe.
To float up the St. Lawrence rapids would have been in Itself a feat beside which the taking of Quebec would seem trivial; but to assert that in addition to this physical triumph Wolfe added the mental achievement of reciting a poem by one man in celebration of another, both yet unborn, is to carry hero worship too far. The most pronounced disbeliever in the legend of Wolfe's recital from Gray's “ Elegy '* is little likely to adopt the new version.
