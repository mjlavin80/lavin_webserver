four number, being reproduced in fac
simile. They are, with the exception of
two or three, the work or William Clark*
who was the recognized draughtsman of
the expedition.	-
J* When we consider/'
writes Mr. Thwaites in his introduction to the volume, “the conditions under which,— these charts were drawn—in the field, with crude astronomical instruments, and from information derivable chiefly from daily observation and Indian reports their relative accuracy and topographical comprehension are worthy of our highest praise; they are eloquent witnesses of Clark’s undoubted engineering skill.”
The maps illustrate in detail nearly the entire ro.ute of the expedition, both on the outward and the return journey, with sites of camping places and Indian villages, presenting in addition much interesting comment on the country and natives. The table of contents gives descriptions of the charts* The volume also contains a modern map of the route prepared especially for this publication.
S. Baring Gould, author of Tlie “ Song's of the West/’ “ Old Riviera. English Fairy Tales/’ " His-
•	toric	Oddities/* “ The Des-
ert of Southern France/' &e.. writes in his ** New Book of the Riviera” about the Ligurian coast of Europe, called by the French COte d’Azur and by the Italians tho Riviera di Ponente. No attempt has been made to give a history of Provence and Genoese T„iguria, nor to treat of the whole of the Italian Riviera. Mr. Gould has tcken “a few of the most prominent incidents *' in the history of this part of tho Continent, and has given brief biographies of interesting and celebrated personages connected with it.
Beginning with Provence, the author goes on to Lc Gai Saber, then to Marseilles. Aix, Toulon, Hyfres, Draguignan, Cannes, Nice, Monaco, Mentone, San Remo, Alasslo, and other places by the way. ending at Savona, which, “ with its port its towers, Us engirdling mountains, and its wide-stretching orange and lemon orchards, is a very charming town/’ The principal sights of eacli town are described, hints arc given to travelers, little stories of natives are related, and other interesting matter is given of all the places treated of in the book. There are many illustrations in half-tone, also, mostly from photographs. The volume abounds with extracts from the writings of modern and other well known travelers of England and elsewhere. It will be published by E. P- Dutton & Co. in about a fortnight.

An epilogue closes '1‘lie On mi* the second volume of	completing ** The De-
World Politics, velopment ot the European Nations, 18701900/' which G. P. Putnam's Sons will publish Jan. 10 in this country, and in this epilogue J. Holland Rose, the well-known English lecturer, editor, and author of historical books and articles, writes as follows ot the outlook of affairs at the beginning of the twentieth century:
The lesson that lips clear on the surface of orur present historical inquiry Cor all who have eyes to see Is that the responsibility for the public weal rests more with the masses of the people than with its officials. Only by whole-hearted exertions and self-denying sacrlflccs have the great national movements of the present ape reached their goal: and these qualities are not apparent in the younger generation of Britons. * * * Chief among the influences that drain away the vital strength from the brain to the muscles of the body politics wc may reckon the portentous growth of armaments, themselves an outcome of the national struggles of the nineteenth century. * * * What was true of the middle of the eighteenth century is trebly true of the dawn of the twentieth centurv. * * • The powers of the race and of‘the Individual are quickened either by healthful repose or by a strenuous* struggle on behalf of some great cause. Neither of
these conditions has fallen to the lot of the great nations of Europe since tho year JSTy.
Mr. Rose opens the present volume with the Triple and Dual Alliances, and continues with considerations of the Central Asian question, the Afghan and Turkoman campaigns, Britain in Egypt, Gordon and the Soudan, the conquest of the Soudan, the partition of Africa, the Congo Free State, closing with Russia's rdle in the Far East. The work will be of much interest, value, and guidance to students of international politics.

Tho'G recks. who callcd The Mvnninj; themselves Hellenes,
of	were	ii race rather
Holln.i, than a nation. Though they were the predominant people in certain parts of Europe and Asia, and though they gave their name to the land which still retains it,
there,was. In fact, no one tountry with a* capital and a seat of Government which we can speak of as Hellas, as we might of France or Spain. * * 9 A system or small States was a characteristic mark of this Hellenism. Each city, with a narrow territory attached, aimed at complete Independence.	*
Thus E. S. Schuckburgh opens his volume. "The Storyof Greece,*’ which the Putnams will add to The Story of the Nations Series, Jan. 10. The first chapter on the Greeks and their work In the world deals briefly with the Athenian supremacy from B. C. 478 to 404; tne Macedonian and Roman supremacies which increased the separation of States; the Cretan Kingdom, and other predecessors of the Hellenes; early Greek political science, literature, drama, and art. This Is followed by fuller chapters on the Persian invasions, the early development of the Greek States, the work of the Greeks, &e.
The book is in two volumes and completes the series. The origin and expansion of the Greeks are presented through their literature; the story is told of their fights against the Persian invasions and their absorption in the Roman system, down to A. D. 14. The volumes are fully illustrated.

An Eiifflinli- ^ell-known English ar-YFonmn list and author of “ The fn India. Durbar,” “Japan." "The
World's Children/’ “Bntiany,** "Rembrandt/* “ Whistler as I Knew Him/' &c., has painted the seventy-five colored pictures in the volume on " India," written by Flora Annie Steel, and issued by the Macmillan Company in the series of itolored picture books. Natives of India are presented in their various costumes, in the market places, in the bazaars, their homes, before their temples, &c.; scenes in the streets, palaces, views of various buildings, etc.
Miss Steel writes about the Aryan race, the Rajputs, the Great Moguls, the Western rulers of India; Hinduism, Mohammedanism, and the other faiths of India; the arts and crafts of the Empire; its temples, Its women, morals, customs, etc,; the Anglo-Indian, British rule in India. In her chapter on the temples of India she writes as follows:
•	* * How perfect they are—as a pic-turc—those high, windowless walls, pale ochre, flesh-color, purple, a niche here, a nichc there, dripping witli the oil of many votive lamplets; yet with nothing in them to be worshipped, maybe, except a worn stone, the print perhaps of a 'blood-red hand. A door in the wall, just an ordinary square door, low. rudely carved, but—ye powers above!—what a glimpse through it. A wide cloister, a spired shrine, a motley crowd, colored, garlanded, the clang of a brazen bell, and over all a chanting voice and a smell of incense, the whole set round with three high, almost windowless walls; above them more spires rising Into the sky, that seems pale with the very excess of light.
