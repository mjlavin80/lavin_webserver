Nathaniel c. fowler, jr., ia the
author of “Gumption; or, The Progressions of Newson New,'* (Boston: Small, Maynard & Co. $1.50.) -which is supposed to bo the autobiography i of a somewhat cheap and cocksure young person who was born on Cape Cod. grew up in Boston, and finally established him-| self In the West. To be sure, Mr. Newson i New professes all the while to be setting forth what the battle of life taught him—
I to be showing- how events licked him into | shape, but he is perfectly satisfied with the results at every stage of the process.
I As for the essential cheapness of the hero, the title ** Gumption" (which, If It means anything means the lesser worldly wisdom) speaks loudly for itself. One gathers that the book is covertly didactic and designed to furnish o. practical exampin to persons who lack the quality of " gumption." Really, too, some very good thing's are said from time to time.
For the reader’s more particular Infor-1 mation it Is set forth that there dwelt In Cape Cod a certain old-fashioned physt-clan, a believer in castor oil. lie had sev-! oral sons, of whom Newson was the eldest. i The parent removed to Boston, where the | son embraced the career of newspaper : reporter, and by grace of assertiveness j and ability rose In that career more raj>-idly than Is the wont of tboso who fall upon It. Having accumulated a certain small capital he presently moved to a city of Western Massachusetts, which Is disguised under the name of Much Town,
; and there ran a paper of his own. He tells you how he ran that paper*—even quotes you paragraphs therefrom—and describes, not without acumen, the humors of Much Town. Prospering there also he presently sells out to advantage and establishes a paper fn another Massachusetts town, (a musical centre and a place of tho Pharisees)—disguised as Chillwell—a paper calculated to please the hypercritical habit and shallow pretentiousness which, he asserts, is tho characteristic of this town. Again he succeeds and learns more still of how to succeed. Finally he shakes off the pelf-satisfied dust of Chillwell and moves clean out of Massachusetts into the West There (having taken out a Cape Cod girl | of excellent common sense to be his he]n-[ meet) ho leaven himself porfectlv satis: fied with the town he lives in, and the i lady, and his own personality.
