That AlLSundersloocJ Poem,
New York Times Saturday RciHcic of Books:
I	notice In your issue of Dec. 0 a letter from a gentleman concerning an unnamed poem published in one of the popular magazines for November. It seems he had difficulty in understanding the poem, but was so much interested in it that he submitted It to several equally intelligent and equnliy mystified literary friends. I think I have succeeded in identifying the poem in question. Is it not ** The Fugitives,*’ by Florence Wilkinson, in the November McClure's? If so, may 1 have a little of your space in which to present my understanding of this poem and of other so-called “ mystical " poems from the same author, and possibly of many other poems of a somewhat similar character?
Would it not be fair to the author to assume that she means exactly what the lines express? Then why need we seek for any hidden or occult meaning in the poem, which upon a thoughtful and intelligent reading seems to me quite clear and easily to be understood, even by one destitute of a *' college education ” or incapable of “crossing the Helicon in triumph"?
To quote the opening; lines:
" We are they that go, that go Plunging before the hidden blow."
Is it not quite plain that " we " refers to such persons as are described in the linos that follow? That is, any persona who are driven through life. Tills driving
force,	which	is " tho hidden	blow ” before	;
which	they	“ plungi*," may	be any tlimly	!
understood motive in their lire. Love of money or power, any overmastering de- j sire or ambition, whatever it may be that I spurs	them	on, " fugitive	from birth.”	j
leaving them no time to wait for results, j
They ** cannot wait for flushing field or j quickened crop.”	i
The	best	lhat is in them is stifled,	i
crushed, yet in thvir c«iiSL*i<>5Rnc.-^ of :
what they might have become?, under different conditions, or with a better bal- ! anced temperament, they cry 'out to their more fortunate brothers:
44 Oh, ye who climb to some clear heaven By grace of day an'1 leisure* given.
Pity us, fugitive and driven,
The lithe whip curling on our track,
The headlong haste that looks not back! ”
Perhaps the gentleman writing the letter was not far from comprehending the real meaning of the poem when he understood that it represented " somebody or everybody," ** chased or pursued by something." To his question " What is the pursuer or pursuing force? ” it seems to me the answer need not be definite. This force that drives people blindfolded differs with different individuals, and with their different temperaments and circumstances.
The collegc-bretl wife nrid the two literary friend?, although thinking themselves in doubt. realty recognized the meaning of the lines, for eadli gave a correct interpretation from her or his own point of view.
The literal gentleman who pronounced the poem " balderdash ** because he could not understand it was, from that very lack of understanding* entirely incapacitated from giving any opinion concerning it.	'	H.	E.	THOMAS.
