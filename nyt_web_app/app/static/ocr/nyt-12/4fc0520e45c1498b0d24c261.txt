IT IS not strange that another edition of Mme. Ducluix’s “ Fields of Franoe " .should have appeared—the fifth printing1 In two years. For the book treats of a subject even yet not too familiar to tho English, and does so in charming style. Mmi'. Duclaix, formerly Mme. James Darmesteter, and known best in England as A. Mary F. Robinson, is thoroughly acquainted with her subject, and in her treatment of it commingles knowledge of the past and of the present most charmingly. quoting from quaint records of the old time, and recalling men and women of the Middle Ages from the shadow land of forgotten books to tell of thq places v/here once they lived and moved and had thofr being. The book Is illustrated very badly. The pictures are reproductions in color of crude wuter-color sketches, most of which have nothing whatever to do with Mme. Duclaix’a text.
There arc only seven chapters in the book, but all are interesting; perhaps the chapter on the poor in the fourteenth century is tlie most so. Some years ago the Hev. Augustus Jessopp, rector of an English parish, wrote a book on " The Coming of the Friars." in which were chapters on the Norfolk of the twelfth century, and later books by him continued his studies of the Middle Ages in England. Mme. Du-claix treats of Normandy in the same manner, and quite as interestingly. She sums up one portion of her investigations In these words—rather surprising, possibly:
Despite all abuses, the Normandy of the fourteenth century was, after all, a place in which a humble, hones-t man migrht earn his bread, lay by thriftily, watch the market, purchase wisely, and rise from class to class much as he may to-day.
In fact, Mme. Duclaix believes that the lower classes, (HJO years ago In France, were about as well off as they are now, differing in this from Mr. Jcssopp’s views of tftii condition of the English laborer of the same period.
The final chapter of tho book Is on “ The Mediaeval Country House." a close yet interesting study of life in the castles which had been made habitable. An island castle, defended by a wide expanse of water, could afford the luxury of light and air, could indulge in large windows, tut the huge moated castle of the plain V/as less fortunate. The windows were narrow; the walls, ten feet thick, were placed very high for safety." In those
houses lived women and men much as women and men are to-day—good, bud, and Indifferent. We read usually only of i how bad tho bad wore; Mme. Duclaix ' tdls ns of how good some of the good I were. Altogether she has made an instructive and attractive book.
