It la lato to seek to enter the controversy concerning Mrs. Wharton's book,*’ “ The House of Mirth.’* But my deep admiration .tor it and stanch belief -that its ecjiius raises it far above aJl contemporary fiction will not permit me to remain 1 silent.
In so great lack of appreciation It must seem that the subtle irony, by which a vivid phase of life so flluminatingly marks Its own relation to the whole has not yet been * divorced from the searching insight of the underlying purpose.	-	-	-
** The House of Mirth " must be either a lamentation over tho slain nobility of human nature or a triumphant witness to the power of love, tho regenerator. And there 1b hero no relentless fatalism, no ; exploiting of the decadence of human i nature, nor is this merely a pitiless analy- ‘ sis of a walk in lovely nature; hero is | rather a demonstration of the latent power of regeneration In each human being.
I The whole marshaling of incident seems but to lay emphasis on the miracle of redemption wrought by love—love disavowed, defied* yet potent to arrest a ; woman’s moral decay, and raise her to thft heights of utter self-abnegation. Tho circumstance of Uly Bart's heredity and .^environment canceled her chances of hap-j pift&ss from the first, but upon its very ruins did she not build her ultimate salvation? "Let us not confuse the fate controlling material destiny with th&fc which in achieving the spiritual mocks it. Por is not th© fatalism of " The House of Mirth *' only that by which each human being is Impelled to realize that higher self startled to life by love alone.
So persistently has the character of Lily Bart haunted me from this conception that I have attempted to construct a study consistent with tt. It consists merely in the grouping, without word of comment, of the statements In the book concerning her individuality and the circumstances that shaped it, of her consequent inability to respond to the love that was her destiny and inevitable wreck of happiness, with the record of love’s triumphant survival and achievement.
I would like to take up one other point. Great stress Das been laid upon the low atmosphere of tho book, because of the characters chosen to form its background* Has any one paused to comment that wo are Introduced to them in that capacity only? Were Lily Bart thrown on to tho canvas as part of this background would any revelation of her nature be Ukely to excite’ sympathetic interest; or were any one of these others brought under tho full light of Mrs. Wharton’s penetration can there be any doubt that the samo human passions and capacities would command attention?
It Is impossible to conceive how any ono can read theso things from Mrs. Wharton’s pen and fail to concede both her genius and her acute moral perception.	.
I hardly daro hope for so much, ppaco aa this demands, but my ardent partisanship tempts me to submit its testimony.
