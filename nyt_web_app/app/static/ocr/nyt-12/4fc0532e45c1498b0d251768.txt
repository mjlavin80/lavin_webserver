IT Is a history " de longue haleine '* that M. Andrfi Michel, professor in the Ecole du Louvre und. Curator of Gov- ' ernment museums, has undertaken In tho eight-volume work of which only a’por- --tion of the first volume has appeared. A history of art from the earliest Christian time? down to our day will include much -that only the closest students of antiquity tn special fi^Jds understand. The names of specialists given as collaborating on Volume I.— Bertaux, Eulart, Hase- * loff, Leprieu?? Male," Marquet de Vasse-ldt, Gabriel Millet, temlle Moll n ter, FSrat£, Maurice Prou—do not signify much to* us. The scope of. M. Michel'a plan has some limits, however; It will not Include Oriental art except where ltBtouches Europe, and we inf^r that the arts of America, whether redskin or white, will be Ignored. . Even so the materials are overwhelming.
In the first	volume	of	MM.	P6rat6,
Eulart, Mijlet,	and	others	treat	of	tho
Christian art of the catacombs, Romas architecture, Byzantine art, and that of Merovingian and Carolingian Dynasties In the W6st, of the architecture, sculpture, miniatures and stained glass of the Later Empire and of	the	art	of	coinage.	The
(ic-oond volume	will	be	given up	to	the
i rise and evolution of Gothic art; the third to the arts before the classic revival of the quattro-cento; the fourth the supremacy cy of ihti arts of Italy In the Cfnquecento. Vol. V. wtll treat of academic art, and Vol. VI. of the supremacy of tbe ** monarchical art ** of France. Vols. VII. and VIII. will cover the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, respectively. To judge by the installments of Vol. I. which have appeared, this will be a very thorough and scholarly work, which will gather up the' latest discoveries and 'reflect tho maI turest opinions of a. host of students In
archaeology and art.	1	•
