THE authors of " The Pride of Jen-nlco " are such practiced and skinful collaborators that ne'er a joining is visible in their workmanship, and the reader would never suspect that their smooth and delicate pictures are, In truth, mosaics.
This is particularly true of * The Heart of Lady Anne/* As they themselves explain in their “Foreword/' it is a “ ‘ Tale in Porcelain' of the Taming of tho Shrew—* Shrew ' (you might say) fs, sure, too liarsh a name for so dainty a piecc as my young Lady Anne,
*	Taming/ also, la perhaps an over-weighty word to depict the conflict of hearts and wit (full of wraih at times, but never devoid of courtesy) between the chivalrous, if iron-willed, young English squire, home-keeping- by taste, and country-loving above all things, and his girl wife, bred amid the artificialities of a Versailles Court and still all afire for the excitement of the Town. But such Is the theme: ‘She would not be taught with a kiss.* And* if taming there bo, at least her experience is more gracious than that of ill-used, bullied Katliarina; and Its lessons are tempered for her by the watches and loving wiles of a decorous Petru-chlo—in a tie-cue and lace ruffles and with a delicate sense of generosity,” Thus do the authors introduce their pretty little story, which reminds one of a painting on a fan. True, it has in It the elements of tragedy, but one cannot take it seriously. It goes trippingly along, a pleasant diversion for an idle hour, all the more engaging because the " Incomparable Bellairs/’ now my Lady Kilcroney, *' still merrily guides tho plot and leads the cantrip.*’ Were the slory In any wise a picture of real life, one might well protest not only against the willfulness of the
Lady Anne, but against the tactics of her spouse. It were absurd, however/ to look upon It in any other light than as a dainty comedietta, well fulfilling its purpose of making life for a little space a more lightsome thing.
