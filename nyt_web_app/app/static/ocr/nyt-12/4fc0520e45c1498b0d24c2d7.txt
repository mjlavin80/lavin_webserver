FRO!VL RE ADERS.
A Reader Wliose Enjoyment of Air. Caweirfs Poems Is Tempered With Disappointment.
New York Tintes Saturday Review of Books:
TTRACTED by tho praise given to Madison J. Caweln's recent book of poems by The ! New York Tihes Review 1 of Books and by a notice '
which I read in another journal, I bought a coM	"	The	I
' " Vale of Tempo,’* and have not yet regretted doing so. In one respect, how- ! ever, I have been disappointed, for tho book has no .table of contents, no Index, nothing1 which will enable ono to find readily what he Is looking for. Thinking that perhaps I had been unfortunate in getting an incomplete copy, I called at the store of the _ jblish-ers, E. P, Dutton & Co., ort?y xo ^ind that all the books were in tho same condition. The gentlemanly clerk who listened to my-complaint agreed with me that a table of I contents was a necessary thing in any 1 book; he appeared to have the Impression j
that the author, rather than the publishers, was responsible for the lack. Will you permit me to assure l.ir. Cawein.
through your cotumns/ that a book of poems containing some eighty pieces, without any clue to the contents, is an absurdity, and not at all intended to attract readers? It lias been necessary for me. in order to find a poem easily tho . second or third time, to improvise an index on a flyleaf? But I do think I should be put to that trouble,	/
This is not my only quarrel with Mr, Cawein's book. For one thing, the puno-tuation is loose and irregular; but that is j a^minor matter. It is an offense, however, to find "rites’* spelled "rights/* ; (p. 130;) at least, I can see no meaning if “ rights ” is correct. On the same page, first line, ** What it would mean" ob- I viously ousht to be " What would it 1 mean,” unless I am wholly in error. j These things may. perhaps, be excusable ! on the ground of haste, (though I do not 1 think that a good excuse;) but what shall we say of tiae grammatical error in the following, (p, 5S:>
"Within her eyes my worshipping spirit j
saw	i
The moments busy with tho dreams I whence spring	*	I
Earth’s loveliness."	,
M Spring ” is made to rhyme with *' everything ” in the lino following the threo j quoted, but so clever a worclmonger as j Mr. Cawein cannot so Justify his violation of a fundanientai rule of English construction.
Carelessness alone would seem to explain the repetition of words, as of ** place " in
“Within that dark and demon place
There was no place to hide,” (p. 1&1,> and of " day "in
** The years have turned her dark hair gray
Since that glad day; and still, they say She keeps the tryst as on that day.”
(p. CS.)
Let me confess that in reading ** The Yellow Rose,** from which these three lines are taken, I substitute “ hcur " for !	“ day ” in the second line*
