Wcio York Times Saturday Review of Books:
Being a reader of The New York Times Review or Books I would like to express a few opinions in reference to criticisms of Mrs. Wharton and her book, 14 The House of Mirth,” by some readers of your publication, and to criticisms in general written by the 11 average reader.” Why all these caustic remarks which have appeared in the last few issues on Mrs. Wharton and her book, written by the " average reader,” who does not In any sense shine as a literary limelight on our public stage of literature and whom the general public look upon as a person who would have been better off had he or she made no criticisms at all?
If our friends must make public their likes and dislikes of certain authors and their books, why should they not be a little more moderate in tone and thought, and not, like tho country boy who, desiring to cut a sapling, took an axe in hand, when a pocketknifo would have sufficed. Certain it is they are endeavoring to impress upon our minds—not their ** pocketknifo ” feelings, but their “ axe-swinging ” views with such forco that there cannot be any doubt as to their true meaning.
I am not making these comments for the benefit of persons who are fully capable to make criticisms upon authors and books, such as we find in the various Issues of Tns New York Times review of Books, but for those I have mentioned above. It is a pleasure to read the criticisms and reviews of new works by such men as Mr. Cary, Mr. Jacobs, Mr. Boynton, and others, whose writings appear in the last issue and who are acknowledged by all as capable of such undertakings. Men of this type do not write In leaps and bounds, nor do they become so heated in their discussions &s to suggest to us that they need a few applications of cold towels, but express their thoughts in a moderate tone and never make personal attacks upon authors—such as the average so-called critic is inclined to do.
If our amateur critic friends would only profit by such writings and not cut the ** anchor rope ” of their thoughts and go < soaring through the heated regions of their intellects, we might be inclined to put the stamp of approval upon some of their criticisms.	>3.	D.
