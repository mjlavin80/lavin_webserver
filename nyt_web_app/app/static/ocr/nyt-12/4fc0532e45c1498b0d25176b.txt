1 HE OYSTER.
A Popular Account of the Bivalve That Is a Living Grace Before Meat.*
■^BOOK of more than two hun-r dred pages on the oyster seems at first sight simply a curiosity; but Dr, Brooks's volume is not a curiosity; it is a careful study of a mol-lusk which is the base of a great industry and stands high among American food fishes. The book appeared first fifteen years ago, and was planned as an attempt to show Maryland oystcr-men their wasteful methods, and to lead to reforms. As such, it seems to have failed in its purpose, so far as Maryland was concerned; hut Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, and Louisiana have read and appreciated the lesson, and have followed the suggestions made by the author so many years ago. To the book as originally published Dr. Brooks has added a section on the peculiar fitness of the oyster for gathering up the germs of cholera and typhoid and transmitting them to mankind. This section, he says, is the most notable addition to the new edition. Concerning his qualifications for speaking in behalf of the oyster, Dr. Brooks says:
I am not totally without experience with oysters. I have dredged them in every part of Chesapeake Bay, from Swan Point and tho Bodkin to Craney Island and Lynn Haven. I have tonged oysters in live different States, and in the warm waters of the South, where froSt ia unknown and the oysters flourish above low-tide mark, I have enjoyed the opportunity to explore the natural beds and have spent months under the broiling tropical sun w.iding over the sharp shells which cut the fret like knives; 1 have planted oysters; reared them by collecting the floating spat; I have hatched from artificially fertiliztd eggs more oysters than the number of people in the last census; in the West Indies I have gathered at low water from a boat the oysters upon the mangrove bushes overhead; and I boldly claim enough practical experience to acquit me from the charge that my views are theoretical.
It was this same Dr. Brooks who discovered, nearly thirty years ago, that the American and the European oyster reproduced its?lf jitferentlv. "When the reproductive elements are fully ripe, he notes, they arc discharged from the oody into the cloacal chamber of the mantle of

the oyster. The male cells pre swept out into the ocean by the current produced by tho hairs on the gills; in the American oyster the eggs are swept out into the water in tho same way. The eggs of the Kuropean oyster are much larger and heavier, and fall into the w'ater tubes of the gills and lodge there; and there they, are fertilized and begin their development as new oysters.	-
There is" no such provision for securing the fertilize (ion of the eggs of the American oyster. They arc thrown out into the water to he fertilised by accident, and v.hile many of them meet with ma-e cells, innumerable multitudes sink to the bottom and are lost. It is fortunate for ether animals that this is the case; for our oyster is so prolific that if all tho eggs were to bo fertilized and to grow to maturity, they would fill up the entire bay in a single season.
An average Maryland oyster of good , size lays about sixteen million eggs; if half of these were female we should have, from a single female, eight million descendants in the first generation, and in the second eight million times eight million, or G4,OOU,tnX),000,<XX).
The danger to man in the oyster lies in 1 the fact that some of its choicest tidbits of food are most harmful to him. " Many gallons, probably many barrels, of water ^re drawn through the gills of each oyster each day. and the microscopic beings that it may contain strained out and pushrd along into the oyster's mouth. Each microscopic organism is a long time in traveling from the point where it first touches the gill to the oyster’s stumach; all this while It Is alive and capablc of becoming the parent of new generations when removed from the gill and placed under suitable conditions.”
Most of these organisms are wholesome to man, and all that enter the oysters stomach are quickly killed and converted into its palatable and nutritious substance; but so long as they are traveling along the gills, all are alive, and some are extremely dangerous to man. The ovster exercises choice in tho selection of its food, rejecting some of the microscopic organisms and swallowing others; but those that are discharged into the water with the sewage of cities are not, unfortunately, among the ones that are rejected, and before these have entered the oyster’s stomach they are most favorably placed for gaining entrance Into human stomachs and multiplying there.
Dr. Brooks sums up the matter thus: " In my opinion, no one need fear to eat true salt-water oysters raw, but every frosh-water oyster and every ‘ fattened oyster * ts too dangerous to be eaten raw. Fattened oysters,” he goes on to say, “ are simply full of fresh water. This is extracted by cooking, so that such oysters are no different from others, so far as cooking Is concerned, and if eaten raw give to the consumer ‘ filthy water from the harbors of cities.* Dr. BrooltS,

The book is not a scientific treatise, but is a popular summary of the knowledge about oysters possessed by one who has studied them for years. It is written In an interesting manner, and any one concerned with the bivalve on whose account we have R in the names of so many months will do well to read it. An index would Increase the value of the book many times; it deserves to have one.
