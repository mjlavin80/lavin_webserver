A NOTE to the introduction tells us that .he author of this book died before he had corrected the proofs. ; He lived long: enough, however, to make : a volume of much interest, in which the : historian will find collected many quaint j bits of the story of London town, and the amateur of reminiscences and " ana ** meet with much to entertain.
It was the wife of Henry I. of England who founded the Hospital of St. Giles for ! Lepers outside the walls of London; from that foundation came the Parish of St. Giies, infamous during tho last century for its poverty and vice, but for a long time the home of writers and of men who 1 made history. The first two parts of the : book deal with the history of the parish, and with the famous and noted people who dwelt within its limits in the days between those of the Good Queen Maud and those of the First Gentleman in Europe.
The hospital, owfng to the decrease of j leprosy with improved conditions of life.
lost its usefulness; its brethren se^in to have amused themselves by quarreling, and in the time of Edward III. actually J destroyed the records of the place rather than allow the Archbishop of Canterbury to inspect them. As a result, the hospital lost its independence and struggled alung until Henry VIII.'a time, when the Kin?: gave it to Lord Lisle. who later bor-amc Duke ol Northumberland. Long before 1 that, however, it had become a custom for condemned prisoners, on their way \f Tyburn, to stop at St. Giles’s anil drinU a bowl of ale. The memory of this Ju.st drinlu was long kept alive by Bowl Yard, an open place in the parish. It was in those days, too, that the parish b«i?:»n to be 'fashionable as a residential district. Sir John Oldcastle, Lord Cobham, lived in St. Giles's; Sir William I >rury and Lord Essex lived there; the Mount-joys, the Hollands, one of whom lived in Holland House; Lord Herbert of Cher-bury, the Montagues, Pepys’s patrons, were St. Giles’s people. In MonLagu House the British Museum was opened in 1750.
The first church of St. Giles's dated from about 1200; a new building was put up in the early seventeenth century, a third in 1731. The second church was alti-

As a royal chaplain, he was one day walking with the King when his Majesty said that he-*‘ was more troubled how to dispose of the Bishopric of London which was then vacant, than of anything in his life.” The doctor remarked that if the King had faith he might easily dispose of It. " How? ’* asked James. If your Majesty,'* replied the chaplain, “had* as much faith as a grain of mustard seed you might say unto this Mountain, ‘ Be thou removed and be thou cast into that seel ’ "	■
