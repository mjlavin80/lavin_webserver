THL ABOLITIONISTS.
A New Book About Them by Mr. John r. Hume, a Veteran AntiSlavery Agitator.
By EDWARD CARY.
Solomon had been living twenty years ago and had lost enough of his famous wisdom to harbor * hostility toward Theodore Roosevelt, we can imagine him e^claimin^:	u Would that mine
enemy would write a Life of Thomas EL Benton! ” Nothing that our then youthful and confident historian has ever done has called down on him from so many sources criticism of greater bitterness. Truth to tell, the book was somewhat unnecessarily crowded with off-hand opinions, or, rather, with very sincere opinion? duly weighed with the deliberation of that time of life and expressed off-hand with a great deal of earnestness and emphasis and very little qualification. It may be called a belligerent book, and it had an extremely belligerent man for Its subject; It is not strange that ft bristles with provocative passages. One of these has attracted the attention of a veteran of the anti-slavery cause, Mr. John P. Hume, now of Poughkeepsie, formerly of Ohio and Missouri- It is a characteristic passage, so much so that it might easily have been written in this year. Mr. Roosevelt sneers at the Abolitionists. They *' have received an immense amount of hysterical praise, which they , do not deserve, and have been credited with deeds 1 done by other men, whom in reality they hampered and opposed rather than aided," After 1840 11 what they did was positively harmful." " The Liberty Party, in running Birney, simply committed a political crime, evil in almost all its consequences.”
** The Liberty Party was not in any sense the precursor of tho Republican Party, which was based <jn expediency as much as on abstract right, and was, therefore, able to accomplish good instead of harm.”
TO combat this estimate of men whom he loved and with whom at a later date than 1840 he worked and fought Mr. Hume started to write an article which has expanded under his eager pen into a volume. (“The Abolitionists,” Putnam.) So far as his immediate purpose ia concerned its achievement was not very difficult. Necessarily it i3 a question of opinion. Practically the position taken by Mr, Koosevelt is that the overthrow of slavery would have come sooner had not the political Abolitionists Insisted on an independent party, and no one can surely deny the accuracy of a prediction of the consequences of what did not happen. But we think that the older observers of the period of anti-slavery agitation and still more those who took part in that agitation will pretty well agree that the action of the Liberty Party forced the issue, aroused the moral sentiment of the American people, gave persistence and continuity to their action, and very decidedly Influenced the temper and the essential aim of the Republican Party when it was finally organized. Nor must it be forgotten that the independent anti-slavery organization, growing slowly but steadily as it did, made a point of rallying for those who separated from the old parties, and, at times, produced marked political results. It certainly gave Mr. Chase to the Senate; It had much to do with ' puttting Mr, Sumner there; it shaped the course of Senator Wade in a considerable degree. These are not negligible facts. When we connect with them the other significant fact that for something over a dozen years preceding the crisis of the struggle the political Abolitionists trained in their ranks a small but effective army of men who sought little for themselves and risked much, and kept burning the sacred fire of unselfish devotion to duty
-
at a time when sordid politics was the rule even
readily dismiss the
movement as a political 4* crime11 or repress the thrill of admiration It excltcs as " hysterical."
Mr. Hume adds to his defense of the political "Abolitionists, as contrasted with the Garrisonians on the one hand and Compromisers on the other, an interesting account of the anti-slavery organization throughout the North and of the part It took in the civil war. He is a pretty severe critic of Mr. Lincoln, and from the standpoint of the purely antislavery man his criticism is easily understood.
*•* i
IT is quite true that Mr. Lincoln was never an
Abolitionist, and was not even an anti-slavery man in the sense of opposition to slavery in the States where it existed before the war. He did everything in his power as President to restore the Union without destroying slavery In the old States. He was ready to buy the liberty of the slaves, He would probably as late as the date of his famous proclamation have supported the restoration to the Union of all the Southern States with slavery had they accepted the conditions of his first proclamation a hundred days previously made. For this he encountered the active opposition of the political Abolitionists, especially in the State of Missouri, where the author of this little volume was at that time living and very actively engaged in politics. Mr. Hume's account of the movements in the State is extremely interesting. There is a touch of partisanship in it, as is not unnatural. But it gives a glimpse of a really important element in that confused and mighty struggle which can nowhere else be had in such entertaining form.
Equally interesting, though not so distinctly novel, are Mr. Hume's personal recollections of the old Abolitionists, and especially of those ot his own family and neighborhood in Southern Ohio, with the adventures of the “ underground railroad *’ and its wretched passengers in desperate flight “ toward the North Star." He seems to have been a lad of only eleven when he first enlisted in thig service, and his story of the negro girl of seventeen and her infant boy, helped in their escap© by tho boy’s white father and the owner of both, throws a curious light on a phase of slavery not now often recounted. How far away the time seems, but for one that ran recall even the later days of the anti-slavery contest Mr. Hume's recollections appear in nowise overcolored.
