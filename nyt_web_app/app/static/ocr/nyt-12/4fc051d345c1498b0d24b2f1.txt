FRANKLIN.
His Literary Influence Considered in View of the Celebration of His Two Hundredth Anniversary-
By EDWARD CARY.
Tuesday last the Pennsylvania Society of New York celebrated (a trifle in advance) the bicentenary of the birth of Benjamin Franklin with a banquet at which the luxurious cuisine of the Court of Louis XV. was served with the scrapple that Poor j Richard wo aid have commended, whether he preferred it or not. It was what Is recognized as a "brilliant" occasion; the great dining hall was crowded 'with men, and a cloud of witnesses of the other sex looked down from the galleries. The orators did such justice as they could to a fc*w of the manifold claims of Franklin upon their appreciation; the Postmaster General of the United States j talked “ of the Deputy Postmaster General of the Province of Pennsylvania,** as did the late Ambassador to France of his predecessor who largely made the republic both represented, and so on through a quite unusual list. And all the splendid scene was lighted by the electricity Franklin’s keen intellect tracked in the heavens, lassoing it for the mighty uses to which it has been harnessed.
Doubtless this is but one of the many celebrations with the same end in view, which the offspring of Pennsylvania all over the land will arrange, while in other lands organizations of varied sort will pay their tribute to the memory of America’s scientist, journalist, statesman, diplomatist, and moralist, or, at the least, moralizer.
N*
WHAT a really wonderful career It was in its scope, in its length and continuity, in steadfast and alert energy, in its influence on the lives of men and of nations. He may be said to have been a bom statesman. That is to say, from his earliest youth he was sincerely and eagerly concerned in the principles underlying the life of men In communities, in the institutions by which that life is guided, in the duties such life imposes. In the first essays he tucked under the door of his brother's newspaper office in Boston, at the age of 1G, he discussed certain of these matters, and especially he gave expression to a sober and reflective patriotism, of devotion to hia “ country.** which was by no means the kingdom of Great Britain, but the Province of Massachusetts Bay. In Pennsylvania, whither he went as a mere lad, he early espoused the cause of the people against the queer, narrow, penurious proprietors, and his devotion never flagged until the cause was won. On the eve of the French war he devised a scheme of Colonial union for purposes of common defense, which, had it been adopted, might have prevented the separation, since it would have rendered unnecessary the taxation of the colonies for military ends. In England, where he spent sixteen years of his life as agent of his colony and that of Massachusetts, he brought forward the one plan by which the authority of the Crown and the rights of American Englishmen could have been reconciled, and again offered the means of preserving the unity of the mighty empire. In the Continental Congress, In its earliest and most difficult days, it was his wise guidance that made possible the ultimate appeal for indispensable aid from France, and
probably no other American could have converted that possibility into a reality as he did In the nine laborious and trying years he spent In Paris, while it was largely his personal influence that opened the way for the successful negotiations for peace and the acknowledgement of independence. And when, on the eve of four score, he returned at last to his native land after a life abroad in its service of a quarter of a century in ail he took as a matter of course a leading part in the municipal affairs of Philadelphia. From the starting of The Gazette at 21 to his death in his 85th year, his mind was con-
j Unuously employed with public questions, and at every stage of that long and tremendously active | career the working of his mind was practical, farsighted, keen, and, on the /vhole, generous and fine,

YET, curiously enough, it may be said, and truly, that had Franklin led no public life at all, had | he held no office, and confined himself to the journalism which he Invented and to the scientific investigations and studies of which he was passionately fond, he would easily have been one of the best-known and the most influential men of his country and his time. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that no other American writer has been read so widely at home and abroad, and of none have the charm and the value been so universally acknowledged. The fertility of his pen was inexhaustible, and responded with freshness to each new demand upon it in a hundred fields as to a thousand subjects. He Is the one great American essayist; with the exception of his remarkable “ autobiography,” he wrote nothing but essays, mostly in the form he chose for his newspaper work, which was a very flexible form. Even his political papers, prepared officially, and dealing with matters of importance and complexity, were essays and had in them something of the directness, the animation, the personal note of his journalism. It is not without significance that his first pen name in those boyish but really mature papers In The Boston Courant was Dogood,'* and his second, in the papers for The Pennsylvania Gazette, a few years later was “ The Busybody." All hia life he was an untiring busybody in doing good as he saw it, and he'saw it with a penetrating and embracing vision seldom matched in his time or since.
i I have ventured to suggest that he was rather a | moralizer than a moralist. It is not to be denied that there is an element in his writing as in his character a little repelling to some minds. If his aims are sound, his point of view is not of the highest. He may be fairly called a fanatical utilitarian. There is a certain tinge of cynicism in his appeal to rather shabby motives for good conduct. In one of his " BusybodyM papers he elaborately argues that the wise pursuit of oleasure requires moderation, since without it ultimately the pursuit fails. It is true enough, but the spirit oir calculation is not, after all, the loftiest spirit. In Franklin it is rarely absent, and the result is that the goddess he Invites us to follow even In the best paths is rather a smUg being. But this is not the criticism of the classes he addressed, nor, probably, is it criticism thfjf. greatly would have disturbed him In his day. It is not of much Importance in the light of his real service, and it is far from lessening his title to a place very near the firsfc in the list of great Americans.
