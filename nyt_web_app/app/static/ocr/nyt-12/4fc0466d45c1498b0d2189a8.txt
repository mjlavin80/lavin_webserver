LIFE IN ISTEW ZEALAND
THE TOLL OF THE: BUSH. By William Katchell. Pp. 422. New York:	The	Mac-	i
millan Company. fl.&O.	1
THE Toll of the Bush,” Mr. William Satchell’a second novel dealing with lire in New Zealand, la interesting not only because its scenes and Incidents are quite different1 from those which ordinarily greet the novel reader, but because the author writes from a manifestly intimate knowledge of his far-off people and places, and with a force and vigor of characterization and description that make every person in his book a real* and vivid member of our acquaintance and every scene plainly visible to the inner eye. for the most part the story concerns a very agreeable circle of colonial English men and women, brought together by the common necessity of earning a living in a certain vague “ settlement on the Great North Road,” there being-just enough of an admixture of Maoris to offer variety and give local color to the whole. In the background dominating ail and furnishing unlimited possibilities of danger and trouble, stands the “ bush "
I —the gloomy, almost Impenetrable tracts of virgin forest that mark the boundaries of the settlements and seem to occupy very mucir'the same relation to the New Zealand colonials as the sea to the sailor, a Nemesis Impatient of his control and ever watchful for a chance to demand her trq.gic toll.
The centres of interest in Mr. Satchell's story, however, are the inevitable man and woman engaged in the ever attractive process of falling in love with each other.
A very thorny process it proves to be in the case of Geoffrey Hei^ishaw and Eve | Mil ward, requiring in the end the irresistible Intervention of the ’* bush " before i opposing obstacles can be cleared away, i Hemshaw does not prove a hero ot the conventional type, able to turn** mount- | ains into mole hills on the least provocation, but he is very human and immense- 1 ly likable, and, by the slow English methods. he does finally arrive at the goal of all his hopes, while the “ toll of the bush " is for the moment satisfied by the violent death of the superfluous gentle- j man who had been rendering the life of tho lovers miserable. Eve Milward‘s is a , most attractive personality, though she Is more than a little irritating in her spiritual sympathies with the superfluous gen- i tlcman, but her father is an absolutely delightful specimen of aJMhat a fine gen- i tleman of the old school ought to be. and 1 “ Sandy ” is a worthy son ol such a father.
But Mr. Satchell’s portrait-making does not by any means become exhausted with these four characters. There is a Mrs. Gird—the rigfit-hand man of her own family, and the confidante and adviser of
■	all her friends and neighbors—who Is j a masterpiece of feminine sweetness and I common sense. There are two young things, born and brought up in the settlement, whose ignorance of the most ccmmon facts of history and whose joint incursions into ** Ow-ns Short,’* Shakespeare, apd other standard sou rets of knowledge are jro vocative of much mirth. There are, too, many minor characters outlined with more than ordinary skill and distinction— a little neighborhood, in fact, made to live their lives before our eyes. It is a crude, rough life in many respects, and the author is enough in sympathy with the primal forces, enough of an artist in his work, to make no attempt to smooth the , roughnesses. There is an atmosphere of freshness and truth about tho book that is most satisfying, and the interest is sustained to the end.
