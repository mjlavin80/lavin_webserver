New York Times Saturday Review of Books:
44 *Tis true, 11s pity—and pity *tls, *tls truejj* With this feeling:, we lay aside Mrs."Wharton’s " House of Mirth/’ who In building it builded better than she knew.
Rarely has any book aroused such universal interest or provoked such illuminating discussions, and we owe The New York Times Review of books a debt of gratitude for printing the many really brilliant letters on this subject. Two years ago many a quarrel originated in discussing Candida's virtue; this year, from pulpit to parlor, it is Lily Bart who-is the main theme of conversation.
What a human jjrip slie has on our sympathy, and whfit a complex creature she is, with her demi-monde longing for luxury, and her fine capacity for conscience. Many consider her no better than Becky Sharp, and only attribute her refusal to sell herself to a careless disregard for consequences,^while others find in her tho true nobility of souL whoso many ignoblo actions are due to force (or is it lack?) of /circumstances beyond her control. Her final spiritual rejuvenation (and here there is no division of opinion) is due to the influence of her love for Selden.
As to her committing suicide, this Is also open to question. Did she, after finding Selden's love grown cold, and after learning that ** if you have no money, you needn’t come round/* deliberately take a big enough dose to end it all, or did she mejely increase the dose to Induce more sleep? She mentions running a risk, but there is no conclusive proof that she really meant to do so, and after reading such a very painful story, It seems too bad that she was not allowed to ** live happily ever after ” as a reward for her virtue.
The other persons In The House of Mirth,” notwithstanding Mr. * Newport, are living, breathlng-creaturcs and represent a certain portion (not all, thank Gdd,) of “ high society/’ Of course, the upper ten are not the backbone and sinew of the American Republic, but to a vast multitude they stand as the head of it, who, like Nettie Struthers, eagerly *read the papers to see what they are doing and saying.
It is too bad they do not realize their responsibility a little more clearly and lead a better example 'to " the masses who ignorantly worship them.” With tbe moral searchlight turned upon them, Mrs. Wharton reveals the voluntary condition of thd “ very rich ” as a far greater crying shame than the involuntary condition of the Jx>or, who do not regard respectability as a bore or disgrace.
One final word of praise for Mrs. Wharton's refinement of touch: Any German or French author, in dealing with such delicate . situations as lily's scene with 'Trevor, or even Dorset, would have made them common <>r risque, but not so Mrs. Wharton; in the entire.book there not
one-scene or word we could wlsb recalled. Dec. 26, lflog,. - NEWJTOBK.
