OIL BLAS OF THE WEST.
IT was as long: ago as the year 1885
that Messrs. Sampson Low, Sons
& Marston issued in England the
original form of this book—“ The Purple Land." As the author, W. H. Hudson, confesses, the public was inappre-ciative " and it very shortly fell into oblivion." Now Mr. Hudson revives it —with some slight revisions and excisions—and E. P. Dutton & Co. publish it in this country. The unappreciative public of 1885 was, of course, within its clear right to neglect ** The Purple Land;" nevertheless, to a reader of twenty years later, it appears a rarely fresh, charming, and delightful book. It Is a sort of sentimental journey in the La Plata country of South America, or, more exactly, the Gil Bias of the east bank of that great river—called by the dwellers there the Banda Oriental, a land of plains and horses and Latin ways of life, a region glamorous of romance and revolution, a place of soft-eyed, appealing women creatures and of men of devious embroidered speech. For there are mingled with the sentimental episodes—these are as various and as pretty as the flower faccs which inspire them—adventures of the way. deeds of blood, tales of the people, grandiloquent, simple, realistic, satiric, by turns, even a battle in which the hero runs ingloriously away. In a!l of which the author exhibits whimsically the local color of morality and the fantastical character of motives and manners among people whose ways an/ not Kritish.
The adventures and reflections are ostensibly those of Richard Lamb, a person of English birth but Oriental temperament. Richard had begun his career by stealing from a proud man of Argentina his beloved only daughter. With this flower for his bride he fled to Montevideo, and leaving tbe lady in charge of a grim aunt person, sought his fortune upon the plains. He found not fortune indeed, but so many distractions that he was a long time returning—though return he did in the end. In the interva’ he rode over the Banda, and rested whiles in wayside places and in ranchos where, as a stranger rode up, he must cry “ Ave Maria ” in token of good-will, where Tierce dogs rushed out. and where the women and children were always kind and the men bore themselves variously. So he met Monica and Margarita and Dolores, and Mercedes and Candelaria and Demetria, all lovely and good—also Cleta, a coquette; and Santa Coloma, a General of revolution; and Don Hilario. a serpent; and Bias Aria, a ruffian; and John Carrickfergus, a Scot cscaped from his native psalm-singing and rejoicing in his freedom. Likewise a whole colony of English gentlemen prodigiously but perpetually drunk as the only gentlemanly refuge in a god-forsaken country. Thereby snake stories, ghost stories, dreams—and sundry kisses and love words—all sufficiently innocent.
