The fact in the history of the Stato to which Rhode Islanders justly point nrHb, the greatest pride^ is thus stated by Mr. Richman, speaking of the Rhode* island of Roger Williams: ** For the first time:* in human history the State had wholly been dl&ociated from church in a common wealUiJiat utopian, but real, k For the first otima the fundamental IdcsUoi. modern civilization—that of rights of man as’ a being responsible primarily to God. iind not to the community—had been given an impulse powerful andvdirect/’ And Mr,

There are some: episodes in her history from which the reader turns with sot-row,, unless he happens to bo of spiritual nlfinlty with the Mathers and those earlier divines whose intolerance led to the founding of Rhode Island, in which case he points to them with glee. Established by refugees from New England, whose eccentricities had made them unwelcome, lhe little commonwealth was peculiarly the " home of lost causes and forsaken neliefs."
