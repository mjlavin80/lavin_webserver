END OF THE BOOK YEAR IN ENGLAND.
A Resume of the Whole Year’s Output—Fewer Books Published Than
in 1904.
With reference to the year just closed, most of them express a fair amount of satisfaction.	_
More books have been sold this year than last. The Spring trade was brisk, the Summer business, in fiction especially, was good, and from the beginning of Fall up to Christmas the demand for new books was excellent.
The number of books published in 1005 was not quite up to the output in 1904. Fiction, biography, ajid reminiscences made up the bulk of the publications, though there was a considerable quantity of historical literature turned out; reprints also were numerous in estimating the quality of the product* Critics seem to be agreed that a large number of interesting books have been turned out. but that few of thorn will live long.

ONDON, Dec. 2D, 1005.—The British publishers have come to the end of the book year for 1905, and for the moment they are practically inactive. Taking Into account the fact that there will he no gooff business in books until the general elections are over, they are in no hurry about making plans for next year’s work.
