‘♦THE PANG-Y ANGER."
EI.MA A- TRAVIS'S new novel with the unlovely title of '* The Pang-Yanger " is a strong but unpleasant book, filled with characters that in real life cne would go far to avoid.
The hero, Abijah Bead, suddenly introduces into the town of Hurstville. where
'	*	9
everybody knows everybody else, a four* year-old boy, whom, without further explanation, he announces as " my son Rob.*' The child bears a startling likeness to the beautiful young wife of a wealthy citizen, a likeness at once perceived by all who have ever seen her, and it is because of this likeness that his father brings him Into the town where the unhappy mother reigns a social queen. It Is evident that .the title of the novel should have been “ The Cad’s Revenge."
The heroine Is a young lady whose chief accomplishment is an all-comprehensive uselessness, and who Is content to live airily upon the charity of relatives, themselves poor. She has been bred an agnostic by her grandfather—In fact, much more than an agnostic, for she and the old gentleman found Col. Ingersoll “ limited—decidedly limited—In his outlook/' not “going far enough to satisfy the scientific mind.” When she loses her temper she declares: *' I'm really no better than a Christian/' This cocksure lass of 20 years is thoroughly up in Herbert Spencer, not seeing how " any rational per-sou ” can refuse to accept his teaching. When she is thanked for saving a child's life, (she says, by the bye, that she “ loathes babies/') her reply Is that *• it was merely an automatic impulse for tho pteservation of the species.”
Undeterred by the knowledge of Abi-jah's past, as by his unmanly vengeance of the present, she mutely but unmistakably offers him her heart, whereupon "Good Lord! " he groaned, “ *tis loving time with her, and, like Titan la, her eyes have chanced to open on an ass."
This hero, detesting the woman who
had deceived him, the mother of his ehlld,
is yet capable of *' holding her to him in a brutal, licentious embrace. Not to the lowest woman on earth would he havo proffered the insolence of such caresscs.” The livid imprints of his savage fingers stood out upon the pallid whiteness of her breast and shoulder.” Not a hero to Invoke enthusiasm, this!
Around the principal figures gather a strongly drawn group, more or less disagreeable. of whom the old doctor, the luroic Zillah, the Innocent, aveDging child, are the most attractive In their human appeal.
It lias been many 3’cars since wo read “ Wuthcrlng Heights/’ but we fancy its influence Is traceable in this book. There is a suggestion of ** Jane Eyrein tho catastrophe brought about by the mad mulatto woman, only a suggestion, for the Bronte Imagination slopped- short of a tragedy so hideous.
It is characteristic of the abnormal lovers that they should becomc tacitly betrothed in a scene so sickening and so terrible as to have crushed all personal feelings out of ordinary human hearts. “ They shuddered as they clung together, f.)r the wind following them up the dark pathway moaned the* death sough of departing souls as their betrothal.*'
As we have eaid, the book is a strong om\ but we are fain to ask “ Cui bono? ** Certainly, it does not leave us the better or the happier for the reading; it does not invoke admiration for the truly admirable; it presents situations repulsive and painful, and we arc glad to think that It falls as a presentation of life.
