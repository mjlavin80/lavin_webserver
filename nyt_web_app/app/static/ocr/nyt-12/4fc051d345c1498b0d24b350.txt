A'cic Vor/c Titnrs Xaturthiff Review of Books:
Apropos of the errors of consistency in fictionists, there is an instance that is rather staggering in n- story by €lr Gilbert Parker, titled " When tho Swallows Homeward Fly," and published in the December issue of The Delineator. A young Englishman is represented as going to the F*a.r North—for some purpose not noted— and outfits at a village on the Sascatche-wan. Here he meets a refined Englishwoman and her daughter. With the latter he falls in love, and while her age is not given, she is represented as< young, with a sweet voice, which is heard tn the village choir. The time of the visit is not given, but the Time is described as modern, with the signs of the progress of civilization even further north than the village.
Tho hero rescifes an old man from the arctic wilds, and brings him to the village of the .Valley of the Sascatchewn'n, whereupon he proves to 'be the husband of th« older lady and the father of the choir-singing sweetheart qf the hero. The old man turns dut tp be one of Sir John Franklin’s men also. Now, since Sir John and his men left England in 184"*, tho young lady would have to be about Gl-years old in this year of grace, and not much younger for the pine stumps of civilization's progress to have been two days* Journey beyond a village on the Sascatehewan. Tills is one of those slips like those of London, Stevenson, and Quiller Couch. The latter has the new moon in the evening, ** shooting her thin horn above the chine of the eastern hills," or some very similar phrase, but ho 'does not found a story all out pf historical i perspective.	*	.	*
