Juveniles That Are Not for Children; Commercial Interest in Books; Some New Editions.
He parents who buy Mr. Arthur Stringer's “ Lonely O’Malley " for their children, In spite of the warning: in The New York Times Saturday Review op books of Sept. 30, should address their complaints to Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin
&	Co.’s *' Educational Department,” which catalogued it with children’s books. In the holiday bulletin it stands between “ Isidro ” and " Rose o’ rhe River," but were it classed as theological, and described as a concrete illustration of original sin, the average parent, seeing the boy pictured on the paper jacket, wouJd purchase it for little Johnny. Similarly the very knowing dog on the cover of a certain thin quarto will probably take it into many a nursery, there to enlighten little Johnny with the^ adventures of a meteoric young woman whose like he will not meet at his mother's tea table. It win be long before parents learn that books can no more be bought by label than preserves or cigars.
