New York Tim*'* Saturday Ilcjictc of Books:
May I venture to reply in your valuable columns to tho charges made by Mr. Alfred Henry Goodwin against Mr. Capen’s book, “ Country Humes of Famous Americans"? It was my very great pleasure to read these articles as they appeared in Country Life in America, and I have also enjoyed their appearance in more permanent form. The implication of Mr. Goodwin that this book is dccadent is as false as it is unnecessary. As a matter of fact, a man’s house rotlcctp his character and his ambition. The book, as Col. Higgin-son says in his admirable introduction, is based upon the principle that no man’s biography is at all complete without some portrayal of tlie house ho lived in. The house, moreover, is sure to represents ht? maintains, to a greater or less degree, not merely the tastes and habits, of his household. but the private background of his public life.
Mr. Goodwin maintains that a man does not live in his house, but that he lives among his books, his friends, and—in Boston. This allegation is based on the theory that the literary world is bounded on the north, south, east, and west by Boston. It is Interesting to state, in connection with this, that some of the most interesting and picturesque features of this book arc the very ones that have escaped the omnipresent New England influence. It may be that it is because I am a Southerner that I resent the insinuation that a man’s set. or literary tradition must set the standard of his work. I for .one am foolish enough to believe that the intimate personal things with which he surrounds himself are more indicative of his , character and his aspiration than anything else. For this reason, therefore, I believe that Mr. Capen’s book not only fulfills a very high purpose in that it gives us a peep into the homes of men we havo learned to love and respect, who have become a part of the very traditions of our lives, but thnt ho has emphasized the unalterable principle that a man’s home Is the best measure of himself, i	JOHN	S.
