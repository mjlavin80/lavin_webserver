Acic York Ti:nc-n Xutunlnrj Rcrinr of Hooka:
If there are among your reariers any bcKUed Christmas shoptv'rs who " don't know what to give," please accord me the space to advise them lo step into the nearest bookshop anti order a. copy of " Kate Greenaway,” published by G. P. Putnam’s Sons. For any one who has a love of art, of childish innocence and dainty gTace, and a sense of beauty, and who likt-s a g^od wholesome biography—a human document dealing with an extremely simple but highly interesting life—thia hook	will	literally	prove "a	thing of
beauty and a joy forever*’’ While the price may seem somewhat high, yet, when one takes into consideration the expensive process by which the beautiful pictures therein are imido, it is not. On the contrary, it is extremely reasonable. One good, rich gift is b*Mter than many giudy, cheap ones, and. furthermore, you will be sure to win the everlasting gratitude of the friend to whom this truly beautiful volume is given.
Eut	let	me add	a word of	warning:
After	you	get the	book, don’t	sit down
voursolf to read it and enjoy the reproduction of Kate Greenaway’s dainty pictures; for if you do you are lost, as you will never want to part with it. I know, because, as the saying goes,	“ I have
just been through the mill."
