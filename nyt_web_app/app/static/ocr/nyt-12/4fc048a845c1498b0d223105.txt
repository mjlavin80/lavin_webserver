SWINBURNE,.
Prof. Woodberry’s New Study of the Poet in the Contemporary Men of Letters Series.*
Written for The New York Times Saturday Revihw
of books by
LEWIS' N. CHASE.
HE latest addition to an excellent series, edited by Mr. Bradley, whose name was accidentally omitted on the title page, is M Swinburne,” by Prof. Woodberry. The book is important not so much because of the accident of its being perhaps the first on the subject to be published in this country as because of an uncommon qualification of the author for his task. It is true he has broad perspective and intimate knowledge, but of greater significance is the affinity of spirit between the poet and his critic. They are spiritually akin, as their printed works show, in such distinct and usually unrelated ways aS affection for children, love of the sea, devotion to scholarship, and faith in the race.
The book is not a biography. It contains no new biographical data, and few of any kind. It is not a study of single poems. Not many more than a dozen are discussed individually, and even then, mainly, as being typically characteristic of the poet. In considering M Tristram of Lyonesse,” Swinburne's " most characteristic poem in * * * all respects, * * * the most representative of his qualities, each at its best
*	* the most imaginative romantic poem of passion * * * in English literature," the writer ia more than half in agreement with Mr. Barlow, contributor to the August number of the " Contemporary.” Prof. Woodberry adds:	The world of Swinburne is well
symbolized by that Zodiac of the burning signs of love that he named in the prelude " to this poem.
The principal sources of Swinburne's literary indebtedness in matter and manner are mentioned. Here again, as in single poems, paucity of detail presupposes some knowledge of the subject on the part of the reader to understand the ramifications of the general statement. Puller illustration, though to be desired, is impossible in the scheme which the writer has followed consistently throughout. It may be further said that simple mention of the men and things that influenced Swinburne is edifying; and it certainly makes a becoming background for the siudy proper, ^t least three names, however, which are commonly referred to in this connection, are missing. ’ One of these is Baudelaire. His name as the inspirer of '* Ave atque Vale ** (to which no direct reference is made) is linked to Swinburne’s by the same bond that links Clough's to Arnold's, Keats' to Shelley's. The lack of personal association which adds sentiment to the other relationships is counterbalanced	by	Baudelaire's	being perhaps,	as has
been claimed, the most potent contemporary influence on Swinburne’s youthful manner.
Many will think the bare suggestion to the Book of Job a too restricted acknowledgement of Swinburne’s use of the Bible. His familiarity with it resulting in the absorption of its pnraseology into his own vocabulary is the more striking in its contrast to	his	well-known	hostility to Christianity
as an institution. This Biblical equipment, not to speak of a certain Hebraic cast of mind, binds him not less than do the several qualities to which tho writer alludes, to English literary tradition. It is hard for the reader to tell whether the omission of Shelley’s name, except in general terms, is due to strict observance of a prescribed plan or to Prof.	Woodberry’s	not . subscribing	to the
belief in	the	similarity of	the two poets.	For it
has been stated by more than one competent critic that Swinburne finds his nearest prototype in English literature in Shelley. To the lay mind this seems plausible. With the possible exception of Coleridge, Shelley alono Is comparable to Swinburne in the music of his verse; both sing the same battle cry of freedom and hatred of kingcraft and priestcraft; they resort to the same classical founts of literary inspiration ; both are dreamers, myth lovers, and deeply spiritual poets. The writer’s silence on this point is to be regretted, as the Judgment of such a distinguished Shelley student would have been authoritative, if not, indeed, final.
The author nowhere claims that this *' Swinburne >f is what it is not; it remains now to outline what it is. it is primarily and almost solely an appreciation of his genius and it is concerned with its quality, not ;

^trith its limitations. Hints of limitations -. are confined, chiefly, to technical mat-’tera. It Is admitted that the poet is not as felicitous in blank verse as in the lyrl-. - cat measures, and although 4‘ perfect in c.’ meter, * • • he is less sensitive to purity s; in structural form. His lyrics are apt ^ to be shortened dramas, his dramas to be -^fragmentary epics, his narrative to be a 1 blepd of lyric passfon and dramatic epf-^ sode.*’ In matters of form, he 14 prefers j.' complexity to siufclencsb, and au ample -. fullness to economy."
! >u. This last phrase is typical of Prof.
V-Woodberry*s attitude when dealing with ■j-rthose traits of Swinburne which have ’ 'met with unfavorable criticism. The ^ poet’s *' ample fullness" has been the r butt of many a sarcasm, when it was not i . designated by that name. That he ; sometimes hard to read is admitted* but instead of attributing this, as is frequently done, to the poet’s Imperfecfty I conceived thought, the Critic explains:
** The main fact is that in the sphere of j
I	natural imagery his mind tends con-stautly to escape from the limited und j particular object into the more abstract primary elements of nature.1'
WHATSOEVER to the unfriendly seems Swinburne's interminable repetition, poem after poem, in the same meter, on the-same theme, is here dignified by the name of *' monotone." Speaking of ** the revolutionary cause. Its monotone, though In part due to the quality of the resonance and to the sameness of the imagery, is essentially emotional, the monotone of profound and unchangeable depth in the feeling itself."
This attitude toward his subject is most effectively shown in Prof. Woodberry *s meeting the charge of “ bookishnoss ” of the poet, of being “ too literary," as he has been called. The writer puts it thus: “ The love of literature is the most fundamental thing in him.'* To style one " too literary *' is uncomplimentary:	to say
** the love of literature is fundamental " is less crude and more tattful, but H amounts to the same thing, at least in Swinburne's case. It is frankly admitted that this trait imparts a ** literary alloy ” to much of his work, that it makes him *' aloof in person, remote in theme, reversionary in art- * * * He is, In fact, ib his greater work of the imagination, remote from current life."
On the other hand, it Is the favorable aspect of this same trait on which the critic dwells longer. He says he supposes " that no English poet has ever had so wide and familiar acquaintance with the poetry of foreign climes. * * • achieved such farall:arity with past literature that his mind became capable or an attitude of contemporaneity toward It.
*	* * He achieves the most genuine appearance of belief in the gods that ha* fallen to the fortune of an English poet. perhaps of any poet in any modern literature. * • * The love of literature gives him a wide domain. Swinburne ia a poet,
*	* * through whom flows the broad stream of the many thoughts of men." In him “ there is • * * the capacity for the passion of life In its largeness.’t-
*.*
THIS is an illustration of the way in which the critic habitually directs attention from the defects of Swinburne’s virtues to the virtues of his defects. It is not special pleading, though it may seem such for the nonce to one a-weary of the poet's ~ ample fuUness,’* It is by no means unreasoned; yet it has the added charm of sympathy suggested above—the charm of rare IntuU tion. It Is an attitude, however, that Is apt to mislead the hasty reader mto the impression that the book is a rhapsody. This is far from the truth. It la mainly an impartial exposition, an interpretation of the poet's pojyers. The writer praises few. if any, characteristics which have not been praised before by other critics of good repute; he never praises what is unpralscwortby; and he never praises indiscriminately or immoderately. He mentions no other poet for purposes of comparison, so exclusively does he hold to his subject—an analysis and an estimate of Swinburne's genius. The following extracts may indicate In brief the nature of Prof. Wood berry's comment on some aspects of Swinburne's work- Of the poet's generosity in praising the critic says:
Swinbui-ne truly is nowhere more the t than in his inexhaustible capacity to moved to hprn worship and the affectionate eulogy of those who * * * seem to be in tne intimacy of genius his own.
The passion is a capacity to hate as well as to love. There is no such master Qt the curse of modern days. He strikes home, * * * and with a volleying * * * of fire and wrath fit to hurl Satan down to the abyss. Th* se are curses to rejoice the heart. The- mark their victims indelibly for-fcfCll.
It is the same poet who has written verses to childhood: "A delicate, inornate, worshipping poo.sy, of which the like in Kngiiph is not Lo be found."
Perhaps the simplest aspect of his genius lies in his revolutionary song-.;.

His nali»iv verse, ;is a whole, d if Ter:'
from the rest of liis work in ire*.don>
from literary taint; hence in It he is mora purely himself. Here, as .In th^*child-hood verse, the personal note is more obvious and apparently stronger than elsewhere. “ The crown of his nature verse Is his ocean poetry." The sea may be considered as the threefold ** nature symbol ** of England, of liberty, and of Swinburne's own genius. And there is no better paragraph in the study than the long one In which this conception Is expanded.
*' The gift of Swinburne 1b to be capable of passion." In another essay, Prof. Wood-berry. has written that ** Burns illustrates
•	* • the element, specifically, of passion " tn the literature of his time. It is plain that tf passion be a salient trait of the one, ft can be applied to the other only with a difference. There U no doubt of its appropriateness to Bums. The difficulty in Its application to Swinburne is tho presence of the ** literary alloy,” of a remoteness from actual life in much
•	* * the element, specifically* of pas-* sion; and also the almost paradoxical fact that In spite of his gift being mainly lyrical, as recent critics agree, thero should be in his voluminous work such a dearth of love poems undeniably expressive of personal feelings
The fact is curious inasmuch as aside from verbal melody a poet Is generally considered lyric only by virtue of personal feeling. It is perhaps, therefore, that Mr. Payne In the “ Belles Lettres Series" declares: '‘Passion this poet has without doubt, and in abundance, but it is the passion of the intellect rather than of the heart" Piecemeal quotation leads to error, and the difference of opinion here is more apparent than real, tor the ; context shows that Mr. Payne's sentence 1 is part of his remonstrance against Swin-bume being considered a poet of passion in the vulgar sense, whereas Prof. Wood- l berry applies the word first to the revo- | lutionary songs where he makes it partly synonymous with enthusiasm.
It may be said here that the authors of the three essays—Mr. Payne, Mr. BarJow, smd Prof. Woodberry—are in substantial agreement in the Interpretation of common matter. This fact lends point to the latter’s contention that in spite of certain superficial mannerisms of style which may distract the attention of the unaccustomed reader, '* the poet’s genius Is one of singular directness." There Is no . one point on which the agreement of these critics is more marked than the conviction that Swinburne is a thoughtful and spiritual poet. Under the general head- 1 iryg *' Fate," Prof. Woodberry comments on this point with unwonted fullness. He traces, step by step, Swinburne’s mental and spiritual growth, the evolution from “ poet of passion" to '* poet of righteousness,** exponent of the religion of humanity. The thought Is compact but clear, and the restilt eminently satisfying.
The critique as a whole is characterized by compactness of thought, notwithstanding Its somewhat poetized diction, .
and there is many a memorable phrase. Generalizations abound. They are usually just, frequently brilliant, and not seldom of inspiriting suggesttvenesa. Since, however, they are unaccompanied by detailed Illustrative matter they may be applicable to too many poems to be appreciated fully by the uninitiated; the work may be too deficient in unfavorable comment to appeal to the unsympathetic: but to those to whom increasing acquaintance with Swinburne Is increasing delight Prof. Woodberry*s little book will be a veritable boon, not only reassuring them in their faith, but affording justification for it	LEWIS	N.
