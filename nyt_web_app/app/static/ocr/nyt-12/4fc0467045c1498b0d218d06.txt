A GREAT WORK ENDED.
Completion of the Jewish Encydo-pacdia—A Remarkable Series-*
ITH tho publication of the twelfth volume of " Tho Jewish' Encyclopaedia ” will be brought to a close a very great work,	the first or sec-
ond, ana easily the largest, work yet recorded of American constructive authorship. We have had cyclopaedias before, but, as a rule, cach new cyclopaedia has been an enlargement of its most recent predecessor. Bat there were no Jewish encyclopaedias to be copied when this present work was begun;	its	plans had to	be drawn, working	plans	prepared; it	had to be con-
structed from the foundations to the roof, with nothing to warn its architects and builders of weak spots to be strengthened, of waste room to be utilized, of crowdcd spaces to be relieved, and with absolutely nothing to guide them toward the furnishing of the places they had prepared.
But the work has been done admirably. If the editors have had to grope their way, there is no sign of their hesitation In the volumes of the work- The undertaking is complete; it has sprung full-grovm from the brains of its editors, ready for its work.
Every one knows that the Jews are everywhere; they are vastly more ubiquitous than the Irish, who. as a fact, are ubiquitous only in English-speaking countries. But the Jew is at home In America, In Europe, in South Africa, in North Africa, even fn China and Japan, and everywhere he is working at something— if not at constructive work, at work that tends to or calls Tor thought, or refinement, in less or greater degree. As the Jewish Encyclopaedia is a record of tho race, one cannot then justly be surprised at the breadth of Its field, though he may well be surprised at the careful cultivation thereof. The cyclopaedia touches on matters of every kind; nothing liumrn is alien to its pages.
WE have noticed the first ten volumes as they appeared; the eleventh and the twelfth volume remain to be spoken of. and the latter, as we have said, is not yet published, though it has long since been completed. Both volumes contain matter of the highest interest, to Gentile as well as to Jew, and -both throw light, if not on dark places, at least on places which have not been so well illuminated in the past as they should have been for the Gentile appreciation of the Jews.
The eleventh volume extends from Samson to Talmid; the twelfth from Talmud to Zunz. In the former we find articles on Samson the Strong, on “ San Francisco/* (where there probably were Jews as early as 3S4C.) and on “ Sanhedrim." 1 The last named is followed by a historical I article on the Great French Sanhedrim, I called together by Napoleon on Feb. 9, I 1S07, under the Presidency of Rabbi
■	David Sinzheim of Strassburg. The San-
thedrim. sat until March 9, holding eight meetings, and then was closed by the President. Its decisions have formed the basis of all subsequent laws of tho French Government in regard to the re, ligious affairs of the Jews, down to the

recent laws agiiinst any establishment of religion, "Satan” is the subject of an Interesting short study; a very ablo and thought-provoking article on " Saul of Tarsus ” is to be noticed, describing Saul (Paul) from the Hebrew standpoint. Of course the Christian cannot -be expected to accept its correctness, but its perusal
cannot but broaden his views of the Apostle to the heathen.
A BRIEF notice of the “ Shabbat Goy,” the Gentile who lights the firo for orthodox Jews on tho Sabbath, contains the statement that Maxim Gorki, the recently famous Russian novelist, was once such a Goy in Kherson and Yekater-inoslav. A pseudo Messiah is described at length in the article on "Shebbethai Zcbj,” the son of a poultry dealer of Smyrna, who was born in 1C2G, declared himself the Messiah in 164S, and was finally banished from Constantinople, where he had devised a combined Judaism and Islam, to Dulcigno, where he died unnoticed. His is a curious story, interestingly told here. The ** Shadchan," or shatcban, or marriage broker, is a character among the Jews well known In this city, and is a figure in literature. The " Shckitah,” or ritual slaughter of animals, is fully explained here with curious reproductions of old Gorman prints. Important is the articlc oil ** Shc’elot u-Teshubot/* the answers made by learned rabbis to questions put to them in writing on matters of belief, ritual, scientific knowledge, the Bible, the Talmud, and the Mishnah. The Eighteen Blessings, which form the second important section of the daily prayers, are discussed in a ’ong article entitled “ She-moneh Esreh," while in “ Shem ha-Mefor-ash " the unpronounceable name of God is considereG. This name was .not unpronounceable because it was forbidden to be pronounced, but because, when immorality had become prevalent, the high priest uttered it in a low tone, lest unworthy persons should hear it; in the earlier and purer days he had pronounced it in a loud voice.
A curious Jewish custom is noted under “ Shinnuy ha-Shem." This is the changing of a person’s namo as an aid to recovery from illness. The reason Is that the Angel of Death is ordered to take a certain person; if now that person’s name bo changed, the decree cannot bo put Into effect, and the sick person may escape death. The connection between the Sinbad of the “ Arabian Nights ’’ and the Jews is not apparent at first glancc; but the article on the famous traveler shows that It exists. Articles of consequence found In this volume deal with socialism, arid the Jews in relation to it; with Solomon, with South Africa, with Spain—at length; and with Baruch Spinoza, later Benedict do Spinoza. Tho frontispiece of the volume is a remarkable portrait of the philosopher, from an unpublished painting owned by the well-known historical Writer Mayer Sulzberger of Philadelphia. Other articles are on statistics, on the rising and tho setting of the sun—which has to do with the 'beginning and the ending of festivals, and Of the Sabbath, and differs in every place of the globe; special tables are given for many places in this country and Europe —and Synagogue, this last named being illustrated with pictures of important synagogues, as well as with plans and interior views.

THE volume contains the biographies of a number of well-known persons— of the Schiffs, one of the oldest of Ashkenazim families; the Seltgmans, tho Solas, a Sephardlc family dating from the eighth or ninth century in Toledo and Navarre; the Speyers, Stelnitz the chess player, (there is an article in an earlier volume on chess and its Jewish masters;) Sutro of gold-mining fitme, and Alfred Sutro, the dramatist.
Forty pages of the twelfth volume are taken up by the article on the Talmud and its commentaries, and " Targum M Is treated, if at less length, with little less detail. A six-page list of Jewish scholars ia to bo found In the article ** Tannaim and Amorajm"—an enlightening list, which could not be matched in the Christendom of tho time. ** Temple *’ covers twenty pages, and describes tn detail,*' with Illustrations, the temples of the Jews from the first to the last. Reformed Judaism is considered in an earlier volume; under the title *' Thedlogy,” the twelfth volume sets forth the view of the orthodox Jew on the subject of theology; The history of Jewish printing appears briefly in the article ** Typography/’ which traces the development of the art;
& complementary article ia on M Title Pages.’*
The Jewish doctrine or uncroan rood has -been ascribed by some scholars to the prevalence of totemlsm among the Jews early in their history; the suggestion is made, for example, that the swine was the totem of an early family, which consequently would not cat pork, and that from this and similar cases sprang up the difference between clean and unclean animals. How this suggestion appears to Jewish scholars may be seen from the article on *' Totemism.” '* Trade Unionism " is another very complete * article; the Jewish workman is a natural unionist, as we in this city know.

travelers; if one wishes to obtain an idea of the debt he need but turn to the article ** Travelers.*’ Columbus had a Jew In his crew, though the latter has not contributed to the world’s knowledge of itself.
The " Lost Tribes " are tho subject of an article which contains the reproduction of a curious picture setting forth the supposed order of march of the tribes from Palestine to—Japan! Here attention , may properly be called again to the illustrations of the work. No pains have been spared to obtain illustrations that illus-I trato, maps, plans that bear on the subjects treated. The Spinoza portrait In the eleventh volume is but one example of the care with which this branch of the work has been carried out. Another ;n-st-ince fs the composite portrait of a number of Jewish lads living in this city,
, in an endeavor to illustrate the Jewish type. The result is interesting.
The most important article in the twelfth volume is that on the United States by several writers. It treats of Jewish immigration, the Jews in their rc-la tion to the Federal Government, edu-! cation, philanthropy, civil and political rights, their position in the arts and : sciences, their social condition, of Russian Immigration; and ends with full -statistics of the race here—an inspiring and illuminating article, with pertinent illustrations and maps. “ Universities *' is an interesting articlc, “ Vegetarianism" ^iunong Jews, of course,! and “ Wine," with reference to prohibition, are also of Interest. Whereas Christians believe that “ in Adam's fall we sinned all,” and that thsy are conceived in original sin, the Jew believes in original virtue—a re-verse-view of atavism, set forth succinctly in an article here. The Wandering Jew and Zionism are discussed at length, the latter subject occupying almost as many pages as the article on the United States. The volume, like its prcdcccssors, is rich in biography. Some of the important Jewa named are Valabregue-Mardoche, chief of the French staff four years after the Dreyfus agitation; the Warburg family, the Kev. Dr. Isaac M. Wise, founder of the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati; Zangwill, Zola, and Zunz.
The brief list of a few of the more important articles in these two volumes indicates what a wealth of information is contained in this encyclopaedia, of interest equally to Jew and Gentile.
