Three Cheerful Books—Bret.Marte’s ' Daughter in Boston.
AD this been any week in the year except that immedlate-
-	ly preceding Christmas Boston would have talked and thought of little' but „Dr. Osier and M Counsels and Ideals," for-it is a work after ‘ Boston's own heart; a hook on conduct, and further £11 a subtle, indefinable way, probably the effect of tlie author’s professional training, it recalls Dr. Holmes's work, and Boston has not yet forgotten to miss her “.Autocrat." Composed of extracts deliberately chosen by the editor, Dr. Camac,- to revive the Influence of his teacher, Dr. Osier, upon his mind, the book serves the layman well enough, and the layman's wile fairly revels in what
to her Is gossip about doctors, even to the advice to physicians not to believe the stories told by patients about other physicians, even although they know the
stories to be true.
Meanwhile Dr. Osier, having resigned his Oxford position, is coming home, and will arrive here Sunday in time to spend Christmas with his wife’s family, the Reveres, and to be present at the Revere reunion.

*' Counsels and Ideals *' will not be quite alone Christmas week, for a fortunate accident or two so hastened the production of Mr. Aaron Slartin Crane's " Right and Wrong Thinking " that it appeared in the shops Wednesday with the full imprint of the Lothrop, Lee & Shepard Company. With it was Miss Coletta Ryan s ” Songs from, a Sun Garden,” published by Messrs. Herbert B. Turner and dedicated to Mr. Charles IS. Hurd, gentlest and kindest of critics, now slowly coming back to his Transcript work after his long illness. Miss Ryan's verses are unequal In merit, but religious topics always bring her genuine inspiration and her faults do not come from the fashionable folly of imagining that a trochec or an iamb may be made spondaic by merely willing them so to be. Her poem, " Hope," with its indomitable cheerfulness, would please Dr. Osier and Mr. Crane equally, and really three cheerful books at once indicates an advance since the season when " John Percyfield " was the one hopeful book of its month.

Mrs. Jessamy Harts Steele, daughter of the late Mr. Bret Harte, is visiting in Boston, and is giving drawing room readings from her father's books and following the London fashion of impersonating the supposed speaker as closely as possible. Mrs. James T. Fields, after her pleasant custom, was among the first to welcome her, and her 'success seems assured.

Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. have had to prepare new editions of Col. Hig-ginson’s " Part of a Man’s Life," of Mr. Mims's ** Sidney Lanier,” and of Mr.
Henry James’s’*' Question of Our Speech M and 44 English Hours.” The season for buying fairy bpoles has brought a demand for	Sarah Cone Bryant's “ How to
Tell stories ’* for the present nursery fashion demands that mothers shall tell stories to their children instead Of reading them.
■ •** .
Messrs. L. C. Page & Co. have received notification from Mr. Nathan Galllzier, author of “ Castel del Monte/' thoit he In preparing a second book to be entitled “The Sorceress of Rome." It is a story of the eleventh century, a period concerning which the historical novelist has hitherto troubled himself but little.
**•
Messrs. Herbert B. Turner & Co. have a novel by Air. Richard Le Qallienne in preparation—a story in the pleasant vein of these later days since ne lost his ambition to be an English Maudle.	.
♦** * Messrs. Luce & Co. have made arrangements with Messrs. ^Foulis & Co. to publish the American edition of the Spirit of the Age Series, a set of twelve biographies, of which the first three, " Irving," " Whistler," and " R. L. S.,” will appear immediately. The " Irving" is from the pen of Mr. Haldane McFall and is illustrated by a very recent portrait and pictures by Mr. Gordon Craig, Miss Ellen Terry’s son. ** R. L. S." is written by Miss Evelyn Blantyt* Simpson, author of “ R. L. Stevenson's Edinburgh Days,” and daughter of Sir James Simpson, th5"* discoverer of chloroform. The *' Whistler " biography will be illustrated by a portrait and reproductions of Whistler pictures.
Messrs. Luce & Co. are also preparing ** The Girl in Waiting,” by an English authoj-. It is a light and lively story, intended to amuse, not to Instruct. The Foolish Almanack is proceeding rapidly to another edition, .which will appear in January.
*•*
Messrs. Little, Brown & Co. have sent *' The Breath of the Gods *’ to its third printing; *‘ The Wood Carver of ’Lym-pus ” to its tenth, and “ II Libro d’Oro," Mrs. Alexander's translation of legends of the saints, to its second. The appearance of this book has recalled stories of the days when Mr. Alexander, then one of Boston’s best portrait painters, used to take his daughter “ Francesca ” to the Boston Athenaeum to study and copy such pictures as he thought best for her to know. Once inside the vestibule doors the young girl paused and her father carefully bandaged her eyes and led her up the stairs, and through the galleries to the one picture which he wished her to see, and so she began her work with no disturbing influence in her mind. Those were the days when fathers had wills of their own and girls were docile, and electives were unknown.
Mrs. Alicia K. Van Buren, the author of M As Thought Led," published by Mr. Richard G. Badger, is a Louisville woman, a member of that club to which. “ Anne Warner ’* and Mrs. Alice Hegan Rice belong, but she spends her Summers in Brookline and her Winters In
Florida.	„
