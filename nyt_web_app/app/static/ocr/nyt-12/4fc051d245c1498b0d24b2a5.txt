Thin paper. If it has not revolutionized
the book trade, has certainly given it a
" boost.” From the old-time English
three-volume novel—in three volumes
whether it were by George Meredith or
the Duchess—to the, modern single-volume
edition of the greatest classic, is a long
step, made' possible by the use of thin
paper. " Bible paper '* has proved its
value in profane a3 well as In sacred literature.	-
A recent issue of good, books. in cheap and convfenlent form due to this excellent thin paper Is Crowell's Thin Paper Classics (Thomas Y. Crowell & Co., New York; 20 volumes.) The series Is well selected, and' contains several of the books that the world is willing to call
11	the best,'* all well printed—more than well printed; excellently printed—in large -type on thin but opaque paper, so that —though there may be from five to eight hundre<lpages in a volume, it Is never too large to sl:p easily into one's overcoat pocket or muff. The books are bound in flexible leather, red, blue, or dark green; and certainly there can’ be no more grateful present to a person who has to travel than one or more or the dainty volumes ol this vei^ attractive series.
