What a preat Christmas story ** Tho House of Mirth ” is to tho weary modern who, perforce, must have his stories made over to the present time. It matters little what be the ancient year or place. How sure is its appeal to that very part of our modern specialism that looks with skepticism on that story of how a mere maternity should make the world stop and listen.	.
Anti yet the very part of the book that showers back on our aching heads the soft waters of humanity is the very part that comes very near to the eleventh vtree of Matthew:
“ And when they were come into the house they saw the young child with Mary, hLs mother, and fell down and worshipped him.”
Wo have spent several hours with Edith Wharton. She has taken us like a curator to her museum, where wc have examined* with wonder at their preservation spec* muiis so hardened in the fluids of sf Irish ness I hat nothing of the human vitality will ever more grace them. She h i3 led us, also, out into the vivisecting room, where, chained and fettered humans like Carrie Fisher and Rosedale still struggle to breathe and live, but who, etherized by elegance, drugged with refn^ment, and having tho sphygmo-griiphs of social success register every pulse beat of their little hearts, they can only hope to struggle empirically against tho perfumed essences of the drugs extracted from the weeds of Life. Where is the uplift? The smell of the laboratories. Tii" odor of the pharmacological experiments has benumbed us. Where shall wc look for something that shall mean a boon to tho pains of the daily pessimism? Was it Selden’y love in idleness? W:is it Gc rty Parish's colorless deniai? Was it Lily Bart's courageous fight? It might bo any of these, but. in fact, to the many thnt read about Lily Bart and her nursery, the great thing that endeared her to all of us, made her " Oh! so human,” "Oh! so one of us,” whether that was a climber on th*1 outskirts of the splendid, magnificent, glittering domain or a lonely sliof girl gazing over her assortment of dolls :ind hearing only the clink and whirr ot‘ th*£ cash as it traveled’quickly by—was thin touch of the wise men and the mange"	■
** Such a vision of the solidarity of life h id never before come to Lily. She had a piemonition of it in the blind emotions of her mating instinct, but they had*been cheeked by the disintegrating influences of the life about her. All the men and women she know wf're like atoms whirling away from each oth^r in some wild centrifugal dance; her first glimpse of th<: continuity of life had come to her that, evening in Nettie Struthor’s kitchen."
