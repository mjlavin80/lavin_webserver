LTHOUGH nearly all the publications Issued at this season of the year have their gift features prominently emphasized, there art* some in which these features are entirely dominant even when the literary material employed has indi-virtually a high und accepted value-pictorial, de luxe, and bookish settings Tor the classics and for those new texts whose Intrinsic worth la measurably increased by holiday garb. Here, therefore. Is some mention of certain books of these two categories, which have not received pre-Ylous individual mention;
The illustrations of that excellent English artist C. E, Broek delicately and sympathetlaUly enhance the artistic value of a set of “ Dickens’s Christmas Books " and George pilot’s " Sltns Marnor," (E. P. Dutton & Go.) The first consists of three little volumes—" A Christmas Carol," “ The Cricket on the Hearth." and "The Chimes "—inclosed in a box bound in robin's egg blue, on which arc embossed little fleur-de-lya. The illustrations are in color ar.d in pen and ink- The George Eliot volume Is bound in pale green and stamped in old gold. For this Mr. Brock has made twenty-four pictures in color. Possibly there may be some readers who are unfamiliar with this artist's work, although thp pictures he once made for an edition of " The Essays of Eifa" have been widely praised; the very fact that Lamb's masterpiece should hare furnished him with pictorial material | U a tribute to his imagination. H« has a most delicate way of setting off v.liul is " old-fashioned '* through a rare combination of ia vender, old rose, pea greens, and pale yellows superimposed on examples of most careful and suggestive draughtsmanship.
ARKPRINT of Charles r.f'ver'F novels. (edition or iR7ii.) with tho original pen-and-lr.k drawings of “ Phiz.’' (The Macmillan Company, $1.2T> each,) will be welcome to those who never tire of reading the adventures of Harry Lorrequcr and Charles O'Malley and other Irish' worthies who are ready to make love at the swish of a dress or fight at the drop of a hat. These volumes .nicely setting off. through modern paper and binding, the pictorial and typographical effects Of the original editions, are
appropriately bound in rcreen cloth, with covers stamped In gold with a monogram.
A particularly seasonable volume Is entitled " Christmas Carols, Ancient anJ Modern," edited by Joshua Sylvestre and illustrated from the masters whose paintings depict early Christmas scenes. Thj editor gives the history of this most interesting phase of folk-song development, and at the beginning of each carol Is, in so far as the truth is known, a brief story of Its origin and the events through Which it has come down to us, "In Ex-celsis Gloria," " God Rest Ye,. Merry Gentlemen," ** Last Night As X Lay Sleeping." ' and many others have their particular stories which form part of the life of a people. The volume is appropriately designed, and is offered In an attractive box with emblems of evergreen and ringing bells. (A. Weasels & Co. $1.)
A ChrsUn&s offering of literary and artistic significance is a cheaper, one-vol* ume edition of F. Marion Crawford’s ** The Rulers of the South," with the new title, " Southern Italy and Sicily." The book is printed from the original plates and includes the hundred drawings made by Henry Brokman, (The Macmillan Co. $3.) It is perhaps not generally known that the frontispiece is a picture of Mr. Crawford's own tower on the coast of Calabria, on the upper floor of whieh 1m* does most of his Summer literary work when tourists invade his Sorr^ntine villa.
At Iasi, tbijt ever mysterious and intellectually burdened vagrant, Gforg'j Borrow, has an edition of which his own approval would certainly be enthusiastic (G. P. Putnam's Sons). It is presented in five Ions lCmo volumes—"Tin: Bible in j Sp:’fn," *' Lavengro," " Romany Rye,*' ! “The Gypsies of Spain,"’ and "Wild ] Wales"—bound In limp leather, stamped !
Iwith fac-simtle autograph and edited by William I. Knapp, author of "Tho Ljfv , of George Borrow." The paper employed | is "B.ble sheet." thin but opaque. Tlu-iv ! are beautiful frontispieces-etchings, pho- j togravures, mezzotints—by A. H. II, Mur- ! ray, A. S. Hartrick and other:-. Th>-texts are all complete and author>/.<_d. AU the formerly suppress^.*! mutter will bo found therein.	j
POSSIBLY the task undertaken by Sarah Hawks Sterling in attempting to reproduce the youth of Shake- j speare through the Illusion of a story at- ] tributed to his wife is not so difficult as | that worked out by Dr. MHohell in h{s j “ Autobiography of Washington." but the resuit is quite satisfactory in " Shakespeare's Sweetheart,’* {.George W. Jacobs
& Co.) Five yfc-;\s after tbe dramatists death Mistress Shakespeare Is supposed to be visited by Ben Jonson at her home in Stratford, and by him the former Anne Hathawuy is importuned to write about the times of hep husband’s courtship* when she once went up to London in disguise and saved a play by performing the rdle of Cesario. Even for the close student of Elizabethan England the story produces a splendid illusion of reality, so delicately conceived and sympathetically executed that the mere authenticity of data presents no obstacles to thorough enjoyment. It is one of those rare expressions of visualization which forms a st ory ihtLt ought to be true simply because there is no proof to the contrary,
" Many of WiIVs comrades, after he had a home of bis own, were invited to enjoy his hospitality, and so I met again stately Burbage, and comical Kompe, kindly Jonson, and reckless Marlowe, young Greene, and the rest. Not one of them, however, ever rccognlsed Cesario., the page, in Anne Shakespeare, the matron—" and so the story ends.
The little volume has a ftting dress, with Illustrations in two colors and delicate, suggestive decorations.
WILLIAM MORRIS’S "The Earthly Paradise" is appearing In four 12m o volumes, bound in cloth. With gilt tops, (Longmans, Green & Co. $5.) The work is edited by J- W. Mac-kail. who writes the introduction ap-taring in Vol. I. He furnishes some biographical data about Morris, and tells the story of this largest and most important of his poetical works. It was inSpired, it may be recalled, by Chaucers ** Canterbury Tales." There are two dozen stories, two for each month of the year. Half or them are talcs of ancient Greece, the other twelve being stories current throughout Western Europe during the same period—of the time of Edward III. of England. Some of these stories arc to be found In tfVe.nch and German romances, others In Norse or Icelandic sagas, and some In Arabian tales, many of them having been known In Europe long before they were collected Into the " Book of the Thousand and One Nights," "The Earthly paradise ^ presents its author's idea of " true " poetry—
" the skilfully designed construction, and tbe furnishing with beautiful and appropriate ornament of a house of tales, in which the reader may find shelter, enjoyment, and rest." as Mr. Mackail puts it,

Boards, with parchment back, and title stamped in gold. New York and Boston: HOughton, Mifflin & Co.)

with the Fisherman and How They Built the Canoe,” by Emily Foster Day. with Illustrations and border decorations by Spencer Wright. The sub-title gives an i
Idea of the/Story. The M6n€hun6s are a mysterious little people of the rocks, but the ancient folklore of the Islands is full of talfes of their " wonderful" works.

The morning after the fisherman received his canoe and went to find his father. The illustrations are lii different tints of brown, and illustrate the various parts of the tale. (Thin 16mo.

R. Hebcr Newton’s *’ ethical and spiritual interpretation M of Wagner’s masterpiece. " Par Bilal,” which ai the time of production troubled theatregoers because It was denounced by eminent clurgymen, was originally an address delivered at a private party. It was afterward read before tbe Actors’ Church Alliance and then at the Summer School in Upland Farms. LuIct it was expanded and published In two numbers of Mind. Until finally it was put into book form. <Long thin 8vo. Pp. 70. Cloth. Oscawana-on-the-Hudson: Upland Farms Alliance.) The author has made no attempt at a musical criticism of " Parsifal," but has simply
tried to interpret the work ethically und spiritually in two chapters dealing with *• Parsifal: Its Involution Through the Life ar.d -Work or Richard Wagner," and "Parsifal:	The Outcome of the Life-
Work Of Richard Wagner." His purpose has been to interpret the play so that genuine music lovers and devout Christians would be enabled to enjoy it with ** a conscience \*oid of offense." The volume is a very effective piece of bonkmak-tns.
