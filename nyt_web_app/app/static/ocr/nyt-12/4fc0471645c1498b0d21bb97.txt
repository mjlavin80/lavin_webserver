A'cto York Times Saturday r.furctc of BcoM:
Among the reviews of the holiday books for children I observed on Friday that one which your reviewer placed under the head of ** Sterilized Fairy Tales.” Who shall say that any fairy book is to be spurned for lack of literary merit in these days when the story* not the style, seems to be the thing most desired?
To my way of thinking, as I read the criticism on Dr. Kolle’s '* Fifty and One Tales," published by the Grafton Press, there was very much in this volume to remind one of the homely lore of Hans Christian Andersen himself, who also was much laughed at in his own country when he first began to spin those immortal yarns about “ The Girl Who Stepped on Bread *' and “ The Kins Without Any Clothes." To see whether I wore right or not in my surmise, t took the trouble to secure a copy and scan these tales for myself. As a result I have this to say: That while the literary merit may not he equal to the classics, yet there is a value to Dr. Kolle’s collection deeper than appears to the casual reader. They are especially adapted to the needs of very young children, to lead them Into happy ways of doing and thinking. In spite of the adverse remarks of the critic who is looking for literary skill, I will venture to say that parents will be very glad to read to their little ones with budding intellects Lhc tale of the " Quarrelsome Knives,” who gave over fighting and settled down into a peaceful pair of scissors, for it is a most comical conceit. Very amu.-ing also is the idea of planting' a feather and growing a little yellow chick, while most charming is the history of the little star who was so curious about the earth that it could not be satisfied in Its place in the sky, but insisted on letting go, and fell through the air till it dropped into the ocean, where it turned into a poor little starfish and had to live ever after in the dark waters. Very quaint is the tale of liow the poor ugly oysters sympathized with the sorrows of the mermaids and gathered their tears, only to have them turn into pearls afterward.
Surely there is a time and place for sweet little conceits like these, and that is in early childhood, before the gold-shine and sllvershine are worn off of everything and we become cynics and critics. Whatever the literary merit or demerit, it Is the story that remains to gladden us all our days.
