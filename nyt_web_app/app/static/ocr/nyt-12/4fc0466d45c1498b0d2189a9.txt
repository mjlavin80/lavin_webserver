ITERS on the history of n	Rlffl	American art as well as	on
|Sfl ¥S wltl	American literature have	not
yot dared to apply to their subject the same measure of criticism which they	un.	hesitatingly employ in,	np-
praising-a rUstically or Intellectually— European arts and literature. And it is often asked:	Why	do Americans cling
so persistently to tho untutored, the unimaginative, the undictinctive in literature and art, when foreign possessors of similar attributes are remorselessly consigned to oblivion? Of course, tho genuine answer would be that the history of the arts of expression in this country is so very brief that the employment of most names is excusable, in order^ to make a volume of respectable size:	The
usual answer is that our prominent nonentities of the past really stand for something excellent—for the incipient inspirations and formative influences Fa ter availed of.and developed by our real masters. The .defense of this admirable theory usually occupies nine-tenths of the space In volumes devoted to the -history of American art and letters.
Hr. Samuel Jsham has done better; he is to be congratulated that in his ** American Painting ” (The Jttacmlllan Company. Cloth. 8vo. $3 net.) he has measurably reduced thb usual portion- Moreover he freely implies that he might have made a still further reduction were It not for the fact that his readers may find it pleasant to recall the surroundings in which some1 of the earlier painters struggled in vain effort to express something where there was nothing to express. A similarly implied avowal also explains and excuses the dsproportionato space allotted to the rise and development of the National Academy of Design, to the defunct and forgotten Art Union, to the Dusseldorf Gallery. On the other hand, Mr. Isham waves a deprecatory gesture over the great exodus of American artists and the latest feverish activity— ihants to improved methods in Chromolithograph y and the discovery of - the three-color process—in . magazine illustrating, and tacitly admits that no single volume could contain adequate appreciation of them and their work. But of coarse men like Abbey, Sargent, F. D. Millet. J. McC. Hamilton, and other painter personages receive full and appreciative- notice, and in the closing chapters of the book we have an admirable series of revie'ws of what has been done latest and best in l.mdseupe, marine, figure, and portrait '-jointing, and mural decorations.
Hence, with the background of American painting relegated to convention and tradition and only lugged in on the plea of civic, patriotic, or popular compulsion, aijd the foreground made brilliant with a wealth ot achievement in which individual force—save in celebrated cases—is almost obliterated Or perfunctorily sKetehed, one naturally-looks to Mr>-JL£iiam for a serious and exhaustive consideration of the middle ground—the revival period of tliir-ty-five years ago, when a National art, which was neither made up of foreign imitations nor of a maudlin native sentimental is:n. assw.rJ itself—wlu*n marines f'tased to be nautical impossibilities; r vj scapes. <:• '1( r< '] diagrams, figures, liieless; port rail s. unconsciously exaggerated caricatures. Hfp\ indeed, the author devotes miiny pages to the social aspect of art, to the* increase of Intercourse among artists, the benefits of clubs .and exhibitions. a::C: to those individual ‘ artists, who, since then: have attained National and even world-wide reputations —palmers liKe Whistler and La Furge. Still, here as in the foreground, the tout ensemble remorselessly dims or obscures indnidual endeavor and result, Gaugcn-geigle, Pritchard, Kxcurgcon, Landsel are not even mentioned—possibly because they hail from the provincial town of Boston.
The truth -is that Mr. Isham has written a book about New York painters with passive sympathy for tradition and convention and with some reference to the development of art in the whole country. H is jusi such a book as one might cx-pect from an artist bom and brought up in New York City, from a Director of the American Fine Arts Society, from a treasurer of the Society , of American Artists—a writer artist whose conception of art as expressed by American painters is practically limited to the annual exhibitions of-the National Academy of Design.

A QUARTO volume of less than two hundred pages is not inconvenient to carry around with one if the cover be pliable as is that of the Famous Art Cities Series, of which a new book (" Florence,” b * Adolf Philippi, translated by P.

ALL persons who are accustomed to receive picture postal cards from ,	Italy are now familiar, If never be-
j fore, with those panels called ** The Days . and Hours,” by Raphael, although the , symbolical meanirg of the design may I cavse them some trouble to look up. In a I thin quarto by Rachel A. La Fontaine I (New York: The Grafton Press,) we have presented fair half-tone reproductions of the pictures with explanatory text on the pages facing them, together with the two most famous portraits of the artist. The autnor believes that the volume will well serve persons ** wjio may not have* access to larger and tfJore comprehensive works." It is a well-made book—very conveniently effective in binding and pagination, while by no means superlatively artistic.

IT has of late been the effort of certain art publishers to* brins out biographies of well-known artists, accompanied with reproductions of their work which should have both intrinsic, and artistic value and be useful as studies for the art student. present this piQ-torial combination in the most finished manner has been the constant labor of George Newnes of London, many of Whose publications are imported here by Charfes Scribner’s Sons. He has now begun a new series, Modem Master Draughtsmen, which promises to surpass anything hitherto issued, If one ihay judge from the first three volumes at hand—" Sir E. J. Poynter,’* by Malcolm Bell; "Rossetti,” by T. Martin Wood, and 14 J. M. Swan,’* by A. L. Baldry. (New York: Imported by Charles Scribner’s Sons. $2.50 net each.)
T ie textual accompaniments have been i written by the above-named authors with a si ccial view to define, analyze, and explain the technique of their subjects as draughtsmen. Mr. Bell draws ’especial attention to the plastic structural method in the figures ot Sir Edward; Mr. Wood naturally dwells at length upon Rossetti’3 overcrowding of detail, his eloquence of line, and his subdued but varied harmony in color; Mr. Baldry shows how Swan has applied realism, to depicting the types of the lower animal world. In each case the schdol and formative influences of the artist are set forth, followed by his individual characteristics in drawing, studies. Then come the'pictures themselves. Theso are fac simile in everything -color, tint, values—save size. In every case even the hue and fabric of the orig:nal board, paper, or canvas are faithfully reproduced. Some of the pencil and chalk sketches by Sir Edward are such marvelous specimens of lithography—or whatever the process be—that they might be detached from the book and framed as originals, defying all but microscopic examination. And as they are “ true" copies they also furnish the student with sfudles which oijly need a skillful and sympathetic interpreter to be uneqnalea examples of inspiring models.

CONTINENTAL 'picture dealers are particularly lavish this year in the pictorial feature of their catalogues. Two brochures have come to hand from Frederick Muller & Co. of Amsterdam, which are fine examples in this department of art publication. One Is descriptive of the Werner Dahl collection, sold Oct. 17, and the other of the Ladislaus Bloch collection, -dispersed Nov. 14. The lif»! of the famous l);is-&nl0orf jsrUcct-u* is particularly strong in the Dutch school of the seventeenth century, which produced many admirable painters, whose work, although of very high character, was not individual enough to elude the shadow cast on it by the great contemporary masters. Fine specimens of canvases by De Bloot, Ter Borch, Van Ostade, Van Goyen. were In this collection, and are finely reproduced In half-tone (sepia) in the catalogue. The Bloch col-
leci^on^oflVlenna wa^_ simtlar iri 'charac-tear, but.■ It also ~lncl\ided some Dutch paintings'after the English portrait'and landscape school of the. seventeenth century and some specimens of pupils’ work. Zeeman, E. De 'Witte, Heda, Jan i>e Grott, Fllnck, and their lesser known yet excellent compatriots appear in this catalogue, which also has admirable reproductions tn sepia Inked half-tones.
