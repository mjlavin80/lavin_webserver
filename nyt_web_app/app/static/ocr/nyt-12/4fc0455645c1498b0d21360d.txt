The Strong Impression^ALade by “ Tbe Hoase of Mirth ** Shown in tbe Discussion It Provokes.
I.
New York Times Saturday Ticcicw of Books:'
F you will kindly spare me space for a peaceful response to the choleric communication of “ a strong adherent of Mrs. Wharton^ signed Lenox, in your Issue of the 25th,	I	promise that this shall be my
last word. I assume that the purposes of a novel are manifold and manifest. It should have plot enough to enable one nobly to resist the Impulse to read the last chapter first; it should mirror wKh precision the manners, motives, and. rcpr-als of the dramatis personae of its set,
(using that word in Its theatrical sesse,) but, as the good outnumbers the bad in atysocictics outride of Sing Sing, it should not present only the wicked and the weak, unless the author deliberately desires to convey a wrong impression; it should be constructed with that fine art which detaches the reader from the writer and which saturates the former with interest In the fortunes of the characters between the covers. Here lies, to my mind, one of the inherent and Irremediable defects in “ The House of Mirth." It is so Whartonesque ttuii the point cf view of the author is always in evidence; her hand can ever be .teen pulling the strings of her puppnU; she draws her creations so fine that her own personality shines through. Who thinks of Henry Harland when r^admg ** The Cardinal’s Snuffbox,” or considers ISJincr Glyn when sharing ** The Reflections of Ambro-sine " V 1 < says that “the inner circle of	which	it	(th*-	book)	por-
trays r.iil i«' quick to «'■*(? mid to recognize." 1 ha\'_> heard some speculation as to tho prototypes of. Mrs. Wlnrvm's men and women, but no two people agree; admitting, however, If L< rex llkcr., that they are silhouettes, that se.-ms to me a minor matter. The point is that Mrs. Wharton sees the worst tile and exploits only that. Confessing that society has its spotted sheep. Its scandals, its divorces, why not leave its skeleton in the closet whjn addressing a larger audience? Society embraces but a very small portion of the American people. Why mislead the masses by bearing before them only the sciled linen of the Four Hundred? Mrs. Wharton knows as well as i do that there are scores among that select band whose lives and loves furnish abundance of color and suggestion for a healthy, happy story, without digging into the sinks and seweni and turning the public searchlight on the poorest specimens of a much-misunderstood class. In society, we regale ourselves with the latest scandal about Mrs, X,, but wc don't shout it out in a Subway car. It is a case of *' noblesse oblige."
Then, tco, the motif hangs on improbable situations. Lily Bart is the kind to get into finsncial hot water, but her social smash is brought about by being •‘spotted," under unlikely conditions, by the right person at the wrong time. We say it is a small world, that coincidences are commcn, that the walls have ears, but it seems like overloading Fate to make Lily run into Iiosedale as she comes out of Sclden's flat, not to mention brushing up against Mrs, Haffen: to place Se'.dcn and Van Alstyne just .ii Trenor’s door as Lily emerges alone ’ midnight; while the yacht business more plausible than probable. Cn t! • three p?gs Lily's min misfortunes h;j..^, and molhir:ks the situations strained to support tlr' s'ory. The money muddle with Trem.r ^r-rr.^ quite likely, but Lily makes out a f lir cefo’iso on Page 134, and Mrs. Wharten adds that " she was too genuinely ignorant of the manipula-£ tions of the slock market to understand." I am rather confounded with the enigmatical remark of Lenox, apropos of the last chapter, about losing that delicious sense of appreciation which comes with a knowleige of true literature.” It seems to the plain American that, as Lily and Selden of:en met for yenrs. and as frequent reference is made tn her reliance upon his complete power of comprehension, they might have " become known to each other" without waiting until she was dead.
One suspects that my assignment by L* nox to Amazonian ranks is a tactical move u> l;* r:*rr precise information as to my sex. ar.d 1 regret to inform Lenox that her <-p- nir-g hazard is a losing one. And. having l-nown ;md loved the rral Lenox for fcriy years. I also regret that her sclf-christen. d namesake shosiin have taken her name In vain.
