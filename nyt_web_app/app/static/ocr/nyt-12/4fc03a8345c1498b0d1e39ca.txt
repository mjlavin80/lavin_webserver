If the wild jungle creature that makes its hahiuition in the human frame of Sarah Bernhardt has been tamed, it is to such an inappreciable extent that the result is Ivirdly apparent to the ordinary observer. Certainly the Fedora Roma- j zoff revealed last night contained enough j of ihf- ferocious tl^er quality to sutisfy j any one whose appetite for horrors is not insatiably abnormal.	j
As an exponent of this particular one of j Vlctorien Surdou’s highly colored her^-1 lnes Mme. is-'rr.hardt has justly tMjoyfcij a reputation for so many years that prolonged discussion seems almost sup^nlu-ous. And yet it mr;st be remembered ■ that each season brings to the theatre new-comers to whom the talcs, old enough to many of us, have over a novel charm. In the case of a player cf such eminence, therefore, and one whose appearances, however frequent in rhe past, must of necessity D£ limited in the future, it is not amiss to repeat again briefly the chief incidents of a portrayal so prominent in her repertoire as this. And in passing it may justly be mentioned that the newer generation to whom the Bernhardt is a novelty will stfll find in it practically all of the vigorous quality which has distinguished it in years gonn by.
The first act is impressive in the actress’s remarkable simulation of terror at the deed tu blooa vnicli sounds the keynote of the subsequent tragic happenings, and her well-sustained sugge&uon:*; 01 nervous anticipation, coupled with an energetic participation In tne efforts of officers and servants to obtain somfe clue to the- assassin uf Vladimir. Tnere are here.innumerable bits of by-play and delicacies of subtle facial expression, and an unending resourcefulness m vocal denotement, by means of which tne actress conveys the changing phases of a mentality wrought to a high pitch of excitement, but, apparently, not yet able to grasp tne full significance of the sudden tragedy that has come into her life.
Her impatience with the doctor, her feverish inquiries as to the state of the wounded man, the gentle fondling of the j dying one’s photograph—all these are minor details exquisitely blended. The ultimate recognition of the fact that Vladimir is dead, a passage played in a recess at the extreme back of the scene, is carried forward with impressive naturalness to the moment of final frenzy, indicated in a wail of agony that carries conviction to the mind of every sensitive auditor.
The passages with Ipanoff in which her determination for vengeance finds itself in conf.ict with a growing passion for the man which she is unable to conquer, and the subsequent discovery of the ruin she has brought into his life, are conveyed by means of so many expressive symbols that they may oniy be seen and not described. And the point where she realizes I that her plotting has resulted in his
mother’s death Is one of the most Impres* slve in a performance teeming with enormous incidents of sustained and varied power.	q
One recalls, too, with especial satisfaction the scene in which Ipanoff coniesses to her and tells of the motive leading.to the assassination, a scene of wonderful seeming syif-possession, combined with a revealed manifestation oi doubt, terror, una a mental searching 1 or the convincing evidence of facts.
The death secene, as may. be imagined, leaves no necessary impression to be filled- irs by the imagination, and yet it is I JieYer so aetailect as to be repugnant. It t
rxcnes deep, poignant sympathy, but it (
does not offend with an overelaboration j of horror.	i
it. Max’s Ipanoff is the best perform- j ance he has yet given. In the ordinary ! conversational passages he is easy and natural, and in conveying the complex emotions of the ditiicult iast act he is expressive and facile. But his moments ot extreme sorrow and passion are much* too explosive,
MURPHY BACK FROM MICHIGAN
Will Talk About Patronage To-day— Threatens Photographers.
Charles F. Murphy, the Tammany
leader, returned to the city yesterday
from Mount Clemens, Mich., where he
has been resting for several weeks. State
Senator Plunkitt was the only friend on
hand to greet him. As Mr. Mutphy came
through the station gate with his wife
and daughter a photograper raised his camera to snapshot him.
If you use that camera on me. I’ll smash it#M said Mr. Murphy, angrily.
To the reporters who greeted him Mr. Murphy said he had not a word to say about politics or appointments.
Mr. Murphy did not go to Tammany Hall during the day, being one of the ptill bearers at ex-Sheriff Dunn’s funeral. He is expected to be at the Hall to-day arid to give some attention to the question of the patronage which is to be parceled out before the first of the year.
There was d scussion among the Tam^ many leaders yesterday about the resignation of Louis Hatfen as executive member from the Thirty-fifth District
and his alleged purpose to build up an organization of his own in the Bronx which will be independent of Tammany. Relations between Leader Murphy and Mr. Haffon have been strained for nearly two years.
As Haffen absolutely controls the Bronx
patronage, it is admitted that he would nave ho difficulty in forming an independent Democratic organisation for the Bronx. If he does, Mr. Murphy’s tenure as leader would depend absolutely on his ability to control the patronage of Mayor McClellan’s administration. Murphy's friends say they do not look for. any break between the Mayor and the Tammany leader. They expect to see Mr. Murphy wield as much power with the administration as he has ever done.
