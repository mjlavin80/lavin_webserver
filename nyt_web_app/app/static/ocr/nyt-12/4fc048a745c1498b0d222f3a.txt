THE FINE ARTS.
The Royal Academy of 1905—.Wenzel's lira wings—Hope Rea’s Rubens.
IKE the seasons, the annual inhibitions of the Koyal Academy continue their perennial way, and for the: most part In placid obiiv-iousnesa of new methods, leaving to the public the choice of school and merit, unless, indeed, an occasional Ruskin disturbs for a time j the tranquillity by startling censure of ; worn-out traditions or of prejudice against a new light. But such disturb* anccs are very rare, and so nothing revolutionary need be expected from the current publication of " Royal Academy Pictures," illustrating the ancient and honorable institution’s one hundred and thirty-seventh exhibition. t,The Cxssel!

The placc of honor is given to Sir Ed- 1 ward Poynter’s " The Cup of Tantalus," a. rich, pseudo-rustic, mediaeval interpretation of the classic legend, reproduced through a new process which presents most of the fine elements of the mezzotint and steel engraving. Then follow in half-tone and photogravure the various canvases and sculptures—by F. Cadogan Cowpor, H. H. La Thangue. FranK Bromley, H. F. Bacon, Spencer Watson, and G. A. Story, whose “ Gri- ; selda,” suggested by Boccaccio's famous j tale of the patient damsel, might have been inspired by N. Sichel's ** Medea,” minus the vengeful aspect. The book la similar in make-up to those of former years and has the usual introduction and notes by M. H, Spieimann Wyllie. If anything, however, the half-tones are better—sharper in line, better In tone, and clearer defined in chiaroscuro.
MENZEti has been dead a short time. He was scarcely more than a name outside his own country* There are two circumstances which make his selection for a volume of drawings in Newnes Modern Master Draughtsman Series—with a critical estimate and biographical sketch by Prof. Hans W. Singer—or peculiar and timely interest. The special feature of this series—the wonderful process by which tho drawings are reproduced )n cxact fax- simile, in all elements save size—has already been commented On in these columns. Kor the late Adolph von Menzcl, in whose honor the German Kaiser oncc penned a poem, and whose history painting is the dismay of Gorman critics, this process offers a splendid medium for showing how this, mysterious artist captured historic details and vivified them through moderns. Those of his drawings which are reproduced in vhls volume are sure to be made the subject of much study and discussion, both verbal and plastic. Prof. Singer is cautious in not trying to sa.y the final word about Menzel, but what he does say Is both informing and intelligent, and, for most of us, considering the subjcct, entirely new, (Imported by Charles Scribner’s Sons. 4to. $±7i0 net.)
Hope Rea's “ Fetcr Paul Rubens ” is the latest volume to be incorporated into the Great Masters Series, edited by G. C. Williamson. (.The Macmillan Company. J2mo. $1.75.) The pictures are well selected and as carefully produced as is compatible with a com para tivoly small format- There 13 Jit tie to-day that can be
said about this famous Renaissance German which has not already been said by Roose, Emile Michel, and a host of other biographers and critics from whom our author freely but intelligently draws— even the three set periods of Rubens's life are familiar—but that does not prevent us from having a convenient and comprehensive work on a carcer which for the many phases of its independent activities, for its romance and human nature has been the lot of few celebrated men to have.

AMONG those lecturers who make a merit ot necessity in not practicing what they preach. Sir Joshua Reynolds has a conspicuous and honorable place. *0 his students at the Royal Academy he never ceased to praise the “ grand style,” the broad stroke, tho subordination ot color to drawing; in practice he painted and repainted and never ceased to experiment in pigments, and he actually gave to British art Its most glorious colors. The lectures which Sir Joshua delivered as the first President of the Royal Academy have several times been reprinted, frequently with elaborate notes. A new edition of them is always welcome; as in many another work of genius, new conditions and aspirations in art can always find some encouragement in them, Mr. Roger Pry. the most recent editor of the literary Reynolds, (** Discourses,’* E. P. Dutton & Co. 52.50.) has presented an interpretation which is full of interest for the student of art. Each lecture, which la presented in large type, receives a critical Introduction explaining by biographical or other data the artlist-lec-turer’s attitude on a given subject. The paintings which were used no illustrations by him an admirably reprixluced
in half-icnc, with a note expatiating upon the muster's particular selection. While some of thcrfe :ire quite familiar, others, whose sole importance lies in the fact that Reynolds mentioned them, are rarely if ever seen in copies—notably a curious Bourdon in whirh the chiaroscuro seems worked out in horizontal lines like the ro~ flection in a gently flowing river.
