AY:c York Times Saturday Review of Book#:
Mr. Capen's " CoUhtry Homes of Fa-X mous Americans ” Is a decadent book. A decadent book is a book that declares freaks of neurosis or Immoral whimsies, or byplays of a murky subliminal, or any chance and unrelated Incident to be an explanation and a criticism of life. For a degenerate literature is not degenerate because it records unholy things, but because it insists that discordant details are a cornerstone in the structure of things.
! The implication of this camera classic I is that because Lowell had a gable roof lie was enabled to write “ The Biglow Papers." It gives a mansard treatment and Colonial arches and granite underpinning as an interpretation of life. It states Lliat haphazard domestic architecture is the* matter of lyric inspiration.
As a mutter of stern fact, a man, a literary man, does not live in his house. He lives in h'.s books, in his friends, in Boston. He may live in a tent, a houseboat, an attic, or at the Somerset Club, and no hint of It will escape into his anaepaests. The wall paper docs not color his style.
Mr. Capon s main thesis In “ Country Homes of Famous Americans" is as false as his literary method is graceful. It is naTve to write of the homes of scribbling nomads. The entire volume is a piece of glorllied gossip. The author would have been as helpful, and far more picturesque, If he had dealt with '* The Neckties of the Cambridge Cult,” anrl had built a volume about the influence of a four-in-hand on the Over-soul, and tho relation of a buttcrlly tic to the “ Chambered Nautilus."
