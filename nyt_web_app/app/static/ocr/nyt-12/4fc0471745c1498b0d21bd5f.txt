ijNE' of the most attractive of modern studios is that curious amalgam of literature, history, and superstition which ifl known by the name of folk-lore. It has somewhat the versatility of the elephant’s trunk in that it can deal with ! the most trivial of children’s rimes, while at times laying hands upon the very secrets of man’s origin i and inmost thoughts. It deals with the origins of soCiety in general as well as the very latest “ survivals " of ancient thought. It has not arrived at any very definite results up to now, but It affords its students all the attractions of the unknown, and occasionally affects its readers with the thrill of tho unexpected.	.
The two books before us are contributions to this science—if science it may be called—from two of its most erudite pundits. Indeed, It would not he hazardous to say that Dr. Frazer-has shown himself to be the most learned of English scholars. His edition of “ Fausanias ” out-Germans the Germans in Its learned paraphernalia and its control of the relevant (or irrelevant) literature, and his work on " The Golden Bough ” brings to bear on a curious and seemingly isolated custom of ancient Rome a whole mass of folk-lore literature ranging over the four quarters of the globe. lie thus controls both the oldest and the youngest forms of scholarship, classical learning, and folk-lore.
His present work is an expansion of a part of the problem dealt with in Dr. Frazer’s f* Golden Bough." Tho curious rule of the Grove of Aricla was that it should be guarded by a runaway slave who was always on guard before a mistletoe bough, but had to fight any other runaway slave who seized the bough and claimed a duel to the death with him. The survivor claimed the right of the guardianship of the Golden Bough, and was called ” King of the Grove." Dr. Frazer’s explanation of this curious custom is as ingenious as it is convincing. The slave, he says in effect, represents the spirit of vegetation of the grove, and to insure that this spirit, and therefore the grove, should be kept in the most vigorous state possible, he should be liable to perpetual challenge, and whenever his powers fail should be succeeded by one who had proved his capacity, *
This fully explains the duel, but it does not explain the mistletoe, or the reason why the King of the grove should bo a runaway slave. Still, we cannot all do all things, as a Latin proverb used to say, and it is a great exploit to have solved so much of a most intricate, perplexing custom.
Dr. Frazer’s lectures deal with much more than the custom of Aricia. He attempts to trace the origin of the kingship in general, and, in so doing, to throw light upon the primitive constitution of soe'ety. Whenever we find record of men we find them collected around a leader, who, whether called King, shefkh, or what not, forms the nucleus of all their organfzation, leads them in battle, and generally rep* resents them in prayer or sacrifice. It has h**' erto been assumed that the King, as Carlyle put it, was the man who could, the strong man, the one who gained his position by wielding his weapons more deftly, or knocking down a possible rival more vigorously. Dr. Frazer points out that this scarcely accounts for the curious divinity that doth hedge a King. To such an extent does this go in some African tribes that it is * death to gaze upon the sacred countenance of the King, and the sacred umbrella of Siam and ancient Egypt was put up in mercy to the possible Infringer of this taboo. Dr. Frazer is, accordingly, inclined to sec in the early magician or Shahman the beginnings of the kingly rule. It was the man who knew how to influence external nature by incantations, charms, and amulets who had the right of leadership among primitive man. This certainly would account for the sacredness of the early King, but scarcely for his po-sltlon as war lord. Incidentally, Dr. Frazer hae an interesting analysis of the nature of magic, which lie points out is^a pseudo-science, as well as a pseudo-art, and suggests that early Kings, while plying

their pseudo-art may occasionally have lilt upon real scicntiflc inductions, so that magic would be the mother of modern science.
Toward the end of his hook Dr. Frazer applies the results he has arrived at to the early history of Home and to tho Kings we know of from Macaulay,*or other literary descendants of Livy. .One had thought that if there was one thing certain about ancient history, it was that the early Kings of Romo were non-existent. This was the great contribution of Niebultr to the world’s history. Yet one hundred vcars after Niebuhr here comes Dr. Frazer, and, assuming the reality of the seven Kings of Rome, tries to deduce the laws of marriage among the early Kings of Rome from the relationship between one King and another. He considers that In those days the Romans were in that curious social stage where, to adopt Bagehofs eupncmlsm, *' maternity was a matter of fact, paternity was a mauer of opinion." Consequently descent was traced through tho female line, and Dr. Frazer would even malce out that the last King of Rome was chiefly regarded us a tyrant because he claimed as grandson of the penultimate King, 1. c., traced through the male* line. Three out of the seven Kings of Rome were succeeded by their sons-in-law, from whc*.ch Dr. Fraser deduces that It was the daughter who really had the right to tho throne, and the sons-in-law only reigned as Kings Consort. It is a somewhat large deduction to make out of three cases, and altogether here as elsewhere of recent years, Dr. Frazer shows himself more ingenious than convincing.
IF Dr. Frazer Is the cost learned of English scholars, Mr. Andrew Lang is the most versatile. Ho Is equally I at home in French ballades and Scotch bal- ! lads, tn translating ancient Greek or mediaeval French, in Scotch history, and In Dickens’s novels. He can unravel tlrt mystery of Edwin Drood with equal skill as the secret of the Man with the Iron Mask; he can analyze for you a nursery rhyme like " Fee Fi Fo Fum," or the mysterious appearances foun£ by gazing Into glass bcrtls. He is Spiritualist, angler, folklorist, poet, historian, wit. and afterdinner speaker. The present installment of his work deals witti tho obscure beginnings of society so far as these can bo traced in the organization—or want of organization—found In the lowest savage tribes, those of Australia. These, as Is wen knov.n, are organized on (he totem system, by which a certain number of Individuals are bound together by bettef . In their descent from a common ancestor. generally of an animal nature, and known as the tot&n. This tribe Is usually divided into phratries, also known by the name of some animal which they worship and do not eat, and the curious custom prevails that no man must tato a mate from that half of the tribe which hns the same totem as himself, but from one having a different totem. It is the object of Mr. Lang’s bool: to elucidate this curious marriage custom. At first sight It seems rather a waste of valuable thought to try and Investigate the marriages of j Eavages, which are rather promiscuous, and their manners, which are usually nonexistent. Both matters come nearer to men's business and bosoms than appears at first sight. The most ingenious mod-j em theory of ancient sacrifice, and thus of ancient religion, that of the late Prof. Robertson Smith, attempts to trace it back to tho desire of having a common mc^J with the totem god. The curious custom found among many savage tribes or " eating the god *’ to acquire the divine properties is also traced back to the totemistic stage. Altogether, il Mr. Lang has really solved the secret of the totem he may cl.Tim to have made a great advance in elucidating the structure of early society.
But has he? The so-called solution is really a combination of views previously emitted by Prof. Max Miillcr, Mr. Frazer, and Prof. Baldwin Spencer. Its novelty consists for the most part in insisting upon the magic associated with names in primitive thought. Tribes pat accidentally got themselves n;:mcd after animals then attributed some mystic link between themselves and the animals whose names they bore, and afterward for some unknown reason considered it a sin to we3 dusky maidens having the same animal or totem name. For the solution of a secret, tUs leaves too many sccrcts unsolved to be altogether satisfactory. Why the tribes took animal names, and why animal names should carry with them a sort of sexual tabu Is still left hidden, and, after all, these arc the essence of the secret of the totem.
Nor is Mr. Lang’s method much more satisfactory than his results. Against all observers, he treats the Arunta as the most developed, instead of the most primitive of Australian totem tribes. His main reason for this is that male descent is recognized by them, while matriarchy Is the essence of primitive relationship. It still remains possible that the patriarchal method was grafted on the other more primitive traits of the Arunta system, and above and beyond this, Mr. Lang shows, as he did twenty years ago, great respect for Mr. Darwin's view that the
earliest human society was that Of a male prcternaturally jealous, who would* not submit to the presence of other males In the same horde. In that earliest of human society—if it could be called human— tho patriarchate would be a marked feature. In objecting to the patriarchate among the Arunta Mr. Lang is forswearing allegiance to Mr, Darwin.	-

Altogether, Mr. Lan» has failed to convince me,' who am but a ■humble student In these matters, hut have followed the relevant literature with some attention for the last ten years or so, and I observe elsewhere that ha has been equally unsuccessful in persuading other persons Interested in primitive society. Truth to tell, he is wandering somewhat out of his sphere In dealing with the subject at alt One gets the impression that he has simply manipulated the materials and theories of others Instead of producing a new one out of the materia^ liimsclf. I have no doubt so keen an intellect could perform something of the same feat with regard to the theories of radio-activity, but I do not think physicists would pay much attention to his views in such an event, and I fear his theories of primitive society win not advance our knowledge to any considerable extent. They are not novel enough to be tho cause of further research; they are not convincing enough to he adequate colligation of the material already collected.
Only one quality of Mr. Lang Is shown in his new production. He is one of the most versatile of writers. He has shown his versatility on the present occasion by managing even to be dulL
