Further Contributions to the Discussion of the Ethical and Artistic Import.of “The House of
Mirth.” z.
Xvw YorTc Times Saturday Review of Books:
one accepts an invitation to the House of Mirth, it is not to he expected that on entering one will find a group of Settlement workers or a society devoted to the promotion ot the virtues. The House of Mirth is the chosen abode of those who malto the pursuit of pleasure tho aim and object of their existence. It is to such a company that Mrs. Wharton invites us ■when we open tho covers of her latest hook. It ought to he unnecessary to say that the hook does not pretend to represent New York society at large, hut merely one of its elements, namely, that group or set to whom amusement and pleasure seeking are the main pursuits of life. That the more admirable types of character which undoubtedly exist In New York society, as they eadst in all society, are not present In this hook, is a tacit recognition of their absence from the particular circle which is depicted, They would find no pleasure in such a circle, and their presence there would not he desired. We have no more logical right to be surprised at the absence of high purpose and fine character from “ The House (of Mirth " than to be surprised at not finding1 edelweiss in the desert.	-
The deleterious effect' upon human character of unlimited self-indulgence has been rccognized ever since the beginnings of recorded wisdom. Mrs. Wharton shows us what forms this debasement takes as a result of the kind of self-indulgence most in'vogue in the circle upon which she has turned her searchlight. So we have In illustration the'Dorscts and Trenors, with their Inevitable parasites; tho unspeakable Rosedale, and then— Lily Bart. \
To a normal observer the most pitiable figures in life are the well-bred, impecunious hangers-on of the rich. What a life must theirs be! What a sacrifice of pelf-respect! What an effacement of individuality, of pride, of honor! What a life of lies! And all in order to lie soft
I and faro well at others' expense; to live
In the limelight, and possibly gain some
permanent material advantage or connec- |
tion. Such is Lily Bart, save that from j
the first she is hampered by a fibre of ;
inward fineness which ever prevents her !
making the most of her opportunities, '
and In the end makes her rOle of world- i ling a failure. When she sees in imagina- , tion the demands of her chosen course, she feels equal* to the ordeal; when brought face to face with the actuality, j her better nature revolts. Something fine thc-re is within her that remains untouched through all her debasing, worldly experiences, and when she lies down to hnr last sleep In the dingy hallroom, (poor Lily! she who so dreaded " dinginess,’’) even adversity has left this something still undefilod. It is the belief in this better self in her that wins Selden’s love. It is her own denial of its expression that estranges him. It is the recognition of its survival in spite of all, that brings him
■	to his knees beside her at last, when silence has fallen between them. Wc arc present at her physical death with a very real hcartache, but, thanks to the matchless instinct of our author, we are not called upon to witness the death of her soul as the wife of Rosedale or the friend of Trenor.
A feeling of dissatisfaction Is expressed by seme readers of "The House of Mirth ” because the characters are not *' noble." Mrs. Wharton Is mildly reproached because her book is full of persons whom we would not wish to meet twice.” Does the merit of a work of fiction depend upon the number of edffytA'g characters which it contains? If so, how did ** Oliver Twist,'* “ Les Miserables,” and “ Vanity Fair ’* gain their hold upon readers?
The dramatic events of life on which Interesting stories are built do not os a rule arise from the peaceful practice of the home virtues—priceless as those virtues are. It is virtue struggling against adverse conditions, and wickedness exlst-, lng without the excuse of contributing circumstances which have ever offered the best themes for the analytical writers of modern—novels. Those “ big-hearted, athletic, doan-livlng men. promtnent in church as in society and business/* to which one of your correspondents refers, doubtlesl exist In large numbers and are the bulwark of our society, but Heaven preserve us from encountering them in the pages of our novels! We may comfortably take their existence for granted.
Somewhat of the irritation and^ resentment expressed by readers of " The House of Mirth” is due, I think, to a sort of offended jingoism. If only it were English or French high society in which these unlovely persons figure, the book could be read with an agreeable sense of gratl-tude that we are not as they are. But, horrors 1 th^se people are our very own who are here set forth—the song and ' daughters of our* Puritan forebears— ‘
gambling and telling lies, gossiping away tho character of a defenseless woman, selling their social countenance to a repulsive money-monger, making light of the marriage tie; In short, doing all those tilings which we have been brought up to believe arc the peculiar features of high life in foreign lands. To certain worthy citizens it seems hardly loyal to admit that tho picture can possibly be true to American life.
Wc Americans are a great people, beyond doubt, but among our many qualities we do not number that of a dignified acceptance of merited censure. So much of the criticism which has been leveled at us from distant shores has been unjust and absurd, that we have acquired tho habit of indignantly rejecting , all criticism and making a fresh catalogue of our virtues each time we are assailed. But now from our own ranks has risen an artist who, with consummate skill and power, has drawn a life picture which we can well • afford to thoughtfully consider. We have had good reason of late to realize that the green bay tree of our unparalleled prosperity bears some curious fruit on its topmost branches. Mrs. Wharton exhibits to us-some other phases of the same lack of moral fibre in high places.
Let not the prophet be without honor in her own land, and if our flamboyant patriotism must find expression, we may well count among our causes for self-gratulation the fact that this gifted writer is our countrywoman.	E.	W.
