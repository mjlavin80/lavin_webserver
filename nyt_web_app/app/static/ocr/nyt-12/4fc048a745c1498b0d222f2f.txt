MUNCHAUSEN MADE A PANAMA CANAL,
The Veracious Baron’s Own Account of Mow He Dug the Great *Waterway
With the Help of Qog and Magog and Others.
PECULATIONS concerning the possibility of an interoceanic canal are encountered in the literature of the last three centuries. In his *4 Travels,” veracious Baron Munchausen tells us frankly how he actually accomplished this remarkable feat.
Prom these islands we set out, attended by a fleet of canoes with fight-in# stages and the chiefest warriors of the islands, commanded by Omal. Thus the chariot of Queen Mab, my team of bulls, and the crickets, the ark, the pphinx, and the balloons, with Hilaro Frosticos, Gog, and Magog, Lord Whitting-tan, and the Lord Mayor’s show, Don Quixote, &cM with my fleet of canoes, altogether cut a very formidable appearance on our arrival at the Isthmus of Darien. Sensible of what general benefit It would be to mankind, I immediately formed a plan of cutting a canal across the Isthmus from sea to sea.
For this purpose, I drove my chariot i with the greatest impetuosity repeat- j edly from ehore to shore, in the same | track, tearing up the rocks and earth thereby, and forming a tolerable bed for the water. Gog and Magog next i advanced at the head of a million- of people from the realms of North and South America and from Europe, and with infinite Tabor cleared away the earth, &c„ that I had ploughed up with my chariot- I then again drove my chariot, making the canal wider and deeper, and ordered Gog and Magog to repeat their labor as before. The canal being a quarter of a mile broad, and 30U vardg tn depth, I thought it sufficient. and immediately let in the waters of the sea. I did imagine that from the rotary motion of the earth on its axis from west to east the sea would be higher on the eastern than the western coast, and that on the uniting' of the two seas there, would be a strong current from the east, and it happened just as I expected. The sea came in with tremendous magnificence, and enlarged the bounds of the canal, so as to make a passage of some miles broad from ocean to ocean, and to make an Island pf South America, Several sail of trading vessels and men-of-war sailed through this new chahnel to the South Seas. China, &c.f and saluted me with all their cannon as they passed.
I looked through my telescope at t£e moon and perceived the philosophers there In great commotion. They could plainly discern the alteration on the surface of our globe, and thought themselves somehow Interested In the enter* prise of their fellow-mortals In a neifjh- , boring planet. They seemed to think It admirable that such little beings as we' men should attempt so magnificent a. performance, that would be observable* even in a separate world.
Thus having* wedded tfce Atlantic. Orean .to the South- Sea, I returned, to England and found Wauwau precisely in the very- spot whence she had. sot
cut,, after having led me a chase all round the world.

! mus, who served In the Russian Army against the Turks. He was bom in j Hanover In 1720 and died there, full of years and legends, in 1797. So great was his fame as a narrator of marvelous tales that his name was used by Rudolph Erich Raspe, himself a Hanoverian, but long a resident of England and Ireland, when he wrote In 1785, ahd published first In English, his world-famous book- entitled H Baron Munchausen's Narrative of his Marvel-ods Travels and Campaigns in Rus-'sla.'* Raspe was the author a3so of sev-er&l scientific works, and was employed tn Tnining industries in Cornwall. Some df his Munchausen book was made up of his remembrance of extravagant tales told jocularly by Munchausen himself. Much of It was derived^from old books. The Panama Canal passage undoubtedly is an echo of some old speculative writings. The cecond volume. or sequel, containing this passage, and written as a parody of James Bruce's ■* Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile/' did not appear until 1793, a year before Raspe’s death, and perhaps he did not write it.
Serious proposals for a canal through
the Isthmus, for that matter, were made as early as the days when Cortes was conquering Mexico. Cortes* him-| self ordered the Isthmus of Tehuantepec surveyed for the construction of a | canal, and other routes were early suggested. Had It not been for the South American wars of independence, the early "nineteenth century might have seen at least the beginning of a canal. Among the revolutionists Bolivar was deeply interested In the project
