The Frenchman has been described as “ u dccorated gentleman who knows nothing of geography." We think that the average American knows very little more atout it than the Frenchman, as a matter of fact. He may know something about the atlas of the world, but of AuKtra.Ua, for example, we think he is pretty ignorant. Of course, however, he has a pretty big country of his own to study, so he may not appreciate the fact th.it within the last twoscore years Australia has been growing fast. It brings it home to a person, however, far more than the news that the six colonies havo formed a United States of Australia, to fliul a book of eleven hundred pages devoted merely to the business firms of A u.stralasia.
Such a book is the new edition of " The Buyers and Sellers of the Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand/' published in Auckland, Kew'Zealand, by the Wise Brothers under the name of the Buyers and Sellers of Australasia Company. The now volume is the fifth in the series, and is a valuable addition to the working library of any firm handling or desirous of handling American goods in Australasia. It is eye-opening to find places that Americans never heard of, with book sellers, music dealers, perfume makers, jam makers, jewel case makers, and similar manufacturers, showing that luxuries as well as necessities may be Obtained in wildest Australia. Burke and Wills are indeed become memories.
