MR. MARDEN is a cheerful optimist, prodigal of pood advice, overflowing1 with apt quotations from tho great and the successful of all times and
countries. He Is the editor of a magazine called Success, anti he is no doubt qualified to speak of human success in all , lines of endeavor from being a specialist In the subject. His style afid method are very urgent; and there is no question but that such a stimulating, enthusiastic sum- j raons toward success wlil help many to j try for It and to gain it. A cold and ealeu- ! lating analysis of some of his propositions, a consideration of the bearing of some of his anecdotes, might find more than ono fallacy in,the argument or in the application. But the enforcing even of self-evl-dent truths and of excellent, though very familiar, doctrines is better than destructive criticism. High Ideals, the love of excellence, should be the vision of life. The world believes In the man who believes In himself, and there is little room In this crowding, competitive age for tho timid, vacillating youth who dares take no chances. There is everything in assuming the-part or character you desire to play In life's drama. Such are the kinds of things we are urged to ponder.
It might not bo hard to go through Mr. Marden's very numerous citations of apt anecdotes and find that a good many of them do not definitely point in the way he would have them. If Elias Howe, ridiculed for neglecting his family, living In poverty while experimenting on the sewing machine, finally carried it through to success, from his confidence in his Idea, how many inventors have there been Just as confident, just as persistent, who have only failure to write down as the outcome of their confidence and persistence? If Andrew Johnson proudly retorted to the taunt that he had been a tailor, saying that he was a good one, It nevertheless appears to-day that as President he was a mighty poor one. If Bee- t thoven wrote and rewrote his sketches a dozen or eighteen times before he achieved the perfect result. Mozart shook perfect masterpieces out of his sleeve with scarcely a correction on the paper. Yet the spirit and purpose of all the doctrine and example that Mr. Marden adduces with euch astonishing fluency are excellent* and they must be helpful. He prcaches self-control, determination, rectitude, industry, thoroughness, courage—and who would'gainsay him?
