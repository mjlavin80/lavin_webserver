I have the good luck to read your RE-( view weekly* and it gives me much , pleasure, especially because I find it so I accurate. In your “ Queries ,f of Bee. 9 you give a notice of Eliza Cook, who was tho author of many poems that will live. Will you permit an outsider to add a little gossip about horV I know many notes about her, as a fie was an intimate friend of some of the members of my family.
1 She began to write bits of verse at an earlier age than you name, (15.) and she ! gave herself un to reading so completely that her father, a surly, churlish man, threatened to burn her books, and the re-j tort came quickly:
, Burn! hum them all! It mattera not I Tivcre's eavth, dnd sky, and sea,
1 And those three volumes—Nature’s work3, Are quite enough for me.
[ Her first little volume of poems, entitled ! “Lays of a Wild Harp,” was published,
1 I think, at an earlier date than that mentioned by you.	‘
On the occasion of Nelson's centenary in October last there arose a query as to the pronunciation of Traf-aJ~gar. Eliza Cook was ahead of them. In a poem praising the sailors of England, she wrote that “ England—
Proudly korps her name and fame,
She won at Traf-al-gar.
It is to her verses that may be traced
the erection ot tho monument to Thomas Hood in Kensal Green Cemetery, She visited and found his gravo, without a stone, and she wrote:
POOR HOOD.
(Written at Kensal Green Cemetery.) *#*■**■**
What! there! without a single mark— Without a stone—without a line—
Does watchfire Genius leave no sparfc To note its ashes as divine!
Poor Hood!" for whom a people wreathes
The heart-born flowers that never die.
“ Poor Hood!" for whom a requiem breathes In every human toil-wrung sigh.
And let they soul serenely sleep While pilgrims stand as I have stood,
To worship at a nameless heap.
And fond'y, sadly, say ** Poor Hood!
The result of these verses was a pubJUs subscription* and, as I havs said, th® erection of a fitting monument. The following stanzas (circa 1S37) were written tn my niece's album:
TIME! TIME! WHAT HAST TIIOO
DONE?
My forehead is smooth, not a wrinkle is yet
To be seen, as the tell-tale of Life’s busy years,
Not a hair has turned gray, not a rccord is sot
That proclaims a long sojourn through trials and tears.
Mine still is the season when spirit and thought	*	.
Should know little of earth but Its sunshine and flowers;
With Joy to look back on, Joy still to bo sought—
And Hope, with its laughing eye, light-I	ing the hours.
i But tbough. short be the tenure I’vo held from above,
Enough of dark sands In that tenur* i	have run
i To make my soul si<;li o'er tho wrcck of its love:
j M Timei Time! what has thou done?**
Changes have come that I sigh to behold Over those that were dear to my cluld-|	hood and youth;
Kindly hearts are estranged—frtenHy hands have grown cold.
And tho lips I onco trusted are warped from the truth;
My affection that glowed like tha God-serving flame,
On the purest of altars that Love could illume,
Lives on; but now worships a form and a
name
; That is wrapped tn a shroud-robe and carved on a tomb.
Oh! tha world has too soon dropped its , falry-tingod mask,
For tho dearest of ties have been torn— / "one by one—	-
~Tfll my heart and my memory tremble to ask:
** Time! Time! what hast thou done? **
I beg to apologize for troubling you at such, a length,	HENRY	MOTT.
