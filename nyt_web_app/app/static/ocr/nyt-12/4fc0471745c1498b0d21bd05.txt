Comedian ?s Well. Suited in Role Written by H. W. Blossom.
BUT PLAY IS CONVENTIONAL
Its Ltne§ Are Bright and, as Acted by Gpod- Company, It Provides
*
Agreeable Entertainment.
In providing Thomas W. Ross with a medium adapted, to the purpose of displaying his very agreeable qualities as a comedian, Henry Blossom may be said to have achieved a considerable amount of success in " a Fair Exchange/* seen for the first time at the Liberty Theatre last night.
Eut he has taken the simplest kind of a motive for his play, has handled it in the most obvious way. and has given his characters all the superficial virtues and vices of elemental drama. As a result it 5s, on the whole, rather a conventional atfalr. The villainy-one of the kid-glove, stock-broking. kind—is patently a villain from the moment of his first utterance, and all the other people of the little play are as easily Identified as if they bore labels.
One is never In doubt as to what will happen. The first scene shows the final rounds of an all-night poker game. The hero—Cliffe Austin—sacrifces a good hand in order that .his friend. Bob Howe, may j win. Bob takes a large pot from Walter Langhorne. That person scowls an aside, and eventually, in CUffe's absence, makes a wager with Bob that his (Bob's) yacht will not beat his (Langhorne's), yaqht in the race at Larchmont that afternoon, and to make sure of his bet plys Bob with drink. How Cliffe sails Bob’s boat, how he saves his friend from loss, and h,ow he subsequently saves his sister and his sweetheart's brother from suffering at the hands of the designing villain, provide the subject matter of the two succeeding acts.
All this, as the story goes, is very trite and commonplace. But it takes on some quality of freshness, for Mr. Blossom has developed a capacity for dialogue of the -telling sort that is, in some respects, quite remarkable. It is not always wit of the highest order, but it Is agreeable. One may reasonably doubt whether the people of Mr. Blossom's story would be likely to display such glibness in retort as Is in evidence here, but, on the other hand, one Is rather well pleased that they are less their natural selves and more the mouthpieces of the author, since the result is increased occasion for spontaneous laughter. The humor,, too, Is distinctively American, and the people less inclined to caricature than those in Mr. Ade’s comedies.	.
Mr. Ross’s method, for the most part, is a restful and refreshing ohe.^ His ease and equanimity are soothing as a balm to nerves irritated by a series of strenuous " amusements.’' His humor is thoroughly American, his manner ditto, and his
ensemble . is * most prepossessing. His points are made easily, his acting shows the result of good training and valuable experience, and he is young enough to admit of a ripening improvement. * Altogether he is not a bad sort of comedian to head his own company, and as an American projector of American plays he is 44 welcome to our city."
The company is of more than average competency. Lizzie Hudson Collier, as the young matron, whose fortune the 41 villain imperils, is graceful and capable; Bijou Fernandez plays an unpleasant part with excellent discrimination, Percy F. Ames is—perhaps unconsciously—sufficiently like G. P, Huntley in the part of an English ** honorable " to be delightfully droll, and Ge6rge Parsons contributes an easy and tactful rendition of a secondary rOle. Claire Kulp, develops an original and pleasing sort ’ of ingenue manner, the effectiveness of which is somewhat marred by an unfortunate trick of constantly puckering her brows in a •pained kind of way, while Forrfest Robinson and Channez OIney, with limited opportunities, provide excellent minor figures.
One of the most persistently annoying claques of the season interrupted the proceedings at every ill-timed opportunity.
"THE MAYOR OF TOKIO” ‘
m	r
Richard Carle's Mixture of Farce and Music at the New York.
Richard Carle appeared in his own farcical opera, as he calls it, ** The Mayor of Tokio.” at the New York Theatre last night, for the first time in this j city. The book is Mr. Carle’s own. The j music is by William Frederick Peters. j
The pink and white parasol of gay I Japan never seems to lose its property of casting rose light over a couple of hours of dance, dialogue, and song. Mr. Carle's new Japanese sunshade covers a corpulent - Tokio Mayor and his charming .daughter; a disagreeable middle-aged Minister of^tate wh^ insists upon marrying that daughter, an explosive Russian with <a bomb, a* pretty American girl, and last, but not least, a stranded American opera troupe much the wbrse for wear on their way home from Australia.
This forlorn band of Kidder’s Konsoll-dated Komiques consists of Marcus Orlando Kidder, the exuberant but penniless impresario; a wardrobe mistress of , uncertain age, with deep furrows in her face and disposition; a tenor, a song boy, and a soubrette, and a bedraggled peanut ballet. Happily they are all taken for princes and princesses in disguise by the cheerful. Tokians.
There is a bit of a plot. The Mayor's daughter, the Princess Oioto, falls in love with tl\e tenor of the 3£idders, *and, of course, he really mIsn’t a singer at all, save just for the* time being—until his wealthy American father turns up with the steam yacht in time to see the end of the last act.	.
But the plot is for the most part pleas- j antlv ping-ponged about in the upper air, while gorgeously decked Japanese and Japanesses trip about and form pretty! backgrounds for songs and specialties. At the very end there Is a hasty brushing up of the story, with the usual happy adjustment of couples. The music.ls light, and sufficient.
A large audience perfectly ready to be amused piled up encores three and four deep. Mr. Carle is the same Mr. Carle, and his slow, quaint fun as the .cheerful impresario seemed to be as acceptable as ever*

** Lohengrin '* was given for the first time this season at the Opera House last evening. The cast was one of the familiar, ones from previous seasons, one that is competent to give an admirable representation of this work, when its members are. in* good conditfon. Unfortunately two of the members were not In good condU tion. Mme. Nordica had not recovered from her indisposition of last week, and it
was evident in her singing, especially lh tye shortness of bream under which she was laboring.
^ Mme. Nordica's Elea has always been one of her most charming impersonations, and it ought to regain some or its oldtime girlisnness with the reduction that she has brought about since last season in her visible- proportions, tor her voice has retained, as few others, its freshness and beauty. *
Tne' other singer who was suffering last evening was Mr. Muhlmann, the Herald of the King, who has filled that office so long and so honoraWy. He was indeed in an unfortunate plight as io his voice.* The rest were as they have been. Mr. KnOte's Lohengrin is a nobly and poetically conceived figure, with the touch of otlier-woridiiness that is one of the essence of the character. And his singing was freer and more natural last night than it has been before this season.
Mr. Goritz’s Telramtmd is not one of his best impersonations; it lacks the distinction and tragic dignity which character* Ize the mistaken and misled , victim of the unlovely Ortrud. Yet in its way it is Intelligently carried out, as is* everything that he does upon the stage. And Mme. Louise Homer s Ortrud, if it does n9t rise to tne greatest heights of dramatic power in representing baleful -influence I that determines .the tragedy of the action* is certainly presented richly and beauti-lully on the vocal side.
One of the most noteworthy features of the performance was the new scenery that has been provided for it. It is all of great beauty—the scene by the Scheldt, with its springtime foliage, the castle yard, tne bridal chamber of sumptuous1 decoration.
MR. PASCAL’S RECITAL
An Ambitious Programme Presented ~ in Mendelssohn Hall.
Mr. Julian Pascal, pianist, added himself yesterday to the great army that is storming the New York concert halls this season in recitals. He gave his at Mendelssohn Hall, and an audience of zealous friends heard him. He gave an ambitious programme of pieces by Chopin, Beethoven, Liszt, Rubinstein* Mendelssohn, and a group of three pieces by himself.
Mr. Pascal presents himself agreeably and unassumingly; but these was little good reason exhibited by his playing yesterday for his public appearance in New York,, where artists o£ high rank are so abundantly offering musical edification to the public.	■	*
For Mr. Pascal is not an artist of high rank; as .a pianist his attainments are slight, beginning with the technical power that must be the foundation of all proper performances of such music as he essayed yesterday; and ending with the imagination and intellectual grasp that provide an artist with a proper conception of it. He has a sincere purpose, but h‘e offers little for listeners outside the immediate circle of his interested friends. .
