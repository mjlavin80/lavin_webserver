NEGRO EDUCATION.
A Brief but Important Study of Six Southern Negro Colleges and Their Work.*
IJOOK of very great interest is this one entitled rather curiously ** From Servitude to Service.*’ It should have a wide circulation, and be read and pondered over by Americans both North and , South. Those interested ordinarily in the 1 education of the negro will of course read it; but those who do not usually car© “about that sort of thing," and yet are pretty decent Americans, can do noting better than to sit do^n and study L_OiJs volume. It is pretty certain to wake them up a little, perhaps more than a little, and it Is good for an American to wake up once In a while. Generally he 1 is asleep—fast, of course, being an American. '	*
The book is a brief history of six of the chief institutions in the South for negro education, the story of each school or college being told by some one connected with it; and to the whole Mr, Robert
C.	Ogden contributes an introduction. In that he argues for a reawakening of the ; National conscience toward the negro:
! The moral responsibility for slavery,
1 the alleged mistakes in negro education, the vast political questions of which the emancipated race is the centre, are not Without importance; but they have noth-: ing to do with questions of personal duty I and obligation to a struggling race of I American-born people. Slavery was a i costly legacy for which the Nation has i paid dearly in numerous ways. Our for-j bears could have settled It all justly and cheaply, Our question, as an incident ot the unwelcome bequest, is what will we do with it for our descendants. The adjustments that will keep peace and harmony between the two races side by side, when the darker race will number twen-
*	ty and forty millions, must be made now. The duty of the hour to the negro la far plainer to the men of to-day than It was to our forbears in the slavery years of a century ago.
Mr. Ogdon accepts the suggestion of a negro speaker, that " the negro question needs for Its solution a triple alliance that shall combine the best intelligence and conscience of the South, the North and the njgro." Each 'element of this combination and all people represented by each, he says, needs to know the 'best about present negro conditions. Only

Howard University, Berea College, Tus-Iceget/, Hampton, Atlanta University, and Fifk lTniveri:lty are described briefly, fully, and intert'siingly, and the work that each Is doin^, and the reason why it is doing it, is set f'jrth. Space dues not permit more than the mention of the,most of these schools, but there is need that mere than mention bo made of Berea College. President Frost tells its history
here.	•
This school was founded before the war by anti-slavery Southerners in the mount* ains of Eastern Kentucky. " the one spot where the Southern abolitionists made a stand for free speech and their rights.’* After the war it opened its doors to colored students, ** the only question being whether they could pass the examinations and pay the modest lees."
New Berea has no fanatical views to express. We do not affirm that such mir.gling o( the races would be heat under all conditions. Under the conditions In Berea it has been for good, and not for evM. We have forced tho opinion of some of our students. No one has been compelled to associate intimately with tiny one. Who was distasteful to him, but in the legitimate interests of the schoolroom and the playground race prejudice and suspicion have been diminished. The negro has had the sobering opportunity to measure himself by the Caucasian, and the white student has been emancipated from the narrowness and bigotry of caste.
But last Winter the former slaveholder got back into the saddle in Kentucky, as a part of tho Bourbon movement which : had extended over the whole South, and the Legislature forbade any school or in-1 stitution to receive white and colored j students except in departments at least 1 twenty-five miles apart. President Frost writes:
This attack arose from no fault or scandal. real or pretended, in connection with Berea. To understand the south we must remember that the Southern States have never had a really democratic government. and that the majority of tne people of the South have no comprehension of '-hat fairness, equality, and republican institutions really are, * * * T«e Bour-! bona are to be pitied as well as coa-I demned. They are not the whole South, but they are the blatant element, and really believe that civilization will yield 1 to them.
President Frost says that the college will attack the constitutionality of the act. This Is well, for the law is less important as a mere accomplished fact than it is as a symptom.
