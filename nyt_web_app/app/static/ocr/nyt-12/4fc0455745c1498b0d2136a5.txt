MISS DUNBAR has completed in two volumes of reasonable size a very exhaustive work on saintly women. The first volume was published about a year ago; the second is just out. The work is more than a mere catalogue of saints’ names; it is such a list, but besides that is a biographical record or Saints. The author has drawn largely on the Acta Sanctorum of the Bollandlsts, but has not confined her searches to them; she has read widely, and her two volumes are authoritative and Interesting1.
Curious Btoriea are told of many of these saints. Dr. Brewer noted some of them In his Dictionary of Miracles. One saint is said to have lived for forty-seven years in the desert, supported only by three small loaves of bread, which never failed her; and, when she finally died, a lion came and helped dig1 her grave. Strange, indeed, are some of the saintly works in which miracles were not involved. St* Rose of Lima, for instance —tho first American saint—as an exercise of humility and an opportunity of suffering often used to throw herself at the feet of a native servant and refuse to rise until " consoled with blows and kicks from the Indian woman."
The stories of the saints are- singularly wanting in ideas which now seem beautiful. Most of them, even in matters worthy of veneration, are simply grotesque, according to modern ideas, and some, if not blasphemous, arc. repulsive. The story of St. Elisabeth of Hungary, in
which occurs the oft-told tale of the loaves of bread changed to roses, has less of the repellent than most. The earlier saints do not have these Incidents in their lives; for instance, the story of Pelagia, who left the stage for the church, is wholly without them, It seems to be the saints of the Middle Ages and since that havo their biographies decorated -with grotf.srjue tales of games of forfeit with Christ, of currying their heads around in their arms, of determining to be nuns at the age of three years.
It must have been difficult to determine vhich saints were which; for St. Piala.
was known also as Caila, Kajla, and Kiera, and was the sister of St, Flngar or Guinger. But Miss Dunbar has worked out the problem in each case, and mado a remarkably complete book—the only one of the kind in English, we think. A census of some of the saints Is curious. There are thirty-three holy women named Agnes, the most recent of whom, tho Venerable Agnes, was the first woman martyr in China. Thirty saints and boatl-.fied persons are called Anna; Catherine claims twenty-two. Margaret is borne by thirty-five saintly women, but Mary naturally outdoes all other names, there being? seventy-two holy women who bear it. On the other hand, there are but two Ursulas, thoug’h one of them is accompanied by eleven thousand virgins.
