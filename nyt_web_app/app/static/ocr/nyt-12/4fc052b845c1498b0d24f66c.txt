Mny Sinclair and Bernard Shaw.
Flossie and Ann Wliitefield.
Sod Tori: Times Saturday Review of Books:
HE association of May Sinclair with Bernard Shaw in “Man and Superman:	A
Symposium." published in The Nbw York Times Sat-traoAT Review op* Books Dec. 1, suggests and Interesting likeness, that of Ann 'WhKeficld to Flossie, the industrious “ little beaver ’* of "The Divine Fire." Allowing for difference In education and breeding1, Flossie’s actions are Ann’s actions, Flossie’s motive, Ann’s motive. Flossie's lying in waft for poor Rickman, cold-blooded little barbarian that she is, and nerve-racking as the performance must be to the sympathetic onlooker, is really less disagreeable than the sophisticated Ann’s equally relentless pursuit of the openeyed quarry of Mr. Shaw. Flossie is frankly of her type nnd class, and her “ build in s',” watching, and preying have the excuse that they offer the only means of cscape from " office work ’’ and the ** fifth-rate boarding house.”
But this is aside from the question. Are Flossie and Ann rightly portrayed as a type or as a prototype of woman? May Sinclair answers by giving- us a Lucia Harden as well as a Flossie. At which moment we proclaim her book the truer; perversely insisting on some high-mindedness in some woman. "We are willing to accept Ann and Flossie as a typo, but wholly submit to having them thrust upon us under the title of Everywoman we don’t. If anybody his got to be called Everywoman, let it be I^ucia—and we will
try to live up to her! In short, while we admit that there are both natural instincts and spiritual instincts, we are inclined to resent having the rormer pointed out as our governing instincts. We have been trying to get away from th? natural man for a considerable number of years. We have very much to bo grateful for to Mr. Bernard Sliaw in giving us orf his bubbling wit, and in briskly clearing out of the way a great deal of sentimental rubbish—for nothing more, perhaps. than for teaching us to call a physical instinct by its right name. And, by the way, “ The Divine Fire ” teaches us the same lesson. But we are pretty firmly convinced, and you cannot laugh us out of the conviction, at least, for any length of time, that we prefer to be ultimately represented, that we are more truly represented by some other instinct; let us say ** the flower instinct,” or the
Lucia Harden instinct, or the instinct by which we push up into the light instead of the instinct by which we push down into the mud.
