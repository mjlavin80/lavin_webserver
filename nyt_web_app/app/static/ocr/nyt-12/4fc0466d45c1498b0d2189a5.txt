ROLLOPE, thy mastery here has crowning test!
Barset, thy sole creation, once thin® ; own,
!
Tbou bidst us share with thee: thus we j have known Tills land thy fancy did with charm invest,
*Tis a real country. Have we not confessed The sweetness o£ the breezes freshly blown.
The glory of the English sun that shone,
Across that unmapped county in the West?
Thy people are not strangers. "Well we know Dean and Archdeacon, Bishop, Bishop’s wife, Warden beloved, and Doctor pure as snow,
And those sweet creatures, painted to the life,
Lucy and Lily, Mary dear, and Grace:
Scarce had we known them better, face to face!
