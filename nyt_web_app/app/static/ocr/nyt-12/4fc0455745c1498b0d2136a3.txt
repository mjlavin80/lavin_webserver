THIS book Is a compilation of tho comments printed tn The London Times from day to day during the war between Russia and Japan, contributed by Its military correspondent—by Its military editor or expert, we should say, in thia country—Mr, Emery, wc believe, the unnamed critic Is. The military expert of The Times holds a high position in Europe as a critic and student of war, and his comments, criticisms, predictions* on events, the lessons he drew from them, were read tbe world over with close attention, The republication of the daily comments, with certain purely occasional remarks omitted. Is then very acceptable to other students both of history and of the sciencc of war, though the volume is not, and does not pretend to be, a history of the war in the ordinary sense.
A.paragraph from the author’s introduction is of interest:
The writer thought, after eliminating a great deal no longer germane to the story, that he might be justified in offering the residue as a preliminary study of the campaign. It was clear that the campaign was of surpassing and perhaps lasting Interest to the British people, and experience had shown us that official and wholly satisfactory accounts of a. great war often found us old men before they saw the light, and that when they did, other events had occurred and interest had been diverted to Borne other stage and other players.
This Is not a wholly convincing argument for writing to-day the history of yesterday, except as newspaper matter; but the form used by the military expert of The Times—comments and criticisms, not accounts or descriptions—is less liable to abuse when history te made out of it than the descriptive articles of observers with the armies, and deserves and undergoes compilation much better.
The volume Is then a record of tho views of the war, taken from day to day by one of the best military critics of tho time—a purely subjective history. Apart from its technical interest, it is noteworthy as showing how well its author could projihesjV; it Is better to Bay, as showing how scientific war is become and I low a competent observer, properly equipped, may deduce future results from past occasions with a very large percentage of accuracy. Portraits of the chief figures of the war Increase its interest to the non-tecbnical reader, while a remarkable set of maps, eighteen in mimbcr, present the history of the campaign graphically, and add Immensely to tbe value of the book.
