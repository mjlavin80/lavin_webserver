HAROLD MacGRATH’S name on the title page of a book is synonymous with adventures of the heart. The title of his new book. " Hearts and Masks,” (Indianapolis: Bobbs, Merrill & Co.,) gives a fair idea of what the contents might be. It is a book to be read in a half hour, but it contains adventure enough to last a lifetime.
Mr. Dicky Cornstalk starts an evening, which later fairly seethes^vith excitement, innocently enough at Moquln's. He meets there a charming lady, and in the spirit
of friendly bonhomie exchanges some
pleasant words with her, all the time noting the color of her hair, which was like ripe corn silk, and the shape of her mouth, which was arched like a bow. Later, In a spirit of recklessness, he determines to be an uninvited guest at a masquerade dance given by a fashionable-hunt club. It was not as if he was an ordinary Interloper, since the price o(
entrance was $10, and tbe card of admission an ordinary playing card of a certain style back* Besides, he was well acquainted with Teddy Hamilton, the M. F.
H.	of the club, and might. have been a member himself had he chose. It was easy enough, however, for the adventurous Richard to secure another card—it hardly mattered what the back was like —so having’ cut with himself and drawn the ten of hearts, he went gayly to the balL
The ten of hearts proved both a lucky and an unlifcky draw. There were other uninvited guests at the dance; indeed, a immber of them* and mysteriously enough, all held the -ten of hearts—the story deals mainly with these—but in the end. after some lively escapades, all
■	turns out well, with no bloo& shed^ save -crnly thev shatteredana or a most «ln-serving; villain; v-‘	7	.	.	'
