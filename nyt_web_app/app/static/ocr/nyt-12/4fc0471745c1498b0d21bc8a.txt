BOOKS ABOUT PAINTING AND ARCHITECTURE.
Treasures of the British National	Gallery—The	Old Cathedrals of
Europe—Gothic Art.
CHARLES KINGSLEY once wrote:
** A man -who cannot spare time for a daily country walk may well slip into the National Gallery. * * * Those noble faces on the wall are never disfigured by srief or passion. There, in the space of a single room, the townsman may take a walk beneath mountain peaks, through green meadows, and by rushing brooks." It may be added that, for one who has not the opportunity to visit this famous British institution, a. perusal of Julia de Wolfe Addison’s “ The Art of the National Gallery," (In the Art Galleries of JEurope Series. Boston: L*. C. Page & Co., $2.) will be proportionately pleasing and instructive.
The author, whose work is well Ulus- i trated with half-tone reproductions of j representative canvases of schools and individuals, follows the schemc of pictorial arrangement first devised in 183S, which begins with rooms Nos. I., IX., and XIII., containing specimens of the early Italian schools and ending with the contents of the Octagonal Hall and the vestibules. A fine discrimination has been shown in dealing with individual pictures. Those most familiar are briefly touched j on, while others of peculiar artistic or historical value or which, for any reason, personally appeal to tho author are expatiated on at length. The Turner Gallery,
‘ for example, is briefly dismissed, while the forgotten gems of the old British school and of the Spanish and French schools are emphasized. An excellent bibliography at the end of the volume shows where additional material may be obtained. In a word, Miss Addison’s book is for a person visiting the gallery who a fair general knowledge of art, one who would like to be guided by impressionistic criticism rather than by accepted scientific connoisseurship.
ONLY the hurrying tourist who enters Spain alter leaving France, almost accidentally, may rebuke the architecture of that country. Residence In Spain will alone reTeal all the beauties of Spanish buildings and decorations, writes Charles Rudy in his volume on '* The Cathedrals of Northern Spain," (12mo. Pp. about 400. Boston: L. C. Page & Co. $2 net,) in which ho enthusiastically tells their history and describes their architecture, while giving' also much information of interest concerning tho Bishops, rulers, and other personages identified with the various buildings, Following the three or four chapters of " general remarks ” on the geography, history, architecture, &c.,
. of Spain, corns detailed descriptions of the cathedrals, divided into three parts— edifices in Galicia, the North, and Castile. The numerous illustrations are in halftones done in sepia, with decorated borders in different designs, giving tho suggestion of photogravures.
Another volume in the same series Is Francis Miltoim's “ Cathedrals and Churches of the Rhine,” for which , Blanche McManus, (who, by the way, decorated Mr. Rudy’s book,) provided ninety illustrations reproduced In the same way as those of the Spanish cathedrals, plans, diagrams. Unlike tho cathedral churches of France, those of the Rhine provinces are just the reverse 'of the " light, flamboyant styleM cbarac-terfstlc of the ecclesiastical architecture in the former country. The cathedrals and churches described in the hook are in the Rhtnft valley from Constance to ! Leyden.
Still intent an seeing all one can of old-Hmn architecture, the traveler crosses the Channel to England. Ho then visits
« The Ruined Abbeys of Great Britain.” which Ralph Artflfflfl Cram, author of “ Church Building,". &c^ describes In his (Svo* Pp. S25. New York: James Pott & Co. £150 net) Glastonbury* Undr
isfarne and Whitby, Beaulieu and Net’.ey, Trintem, Gisburgh and Bolton, Jedburgh and Kelso, RIevauIx and Byland, Melrose and Dry burgh, Kirs kt all, St. Mary's York, Malmesbury, and Fountains. In looking over the remains of these once-iraposing buildings, the history of monas-tlcism in England is revealed, and memories are raked up of the olden times, when the abbots and friars were mercilessly persecuted. Mr, Cram’s book is fully illustrated with half tones, and, in bis descriptions of the ruins of the abbeys, some bits of history are interspersed and anecdotes related of people connected with them.

TWO more books have been added to the Langham Series of Art Monographs, convenient supplements to guide books, with their limp leather bindings, large type, and numerous illustrations. They are: *• Italian Architecture,” by J. Wood Brown, M. A., and “ Rome as an Art City,” by Albert Zaclier, respectively the ninth and tenth in the series. Mr. Brown opens his monograph with the architecture of Rome, following it with considerations of Basilican, Byzantine, Lombard Romanesque, Gothic, and Renaissance architecture. Altogether, tho book furnishes “a brief account*’ of the “ principles and progress ” of the architecture of Italy,
Albert Zacher approaches his study of the art of Rome “ In the character of a free-lance,” and considers the Eternal City geologically, as it were, tracing the successive “ strata, ” of her political and artistic history as chronicled by her many and often superimposed monuments. He says: “ Approached in thi3 spirit, Rome raises us above the prose of every-day life, and gives even the layman courage to discourse on her art, even though sentiment may in his case take the place of knowledge.” (lGinos.

There are a photogravure frontispiece and 160 plates in pollotype in the volume on “ English Furniture,” by Frederick S. Robinson in the Connoisseurs' Library, edited by Cyril Davenport, (Octavo. Pp. 34S. Printed on heavy hand-made paper in large and legible type. New York: G. P. Putnam’s Sons. $0.75 net.) This is the fifth volume in the series. It is believed to be the first on the subject covering the entire period of the making of furniture in England down to the beginning of the nineteenth century. Written from the point of view of the collector, tho work wiil be of spccial attraction and value to 1 tho reader interested in this " art.” While particular attention is paid to the different periods—Sheraton, Chippendale, Adam, Jacobean, &c.—references are also made to interesting items of contemporary history. Detailed- treatment is given to those rare examples of certain early periods which are tho spccial “ hobby ” or the archaeologist.
> After the different styles of furniture have been dealt with and their characteristics compared and their particular points shown, Mr. Robinson provides a few notes on the materials, manufacture, and car© of furniture made of oak, walnut, and mahogany, giving instructions for polishing, tho retaining of the color of the wood, &c, The closing chapter is devoted to tho materials used for making fnmitnre In the eighteenth century.
AS might be expected from an author of a book entitled “A History of Gothic Art in England.” Edward S. Prior's latest volume, M The Cathedral I Builders in England.” betrays an enthu- ' filaSUc respect for those traditions of Insular art evolution which are most dear to the British historian and connoisseur! Whether or .not we accept Mr. Prior's
dicta and implications that the building art in England should be esteemed for its purely artistic development rather than for its merit as the idealization of an exigency, that all ** pointed architecture ” lsf per se, Gothic, that English Gothic merely owed to the architects of the lie de France certain ornamental and few structural devices, no one will doubt i the truth and soundness of his theory, the restorations of the nineteenth century conducted from a commercial basis and Inspired by a pseudo faith are much 1 Inferior to renovations due to a dlspas-sionate, scientific knowledge of the monuments to be restored; nor can one refrain from praising tho consummate care with which the illustrations have been selected and the beauty and correctness of their reproduction. Although these pictures are of prime importance and interest to sciontific investigators, many of them have an intrinsic artistic value. Modern photographic views as well as fine old prints and drawings are made to contribute their very best, while the more imaginative pencil of the modern archl-; teet has been availed of where necessary : to emphasize structural phenomena of j which no pictured record remains. The ^ color fac similes of missals and other I specimens of illumination from the originals in the British Museum are splendid examples of modern artistic printing. (E. P. Dutton & Co. Imperial Svo. Pp. 112.)
! This is hardly the place to enter into a
I	criticism of a scries of scientific articles on the products of the SSvrcs kilns from the pen of the distinguished French ceramist M. Taxile Doat, and now translated by Samuel E. Robineau, and elegantly published in book form, (Syracuse, N. Y., Keramic Studio Publishing Com- j pany. $7.50,) for popular interest in the 1 subject hardly extends beyond some little knowledge of pottery making, varied taste in' artistic appraisement, and a vague realization that the beauty and rarity of porcelain are measured in dollar units extending far to the left of the decimal point. No pains have been spared to give M., Doat’s -text an adequate pictorial setting. The frontispiece is a Tac simile in color, with perspective illusion of the author’s famous piece, ’‘ The Snow.” Naturally, all the mysteries of the great Stivres laboratories are not revealed, but there are many things personally discovered or perfected by M. Doat, whose joy of possession he would have the reader share; he frankly writes for the benefit of artists and for the glory of his art.
** I have,” he says, " refused many brilliant offers from foreign factories, but as
I	was unable to resist the passion of the ceramist, and as a ceramist does not exist without his kiln any more than a violinist without his violin, I have established at my residence an experimental laboratory where I win from the fire the wares which have brought me a gratifying success.” His book bears the simple title,
“ Grand Feu Ceramics.” There aro also to be found in it notes on the use of American clays for porcelain and Gris by Prof. Charles F. Binns.
