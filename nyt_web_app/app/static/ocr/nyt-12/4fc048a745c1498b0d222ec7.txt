A'no Vcr/; Times Saturday Review of lioolzs:
I was much interested in what your correspondent, " E. R. C./* had to say fn your issue of Nov. 23 on the subject of ’William Watson’s poetry, and beg to add my “ Amen " to his praise of the sonnet " Estrangement.” One line of it,
A spirit wherein I have no lot or part.
Gives him pause, and he says: “ I have always wondered why Watson uses ‘ spirit/ a two-syllabled word, in the eighth line of the sonnet, where a one-sylluhled word is needed; but aside from this Haw I cannot perceive a fault in the production.’' I hasten to assure “ E, R. CV* that our poet has not been betrayed Into carelessness, and that lilu use of the j word quoted is not a “ flaw." “ Spirit ”
I is allied with “ sprit,’* etymolojically, and i it is not so Ions' ago that the former was, apparently, pronouncrd just a.s we pronounce the letter. Por example, we read in "Hamlet":
He thou a spirit of health or goblin damnM.
and Milton wrote in *‘ Lyonia?,'*
F;ime is the spur that the clear spirit doth l'&isc*
In both these cases. (and in many others) it Is necessary to pronounce " spirit" in one syllable in scanning, although both Shakespeare and Milton at times use it as a two-syllabled word. Now. Watson was writing in the style of the older poets, (even ■’ E. R. C." mentions Drayton in the same breath with him,) and it seems to me that It was quite natural that he should follow thoir example and employ this -tf-ord as they did.
