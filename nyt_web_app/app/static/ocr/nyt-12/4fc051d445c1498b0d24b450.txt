is one of the incidents of a greatness like Napoleon’s that not even the scribbiings of youth can escape the eager search of posterity for information. He himself realized the importance of destroying immediately what he did not wish to be preserved, as when he tossed into the fire the collection Of documents proving that his -ancestors had been Dukes of Treviso, with the words that he wished his nobility to date from himself, and to hold no titles but of the French people. This does not mean that v/e wish N ipoleon had done the same thin" with his notes on English history,
M. Frederick Masson, in hig " Napoleon Inccnnu,” was the first to impart a knowledge of the contents of the note becks which dealt with many subjects besides English history. After a somewhat checkered existence these note books now repose in the Lorenzo Medici Library at Florence. They were nearly a]I made during tho closing months of 17SS, before the Corsican patriot was merged in the revolutionary soldier.
Mr. Henry Foljambe Hall, who did not Uve to see this his last work published, ^as a devoted student of Napoleon ** thft man.” His publisher tells us that Na- : poleon " had become the romance of his I life, nay, one may almost say its pas-sfon. This js therefore the work of an | avowed Napoleon enthusiast, and should be read as such. Jt is doubtful if the , world, long accustomed to regard Napoleon as the greatest General of modern times, will acknowledge that he’ was in posse if not in esse a great historian. Somethin;? like this teems to have been in Mr. Hall’s mind when he wrote; " Considering the very poor material at his disposal, Napoleon's almost invariably right judgment seems marvelous, and his verdicts, generally the Very opposite of those of his author, who kept to the orthodox i uts of eighteenth century opinion, are those of a hundred years later." It further appears that his hero! Id the realization of the significance of sea power, anticipated Capt. Mnhan by a century,

THE work from which Napoleon derived his knowledge of English history and upon which he took these notes was John Barrow's *' Nev.' and Impartial History of England, from the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Signing of Preliminaries of Peace. 17G*J,” published In ten volumes in ii(J3 and brought out in a French edition in 177^. Other histories of England in French wore available when Napoleon took his notes, but he was certainly most familiar with Barrow.
The qucction which every one who reads this book will want to have answered is. What was it in English history that most interested and impressed the young note-takrr? As the notes are of a vei-y fragmentary nature, this is not easily found out. There is no trace of his later hatred of England or of his later love for France. He makes no mention of his great predecessor, Charlemagne, who was soon to furnish him with so many precedents. Here is his curt commentary on Agin-court: “This year war against France recommenced and the celebrated battle of Agtncourt was fought, in which l-l.oon English beat 100,000 French, who lost 30,000 men. Mjre than U00 persons of distinction were taken prisoners. The English lost only 400 men.*’
HIS adn.iratmn for the heroic is apparent. Wallace is a “ rare man, to bo compared with any of the greatest which the world has produced.” At this stage of his evolution,- despotism and tyranny seem to repei him. Here are some comments on the English Constitution. Its principal advantage *' consists without doubt in the fact that the national spirit is always in full vitality, and has its eyes on the conduct of the King, who doubtless can for a long spell of years arrogate to himself more au- , thority than he owns, may even commit ; injustice, considering his great pow\T, but the cries of the nation scon change to ; thunder, and the King succumbs sooner or later. Tins is what ho had to suy ; about the man with whom he has fre- 1 quently been compared, Oliver Cromwell;
’• Courageous, clever, deceitful, dissimulating, his early principles of lofty republicanism yielded to the devouring flames of his ambition, nnjl, having tasted the sweets of power, he aspired to the pleas-urc of reigning alone.”
Perhaps it is as well not to attempt a categorical answer to the question we ! suggested. The notes which most stu- i dents take do not to any great extent reflect tiieir own sentiments or ideas, and there is nothing to show that the young Napoleon was any exception here. On
