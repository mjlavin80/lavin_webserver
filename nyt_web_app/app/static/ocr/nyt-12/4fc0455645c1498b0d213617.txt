T would bo pleasant to answer briefly, and once for all, some of the purely academic questions touching literary matters which are abruptly put to us now and again. But, after many years of deep reflection, we are still unable to answer that imperishable query, Which was the greater novelist, Dickens or Thackeray?—a question which, though it has been answered definitely, and both ways, hundreds of times, by youthful members of debating1 societies, yet remains, so to speak, In the air. It was ’ 4s humbly acknowledged inability to rcach definite judgments on such mooted points which led us, recently, to hall with acclaim Mr. Will Morton Payne's statement that the two leading American poets are Prof. George E. Woodberry and Mr. William Vaughan Moody. After that, we felt sure, nobody would ever again bother us on that head; and, to be sure, the question has not since been opened, except briefly by President Roosevelt. Now a lady writes to ask us to name the '* three greatest American novelists." The question vexes. How greatest, by whom considered greatest? one Is constrained to ask. If greatness meant the applause of a majestic multitude of readers, then we should unhesitatingly answer; Tho author of “ Uncle Tom’s Cabin," the author of “ Ben-Ilur,” and tho author of '* David ITarum." Even then, we might be doing injustice to the memory of the authors of many books classed among the " best sellers ” of their respective rpochs* Hut perhaps our inquirer refers only to living novelists. In that th-* question, though it may seem tapier to answer, lias its complications. fol. Harvey assembled no fewer ihan 1 lio writers uf prose fiction to greet Mark Twain at the celebration of his sev< i:t’- th birthday, and few* of these were greater than their fellows. It was a great assemblage of producers of Imaginative literature. Ii would be easy enough, and gratifying to one’s sense of his own fitness as a judg»\ to answer the question off-hand with the names of Henry Jam^s, William D< an Howells, anil fafter a cautious glance nl the current publishers’ lists) Editli Wharton.

THAT 1. aniiu«t to M;ii*k Tw;;in v, as truly a memorable o*,.asion, a getting together of a large part of the hosts of American literature, which cannot fail to havo a good result. In the unorganized army of American writers too few of 1 he individuals know each other. There is no esprit do corps. We ho k the modest dubs and sncit-iies of authors which have served *=o w^ll in Lon ton to bring ah.-.ut an i:it* i\ h.mge of thought an<i a eommon undf'r.-landing. It is a great pity that the short-;i\e.] Institute ‘jf 1-itemture and Art did not survive. It would surely be a good idea to revive it, on a broader basis,
with due recognition, of the place occupied by women in contemporary American literature. The dinner to Mark Twain, to be sure, was an unusually inspiring event. It was, indeed, an ambrosial nig tit. Everything that was said In praise of the great humorist was spoken from the heart, and all the speeches were unusually Interesting, including Cob Harvey’s brief remarks introducing the speakers, and Mr. Howells’s address in prose and verse, proposing the health of the guest of the evening. In his best vein of extravagant humor, and delivered with his customary deliberation, and an air of perfect sincerity, Mark Twain's speech was delightful. In fact, the feelings of everybody who was lucky enough to be present at that notable fe.ist are best expressed in a private letter by one of the tall but gentle and always sympathetic poets who sat at Col. Harvey's board:
Dear Muse, if ever I attain An age wlwre wit and wisdom blend, Grant me to be as ydung as Twain, And have a Harvey for my friend!
MR. LAYTON York < orrosi
CRIPPEN, a New •ospondent of The London Times, has written a little book, and the Grannis Press has given it a beautiful typographical setting. Dainty as It is, this book, called “ Olympus and Fuji Yama," inspii*es a certain measure of awe. Mr, Crippen Is mystical and pessimistic. He views the rise of the Japanese, not with alarm, for he has no liking at all, it seems, for the materialistic glories of Western civilization, which really mean a great deal to most of us, but with a conviction that the people of Nippon are to be worldwide conquerors, and the new Greeks of a new and, perhaps, a better civilization. For a motto he uses Matthew Arnold's symbolical poem about the letters God gave a man to form a word which he has not yet been able to form.
And empire after empire at their height Of sway, have felt this boding sense
come on;
Have felt their huge frames not constructed right.
And droop’d, and slowly died upon iheir throne.
Mr. Crippen traces the story of the great nations reflected in their literature and their art. He finds the nations of to-day decaying. He remembers “ Disraeli leaning on Rowley’s arm," and reflects that England has
v
no more great men. Montagu Corry, by the way, became Lord Rowton, not Rowley, and it was his arm Disraeli loaned on, but this slip of the pen does not matter. The point is that Mr. Crippen quite overlooks the mighty men of st ience, the giants in the technical arts, who are prominent in our own world/and are helping to make it wfser and better. He sets no value on the wide diffusion of knowledge. The turmoil of democracy disgusts him. To j be sure Mr. Crippen's book has many | wise words against mere materialism,
■	and treats briefly of the decline and , fall or r: ligions. Then he comes to t,J.!p;rih* ir art, their intelli-p-n.-e, tij♦ ir ideals, and waxes elo-j i;u' nt v.iili a note of foreboding. Many | person^ \.ho love mysticism will find i an ut!'orvaen <*harm in Mr. Crippen's i book.
SoMH yji "Ur r<.ad< is who are taking part, vigorously and most entertainingly, In the heated discussion over Mrs. Edith Wharton's novel, " The House of Mirth,1' are deluded with the idea that the prodigious suc-. <-ss of that work of fiction is entirely due tn favorable newspaper criticism. Yet these very persons, if they happened to like the book, surely would be the last to declare that they had been influenced in their liking by the nc-ws-pnp’r critles. As a matter of fact, '• The House of Mirth " arrested a large measure **f public attention from the j very beginning of its appearance as a
1 serial; it was talked about from the i
; first. To those newspapers which are
i
aware of current literature it eoon became a news topic. The novel held its
$1) c Jfeur JjjcrkSimcs
own installment by installment, and
’V-
since Its appearance in book fo>m its popularity has naturally increased. The fact that it provokes so much eager discussion merely proves Its power.

TASTES will always differ, and much, proverbially, depends on the point of view. Last week one j of our reviewers, obviously sincere, and' | deeply impressed by what he consid- i ered the unwisdom of the book, dis- j missed Jocularly as ** sterilized fairy tales ” Dr. Kolle's " Fifty-and-One Tales of Modern Fairy Land," a book for children, which Includes an account of a red gobolink, who. It seems, ought to be an attractive creature. This week we gladly give space to a diametrically opposite view of the book from a lady of acknowledged literary taste, who is equally unprejudiced, and tells in simple* language why sho likes it. Intelligent discussion from opposing points of view is good alike for books and men, for the development of political theories and the abatement of strife.
IT was a happy Idea of Charlotte Harwood to get together some oC the pictorial and literary ideas of Washington Irving, Thackeray, and Dickens, touching Christmas, and make an article of them for- the December Critic. Here we have “ Bracebridge Hall ’* pictures by Randolph Caldecott, and Augustus Hoppln, whose name and delightfully scratchy pen-and-ink work are pleasing memories of the past; Dickens pictures by Leech, Maclise, Phiz, and the later Frederick Barnard. What could be droller than Lcech's portrait of Trotty Veck? Some of Thackeray’s own pictures are reproduced and Miss Harwood's article itself is good reading.
JOHN BARTLETT, who died this week in his eighty-fifth year, was the compiler of one of the most useful books of reference. Bartlett’s “ Familiar Quotations ” Is a standard work of unapproachablo excellence. Of the many other compilations, English and American, not one fairly rivals it in fullness and usefulness. The latest edition, the ninth, contains 1,15S pag-es, Including a voluminous index and an appendix. A newer edition, however, is needed almost immediately, as Rudyard Kipling is not among the authors quoted. Who will take np the task of revising “ Familiar Quotations’* from time time we do not know, but the work must be done. Mr. Bartlett's concordance to Shakespeare is another very valuable work.
