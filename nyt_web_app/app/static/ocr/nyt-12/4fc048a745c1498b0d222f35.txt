XOPICS OF THE WEEK.
LEADING topic of the week is the large proportion of men of letters in the new British Cabinet formed by Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. In the retiring Cabinet, which had survived many years of turmoil, and many changes of personnel, there were the late Marquis of Salisbury, certainly a literary man of high repute, end his nephew,
Arthur Balfour, also a writer of renown. But their associates, from Lord Halsbury to Mr. Broderick, were not men of any literary pretensions. The Liberal leader, on the other hand, has gathered around h tm a rema-riLatile group of writers, including Mr. Morley, whose “ Life of Gladstone ” is of recent memory, whose studies of “ Cromwell/* - Burke,*1 “ Voltaire/* and
M Rousseau ” are standard works; who wrote a “ Life of Cobden " and a famous book on " Diderct and the Encyclopaedists/' and Is called by many of his countrymen the foremost Englishman of letters in his hour. There are also Prof. James Bryce, author of
that notable book on 44 The American Commonwealth *’ and also of " The Holy Roman Empire/’ " Studies in Contemporary Biography/’ and other
works off permanent worth; Sydney
Buxton, who wrote " Mr. Gladstone as Chancellor of the Exchequer," M Finance and Politics:	An Historical
Study,” and a series of essays on M Fishing and Shooting/’ and Augustine Birrell, (his fellow-countrymen pronounce his first name as if it were spelled ~ Austin/’) that brilliant Johnsonian of whose qualities as an essay* ist Mr. H. W. Boynton wrote for us, appreciatively, only last week. Mr. Birrell's edition of Boswell’s “ Johnson ” has superseded Croker’s. His latest volume of critical essays, M In the Name of the Bodleian," already has a place on the bookshelves of folks who keep In touch with £1ie best of current criticism, along with his M Obiter Dicta," The new War Secretary, Mr. Haldane, has written a life of Adam Smith, has translated Schopenhauer, and is the author of *' Essays in Philosophical Criticism." His university lectures, “The Pathway of Reality/* reflect some of the noblest tendencies of contemporary thought Lord Crewe, a son of the famous Monckton M lines, has written both prose and verse, while Sir Edward Grey is the author of a book on the piscatorial art called *' Ply
Fishing/* Sir Henry -Fowler, that stanch pillar of nonconformism, is not a writer himself, but he is the father of that vivacious novelist, Ellen Thorneycroft Fowler, and has another
daughter who writes well.
WE printed a y« ar or so ago an account of the appearance in Berlin of a Gorman work of fiction called ** Der Welt Krieg,” which embodied a prophesy of the downfall of English power in a general European war. A similar book, called “ Seestern, 190G/' has just been published anonymously in the same city. The Germans seem to be fond of prophesy in the form of fiction. In the new novel the United
States begins the trouble by secretly
arming the Samoans. An American missionary leads an uprising, and American and English warships land marines. Whereupon there is war between England and Germany. ; France
, joins England and all the other European nations are drawn into the conflict. The map of Europe is torn to pieces. In the end the fleets of England are destroyed, the United States of America is the greatest naval power, while Russia, whose star ■seems now descending, becomes the greatest military power on earth. We doubt if this book will be translated. Real happenings In Europe just now are much more exciting and interesting than the imaginings of a M sensational “ story teller.
THE discussion of Mrs, Wharton's novel goes on merrily and, as It seems to us, to some purpose^ " The House of Mirth " is a book of so great potency that it really inspires thought. The London Times, by the way, in a belated review of this novel, awards it very high praise. Mrs. Wharton, says the reviewer, ~ brings all her humor and sureness of touch, and adds a sustained fire and beauty beyond anything she has written hitherto. The book is in the first place solidly founded upon a trenchant knowledge of the human spirit and its curious workings.” Lily Bart is described as a more sophisticated Manon Lescaut The characterization seems particularly to please this reviewer:
There is not In the whole of it a single piece of conventional or second-hand characterization. Mrs. Wharton jknows through and through the extremely' modern types which she chooses. She registers to the last degree of delicacy the jumble of crudity and overcivilization which she finds in New York life of to-day. She describes cooliy and patiently, without a touch of journalism
or sentimentality, the in terminable race after pleasure which that fierce little world, like many another, engages in till it unconsciously becomes more absorbed in the race than in its object.
Yet this enthusiastic critic feels compelled to award Mrs, Wharton a place among novelists below the highest. She writes with certainty and her hand is sure, but lacking the richest Imagination, “ the creative gift at its fullest," her worK fails to reach the highest point
THAT patriotic poem which, painted, stanza by stanza, on the boards which are set up among the graves and along the roadways of the National Cemetery at Arlington, Va., certainly helps to emphasize for the common mind the pathos of the serried ranks of soldiers' graves, was written by Theodore O’Hara, a soldier himself, bom in Kentucky of Irish parentage. He was an officer in the Mexican war, and was badly wounded at Cherubusco.
While recovering’ from his wounds, at his home in Frankfort, he wrote " The Bivouac of the Dead,” deriving his inspiration from a sight of the soldiers' graves in the Frankfort cemetery. In the war of the rebellion he fought bravely on the Southern side. He died in 1867, and was buried with military honors at Frankfort. O’Hara wrote other poems, including a famous tribute to Daniel Boone, V The Old Pioneer." But he is best remembered by the ringing first stanza of “ The Bivouac of the Dead/’
The muffled drum’s sad roll has beat The soldier's last tattoo;
No more on life’s parade shall meet The brave and daring few.
On Fame’s eternal camping ground Their silent tents are spread,
And glory guards with solemn round The bivouac of the dead.
The story of Theodore O'Hara’s life
is sympathetically told in a little book by George W. Ranck, “ The Bivouac of the Dead and Its Author,” (New York, th^ Grafton Press,) which also contains his two elegies, and is appropriately illustrated.
THE collection of letters called “ The Correspondence of Henrik Ibsen ” has already appeared in an English translation in London, and will soon be published here. It seems there is a mystery about the origin of the
book'at the outset. Ibsen^ It Is known, has. always destroyed the letters Bent; to him. It is scarcely credible, in the circumstances, that he should keep copies of his own letters. But if he has not kept copies* and given them to his editor, the begetters of this book have accomplished an extraordinary feat in securing letters written to many correspondents in many years^ Noteworthy letters are addressed to Frederick Hegel, the Danish publisher; Bjornson, Edmund Gosse, and William Archer. They all reveal something of their writer’s tremendous personality.
BESIDES Mr. Bram Stoker’s forthcoming book on Sir Henry Irving, which was announced in our
cable dispatches last'week, there are to be many others. Indeed, Mr. Haldane Macfall has already published in Edinburgh an “ appreciation ” of the great actor which is Jilghly praised. A book by Mr. Joseph Hatton, recalling his memories of Sir Henry, and the Irving epoch in English theatrical history, is also announced. Mr. Hatton has long been associated with the London stage, both as chronicler and playwright; he knew Irving well. “ Sir Henry Irving: His Romantic Career On and Off the Stage” will be the title of Mr. Hatton’s book, Mr. Austin Brereton is publishing a small book on Irving and the Lyceum Theatre, and will later bring forth a full biography. Sir Henry’s sons, Mr. H. B. Irving and Mr. Laurence Irving, have, it seems, no present intention of collaborating on a biography of their father. .Mr. B,.
IT seems that too many of the poets are taking to the dramatic form, and thus wasting much energy and talent As Mr. Carman intimated recently, in his remarks on Mr. Henry Lane Eno’s *' Baglioni/’ the dramatic form makes hard reading for most people. Surely our most aspiring poets aim to be read. Even admitting that a few deliberately write plays for the reader only, with no view of stage representation, we cannot believe that any poet puts forth a single book with the idea that it will not be read. The theatrical stage now offers no opening for the aspiring author of drama in verse. Yet besides Mr. Eno's “ Baglioni/' we have lately received “The Last of the Stuarts,” a dramatic poem In five acts, , by Charles Julian, (Denver: The Reinert Publishing Company,) which deals with the career of “ Bonnie Prince Charlie**; MAurelian: A Drama of the Later Empire, in four
acts and an interlude,” (and in blank verse with a few prose passages,) by Spencer Moore, (Longmans, Green & Co.,) and “ The Faithless Favorite,” a M mixed tragedy ’’ by Edwin Sauter, which is published hy the author ** at the Sign of the Leech M in St Louis. This play is founded on old Saxon chronicles, and King Edgar, Athelstan, Atheiwold, Elfrida, and other personages of Saxon legend are among its
characters. This play Includes a satirical epilogue, and a ** post-face '* in scorn of critics, It contains a deal of frank language and some bitterness-.
Mr. John Davidson, whose versions In English verse of French poetical plays have been acted, but not for long, has published in London a new satire of contemporary life in the form of a versified play called *' The Theatro-crat,” in which the actor-manager and other personages are held up to scorn. Why do not these seriously aspiring poets, and others like them, try the novel form? That there is a wide and growing interest in poetical expression was proved (if nothing else was proved) by the heated discussion about- poetry which was carried on by readers of The New York Times Book Review in the Summer and early Autumn. Perhaps the time Is ripe for a revival of poetry in the form of ** Aurora Leigh ” or Scott’s metrical romances. It is better worth trying, just now, than persistently to repel readers by the dramatic form.
Irving says that he hopes some day to write a book on his father's life, but not now.
WHILE treating of subjects more or less related to the theatrical stage, it is pertinent to mention the appearance in book form of Mr. Clyde Fitch's play In four acts called M The Girl with the Green Eyes.” Many passages in this smart piece read well, and 4he study of feminine jealousy it involves has not been sin "passed since Colman’s “Jealous Wife.” But the chief Interest in the publication, of course, lies in the fact that one' may now have in type a play that many thousands of playgoers enjoyed in the performance. “ The Climbers *’ and other plays of the same author are to be brought out as books by the same publishers, the Macmillan Company. We always remember with delight Mr. Henry James’s complaint, many years ago, that it was impossible to criticise the contemporary drama because there was no drama. He ur^ed the dramatists to print ** I can put my finger on my Congreve/* he declared, 14 but not on
my Pinero/' Times have changed, and the successful dramatists of the hour all print their successful plays. Mr. ' James, if he cares to, can put his finger on Pinero, and Fitch, as well.
MRS. PAGET TOTNBEE'S admirable new edition of ” The Letters of Horace WalpoleM is all but finished. Three volumes, the thirteenth, : fourteenth, and fifteenth, have Just come from the publisher, Henry Frowde. There remains only a sixteenth volume to be given up entirely to a voluminous Index, which will, of Itself, be of remarkable interest. For the letter-writing career of Walpole be-
i gan In his school days, and he lived until 1707. It comprehended the larger part of the eighteenth century, and his letters form a vivacious, wise, caustic commentary on the politics, literature,
and social life of his epoch. In England
and France. The newly published volumes deal with the years between 1783 and 1797, and comprehend the era of
the French Revolution and the flight of
the impoverished French nobles to England, Many of these letters touch on these topics. Many of the noble emigrants were Walpole’s friends. He retained his high spirits and his graces of manner, in his letters at least, until almost the end of his life.
WILLIAM O’BRIEN, the energetic Irish member of the British Parliament, whose volume of " Recollections/* published here by the Macmillan Company, is now in the hands of the reviewers, reveals a most interesting and complex personality in that work. Many or this vigorous fighters recollections concern the Tierce, endless warfare over Ireland’s rights and wrongs. But he was a poet in his youth. He has strong sympathies with the Gaelic revival, he was an ardent theatregoer in his young manhood, and is still, It seems, in the intervals when the Irish contingent in the House of Commons is not active, a dreamer of brave dreams.
THE revelation of the Identity of Fiona Macleod simultaneously with the death in Siciiy this week of William Sharp, quite distinguished as an author under his own name, recalls the Identification of J. P. Mowbray, author of idyllic books, with Andrew C. Wheeler, after Wheeler’s death, about two years ago,. As a* journalist Mr. Wheeler wrote nothing of the quality of the Mowbray
books. Mowbray, however, never made the literary sensation that Fiona Macleod made* The writings signed with that pseudonym may not have been ” popular,” in the broader sense, but they aroused great curiosity in the literary world on both sides^o^the Atlantic. They were full of Celtic fire and mystery. Mr. Sharp’s writings i under his own name were voluminous , and of varied character. He was critic, 1 novelist, and dramatist	.	.
