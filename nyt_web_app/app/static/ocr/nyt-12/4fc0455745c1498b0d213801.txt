Discoverer of Chloroform,
New York Times Saturday Reclew of Books:
In the last number of Ties Nkw Yo^ic Times Book Retview, referring? to forthcoming- biographies by Messrs. Ivnce & .Co., you refer to Sir James Simpson (Dr. J. Y. Simpson) as the discoverer of chlo-, roform. In thia you err. The Encyclo-, pedia Britannica says: ** Chloroform ^as discovered l)y Gutlirie (Dr. Guthrie of Sajclccrs Harbor, N. Y.) in 1831, ana by ; Soubelran in France. Uebigr rnado an ini dependent discovery o£ it in tho following year, (1S32.) In the Summer of that year it was used by Dr. Lawrenca at -the St. Bartholomew Hospital, and in the succeeding Autumn by Dr* J. Y. Simpson at Edinburgh."
Yet ask almost any physician as to th« discoverer, and he will promptly answer. Dr. Simpson. of Edinburgh. It seems hard to down this error.	CKEXIC*
