^O-OFHRATIVE writing of hie* tory Is one‘of the latest developments of the principle of specialization, by means of which most of our reccnt progress In scientific research has teen accomplished. It is distinctly a growth of tho last few years* and there is no reason to believe that it has not come to stay. It Is aJrin to the writing of history by monographs, in which an author devotes himself to a single event or epoch, and says practically all there is to he said about it. The editors of the present work say with truth that ** the vast number of authorities, printed and in manuscript, on which a history of England should be based, IT it is to represent the existing state of knowledge, renders co-opcration almost necessary, and certainly' advisable.” Division of labor, applied to historical composition, has manifest advantages well as disadvantages. The editors are enabled to procure the services or eminent specialists, and can, as a result, bring out a series of volumes which in 'correctness of detail and scientific accuracy. probably excel similar works by individual authors. Each period is treated by a man who has devoted to it more time and attention than could have been possible had he been forced to write on all the other periods as well. The chief disadvantage of the collaborative history Is that it lacks a comprehensive point of view, whieh no mere editing, however capable, can supply. The defect is mainly a literary one. No one would read such a history in expectation of intellectual delectation, any more than he would read the Britannica for the same purpose. It is pre-eminently, when at its best, a-work to be consulted, not to be read through, except by the hapless reviewer.
THE three volumes of the present work which have appeared arc Volume
11.,	from 10CG to 121G; Volume III., from 1*J1U to 1:577, and Volume X., frcTO 1700 to lfcQl. When completed, the history will include twelve volumes, ending with the year 15301. All the authors, with one exception, are Englishmen. The names of the editors, Dr. William Hunt, President of the Royal Historical Society, and Mr. Reginald Lane Poole, editor of the English Historical Review,—are sufficient guarantee for the serious nature and purpose of the work.
Each volume is supplied with an appendix on the authorities, which gives a sketch of the materials used. There are very few footnotes. The editors warn us that “ references will not be appended to statements which appear to be matters of common knowledge.” As each writer can judge for himself what is matter of common knowledge, the references naturally have little value.
The general teodeney of the modern scientific historian is to rely little upon accondary authorities, and mainly upon the original sources. Few persons who read or study history como into contact with these sources, though-' the facilities for doing so are steadily growing, and the emphasis laid upon them in the teaching of history is constantly increasing. It l£ Universally acknowledged that no one can properly write history who is content to let others do his investigating, and this is what a reliance uiion secondary authorities implies. Yet the secondary authorities should be carefully examined. A well-known professor of mediaeval history, who has devoted years
-	to conscientious study of musty manuscripts, admitted that he had never read J all of Gibbon. It was as a warning not to neglect such authorities that Dr. Prothero said recently, " The greatest historian Is probably he who Is able to make the fullest use of his predecessors.The pian of this History of England is the correct one; independent research pins esamina- ; tion of the histories and theories of predecessors.

THE first of the volumes which have appeared is by Prof. George Burton Adams of Yale, the only American contributor. Prof. Adams enjoys an enviable reputation as tho author of that very stimulating book, " Civilization During the Middle Ages.” The mediaeval

period is one in which he is thoroughly at home. He bas many good and suggestive things to say about England under Norman and Angevin rule.
. The true significance of tho conquest is that It brought England, formerly an isolated country, into the current of Continental life and ^bought. About the feudalism of the Normans Mr. Adams is as dear as he can be, considering the obscurity of the subject. Historians have dwelt upon William’s political sagacity in preventing the rise of quasi-independent principalities in his rea^m, and have asserted that the numerous manors granted to the great Norman Barons were so scattered as to render a rapid concentration of strength by any feudatory Impossible. Mr. Adams, on the contrary, says that some of William’s gran£s show that he was not afraid ot the growth of principalities. In general. It may be remarked that he does not credit the Conqueror with statesmanship of a supreme order.
Tho judgment of Henry n., commonly accepted, is that he was, as a statesman, the greatest of England’s early Kings. It has been said of him that ho defined tho relations between State and Church, that he established the judicial and financial systems, that he transformed servants ot the royal household into Ministers ot State, that he gave England a foreign policy, and much else. Most historians, however, recognize that he was greatly indebted to the work of his grandfather, Henry L Mr. Adams emphasizes tils last point very strongly. Henry G.’s task was at first largely one of restoring order after tho anarchy of Stephen’s reign. His ideal was to reproduce the order and justice that prevailed under his grandfather. Mr. Adams evidently considers Henry I* , the greater of the two. " Every new bit of evidence," he says, ** which the scholar i from time to time rescues from neglect tends to show that tho special creations, for Which we have distinguished tho reign of Henry’s grandson reach further back in time than we had supposed/’
As tills is a political rather than a, constitutional history, the author is justified In making his discussion of Magna Charta brief. He insists upon the strictly feudal character of the document, and shows that In Its specific provisions it docs not contain what we consider the great safeguards of Anglo-Saxon liberty. If it is to be‘regarded as a contract at all, It is a contract between suzerain and vassal, not between the King and the nation. The modern idea of the nation was still in the future, and this fact explains, much tn the history of the times. It explains, for example, how John could have done homage to .the Pope for his kingdom without being humiliated and disgraced in the eyes of his contemporaries. Some historians, Imputing to Englishmen of the early thirteenth cenLury their own conceptions of nationality, have unfairly accused the King of basely betraying the national honor.
Throughout Mr. Adams’s work the influence of Stubbs is patent. T3ic touch of tho master is to be seen in such statements as this: “ The Saxon law and the machinery of the local courts did survive the Conquest with little change.’* He says, in fact, that Stubbs’s work is “ first and foremost for every student of Norman and early Angevin history.” It is noticeable, and rather strange, that Gneist, whose teaching often differs from Stubbs’s, is nowhere referred to.

PROP T. P. TOUT, the author ot Vol. ,
III.,	is also a distinguished me-diacvalist. His knowledge of English history, particularly during the reign 1 of Edward I., is both minute and extensive, and his acquaintance with the mediaeval archives in the Public Record Office is intimate. His narrative is based entirely, or practically so, on first-hand evidence.
The political history of tho reign of Henry IXL is extremely wearisome, and Prof. Tout wisely enlivens it with an excellent account of the literary, scientific, and material progress which coexisted with political retrogression, and he utters a warning against making political history the criterion of every aspect of a nation’s fortunes.
His survey or the reign or Edward L is luminous and critical. It leaves the English lawgiver where the verdict of the best historians have placed him, the greatest of the Plantagenets, Mr. Tout's worlt^ calls for no special criticism. It is scholarly, and the information is well presented.	■
The praise that has been accorded to Mr. Adams and Mr. Tout cannot be given to Dr. Hunt. His penocf is from the accession of George fll. to the close of Pitt’s first administration. It Is a period great with momentous political events, which, above all, call for fair and unprejudiced treatment. The Englishman Who would write its history must have
sufficient breadth of mind to realize and acknowledge that the Government of his country made wretched blunders and disastrous mistakes, and, as a historian, he roust free himself from the bondage of Insular patriotism, if it be unpatriotic to admit frankly that one's Government was in the wrong.
Dr. Hunt’s whole frame of mind, his historical " prepossessions,” unfit him to tell the story he has undertaken. As Bagehot said of Macaulay, “when he Inclines to a side, he inclines to it too much.” He writes too much from the standpoint of tho eighteenth century Tory. He has taken no pains to understand or to make his readers understand the true position of the American Revolutionists, or of the French Revolution' ists. There is nothing to indicate that he cares anything for the efforts toward Parliamentary reform, or the cause for which Wilkes suffered.
To begin with, he gives us to believe that George III. was on the whole a pretty good sort of King. He came to the throne after a prolonged period of Whig domination, with the firm determination of shaking off that domination, and, unlike his two Hanoverian predecessors, of ruling in fact as well as in name. He began his reign by driving Pitt out of office, and England, in spite of that statesman’s remonstrances, with a lasting stain upon her honor, withdrew from her German alliances. “ There was* much,’' blandly observes Dr. Hunt, " to be said on the side of the Tories and others, who held that England should confine herself to a naval war.” George called upon the Tory, Bute, to form a Ministry, whose watchwords .should be “ prerogative and purity.” The corruption which had flourished since the days of Robert Walpole, it seemed, was to be a thing of the past. Such hopes, if anybody seriously entertained them, were soon shattered. The means employed by the King and Bute in getting the Peace of Paris through tbe Commons were so Infamous and scandalous as to make the corruption of Sir Robert seem innocent . and the borough mongerlng of Newcastle honorable. The King and his Minister were guilty of hypocrisy as well as of wholesale and unprecedented bribery. As a party manager or a political boss George was at home, but as an enlightened statesman he was a most preposterous
figure. His narrowness of mind ana stupid stubbornness recall James II,
***
AN eminent historian has pronounced Grenville's administration the worst since tho Revolution of l©a>. To remedy some of Grenville’s blunders the King was forced to have recourse to tho Marquis of Rockingham, whom he disliked and circumvented in every petty' way conceivable. Rockingham was as stainless a gentleman as ever held office In England or any country, and he possessed some high qualities of statesmanship. Among others he had that of inspiring his followers with the deepest personal affection for him. Burke eloquently praises him, and Dr. Hunt uses Burke as authority for some things, but evidently considers his eulogy of tho Whig Lord, unenlitled to serious consideration, for here is what he says: "Rockingham, a man of thirty-five, a -prominent figure on the turf, of vast wealth and irreproachable character, was a wretched speaker, and had neither genius, knowledge, nor industry,”
His whole treatment of the American Revolution Is unsatisfactory. If the Revolution is to be written about by a partisan, it had better be done by an adherent of Fox than by a supporter of North. Dr. Hunt sees little in the attitude of the former but factious and unpatriotic opposition, and consequently fails to bring out the significance of the American Revolution as an epoch in English history. The fact that the Revolution was in reality a civil war is not emphasized. We gather that England was practically united in support of the Government, and that such licensed grumblers as Chatham and Fox did not count. England’s colonial policy, which contained the germs of the Revolution, is not too accurately described. For example, the reader will fail to sec that there was any hardship for the colonists in legislation which compelled them to import through England. We hear too much about “ mobs ” and " rioting.” Boston was not really such an evil and seditious town. All Whigs did not go around armed with bludgeons, nor all Tories clothed in tar and feathers. Dr. Hunt says, speaking of the penal acts, “ Its '[Boston's] punishment was heavy, but surely not heavier than its offenses.*’ He tells us, though it is superfluous, that he has disagreed with Trevelyan regarding f* the causes and character" of the Revolution. It is doubtful if many impartial scholars will side with him. Perhaps he has been misled by his authorities, for he says that Judge Jones’s “ History of New York ”
** is written with vigor and censures the misdeeds on both sides alike.” Jones certainly wrote with vigor—with vituperation at times—but he was as violent a
partisan as ever pretended to write history, and his judgment is generally worthless.
The statesman for whom Dr. Hunt has most admiration is William Pitt. Of all *he great rulers of the world, Pitt Was
SllfiNVUTljork Simce
one of the most remarkable, as he was one of the most endowed.''At an age when most men are leaving college, or entering business or the professions, Pitt was called upon to govern England, and to guide her through one of her greatest crises. On tho whole, he was a reforming-Liberal. His financial and economic policy, his treatment^ of Ireland, his efforts
for Parliamentary reform—all show this. But through ids opposition to the French Revolution, the Toi*ies claim him as their own. Here, at least, he was orthodox. He never, really understood the Revolution, and greatly overestimated the danger of its spreading to England. Dr. Hunt follows him in all tlil3. Toward the close of 1792 the Mkiisters believed they had evidence of the existence of a revolutionary plot. " There was much,” says Dr. Hunt. •* to justify this alarm. * * * If scdiLion had remained unchecked it might soon have become dangerous.” The English friends of Republicanism were at most but a handful, and the terror which seized the people, encouraged and augmented by the alarmist writings of Burke and others, was wholly uncalled for.
Dr. Hunt makes some errors of fact, but it is his general attitude that lays him open to criticism. He should not have attempted a task that called so conspicuously for unprejudiced treatment.
