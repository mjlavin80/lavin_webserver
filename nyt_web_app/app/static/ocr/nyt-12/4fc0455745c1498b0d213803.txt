and guardian to the young Victoria and was throughout hJa life her closest coun~ selor and guide, who choso her husband for her and even continued to instruct tho young pair after their marriage? No, no. I am. afraid It Is useless to plead ignorance of the English Court for Maximilian's Empress. So although I set out to find no fault with Mr. Lyle, but rather to praise him* I must defend myself against his defender.
Had I been looking for mistakes I Should not have passed over unnoticed tho fact that the author killed off the unhappy Empress many years before her time. We Americans have invented that new brand of historical romance which treats of people still living. And it would ill become them if a few actually alivo should object to dying untimely upon tho altar of poetic license.

“ The Alissourian.”
tfcic York Times Saturday Rcvicic of Boohs:
May I bejj but a small bit of your valuable space to put myself right with those of your readers who, missing my original letter in regard to Mr. Lyle's ** The Missourian/* have seen only the rather unfair and certainly misleading comments thereupon by Mr. A, Van Zwir luwenburg in your issue of Nov. 18? There he s:iys that I was ** finding fault** with the bunk; that I ** enjoy (?) advantages of a residence at a European capital that I “graciously forgive Mr. Lyle many minor atrocities on the score of Amerii-:ui ignorance/' He goes on to say: " T:ut the patience of outraged superior knowledge* has its limit/’ Then he adds: " Note the gentle condescension of his reproof/' Surely many of your readers know that this Is not only unjust, but it Is more-untrue. If Mr. Van Zwa-luwenburg knows where I bavc my residence, unless he assumed it from a date line, it is more than I can claim to know about him. • But permit me to say that far from finding fault either with Mr. Lyle or his work I distinctly said that *' The Missourian ’* was the best novel I had road for years; that it appealed to me particularly as one acquainted with Mexico and with many of the very men who followed Shelby's brigade on its adventurous visit to Maximilian’s Court. I thought that I showed quite the proper American spirit in rather glorying iK the author’s negligence of the little niceties of Courts usage. But I do not perhaps go so far as the gentleman who so valiantly comes to his defense.
Let me repeat what I said at first, that Mr. Lyle's little error only	my	at-
tention to an interesting use of what Ia to us Americans a homely term. But that Carlotta surely knew well that ** Ma'am" was the usual dignity be* stowed on reigning Queens in England is beyond a doubt. Mr. Van Zwaluwenburg speaks of Carlotta's " brief stay at tiio English Court,” Surely he forgets who Carlotta is. Does he remember that but for the death of his first wire her father would have been Prince Consort to an English Queen? Does he remember that this same father of Carlotta was uncle
