They have the attributes of their fellow-mon. The standard by which to judge a peoplp is llieir works. "What have not the rich men .'*nd women of this city done for New York? Let answer our munificent museums, libraries, hospitals, churches, parks, and other great public works to which their money, time, and brains have been given, to say nothing of the numberless eleemosynary institutions and nameless charities which owe their being to the bounty and good-will of the rich. A voluminous
directory contains aiono a catalogue of the charitable institutions of this city, and not a hundredth part of them on the " sight-seeing ” list. Not only that, but these vast and complex endowments are actually often under the personal supervision of their donors.
During1 the dark and perilous Winter of 1S0.% when men and women walked the Winter streets without work and homeless, the money of the rich flowed like water for the saving of the people. It is safe to say if the wealth of New York was withheld for one week, tho ceaseless wheels of charity would fail to move. All this on the surface; but who can compute the hidden acts of gracious benevolence that never reach the outside world? One very rich woman who died within remembered years cherished in her private chamber the crude offerings of grateful little waifs of the slums. She knew them all by name, and hers was written on the heart of caeh of her rescued children. One woman driving through the streets in her stately coach never fails to furnish her pockctbook with coin to relieve any object on tho street that attracts her regard. Flowers to the lonely sick, books forwarded to those who love to read and are too poor to buy. God alone knows how many prayers ascend from humble lips In twHialX of these ministering angels. One woman in this community is conspicuous for giving her whole life and vast fortune to ameliorating the anguish and necessities of the poor and afflicted. She is wedded to charity, childless, but the Incarnation of motherhood. Her " IIouso of Mirth *’ would make the angels rejoice. Tho motto of the rich is ** Noblesse oblige/' Alas, who knows the sorrows of the rich? Like their fellows, they are human. All the vices that afflict and degrade humanity are found among them; *S11 the suffering, disappointment, and loss. One has but to look about him to see. Let us discriminate. Let us look beneath the froth on tho surfacc to " that vast tide that is too deep for foam." Let us keep the good ever in sight, 11 lest we forget.'* Do not take the daily journals as a calendar of character; remember that evil flaunteth itself, and goodness pa^seth by veiled. And let us not rorget that in His summary of tho virtues the Blessed Master declared, But the greatest of these is charity.

New York Timex Saturday Review of Boohs: We are greatly Indebted to Kdilh Wharton for her admirable novel. As a work
•	of literary art, a story of entrancing interest, it is above criticism. But having pilloried the ** smart set," and the public having had its fling at them* I wish, in the name of justice, to offer a protest. The picture' which Mrs. Wharton pre-! sents, so far as It goes, is a true one; but ; the people in her •* House ot Mirth " are only a fragment of the’ class to which popular opinion consigns them. The rich,
and so-callcd leisured doss, is as distinctly human as ia'6hyloc||is Jew* "who
