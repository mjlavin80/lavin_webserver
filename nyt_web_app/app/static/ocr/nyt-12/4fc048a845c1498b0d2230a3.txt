J. A. FROUDE.
Herbert Paul’s New Biography of the Brilliant English Historian.*
By Arrangement with The London Times.
HE complaint to be made against Mr. Paul, if there la one, is that he has given us not so much a life of Froude as an essay on Froude's life and opinions— that is to say, a sketch. And a sketch is a thing which, after all our delight in its brilliance or dexterity, is apt to be found to have something about it which, in comparison with finished work, is a little unsatisfying and unresting. When we put down Trevelyan's ‘‘ Macaulay,” or even Pattison’s ** Casau-bon,” the thing is done; we are at ease in our chair, we rest in unquestioning assurance that we know Macaulay or Casau-bon. Even the human mind, the hungriest thing in the universe, asks lor no more. Mr. Paul will not resent the compliment of trying him by this highest of all standards. But he will no doubt reply that ho had no materials, either in personal knowledge or in the letters and papers supplied him, for attempting a biography of the great order. That is so; and it Is our misfortune as well as his, only the facts being as they are, it Is right that people should be told exactly what they are to expect. They are not to expect a detailed biography of Froude or a new revelation of his character and personality, or a collection of interesting diaries, or unpublished letters. There are some letters, of course, and there are some new facts. But there is nothing that alters substantially the accepted view of Froude; and all the new matter together would make a very small portion of the book.
New discoveries, then, are not what is to be looked for. What is to be looked for? What is to be looked Tor is a book in which Mr. Paul takes us through all the stages of Froude’s career and discusses them with the vigor, the pungency, the wit, the moral seriousness and Intellectual contempt which all who know his work have learned to expect from the
most brilliant of contemporary journalists. And when it is remembered that
the fields Into which Froude's life necessarily carry Mr. Paul include Oxford and Oxford education and the Oxford movement, High Church and Broad Church, Carlyle the idol and Freeman the enemy, as well as all the disputed problems of the Reformation, and the English in Ireland. and the English in their empire, to say nothing of the even more exciting controversies that rage round the Cheyne
Row household, every one will expect to
be kept very agreeably awake from the first page to the last. ,And no one will be disappointed. You may agree 9r disagree; you may smile or gnash your teeth as the political and historical ninepins go down. But if you care at all for matters historical or political or ecclesIasticaJ you will
not be bored.	'	.
Froude was not a man who underwent much change. Except for the very temporary phase of Tractarlanism, and the equally temporary reaction into active agnosticism which followed it, he remained throughout, as Mr. Paul says, a " Protestant, Puritan, sea-loving, priest-hating Englishman." What he regarded as the fundamentals of religion he fek little temptation to doubt; what he regarded as Its excrescences or, in the most literal sense of the word, its superstitions, he felt none to believe. Of all this side of him Mr. Paul writes with the insight and vigor of sympathy. Of the other sides, the existence of which he j does not conceal, though he has left them out of this particular summing up, he has naturally less to say. Mr. Froude, who was the eager panegyrist of tyranny and the frequent apologist of force, and even sometimes of the most horrible cruelty, Is naturally a less agreeable subject to enlarge upon. Nor can Mr. Paul be expected to enjoy dilating upon the enthusiastic defender of Cromwellian methods in Ireland, the scorner of the Irish people, the contemptuous belittler of Parliaments and free institutions, or perhaps even the man whose political eyes were always wandering away from Westminster to the England beyond the seas. The fact Is, of course, hat the politically minded man of letters is generally a very awkward person to fit into any of the ordinary divisions recognteed by politicians and Journalists.
Perhaps the most important thin? in Mr. Paul's book is his elaborate defense of Froude's claim to be a great historian. As against Freeman, Indeed, it can hardly be called a defense. In that matter the war is mercilessly carried into the enemy's camp. Not a word Is said against Freeman, the historian; but of Freeman, the critic of Froude, it is scarcely too much to say that nothing whatuvtr is left standing. Freeman is convicted out of his own roiutb. Mis 6wn letters show him confessing tfiat he was 11 profoundly ignorant of the sixteenth century/! the very subject on*whlchJh© put himself forward,
in ills own phrasS 'to belabor.’* the main

who had made a new era in English historical v>r<rk by his laborious study of the previous*/ unknown manuscripts in which the secrets of that period lay buried. He is refuted in detail after detail. It is again and again shown that where he did convict Froude of inaccuracy the error was due to the printer. Froude was amazingly careless, certainly, in correcting his proofs, while Freeman, as Mr. Paul characteristically puts it, ** had some skill in the correction of misprints, and would have been better employed in revising proof sheets i‘or Froude than in ‘ belaboring * him.” The final demolition of Freeman as the impartial defender of truth and history against Froude's ignorance and lies Is afforded by the evidence Mr. Paul has discovered in Freeman’s own copy of Froude's book, which is now in the Owens College Library. It is melancholy reading. In other fields Freeman’s Is a great name; and if he had not made it necessary by his injustice to Froude no one would wish to drag to light the ill-mannered expletives “ Beast,” “ Bat,” “ May I live to embowel James Anthony Froude," and others of the same order which deface these volumes, and recoil so cruelly now on their writer, throwing a light which is absolutely fatal on his temper and fairness, and one which is not very agreeable on his taste and character.
But the arfalr of Freeman is only an episode in Mr. Paul’s account of Froude, the historian. Larger issues are involved from which he does not shrink. Those who have had occasion to read the State papers of the reign of Henry VIII.* for instance, or the letters of Erasmus, will not, we fancy, be willing to use such unqualified language as Mr. Paul uses about Froude’s historical learning and trustworthiness. In the one ease it is at least doubtful Whether he had ever read any large number of the originals, however accurately he dealt with those he had read, and in the other It is certain that he again and again saw, not what was in the documents, but what he wanted to find- in them. No one who has read the contemporary accounts of the affair can stop short of amazement at his history of tho relations between Henry VIII. and
Anne Boleyn. But this, however impor-tent, is only a~ detail in Froude’s great work. Mr. PuuJ. who admits some serious errors in the Irish history, hardly seems aware th:it there are flaws in the ICnp-lish. It Is a pity, for the admission would really have strengthened and not weakened the effect of such remarkable testin’onies to Froude’s substantial accuracy as he quotes, about Erasmus, from Mr. Allen, who is editing the letters, and about Mt ry Queen of Seots, from Mr. AnJ/ew Lang.
The really Interesting question is not
that of Froude’s honesty, or even of the general truthfulness of his picture, which, except as regards Henry VIn., is not now, so far as we know, seriously disputed; it is that 'of his conception of the historian’s task. ** History is a science, no less and no more,” said the Regius Professor of
Modern History at Cambridge two years ago, on which Mr. Paul very justly comments: " If this view is correct and exhaustive, Froude was no historian. He must remain outside the pale in the company of Thucydides, Tacitus, Gibbon, Macaulay, and Mommsen.” There is the j issue. Is history a science or an art?' U l is the business of science to know the l facts and let them alone, as untouched as I may be by humanity or personality. It is | equally the business of art to know the facts, but by no means to let them alone. .Art Is nature seen through humanity, history seen through personality, everywhere the facts * seen through a temperament, the temperament of Raphael or Rubens or Turner, of Tacitus, of Saint Simon, of Macaulay. It is obvious to which school Froude belonged. Could a great historian possibly belong to any other? If a really scientific historian arose, one who had no creed or temperament, or at least never let us discover it, would anybody read him? If history Is to to alive It must be human, it must be personal, and it must have the limitations as well as. the strength of personality.
There was alloy, no doubt, In Froude’s
gold, but in spite of It, or because of it, his work is imperishable. No one will ever again tell the tale of the breaking of the bonds of Rome as he told it; no ore will ever dream of rivaling his story of the momentous struggle that left England the free and Protestant nation, with eyes always looking across the seas, that she has been ever since. And those immortal pages could not have been written if Froude had not been, carelessly, openly* and exultantly, what Mr. Paul calls him, a " Protestant, Puritan, sea-loving, priest-hating Englishman.”
