W. K, Brooklyn.—The poem about which J. McF.. Chattanooga, Tenn., asks, beginning “ When the lessons and tasks arc ended," Is hy Charles Monroe Dickinson of Binghamton, N. T„ and may be found in Coate'a *' Encyclopedia of Poetry” and in Stedman's " American Anthology/’ Page 471. In Bryant’s *' Li' brary of Poetry and Song," in the table ot contents, tho author U correctly given, but the name at the end of the poem is Charles Dickens, a printer’s error which the proofreader tailed to discover. Its title Is ** The Children.” which is also the title of a vommc of poems published In London in 1889 by the same author.
Mr. Dickinson is the editor and proprietor of The Binghamton “ Republican," and is now, or was lately, Consul General at Constantinople. The poem was published as long ago as 1S&4.
D. W. A.. La Fayette, Ind.—Nearly twenty-flve years ago I read a book that I would give much to get again. I was a small boy then, and the title has slipped out of my memory. I remember only a little of the story* Cr^se are a few of the fragments: Three children, two brothers and a sister, axe left homeless by the death (?) of th<iir mother. They set out to find their father, who has been outlawed (?) They hunt for him In “ Sherwood Forest,” and the ^tory is laid in the times of Robin Hood. In tho very start they come to a place where a band of hunters ate dinner and flod wine eggs which the hunters had left Thfr youngest boy wishes very much to kill a wild pig. The older boy quotes: “It is the nature of man to love to slay." Then there is a scene somewhere in the story where somebody kills a doer. These children have many adventures during their wanderings, and meet several characters. One ot these was Jean the Forester, another was callcd Jacob of the Bay. I think these children were detained some time In a sort of monastery, but am not sure of this. They finally fall in with Little John, who takes them to Robin Hood's band, where they find their father, Rollo the Archer. Thl3 is all I can remember of the story—too little, I fear— yet £ do hopo you will know what boof. It cas, as I want so much to get it.
And there was a flavor or venison pasty through the book, was there not? Wc think the story ia Anne Bowman's “ The Boy Foresters; a tale of the days of Robin Hood." It was published in the seventies by Routledgc. E. P. Dutton & Co. are agents for his publications.
Z. B. D., Brooklyn.—!. Will you please give me a suggestion as to what a young man’s library should contain? 2, Who was Herbert, and what are his writings?
1.	It depends so much on the young man. If he likes sports, let him get books on outdoor life; if he likes novels, let him get novels—history, get history—biography, get biography. He will want some books bearing on his business, undoubtedly; but he should not restrict his library to those. As Shakespeare puts it, “ In brief, sir, study what you most affect." 2. Wo supposo that George Herbert is meant; he was an English clergyman, courtier and poet, born 1503, died 1033. TIw poem by which he is chiefly known is “ The Temple,” published in 1034.
CL E. DECKER.—Kindly Inform me who pub-
Ilshcs the works of Robert Buchanan. I have several of his books in Munro's Seaside Edl-tion. Want them bound.
Buchanan's novels, almost without ex- I ception, were published only in the cheap paper editions, in this country; and In i England he seems to have had a different 1 publisher for about every book. Possibly some of the local firms which .represent English publishers might have better editions than those made here.
S,, Philadelphia.—'Will you kindly advise me as to the Duke of Argyll’s “ Organic Evolution Cross-Examined,” whether it has any standing as opposing the theory or evolution?
It has no scientific standing.

L. J. B.—Was not the cpltanb credited to Mr. Huxley in your issue of Dec. 23 written by the wife of the scientist Clifford? I havo seen it so stated—perhaps erroneously.
It may have been; but wo doubt the correctness of the ascription.
H.	3C N., Trenton, N. J.—Kindly inform me who was the Farmer General on whom '* Mon-selgncur” bestowed his sister as a prize, mentioned In the fifth paragraph of Chapter \-II. of “A Tale of Two Cities.”
He was no one In particular. M Mon-scigneur " is merely the (Dickens) typical French nobleman of the Old Regime; and the Farmer General theHypical rich bourgeois who married Into the nobility_jvith-out becoming noble*
; HEP, Leavenworth, Kan.—Can you give me
any Information about Rlcharde Harrison who printed a black letter quarto edition ot Calvin's “Institutions" in Whlto Crosse Street ; London, anno 15U2? His rc-bns trade mark j consists of a hare partially hidden In the butt of a standing sheaf of grain, on the binder of which is Inscribed R. L, and above the sheaf apiiears a conventional radiant sun. I do not
find mention of him in Blades, Slater, or Putnam.
I Johnson’s “Typographic" 1S24, says of Richard Harrison: "He was an ori"-| inal member of the Stationers’ Cotn-pany probably on the old livery, as 1 | he did not take up the livery when it was revived; he was Under Warden in 15(j2,
I but died before bis year of office had ex-I plrea. The company attended his funeral sermon, and Mrs. Harrison gave thc*m x s." He was the printer of Galvin’s “ In-Btltutiones" in folio in 1561, and of the | “ Institutiones ” in quarto, Cranmer’s Bible in folio, and Calvin’s "Neutrales" in quarto, all in black letter, m 1502. He is mentioned in Sayles and in some other books, but not so fully as in Johnson. 1
C,	S. H,, New York—In reply to A. E. Harlem, for author of lines “ I shall pass this way but oncc," &c„ seo Drummond’s “The Greatest Thins in the World.” It is found there, however, in quotation marks, but I am Inclined to think the quotation Is from the Bible.
The phrase is not in the Bible—the idea
Is not, either. The “ reverend gentleman's " ascription of it to Paul is merely another instance-of the familiarities that
some students take with the Bible.
HENRY L. WILLIAMS, Pearl River, N. Y — Regarding the expression:	I shall pass
through this world but once.”:	Long before
Mr. Moody gave fresh currency to it. Gov Horatio Seymour introduced it in a speech as original with a neighbor of his up the State. This trick of verisimilitude Is commoh with the orators of the ante-bellum period, as witness Lincoln. But it wa3 familiar earlier la
New England, a man giving overweight or heaping measure saying; “ I am not coming back this road and cannot verify.** A reverend fcntlcman ascribed it to flt Paul, (Acta, x., 38.)
He (the Master) passed through the world doing good."—Latin Vulgate; " Pertranaiit benefaclendo.”
A L. ,B.. Trenton, N. J.—I have seen mention of books by Mr. Wolfe—" Literary Shrines," and “ Literary Haunts and Homes ot American Authors ”—which arc presumably descriptive of authors' homes and the scenes of their work. Will you kindly tell what, if any, other books of the same character havo been written by Mr. Wolfe, and who publishes them.
The Lippincott Company publishes Dr. Wolfe’s books, as follows: “A Literary Pilgrimage,” “ Literary Shrines/' " Literary Haunts," "Literary Rambles,1" In all four volumes.
F. J. H., Norwich, Conn.—Can you tell me who was tho author ot this book: “ Notes ot a Journey Through France and Italy, London. Printed for Hunt and Clarke* Tavistock Street, Covent Garden, MDCCCXX.VI”?
The author was William Ha2lltt, critic and essayist, 1778-1830.	'
J. W. A. M.—Kindly favor mo by publish.
Ing tho approximate value of the following books:	(I) " An Historical Treatise of Cities
and Burghs and Boroughs,” by Dr. Brady, printed for and sold by James White In Ltn-coln’s-Inn-FleldB. 1777.	(2) “Minutes of the
Negotiations of Monsr. Mesnagar at tho Court of England," by himself, and printed for S. Baker at the Black Boy, 1T17. (:»} " A Code of Gentoo Laws." printed in London, 17S1,	(4)
" The True Interest and Political Maxima of the Republick of Holland and West-Fricsland,** by John De Witt and “other great men In Holland." Printed In London in 1702.
None of your books is of sufficient value to be recorded.
GRACE NAPIER WARD, Rouse's Point, N. Y.—I have much pleasure in sending the verses on the Bible asked for by your correspondent, A. E. P., Benson hurst, N. Y. I do not know the author's name.
The verses have been forwarded to A. E. P., together with a version sent by M. D.

5	® Calais Sands," for the benefit of “ R.
L. C. W., * who aska for an explanation of the poem In the issue of Nov. £5: The pcot happens to be on Calais Sands, and while there enioys himself dreaming about a lady whom he " lov^s ” hs only poets have liberty
t(?. Uut .wlt.h whom he is very Slightly ac-quaintid. As luck will havo it she comes over from England and stays overnight in the same botei In which the poet Is lodging, and next
day goes on, by train, to the Rhine. In tho absence of any biographical data, to the contrary, this seems to me an interpretation of uio poem.
A VAN FREDENBURG. Port Jervis, ..T?in^p” Bi;ooklynwill find “ Sing Always In the works or Fanny Crosby. The quotation mixes several lines. Three verses or the hymn or song were set to music by W
F.	Sherwin and published in “ The Victors,” a church music collection, edited by Mr. Sher-wjn and Chester G. Allen, and published by Bfglow & Main in New York City, first in 18W and In a revised form In 1870. The words and music will bo found on Pago 48 of tho 1870 edition.
CHARLES P. BUTLER. Brooklyn.—1’• Cor-ry O'Lanua," about whom “ E. P. 13." inquires in your issuo of Nov. 18, was John Stanton, tho humorist. He was born in London Nov. 4, IKJ2, and died in Brooklyn, N. Y., Nov. 2, IS70. Ho contributed humorous articles to The Brooklyn Eagle for several years.
I.	S., City Island, N. Y.—An Inquiry was mado a fortnight ago for a poem beginning:
My home is drear and still to-ni^ht.
Where Shenandoah murmuring flows;
The Biuc Ridge towers In the pale moonlight And balmily the couth wind blows.
The poem was written by Edna Dean Proctor during the civil war. Perhaps it can be found In. her puhlishcd poems. Its title is “The Virginia Mother.”
..-J:- P* Py», Rochester, N. Y.—In answer to " B. A, Westchester, N. Y„" I would say that the author ot her second line Is “ M. M.
D.,” probably Mary Mapes Dodge. The verses are In St. Nicholas for September. 18S1. I can send tho wholo poem if desired. The first verse is as follows:
Whcn-cv-or Pa-ra takes a walk,
•	He al-ways calls us three;
Ho says he couldn't go with-out Old Car-lo, Jane, and me.
W. A, J., Newark.—What poet said to another: *' For his faults I loved him; if he had
less faults, I should have loved him the less ” ?
The idea of this remark is not uncommon. Goldsmith, in “ The Good-Natured Man," said: “AH his faults are such that one loves him still the better for them"; ana Gen, Bragg, as every one knows, said of Cleveland: “ We love him for the enemies he has made." Congreve makes one of his characters say: " I like her with all her faults; nay, like her for her faults." But we do not find your very lines.
G.	H. C,, Passaic, N. J.—" J. p. H./1 Jersey Shore, Penn., Inquires for "Miss Lamb’s ‘Windham County.' (Conn.") Possibly the reference is made to " History of Windham County,” by Miss Eilen D. Larned, two large volumes, published in 1S71 by the author, printed in Worcester, Mass.
TENTH NEW JERSEY.“The statement by yr>ur correspondent, *• M. J. C.,1' Boston, that Chartes Y. “ rehearsed his own funeral rites," shows the persistence of myth and fable. If anything fictitious In history has been disproved it is the story—first told ever st many years after liis dcath-that the great Emperor had an ante*mortem funeral. Of the numerous writers wlio have exposed the fiction. Parsons, in his ** Errors and Lies of History,” may be mentioned as a very entertaining- as well as Instructive author.
