IT Is impossible nowadays to say, M This is the latest thin-paper book," for even as one says the words, another volume appears on the paper which is doing so much for “ standard literature reviving: it. Think of Poe's works—nine volumes, we think they used to be—in four volumes that one can not only take in his hand to the fire, but can slip in his pocket! More than 1,800 pages of text in four pocket volumes.
But these volumes are not merely an edition on thin paper; they are edited with as much care as If they were printed on “ hand-made deckel-edged paper" in a limited " de luxe edition *’—or for people who read books, not merely buy them for their library. The first volume contains reminiscences of Poe by Richard Henry Stoddard, a brief biography of Poe, and many of his stories; the second, besides the stories, has Lowell's sketch of Poe, written In 1844; the third has N. P. Willis’s reply to Griswold’s obituary notice of the poet, and the fourth, besides its account of the Fordham cottage, contains the poems. The editing has been performed with skill and sympathy—two qualities not always found among editors, some of whom are only too much inclined : to look down upon the author whose works they edit, Mrs. James T. Fields, we think it was, likened the reading of an annotated Shakespeare to an attempt to play on the piano with mittens on one s hands. The notes to this edition of Poe have no muffling or mittening effect; they afford information where it is needed, and In such a way as to explain Foe, not to exploit the editor.
Not the least interesting feature of this edition is the republication of Lowell's contemporary biography of Poe and of N.
P. Willis’s obituary of the poet, seldom to be read nowadays. The latter was a defense of Poe, dashed off in the heat of the author’s feelings outraged by Rufus Griswold's version of the poet's life. Its publication now is of literary and historical interest:	So, too, are the fac
similes of letters and manuscripts, and the pictures that serve as frontispieces to the four volumes; Poe’s portrait,
from the daguerreotype owned by The Players, believed to be the last taken of him; the Allan house In Richmond; the building In Richmond where Poe editt-d The Southern Literary Messenger, and the house at Fordham where Poe had his only real home.
The volumes themselves, In spite of their 1,800 pages, are smaller than even the usual thin-paper editions, being Itimos In size. But their type is large and clear—much larger than one would expect, and the books are admirably adapted to their purpose— making all of Poe’s work, prose and poetry, available, if not to the man that runs, at least to the man that travels or that prefers to hold his book in his hand rather than bend over it on a table. We think there should be a revival of interest In Poe, duo to these charming little volumes. They will be
