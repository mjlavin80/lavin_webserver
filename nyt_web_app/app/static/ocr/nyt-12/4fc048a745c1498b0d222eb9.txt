A ISTEW VOLUME OF ESSAYS BY MR* BIRRELL
By II. W. BOVWTOX.

UGUSTINE BIRRELL is not wliat would be called a commanding figure in modern English letters; he would be the first to disclaim any such distinction. An attempt to foist it upon him would amuse him, no doubt. He would have a little quiet fun at his own expense, and the rest of the world would not get off scot-free. He would suggest some demure and deprecating inquiry into the nature of a “ commanding figure in letters," he would hint at the superior qualifications of certain of his contemporaries, and dismiss the subject with a smile and a genial wave of the finger-tips. Mr. Birrell is, if you like, a writer of yesterday rather thg.n of to-day; a writer of independent and even audacious mind who yet holds to certain comfortable old-fashioned amenities. He belongs to the period of Dobson, of Garnett and Stephen, rather than to the hour of Chesterton, Hune-ker, and Shaw. He is too sound a humorist to be In danger of buffoonery, too accomplished a scholar to mistake wit for criticism. Just now it is our whim to be as proud of- the self-made writer as of the self-made millionaire. Look, we say, at the most popular
story writer and the most popular dramatist of the day; tftcy never went to one of your universities, they never had a chance to get the thing you call education. They educated themselves, they are the product of direct contact with life, they have studied the human document—and here they are.
Yes, we admit with due meekness, here they are—but there they are not. We are proud of what they can do, but we observe a variety of things they cannot do, some of them of importance. For one thing, they cannot be simple, gracious, and at ease. They h/yyg accomplished the fortiter In re, but the suaviter In modo Is quite beyond them. It Is hard for them not to wish to shine among their equals; a consideration of no consequence to a writer who has both ability and breeding. If Mr. Birrell’s literary ability is not of the first order, (and that would seem to be true also of the popular Idols In question,) there is no doubt about the perfection of his literary breeding. The point seems worth making because his considerable powers are such as might, if self-developed, have readily lent themselves to a merely brilliant and spectacular way of writing.' They were, on tho other hand.' In no danger of being subdued by contact with “the humanities,1* to use that rich old phrase.

and humane tradition of letters. It would, of course, be easy to name writers out of Oxford and Cambridge, especially among the latest generation, who have missed or grown away from that association. This is most common among those who have undertaken to write for a living. Mr. Birrell J has not been subjected to the peculiar | temptations of the professional writer. , He has not, It is fair to say, had the advantage of that healthy stimulus of which tho professional writer in his best moments is conscious. Ho has the qualities and the defects of the highest type of amateur. It is a type which can hardly be said to exist in America.
If these remarks were to induce some reader not hitherto acquainted with Mr. Birrell to look over his latest volume of essays, (“ In the Name of the Bodleian," Scribner,) he might easily think we had been taking an agreeable writer too seriousl3r. Their very unpretentiousness would count against them, for our first impulse is to take a man, whether In a book or in society, at his own valuation. We expect him to put-his best foot forward, and as if it were a member in which he had perfect confidence. Mr. Birrell Is confident enough, but does not care at all which foot comes first. He obviously considers it his affair what he writes about and how he writes about It. Ho has not produced very much in bulk; once In three or four years appears under his name a collected ’miscellany of papers originally printed In the English periodicals, "In the Name of the Bodleian ” is the sixth of the series and is rather sllghterin material than its predecessors. Most -of the essays are very brief, and many of them are occasional. They none of them, perhaps, have to do with subjects of the first literary importance. None of them will seem really trivial to lovers of 11 Obiter Dicta M and Its successors. For they are ail marked by the good-humored acuteness, the animated nonchalance, which engaged us in him long ago. We cannot help- being interested in what interests him, for wo are glad of anything that may help us to a better acquaintance with him. No, this is not because wo take him to be a great man; it Is a question of companionship, not of hero-worship. For the rest the fact remains that men who writ© about whatever happens to interest them, and-use their natural Idiom, are likely to bG read, for their own
sakes, long after your philosopher has become the spook of a system, and your stylist-the shadow'Of V namc.

write dully than his master Bagehot. He also would be capable of a witty treatise on parliamentary law or of giving charm to a reliable discourse on political economy. There is nothing humdrum in this account of the founding' and development of the great Oxford treasure-house of books. Tho paper closes with a characteristic suggestion to American millionaires: "If by any happy change,” he remarks mildly, “any one of them should accidentally stumble across an odd million, even half a million of dollars, hidden away In some casual investment he had forgotten, what better thing could he do with it than send it to this the most famous foundation of his old home?” In a later essay he expresses a whimsical grievance against American authors apropos of international copyright.	.
The United States of Amorica have been a great disappointment to many an honest British author. In the wicked old days when the States took British books without paying for them, they used to take them in large numbers, but now that they have turned honest and passed a law allowing the British author copyright on certain terms, they have in great measure ceased to take; for, by the strangest of coincidenreg. no sooner were British novels, histories, essays, and the like protected In America than there sprang up in the States themselves novelists, historians, and essayists not only numerous enough to supply their own home market.s, but talented enough to cross the Atlantic in large numbers and challenge us in our own. Such a reward for honesty was
not contemplated.
On the whole, the most vigorous essay of the lot is the brief defense of " Our Great Middle Class,’* It was suggested by a reprint of Arnold's ° Friendship^ Garland,” of which Mr. Birrell does not think very highly. He does not consider its treatment of the middle classes at all just, and calls attention to the fact that the middle class's treatment of Arnold was most magnanimous. It was they ** who took him to honest hearts, stuck his photograph upon their writing tables/' and in fact constituted his chief audience. He did at least give them a chance, teach them something. It Is against the attacks of a very different sort of adversary that Mr. Birrell makes his most spirited counter-attack. It is all in one sentence, but expresses with satisfying completeness the attitude of the humane mind toward a kind of literature just now lamentably conspicuous. “A rabble of bad writers may now be noticed pushing their vulgar way along who, though born and bred In the middle classes, and distinguished by many of the very faults Mr. Arnold deplored, yet make It a test of their membership, an * open sesame* to their dull orgies, that all decent, sober-minded folk, who love virtue, and, on the whole, prefer delicate humor to sickly lubricity, should be labeled * middle class/ ” If we have said anything to give an impression of Mr. Birrell as a merely genial, gentlemanly, bookish person, a compound of the connoisseur, the litterateur, and the don, this sentence should make matters right. It is by such utterances that criticism continues to prove itself an influence in the active world.
