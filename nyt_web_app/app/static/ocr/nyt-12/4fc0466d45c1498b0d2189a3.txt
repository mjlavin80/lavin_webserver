FOR more than a century there has been no moral dou'jt of the marriage o$ Maria Fitzherbert and Ge0rge IV. of Great Britain. For the last seventy years It has been practically certain that the proof of that marriage was deposited j. in Coutts’s bank, in London. Fifty years ago application was made to the person who had charge of the documents that he permit thcl% publication: but with the ! curious hesitancy of a clergyman In cer- [ tain cases, he refused on the ground that ! Mrs. Fitzherbert could never have In- 1 tended that they be published—though It was provable that she kept them from destruction for that very purpose. At last, however, that curious English par- 1 son, who was not the original trustee of | the papers, but Inherited his position as their guardian, died; and In some* way— not explained—the papers were acquired I by King Edward, who placed them at the disposal of the author of this volume, and thus enabled him to prove conclusively ; that Mrs. FiUlierbert was the wife of i George. Prince of Wales, later George IY. i
Apart from this fact there is not much now In the booli, though It is Interesting enough. Mr. Wilkins shows that the marriage occurred at Mrs. Fitzherbert’s I house in Park Street, Park Lane, London,
, on Dec. 15, 1785, and that not " Parson '* Johnes Knight* as supposed, but the Rev. Robert Burt, officiated. Mr. Henry Er-: dngton, her uncle, gave the bride away; j and he and her brother acted as witnesses. After tho ceremony the Prince of Wales wrote out the certificate: ** We, the undersigned, do witness yt George Augustus Frederick, Prince of Wales, was married unto Marla Fitzherbert, this 10th of December. 1785," and it was signed by the parties, " George P., Maria Fitzherbert, John Smythe, Henry Errlng-ton.” Many years later Mrs. Fitzher-bert cut out the names of the witnesses at their earnest request, to save them from the peril or the law. In 1799 the Prince wrote to her: " Thank God my witnesses are living, your uncle and your brother, besides Harris, fLord Malmesbury,] whom 1 shaJl call upon as having , been informed by me of every, even the minutest, circumstance of our marriage.” In default of the witnesses’ names to the certificate, Mrs. Fitzherbert kppt this letter with the other papers.
The need of keeping the marriage secret was caused by the royal marriage act, passed in 1772, which forbade any person of royal blood from marrying without the King's consent under the age of 25, under hriivy penalties upon the clergyman and witncsros, and declared such a marriage void. Besides this was the act of succession, which forbade the marriage of a person in succession to the throne with a Roman Catholic under penalty of exelusion from the throne. Mrs. Fitzherbert wan a Homan Catholic. On this subject some of the chief lawyers of England have rendeied opinions, ar.d Mr. Wilkins quctes from Brougham, who held that according to law the cerrmony was illegal and the marriage null and void, but that by the law of both the Anglican and the Rom in Churches it was valid. As It happened, the death of George IV. without children or lawful descendants obviated th^ nrcd of settling what might have been a difficult question.
Mr. Wilkins lias made a very complete biography of Mr;', Fitzherbert. u?;ng Forr.o hitherto unpublished letters of hers and her husband. Although hr writes as .** pirtisiui of Mrs-, Fitzherbert. In* is fulr^ minded c-ncugh to writi* of tin- King;
Whei/the mists of passion and prejudice have to some <xUnt cleared away it is beginning to b*j	that the judgment
passed on him w:is too harsh. Even ho had his good qualities, some of them lovable. UN faults v.:’re ninny an J grave, bat some of them were vory human ;<nd others almost inevitable from his edi,nation and environment. There must iuiv^ beecn good in him or :i good v.- m *.n wo :1 I not htMu loviti him.
