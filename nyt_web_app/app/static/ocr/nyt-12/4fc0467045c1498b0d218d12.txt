NATURE AS A FIELD FOR FICTION,
Some New Books on Natural History and Outdoor Life Dealing: with Fact
. and Fancy.*
Writu a for The ICew York Times Saturday Review op Books by
MABEL OSGOOD WRIGHT.
OML time ago when John Burroughs wrote his famous article for The Atlantic Monthly attacking the writings ot Ernest Thompson Se-ton and William J. .Long, he made one to.ave error, that of taking the point of view of the quasi scientific observer of nature's methods, instead of that of the naturalist facing a rather new literary phase inhere nature was seized as a field of fiction. Seton began with virile originality, but worked h-j lode so greedily that he frequently sidetracked and bored through into sand. Long- used as his stock in trade an incomprehensible mixture of enthusiasm, love of tbe beautiful, inverted observation and folk-lore testimony of guides and halfbrccds, leaven by a weird credulity much broader than the wide but fixed limits of natural law, by which it must be judged, if his claims were to be regarded seriously.
Of course throughout all time natural history has been a setting for mythology, overdrawn conclusions, and errors of observation backed up by curious forms ot ignorance such as made John Josselyn, gentleman of Kent, who, in writing his observations made in this country in 1638, state that " in the New World barley commonly degenerates into oats and Summer wheat often changeth Into rye."
The difference between the creator of the hero of human fiction and the authentic record of the doings of a specific indiv.d-ual that constitute biography lies in this. The hero of fiction is in more or less degree a composite character, but all his attributes must be of course in accord with the known qualities of man, even though mixed in proportions to suit the author. This latter point some of our creators of this new type of fiction forget, and insist not only upon the Introduction of unprovable characteristics. for their animal heroes, that do not add but rather detract from tho strength of the situations. no matter in what light they are -i<l«-rod, but Insist that the composite lc <.u.i*?idered as an individual pure and simple, whose comings, goings, and thoughts they have personally (or by proxy) watched and fathomed.
This posiUon is foolish from any standpoint, for those who love a good, human story, both for its characterization and literary expression, do not care a pennyworth whether the hero is an actual man Unawn to the author or a creature of his fancy, so long as a rational and convincing probability is maintained. U is when the authors In this new field insist that they arc not only telling ” the truth and nothing but the truth,” which, moreover, they have personally touched, tasted, swallowed, and digested, that a halt must be called.

CHARLES G. D. ROBERTS, the most consistent writer of this new school, as v,\.*!l as the one having the most artistic tcmoerament, regarded from the literary standpoint, sounds the right note in the preface to his splendid story of '* Red Fox," when he says:
Jn the following story T have tried to trace the career of a fox of the backwoods district of Eastern Canada. The hero of the st^rv. Red Fox. m:iy hr t'ikcn as fairly typical, both in his characteristics :tnd in the experiences that befall him, in spite of the fact that he is stronger and cleverer than the average run of foxes. * * * This fact docs not detract from his authenticity as a type of his kind. * * 0 As for any emotions which Red Fox m ly once in a great while soem to display, these may safely be accepted by the most cautious as fux emotions, not as human emotions. In so far as man is himself an animal, he is subject to and impelled by many emotions which he must share with not a few other members of the animal kingdom. Any full presentation of an individual animal of one of fhe more highly developed species must depit t cert.tin emotions not altogether -.alike tho^e which a human being experiences under like conditions?. To do this is not by any means, as some hasty critics would have it. to ascribe human emotions to thy lower animals.
W77,L7AM J. LONG, however, in his latest volume, " Northern Trails," persistently and foolishly, no matter what may be the standpoint, adheres to his old formula, which was made Into

f kindling wood, burned, * and the ashes I scattered to the four winds by Burroughs's ^ somewhat narrow criticism. This volume, with its spirited illus-! tratlons by Charles Copeland, is made up of eight stories. “ Wayseeses the Strong One,” (a wolf story, following many miles afterLobo,” Seton‘s first and best achievement,) ** In Quest of Waptonk the Wild;” the pursuit of the ; wild goose in Its breeding grounds; ** Pequam the Fisher,M tbe cunning robber of traps; “ The Trail of the Cunning One," •• Out of the Deeps," dealing with whales, seals, sharks, and gulls; Mat-weeck of the Icebergs," a polar bear;
, " Where the Salmon Jump," and " The , Story of Kopseep,” a- salmon-colored romance.
Listen to the author’s solemn guaran-, tee of absolute voracity, and the completely Identified Individuality of each animal I depicted, with one single exception in the case of Kopseep the Salmon, where, it being impossible to personally follow the fish under water from the sea to the river sources, the author was obliged M either to omit that part of his life or to picture It as best I could from imagination and the records of the salmon hatcheries and deep-sea travelers,"
The reader who has not followed such trails before will ask at once, How many of these things are true? Every smallest incident recorded here is as true as careful and accurate observation can make It. In most of the following chapters, as in all previous volumes, will be found the direct results of my own experience among animals; and In the few cases where, as stated plainly in the text, I have used the experience of other ^ind wiser men, X have taken the facts from first hand and accurate observers, and have then sifted them carefully, so as to
retain only those that are, In my own mind, without a question as to truth.
Ah, Mr. Long, nere Is another Illustration of the glaring inconsistency of your methods. We, the reading public, must swallow whole any presentment you choose to make, but you reserve the right to question the statements born of the experience of " other and wiser men, firsthand and accurate observers," and retain only what appeals to you as being truth,, thus confessing to a standard of veracity that, instead of being fixed, is to he wholly controlled by the personal equation of the author. Against th‘s a priori the pen of criticism is powerless except to recommend a severe Winter course of pure logic as a possible cure. Aside from the controversial side as to whether these eight stories are to be classified as natural history or fiction, these tales of the northern trails are dull and lifeless. A certain entertaining quality that the author's earlier volumes, probable or Improbable, possessed is missing. For some reason, we care very little about the animals portrayed; the stories are too much worked out; Insistence upon truth and verbosity of detail and palpable word paintin^ are not creative qualities, and nowhere is there a single breath of the genius such as makes the creatures of the jungle books as vitally probable to us as the little squirrel that gambols about the porch.

A MANLY book, written from the sportsman's standpoint, is ** Wild Fowl, of the Fur, Feather, and Fin Series, and fathered by three authors— L. H. De Visme Shaw, who supplies the narrative as well as the biographies of ducks in general and particular. The chapters on shooting the duck and goose are by W. II. Pope, while A. I. Shand winds up the volume with twenty-odd pages upon wild fowl cookery. The Illustrations by Archibald Thorburn and Charles Wymper arc unusually fine; those of Thorburn, the British master of his craft, being not Only full of action and feeling but arc pit1 lures In the best sense. The whole volume Is written in a direct and vivid manner that, while convincing and instructive to the sportsman in every detail concorning stalking or shooting wild fowl, even to the calibre of shot best suited to the different species, is also excellent reading from a narrative standpoint, while thi* maintaining of the outdoor atmosphere should make it welcome on this side of the water, especially at the Christmas season, when it is so difficult to find an inexpensive something for which the outdoor man will really care. For all sportsmen love the duck as a Quarry inseparable from the sea or river In which it swims or the lung reviving mist that, rising from the water, shows the coveted birds closely bedded In the still water behind bar or inlet. Says Mr. Shaw;
That lhe*duck has been popular with man is an article of food since the very dawn of our race is attested by the fact that wild duck hones have been discovered among the uncons'dcrcd trifles thrown to the ground Ly troglodytes of the Stone Age. In Lcpsius's “ Denkmiiler aus Egypten ” and elsewhere are to be seen drawings of Egyptian monuments ranging in date from H,00Cl B. C. to 1,000 B. C„ which represent duck being taken by means of a net, and also being killed by the boomerang—the weapon whiazlng through the a.r in the direction of the
birds. The dtick Js common In the art of anclcnt Babylon* By the Romans/the head and breastsofa duck were' considered' choice delicacies. The Anglo-'Saxon name for duck was *'enIdM; enid rake, the ruling duck is undoubtedly the origin of our word drake. The word duck comes Irom the Danish •' dukke M or the Dutch ** dulven,*'- to dive or stoop. Mallard is the Norman male in anglicised w garb. Duck as a turn of endearment, has nothing to do with the bird, but ** dokkc." a doll. In the Earl of Northumberland's Household Book, date 1512, the jjrlcp^lven for mallard appears as 2d. each; teal-.' (Spelled teylle) being bought for half that sum.
A SELF-SUPPORTING HOME," by Kate St. Maurs, the wife of an English actor of a literary bent, who for some years past has been favorably known to the American stage, is the true story in Ml its practical details of a woman who had the pluck to break loose from the disheartening struggle with the hectic condition of city flat life and not only transplant her family to the country, but evolve and carry out a plan to house and feed them without encroaching upon the slender household capital.	’
Many people have In recent years " adopted abandoned farms *’ for homes l In the vacation season until the doing has become more than a mere vogue and ! ha3 all the solid dignity of an upward ; movement in the plan of living of the In! telligent portion and especially of the Itt-, erary class. These places are usually I charming, but often too far from mercantile centres to make practical all the year homes for those who must work in town, therefore a tried and proved selfsupporting home, twenty-five miles from New York and In close proximity to the j station is fairly novel, and an undertaking | sure to attract attention and wholesome ! Imitation.
1	A self-supporting country home for persons whose income depends on personal effort within the heart of a great city, will seem a Utopian dream unless I relate my personal experiences as to Its practical value, which commenced ten years ago. Up to that time I had been a city woman, striving, like hundreds of ! others, to maintain appearances on a i housekeeping allowance which needed [ coaxfng owr every little bump of hospl- ] talfty to Induce the two ends to meet. Through ail the petty warfare of bad times, one desire, one hope was paramount—a country home where plenty should make visitors an unalloyed pleasure.
With this plain statement the book begins. the author straightway proceeding i to the selection of the house, and the various ways and meang by which live slock was accumulated from a beginning of one elderly Plymouth Rock setting hen, two ducks, a drake, three guinea fowls, two maltese cats, and a pair of white rabbits, for nothing came amiss or failed to be turned to profit by this Indomitable farmer, from an egg to kittens, or " Easter" rabbits furnished to a dealer in pet stock.
The fifteen chapters, beginning with the origin of the farm, show its evolution from small beginnings where a dry goods box served as a duck coop, up to the time when well-equipped henneries, &c., of commercial importance are attained, are grouped according to the typical work of the months, beginning with October. Outside of the usual domestic dairy, vegetable and flower garden, the home support was gained by raising ducks, pigeons, pet rcibblts, mushrooms, bees, pheasants, grese, turkeys, cats of high degree, th^ directions concerning the purchase and care of which, as well as the advice upon building up the business side of a farm arc both detailed and convincing. The book is no theoretical treatise or dream, but the earnest work of a woman of n charming personality, which she modestly strives to conceal, who in sharing the |
fruits of her success wilh a public that I haTs need of the information given, do<** it a greater scrvice than a score of | learned writers on social and political i economy.
A few little slips there are here and there, such as the statement that " A cow:s age can be told by the rings or ridges on the horns, one appearing for each calf:" Whereas, the calf has nothing to do with the matter, the first ring nj.ptaring at the age of two and a ring being added for each year of the animal’s life, irrespective of family, the same test of age applying equally to oxen. Two things arc proved by ihis excellent book— that the sclf-supportiaj country horne, to be successful, must not only be personally conducted, bjL that Us mistress must be of more than the average Intelligence and master of all rural arts and sciences, so that by independence of hired help in | many emergencies she may avoid a | downfall. “Cultivate the habit of talking to your horse when cleaning, hitching, or feeding. No matter how good a n^n you may have, lose no time in acquiring the knowledge that will enable 3'ou to intelligently care for your horse should the necessity arise,” is one of the many sane bits of advice in regard to outdoor housekeeping, that shows the trend and quality of the writer. Even if you do not as yetT desire to possess a country home such as Mrs. St. Maurs, buy this book and digest It thoroughly, as It will open a new vista before you, that will surely lure you to the desire of a nearer view, for a condition where the life is more than meat and the body than
-raiment is nowhere better to’ be found , than In a self-conducted, self-supported country home.	„*	-■	.

FROM the country home to a book upon floriculture is but a step, and a good book for the gardener, amateur or professional, to keep upon hia table for Winter evenings, when garden Improvements are planned and experiments suggest themselves temptingly, is Carnations and Pinks," edited by E. T. Cook. To be sure, It Is an English volume, Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons being its importers, but much of the cultural directions for the growing of carnations, picO-tees, wild and garden pinks are available here also. Except for Winter forcioff the pink family has never received due ! consideration from American gardeners. The chief reason for this is undoubtedly due to the severity of our Winters and the scorching suns of July and August, yet these might be in a great measure | overcome if ttfe ^amateur gardener can only be convtnced"of the beauty and general worth of these flowers and their suitability to the M old-fashioned gardens" that are steadily and surely replacing the gaudy and inartistic carpet beds. To once see the gardens of Kew or Hampton Court ablaze at midsummer with rich carnations and—delicately marked plc-tees is enough to encourage one to take the extra trouble necessary to gtow tlie plants in our climate, where extremes require a more frequent renewal o? the beds than in the old country. Even the chapter headings seem like whiffs of a fragrant bouquet and make one long for the month to comc when the little flat seeds may be sown and the experiment begin. The first chapter, ** Early History of the Carnation, Sweet William, and Fink," is an interesting sketch: then follows “The Carnation in the Garden,’* " The Border Carnation,’* ‘"lht Picotee,” "White and Yellow G rounds,” “ The Malmaison Carnation/’ u The Tree or Perpetual-Flowering Carnation,*'	'* Carnations for Exhibition: a
Year’s Work,” “ Carnations in Town Gardens,” (not New York.) Carnation Growing in America,” '* The Pink,” *' Wild Pinks," and “The Pinks of the Alps." Of half-hardy outdoor flowers no one family here has a longer season of bloom than the pink that covers the ground with the clove-scented masses of the fringed Scotch pink in May until the last Margaret carnation holds ice crystals between its sturdy petals In November.
“ The Vegetable Garden," translated from the French of MM. Vilmorin-An-drleux of Paris, is an exhaustive book of nearly 8tA> pages of all vegetables known to or* worthy of modern culture. It should have a place in the garden library' as a rcfercnce book, though we have many volumes more suggestive and of more convenient form for the use of the amateur. Foreign books of this class are at best only suggestive, as many varieties of vegetables, even though adaptable to our soil, demand a different culture here, and the conflicting advice is confusing.
