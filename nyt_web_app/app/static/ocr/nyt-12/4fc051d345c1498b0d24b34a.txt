THERE is no denying that books Of this sort are not “popular” nor „ ** best sellers,” but if they were tt j would be better for all of us. They axe shunned because they are not thought easy reading, and their practicality is 1 not perceived. For lack of such perception, great suffering has come, and is likely to come again, to both individuals and the community at large, without ap-pi uhension of how the harm is done. Merchants, hank officials, even legislators, are constantly showing a dullness of perception as costly to them as thick-headed thinking was to the Irishman who was accustomed to charge $2 a day of ten hours or *i0 cents an hour. He was con- j tented for years until he was employed , by one man who took the trouble to ex- ! plain that when he worked for $2 a day j he lunched in his employer's time, but when he worked by the hour he took his j r.oon hour at his own cost- Errors regard- ! mg currency and banJUng invite and con- l ceal similar leaks upon the largest scale. Not less insidiously does the country suffer by lack of general and sound ideas on ! the subjects of this book. Mr. Conant is in the position of the Irishman’s employer, and he tc*tches the larger accounting in a manner so that all who will may understand it.
His success is the result of fitness reached through a career of extremest practicality. A newspaper correspondent j at Washington, a Commissioner of the , Currency of the Philippines, a. member of the Commission of International Exchange, and finally a high official of a i leading trust company—here is a man who ; has been close to the wheels while they revolved, and ts fitter than almost any other to blend theory and practice-into the ! highest practicality. This, In fact, is the | book’s chiLra-teristic. There are other books of theory as sound and learned, and there are other books of narrative and fact even superior In their way. But it Would be difficult to name a treatise which blends facts and theory so well, j applying each to the other in .a manner so illuminating. Take, for Instance, the chapters upon one of our burning questions—our crazy-quilt currency system. Mr. Conant is delightfully clear In his explanation of why a currency all gold is needlessly expensive, and how a paper currency caa be substituted with equal safety, and with an economy to the Nation which would go far to help it to success In tho hard struggle for the world’s trade when every burden Is a handicap. The passages upon elasticity in a currency and upon the proper basis of a banking currency are further examples of happy treatment of topics of to-day, and which will long be of absorbing interest to men of affairs, wnether affairs of the market place or Capitol. It would be a happy day if the principles of civil service reform might be applied to our lawmakers, and only those be eligible who passed a satisfactory examination at least in the topics likeliest to come before them for official action. But any American is thought fit to bo a legislator by virtue of birth cr naturalization. They are long of patriotism, but they are likely to be short of thorough training, with the result that the necessity of the moment often fastens upon us a makeshift device—like the greenbacks or a bond based currency—and partisanship makes it permanent. Mr. Con-ant'0 book lessens the excuse for such blunders.
