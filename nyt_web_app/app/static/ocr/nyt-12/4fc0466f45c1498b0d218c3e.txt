SOUTHWARD, HOI
Another Readable Book About Ant* arctic Hxploration and Adventure.5*1
the two volumes written by Oapt. Scott, the commander of the Discovery In the British National ant- , arctic expedition, the volume by Lieut, Armitage come3 in the nature of a refreshing ! supplement As Dr. Nansen, in a preface to the book, says, " he has written j a most entertaining and readable tale ! about it * 1 *	* told In a manner
simple and straightforward—like the man himself."	|
That is likely to be the general view of Lieut. Armitage’s book. He is a ! good narrator and carrics the reader j along with a warmth that Is surprising : in such a chilly subject- Here and there lie rises to brilliancy, then staggers anti falls down for a bit like some i plain fellow who has been caught in the act of unusual eloquence and ; blushes for himself.
His own excuse for writing a book about the antarctic expedition In the Discovery after Capt Scott had said his “ say ” is that some people may welcome a plain tale about half a hundred plain men who were away from their families for three years. One is apt to suspect, however, that Lieut. Armitage's real reason for publishing | the book is that he wrote it In the antarctic during the “ long night ”—kept a 1 diary day by day—but with the respect ! and modesty which characterizes every page of It, allowed his superior officer I first M say/'
No matter who had official prerogative, however, it must be said, without casting any aspersions, that the Lieu- I tenant has turned out a work which is ; likely to live in the hearts of the people, If not in the dusty archives of scientists and cosmographers. He begins at tho beginning, describes the parting from the English shore as only a sailor can, doesn’t hurry the reader into the fog and blizzard and pack-ice too suddenly, but lowers the temperature of the bath gradually. He gives us humorous stories of life on board ship, descriptions of the tropic islands the Discovery went past, and In the enthusiasm with which the ship Is greeted and given godspeed as it moves further south the Lieutenant really manages to get Into his pages that thrill of ex* pcctaney, that fire of adventure spirit, that spice of danger to come, which made "Treasure Island" an atmosphere of its own.
And when the reader really arrives at the antarctic circle he finds himself, not at the one hundredth page, but on the bows of the Discovery, gazing on a field of gathering ice, not with tbe dreary boredom that usually is associated with fields of ice and confusing geographical terms, but with that In his mind which makes life worth living j —the interrogation point ! As an example of Lieut Armitage’s j power of charging the reader with this atmosphere of romance, observe his method of describing the crow's nest from which observations were made:
It always seemed to me that I had more absolute control of the ship when I was in that situation than in any other. Beneath one is i.hu ship hersulf, her whole upper contour sharply and gracefully delineated, and one feels, as it wove, quite separated from her and yet directing her every motion. Ahead and all around is a vast illimitable field of ice, which in the furthest distance appears to be absolutely impervious to attack. Somewhat eloser are to be soon thin, black-looking streaks of water: and still closer to the ship the weak places in the lino of defense thrown out from the inhospitable land which we arc determined to reach are easily seen; and one is able to guide the ship from one lead to the other by the least line of resistance.
When the ship has taken to Us Winter qxiarters and the men are cooped up practically within the confines of the ship for months on end, Lieut. Armitage's spirit still conquers the dreariness which so often attends descriptions of how tho men passed the time. It is certain that the discomforts of this period must have been

♦TWO YEARS l\ THE ANTARCTIC.
Ucins a Narrative ot tho British National Antarctic Kxpodition. By Albert Li. Arrnit-ap**, l.ifUtinant R. N. It. With illustm-Edwartl Arnold. New York: JLongmans, Green & Co. $0.
we exhausted each other's little yarns and jokes somewhat, and I often admired the attentive manner in which an oft-told tale would be received by the narrator's audience; the joke, too,
' that had frequently served its term, would still raise a laugh from us all. If a stranger could have been suddenly conveyed from the centre of civilization to our wardroom, he would, I am; afraid, have felt a trifle nervous as he heard the merriment that ensued on' some remark being made, and in which-he, without doubt, would have been ‘ unable to discern any cause for laughter, hut whict* to us sounded very funny indeed. A most fortunate thing it was, too, that we were able to see the humorous side of things in these regions; otherwise our life in the secluded south would have been a most melancholy affair.
A part of this book which will appeal to youths as well as *' old boys ” is where In the Winter quarters the ice landscape becomes so familiar to the crew that from a colorless expanse it becomes a local habitation and a name/* There is no boy who ever played Indians in tho backyard -vbo has not delighted in giving names to every cabbage, tree, and fence—Dead Man’s Gulch, Massacre Boulder, and so forth. In Lieut Armitage’s book one reads with delight of how the crew christened the glaciers, the rocks, and the valleys. There was Castle Rock, Carter Hill, the Gap, Hut Point, Arrival Point Harbor Heights, Scott Bay, and Cape Armitagc. A hundred years hence, when the antarctic is no longer a sealed book, it is probable that these names will be on every map, but ono wonders if It will be recorded in what idle moments and picturesque fancics these names got their being.
Lieut. Armitage was one of the Jackson Harmsworth north polar expedition, so that he Is qualified to draw comparisons between the arctic and the antarctic. In summing up he says:	a
>
i	am glad to have been to South Victoria Land; I am proud to have been associated with the national antarctic expedition and to have viewed the grandeur of the Far South; but my heart goes out, as I pen these lin^.s, to my first love, the Nor til, where tllO white bear wanders in freedom over frozen land and sea, and the noble-looking walrus rears his gigantic head armed with mighty tusks, and gazes around in defiance of all who may approach him. The millennium wilt, no doubt, be delightful, but sonic of us are hardly fitted for it just now, and, speaking personally, I prefer a land where the beasts fight shy of man, and resent being stroked.	-
This is one of the peculiarities of the South that such animals and birds as were there had not the slightest tear of man and could be knocked over the head for breakfast without even offering a protest.
At the end of the book—where it Should be in such a picturesque volume —the reader will find an appendix with all the facts about antarctic observa^-tions of scientific phenomena that he may care to read according to his laste^ STEPHEN CH ALM E RS.
