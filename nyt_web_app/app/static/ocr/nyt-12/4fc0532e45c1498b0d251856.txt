CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL'S DECISIONS. |
ALTHOUGH John Marshall is acknowledged to be the expounder
of the Constitution, and more than any other person to have given to the Constitution its present and enduring , form, Mr. Joseph P. Cotton, seventy j years after the Chief Justice’s death, is the first person to prepare a complete and separate collection of hia opinions on Constitutional cases, 0‘ The Constitutional Decisions of John Marshall." Two volumes. Putnam.) The collection of the decisions is not the only thing* of importance in these volumes, however; Mr. Cotton has prefixed to each opinion a note setting1 forth the political conditions existing at the time it was handed down—for even Marshall as Chief Justice was not impervious to political conditions—the origin and character of the ease, the decision, as changed or affected by subsequent decisions, and Its effect on the Constitutional history of the United States. Hi is is a difficult task to carry successfully to an end; yet we think that Mr. Cotton has completed it as he planned it.
Marshall’s opinions appear to have been struck out by the contact of himself as flint and the steel of such advocates as Pinckney, Martin, Ogden, Bmnoy, Hopkinson, Taney, Benton, Webster, Clay—the ablest group . of counsel that ever practiced before an
American court," Mr. Cotton asserts, and there will be few to deny his assertion* '* But Marshall's was the dominating mind,” he continues, “ completely overshadowing and pervading the court during bis whole term of service. He created the American system of Constitutional law, the theory was his, the form and vigor of the opinions were his, and this body of decisions is fairly his achievement and his service.”	.
The first opinion on Constitutional matters rendered by Marshall was in 1803, in the case of Mar bury against Madison, in the matter of the application of William Marbury for a writ of mandamus directing Madison, the Secretary of State, to issue to him a commission as Justice of the Peace for ** the County of Washington, in the District of Columbia.” It was an outgrowth of Adams's performances in creating the “ midnight Judges,” and an unimportant case, apparently; yet Marshall's decision made It of vast consequence.
That opinion is the beginning of the American system. of Constitutional law. In it Marshall announced the right of the Supreme Court to review the constitutionality of acts of the National Legislature and the Executive. Such a power had indeed been spoken of in certain opinions, and indeed occasionally acted on in unimportant cases in the State courts, but never in the Federal courts. Common as this conception of the powers of our oourLs is now, it is hard to corqprehend the amazing quality of it then. No court in England had such a power; there was no express warrant for It in the words of the Constitution; the existence of it was denied by every other branch of the Government und by the dominant majority of the country.

of judicial independence thus decla.*ed by causing the impeachment of Judge Pickering and Judge Chase: the former was convicted and removed (Mr. Cotton says he was insane;) Chase was acquitted. John Randolph proposed an amendment to the Constitution that Judges be removable by the President on the Joint address of both houses of Congress, but the proposition fell flat,
' and the independence of the Federal judiciary was established.
It has been eaid that Marshall's opinions were merely the echoes of Webster’s arguments. It seems to be a fact that in all but one of Webster’s cases involving Constitutional interpretation Marshall's decision supported Web- , ster's arguments, and in the exception- i al case the Chief Justice’s dissenting | opinion was in Webster's favor. On !
the Dartmouth College case Mr. Cot- ! ton writes:
There can be little question that by the influence of counsel, by some subtle influence of politics or friendship there seems to have crept Into the consideration of the Dartmouth College case a distinct bias in favor of the college. It is not easy to support such an assertion, but it is the inference from Marshall’s opinion. it is characteristic of Marshall’s opinions to be argumentative, combative, to state logically, cogently; but one rises from this opinion dissp.tisficd. There is bias in the statement of facts, a bias in the statement of premises, and surely, what seems now to tis the main issue of the case, the assumption that the charter of the college was a " contract,” as that term is used in the Constitution. is too hastily and too barely supported.
The effect of this famous decision has been diminished by "a long series of cases,” but Mr. Cotton declares that its value has not been destroyed, and that its underlying principle, the sacredness of corporate charters, is maintained by the courts “ even in times of public excitement and the modern feeling against the power of great aggregations of capital,” and his assertion seems justified. The other chief leading cases on Constitutional interpretation are discussed with equal certainty—those of McCulloch against Maryland, of Gibbons against Ogden,
of Cohens against Virginia—while the
less important ones receive due consideration.
Summing up Marshall’s work, Mr. Cotton writes: “ A nation has delighted to honor him, and no voice has dissented from that praise. The final comment seems to be that he saw most clearly the evfls of the Confederation, that he read the Constitution and all Its clauses as subordinate to the central idea of the creation of a mighty Federal Government, complete with every National power, and that he created ah opportunity and made the Supreme Court the interpreter of the Constitution for every department of the Nation,” This Is undoubtedly true; if the words were Webster’3—wo do not say they were—the voice was Marshall's, and without Marshall to utter them Webster’s words might only too readily have fallen on the empty air.
