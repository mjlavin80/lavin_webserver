The six Rhind Lectures for liXKS on " Coin Types:	Their	Origin
and Development,” delivered by George Macdonald, M. A, LL. D., of the University of Glasgow for the Council of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, have been gathered into one octavo volume and presented through tbe Macmillan Company exactfy as :hey were spoken.
The opening lecture contains a brief 6kctch of the first beginnings of coinage, passing in review the two most important theories that have been propounded as to the origin of types, and showing that types and symbols were identical. Lecture II. shows that the "analogy between types and symbols “ indicated their similar heraldic origin, and that money was “ merely a special application of the practice of sealing.” The third lecture deals with the coins commemorating events, localities, or aersons. The lecture that follows considers heads as types, heads of divinities, Jewish coins, portraits on coins,
“ Greek Imperial M issues, the influence of literature on coins. Lecture V. deals with the types of Roman coinage, which was a direct descendant of the Greek, and the ** most striking feature of whose story has been the great development of the com* memorative influence." The last lecture treats of the ** commemorative" influence. which gave way to the '* Imitative M and to a 44 curious revival of religion."
There are many photogravure plates In the\voIume showing obverse and reverse views of various coins, half-tones of types, and drawings in the text.

The past and prea-Wl*f re Spencer ent history of “ Somerset House,” in the Strand. London, England, is told in the volume which E. P. Dutton & Co. are about to bring out by Raymond Needham and Alexander Webster, who have supplied it with many pictures of old plans, Interior and outsfde views, portraits, &c. The present building stands on the site of the old palace built by Sir John Seymour. the first Duke of Somerset, a brother of Jane Seymour, one of the Queens of Henry VIIL, who later became Lord Protector of England and was an ardent Protestant worker.
Somerset House was begun in 177G by Sir William Chambers, to gtve better accommodation to the Royal Academy, the Royal Society, and certain Government departments. It was completed, all but the west wing, in 1786; this part was finished by Pennthorne in 1852. The style of the house Is Italian, with decorations by Carlini. Wilton, Flaxman. and other*;. The Academy held exhibits there for several years, but its continual growth led to its removal, and it was shortly followed by the Royal Society. There were also a Naval Museum and other attractions. When the stone work and sculpture began to wear off and bear the marks of idle hands, the plane was inclosed in iron railings and locks put upon the gates. Keys were given only to inhabitants of the buildings and a few favored residents of the neighborhood. When Herbert Spencer joined the staff of The Economist he frequently wansereu through th«; grounds, and later was often joined by George Eliot. The philosopher speaks of thcso rambles in his autobiography (£). Appleton & Co.) and of the rumors which they caused. At present King’s College and School occupy a part of Somerset House.
The forthcoming volume, while telling
tho story of Somerset House, also relates

bridge, which Longmans, Green & Co. are about to publish, G. T. Atchison and A. J. G. Undsell have *4 endeavored to collate the principal theories on each point,” and, while indicating their prefer! ence for one or another, “ to state fairly thi case for its rivals, leaving the final , choice to the discretion of the I'eader.” In every case, reasons have been given for the course of play suggested, and emphasis laid on the principle rather than its particular corollary, paying special attention to those points which experience has proved to be most generally apprehended.
Tho laws -of bridge are given In brief and simple words, based on the codes of the Portland and Turf Clubs of England. Following these come the usual explanations of “ declarations," doubling and redoubling, the original “lead." the plays or the different bands, *' dummy " play, calling, and discarding, the ” spade convention,” three-handed bridge, &c. Space has also been given to the ” etiquette ”

California, Ore-An	Englishman gon, Washington,

do, Now Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada, the eleven youngest States in the Union, form the subjects of the fourth volume of American impressions by Paul Fountain, an English writer. The book, "The Eleven Eaglets of the West,” will be published here shortly fiy ]£. P. Dutton & Co.
The country is described State by State. The narrative is given as a consecutive journey, although, as the author points out, it Is really made up of two long and several shorter journeys, some of which he has already described. The story begins abruptly, and, like the other books by this author, is not in diary form, of which Mr. Fountain does not approve. He wriies as follows of the country:
It is a region still called the “Wild West,” and at the time of the journeys detailed was emphatically a wilderness.
This is no longer the caj=o, and it is
now an assured fact that these Western territories are budding into a great State of the near future. Thev are still of scanty population, with wfde districts of uninhabited land, but are the richest in mineral wealth of all the United States, and contain much of the best agricultural land; and their rise in population and wealth will be as rapid as that of any of the older States of the East. The network of railways, with which the country has been rapidly covered during tfie past two or three decades, will effect this.
*	* • Th© land can never again be known as I have known lt*-the past Is a fleeting picture which I have endeayor?d to fix ere It fades away forever. Much attention has been given to the natural history of the districts passed through. This, in my opinion, is one of the chief charms of my journeys. But I have not written for the scientific naturalist.

Prof. Charles Scottish Parliament Sanford Terry
of the Univer-to 1707. gity of Aber_
deen writes in his preface why he compiled the volume on ** The Scottish Parliament: Its Constitution and Procedure, 1603-1707/* published here by the Macmillan Company:
This treatise would not have heen written If the Information it endeavors to impart had been accessible elsewhere. But except In broadest outline, no attempt hitherto has been made to elucidate the Constitution and procedure of the Scottish Parliament between the Union of the Crowns and of the Parliaments. In consequence, the significance and Interest ot the only period in which Parliament bad much claim to pose as a representative institution have b^en almost entirely overlooked. So far from remaining, as Is the general impression, a chamber doomed to futility by the overshadowing committee of the articles, the following pages not only show that the development of Parliament's powers and processes was striking and rapid within the period, but that by 170/ it had brought Itself, both as a chamber of debate and of legislation, to a reasonable level of procedure with the English Parliament of the day.
The chapters treat of the officers of •State, the clergy and nobility, barons of the " shires,” Commissioners of the burghs, officials of the House, discipline of the House, the Parliament House Itself, the Lords of the Articles, &e. Various documents have been Inserted In the appendix, and have been printed without their “ perplexing M contractions in modern spelling.
