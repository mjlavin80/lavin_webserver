Tile Hibbert Journal of last July and the publication by Messrs. John W. I^uce of ‘‘ The Plays of OScar Wilde ’’ seem ejwito sure to start a recrudescence of judgments, pro and eon. on a man whose genius flashed torth no less in the night of i his despair and consequent discovery of i the soul’s moral issues than in the earlier days when ho showed himself so great a master of literary expression and critical acumen.	.
Mr. Richard Butler Glaenzer’s sympathetic and appreciative estimate of the writings of Oscar Wilde, and his kindly rebuke of those who carelessly cast false charges against him, will please all who admire fair play even for one on whom the world turned its back as deserving only scorn and utter oblivion. Wilde’s career was so shot through and through with intellectual and aesthetic brilliance, though so often obstructed and deflected by great blotches of folly, conceit, and moral perversity, culminating in the travail and tragedy of a soul. plunged into outer darkness, tnat his life and works have set problems for'the litterateur, the moralist, ana the theologian alike.
In The Hibbert Journal of July. 100T>. Prof. Hugh Walker, LLt. D., of St. David’s College L-empeter, under the caption ** The Birth of a Soul,” makes a study of Oscar*Wilde as no reveals himself m " De Frofundis,” wrkten while in prison, and In the ** Ballad of Reading Gaol," written after his discharge. It is a study in moral
pamoiogy in the light of Wilde's own experiences of sin and suffering. Prof. Walker finds in the two books named that Wilde’s whole view of life has changed, and that he confessed that the reality of his sufferings reveahrd to him the reality of a world he had scouted.
Thus arose for Wilde, as for all thinkers, the eternal problem of the relation of suffering—soul suffering—to reformation, and the still deeper and more startling question whether it may not -be true that sin and suffering are necessary, o: worth while, if only thereby a soul is brought to a new birth. Wi-de so thought and he may have supposed himself therein original, and as the j.irst to have found this admittedly dangerous idea ia tlie teachings of Christ.
But" Prof. Walker finds the same idea taught by the great philosopher Hegel and by Browning, and closes his very serious study of the change from the old to the new Oscar Wilde with this very striking question: *' I-Lave all the churches in nineteen centuries thrown such light upon the problem of evil as is shed by these two books lri contrast with their author's earlier writings? ”	‘	•
