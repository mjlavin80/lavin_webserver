HKRI1 is n Ftory bristling with adventure. Mr. Nicholas Meredith calls his novel, “ The House of a Thousand : i'anfiles," (Bobbs, Merrill & <?o.,) which is a -rfcry picturesque title, although, after all. thP thousand mndlps are not absolutely essential to the story other than to add a >.ort of flickering weird ness to the tale. An old gentleman, rather eccentric and reputed to be Immensely rich, dli a In Wrmfiit attended only by a faithful servant. His fortune, save a bewildering t-stale in Indiana, has mysteriously disappeared. The house is large and unfinished and of a rambling style of architecture, Which includes subterranean passages and stmnge uncanny crypts and tunm'-U. The old gentleman was something of a student of architecture, and his ke»*n re*; ret wut* tlmt his lusty young grandson preferred tiger shooting in the jungle to building poems in stone and granite at home. Being fond of the young man, nevertheless, the old gentleman so worded his will that young John CrU’iiurm was to remain for a year n res.ilf-nt of tic house of a thu^sairl i randies with tile view lo cutting him off from convivial companionship, and so.
; from sheer force of ** nothing else to do," j Turn tig the young man's mind toward I GO tup I*; tins tl.e house. Also, it was t-x-I pn-ssly staled in the will that should ; young John quit Indiana for any reason at all, he forfeited Irs claims to the i estate, and the property passed on to one ! Marian Devcreaua; or in the event of a ! marriuge between the said John and | Marian the property was to be disposed of j still otherwise.
, “There is, of course, a \illnin in the story, smooth tongued. but black hearted, and again, of course, the villain is in love i with Murinn and John scorns Marian, but j fails desperately In love with a delight! fui ci’ftaturo who eatl3 herself Olivia, but
: who iy a:i impostor inasmuch as she is only Olivia's friend and Marian herself.
There is shooting in the alory, and even ■jonoe slugging, but John has a stanch 1 ffiend or two, and Marian is not idle rooting for tbe right person. The secret passages end strange doings are quite as
bewildering as the author intends then; to be, and when f.'naHy the dead returns to life and the old gentleman himself ' **U'ps out of the fireptacc and confronts all the dramatis pcrsonnae it is qu’te to be fixpr*rlod, and the cheerful reader accepts it all and asks no questions.
