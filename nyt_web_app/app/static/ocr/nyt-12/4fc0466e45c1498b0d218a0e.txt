Backwoods Talcs.
DUCK LAKE# By K. Kycrson Vonng, Jr. liimo. 1^. 1111* Boston: Eaton St Miitna,
This book is made up ot tales of the backwoods of Canada, and should provide an interesting hour or two of reading for any boy who likes Indiana and hunting ! and unexpected encounters with bears. One of the stories* M A Haunch of Venison," is especially interesting, dealing as it does with the strict game law protect- ; ing moose and the strictly consistent way in 'which Uuvt law is broken. A quaint situation results from a hunter killing a moose and borrowing' the parson’s knife and tute to skin and cut it while tho parson is out. The game warden discovers thia evidence, and the parson ia put on trial. He is cleared, of course, by the real culprit coming forward, but the picture of backwoods trTil !s interesting.
Other stories are Chubb *’ and ** Dave
Dodge.” Chubb is just a boy. but he goes hunting and fishing and camping and associating with Jonas, his Indian friend, so that this portion of tho book should have a great deal of charm for the boy reader.
