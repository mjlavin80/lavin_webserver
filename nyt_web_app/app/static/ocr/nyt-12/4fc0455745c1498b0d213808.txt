The Century Magazine is sending out, in the form ot a summons issued by Lincoln in 1S5G, an announcement of its plans for 1006, particularly the Lincoln series. The *‘ document *' looks timeworn, while on one page is a fac simile reproduction of the summons, which is made out to Thomas IjC^Is, Willis _I-I. Johnson, and John B. Moffett. On the opposite page is a Tac simile of an autograph of Lincoln on the flyleaf of a dictionary.
