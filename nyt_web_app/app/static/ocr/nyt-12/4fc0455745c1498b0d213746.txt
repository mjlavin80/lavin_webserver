MAYNE REID.
Gen.Rush C. Hawkins’s Remembrances of the Famous Soldier and
Roman-c Writer.
EVERAL communications lately printed fn Tub New ' Yoim Times Book Review referring to the lute Captain Mayne Reid have revived plcustxni memories of one of the most fascinating personalities I had ever known. My acquaintance with this gifted writer and brave adventurous soldier of fortune covered more years than I care to attempt to remember. I believe it be- i gan not far from the year 1&47 after the fighting part of our war with Mexico I came to an end. From the Liter eighteen 1 fifties until 1SS0 we did not sec each other, but kept up a sending word kind of correspondence through mutual friends. In 1 1S90 our direct intercourse was resumed and continued until his passing away Oct, 12, 1&>3.	'
In relation to his service in our army he maintained an attitude worthy of all praise. Ho felt that our Government had bestowed an honor upon him when it gave him an officer’s commission, and he was proud of the disability which came from a painful wound received in the assault upon the Castle of Chapultepec Sept. H* 1847, the effects of which were to last him through life. And although by his writings he did not succeed in accomplishing great financial success, he never applied for a pension until thirty-four years after he had become entitled to receive it, and It is doubtful if at that late 1 day he would have made an application If ho had not been urged to do so by others.
His gratitude to our Government for having admitted him Into our army, and thereby giving him his many opportunities of being shot at, and incidentally in regular course of being wounded, was one of the most remarkable conceptions of an obli'ration I had ever known. Of eourse suth an interpretation could hardly be imagined, and certainly not foreseen. But with Reid Its originality was not in the least out of order. It was only one item among tho many strange outflows from an exceptionally romantic and heroic nature.
His ardor did not cool with age, and be carried with him in conversation and in his correspondence his earnest and honest exuberance of expression to the end of his life. The following letter, in answer to one urxing energetic action at the Pension Office, next to the last I received from him, although purely personal, is so completely characteristic of tho man that I do not hesitate to insert. it just as written:
Frogmore House,
Roy Herefordshire, Oct 11, i«ti. ity Dear Gen. Hawkins:
Your letter from Dunstable only reached ; me this (Tuesday) morning. I trust they may not be so long In delivering this, else it may miss you. I am pleased to hear that you have enjoyed your Summer tour and that Mrs. Hawkinss health has been benefited by it*_ tJiough how any one can bo happy elsewhere than In your own dear land—one who has the privilege of a residence in New York, is a mystery to me. I once announced to you, viz., that I would rather spend my life picking oakum in an American prison than live In an Engli3h palace. How I envy you the warmth of welcome and friendship that will meet you on your return! Would j that I were with you, or could hope ever I to see that fine city again!	'
I am just recovering from another as- i sault of the enemy, ill-health, all through that old wound J got on the crest of Chapultepec, Alas! for the pension; I fear It is hopeless. My poor services to . your country are of too old a date, now, to be remembered, much less remunerated; though I should be tho last man to charge the great Republic with ingrati- ' tude. I hold It too highly, love it too dearly for that It was kind of you to again remember me and my needs, but I should have been better pleased had you brought Mrs. Hawldns to visit us in Herefordshire, and given me on opportunity to show you some of our country life, with a bit of England's best scenery.
Trusting and hoping you may have a safe and pleasant voyage homeward, 1 am, my dear Gen. Hawkins, yours very sincerely,	MAYNE	REID.
As a socfal companion Reid was at his best Jovial kindly, brilliant sympathetic and breezy, with always an abundant flow of conversation of the better quality, he was cne of the select Gllte we meet with during tne voyage onward
of whom It may be truthfully said that contact with him lightened all sorrows and cleared away the murky mists of tho individual atmosphere which so often shut out the light of happiness.
From what has been written, it must not be Inferred that Reid was all sparkle and milk and honey. Ho had a strong side as well as the loving, with convio-tions and no end of courage to sustain them. Ho hated wrong and mean acts of every oescripUoni and was never moro emphatically outspoken and earnestly eloquent than when denouncing his countrymen for their participations in the corrupt schemes of politicians which resulted in such plunderings as attended the reign of Tweed. He loathed their base ingratitude toward the country which had given them liberty and such a warmth of welcome, and was most bitter in his denunciation of .their misconduct Possibly the most taking item fn his whole make-up was his capacity, to fceep
away from himself. Save when talking of his military services he had little use for the personal pronoun; and although he had written popular works of acknowledged merit, he never posed as an aulhor or affected that lofty air of mysterious superiority which is often so characteristic of the professional quill fraternity. One could have associated with him for years without discovering that he regarded himself as being anybody in particular or Chat he felt that he was in any respect an individual ut special importance.
What a pity such attributes are not permitted to survive death—to be bestowed by last will and testament, like material things!	RUSH C. HAWKINS.
New York, December, 1905.
