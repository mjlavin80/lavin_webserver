MR. HOWELLS AXSTD THE ENGLISH.
-	By EDWARD CARY.
WE arc beginning to get the echoes of Mr. How- ^ ells’s comments on our English brothers and sisters, and the first impression they make
i
Is that of the responsibility—If I may be pardoned ; a somewhat portentous word in this context—of the observer toward the observed, toward both peoples in fact concerned. For the most part that sentiment is not very strong in the observer. He takes his mental kodak on the steamer as he takes the little camera slung over his shoulder, for his own use and amusement. Ho exposes his films to whatever scene attracts or interests or repels him. fle develops them with such skill or method as best pleases him, manipulating them to increase or lessen the emphasis, heighten the lights and deepen the shadows as his taste suggests. If he be, as very often he Is, a , writer—who, in the matter of mental photography is an amateur with a market—he turns over to the public the views he finds most satisfactory to himself and likely to be the most satisfactory to them, and gives little thought of how the people he has been "taking" will like or dislike the pictures he presents. It is a sport in which every traveler more or less consciously Indulges, and it gives zest to traveling in the ratio of his keenness to seeing and his gift for making use of what he sees. For the observer who intends to Impart his impressions to tho public the sport is more serious business, as concerns himself; it is not always or usually as serious as it should be in the light of others* feeling.
LET it be said at the start that there is nothing It? the reception of Mr. Howells's ” London Films ’* by the press of the great town where they were gathered to suggest this criticism upon the performance of His difficult and delicate task. On the contrary. Americans have every reason ttT be gratified by that reception. Of course we expected it. Mr. Howells, from the moment he became an observer for publication became also in a way our representative, and we are well content. We knew that the picture he was to prepare and exhibit would draw all English eyes to him and that he would stand in the reflected light of his own ob-
*
servations the target of multitudinous snap-shots by the writers of the people observed. It Is necessarily rather a “fierce lighthappily it beats on one se- ! curely enthroned in the esteem and confidence and affection of his countrymen. What other writer 1 should wc choose more gladly or safely to challenge
i
the general scrutiny the scrutinizer inevitably pro- j vokes? The other night at Delmonico’s, when Mr. Howells arose to propose the health of Mark Twain, the greeting he had from the great companv of writ- i era was what the reporters might call " tumultuous.** I
Had he been a candidate for any sort of office these faithful gentleman would have had out their watches and told us to a second how long those waves of applause rose and lapsed and rose again and again before the smiling lips of the intending speaker were allowed to utter an audible sound. It was a very generous and entirely genuine tribute, and there are great multitudes of American men and women of all sorts and conditions of taste and culture who heartily would have joined in it. Hardly one, I think, of the long list of brilliant names for whom plaudits have shaken the walls of the famous banqueting hall has had or deserved a gladder acclaim. So we could not disavow him, if wo would, when Englishmen he talks about turn to talk of him, and of us of whom ho Is the Informal ambassador, and we have no mind to.

IT Is not surprising that the English find Mr. How-ells’s “judgment** of them “kind” and read it with
i
“ a keen sense of pleasure and even a touch of emotion all the more so since “ with our language on his lips, our traditions in his memory, our blood in his veins, it is Idle to deny that he is in a position
i
j to judge us.” So says a writer In The Spectator, a Journal always well disposed toward the Americans— " an American visitor is not a strangerM—while it
; Is intensely British in a hundred ways that the Amer-
i
| lean cannot help noting. ** In reading Mr. Howells's
, book,” this writer adds, M wa are perpetually re:
| minded that we are reading the writings of a highly cultivated and traveled author, who is yet a true American with no disposition to pose as a denatiomil-
! ized cosmopolitan for whom all differences of social system have ceased to afford food for wonder. The social distinctions which from long use strike us as so nutbral, seem to him entirely foreign, and he comments on them from an entirely outside point of view.” He comments on them, too, it would seem, with a good deal of acuteness. Though *' the tendency of the American mind is no doubt to exaggerate the Influence of what seems to It something very much like a caste system,” The Spectator admits that " we English do find In our differences of rank a convenient expression for our natural reserve." If Mr. Howells " gives to that expression considerably too much meaning,” it is to be remarked lhat he finds in it the explanation of the real kindness, selfrespect, and mutual respect prevailing between classes, the very recognition of which woukl be intolerably irritating on this side of the ocean The Spectator follows Mr. Howells through a good many of the paths along which he collected his 41 Films," and while, as In the instance first cited, It has qualifications and corrections to suggest, the final judgment is precisely vvhaL we Americans should like it to be;
Even the clearest eyes see only what they have the power of seeing. Mr. Howells has given to the Americans, perhaps consciously, a favorable likeness of a friendly people, and unconsciously has given to the English a true picture of an American friend.
