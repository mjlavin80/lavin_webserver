AS WE GO COURTING.
R. JOHN LUTHER LONG has dedi
catad his story of Seffy (Indianap-
olis: Bobbs, Merrill & Co.) “ to all who have courted—for remembrance; to all who will court—an example; to all who havo never courted—in pity; to all who will never court—with tears.’* Seffy, more properly called Sephenijah P. Baumgarb-ner, Jr., was a resident of the Pennsylvania-German section of the country, where courting is looked upon as a serious business not to be entered into lightly—and where always the best man wins. Seffy loved Sally Pressel, a bonny lass with tho Pressel red hair and tho Pressel hot tem* per. Baumgartner the elder, a genial soul who frankly worshipped Ills son, loved tho wealth of rolling pasture land which belonged to the Pressel estate and adjoined his own. Sally thought nothing of the
estate, but loved Seffy.
Such is tho situation when tho tale begins. Old Baumgartner had many times approached tho late Mr. Pressel with offers of purchase, but was repulsed verbally so often that at last, the hot Pressel temper reaching tho boiling point, old Baumgartner received a thrashing. But there was no vengcance in the amiable Baumgartner, only a beautiful dogged determination to get what he wanted And so, as Seffy and Sally grew side by side from childhood to maturity, old Baumgartner chuckled audibly as he thought of the not far distant day when, for no price except love, the old dividing1 fence would come down. But old Baumgartner did not count upon the unfailing slowness of his son and heir.
Young Serfy loved with that slow, undying smoldering Tire 'which rarely breaks Into flame. Sally worked nobly to bring
tho young man to the right point of de-claa-ing himself—l>ut even Sally’s patience coupled with her temper and her hair,
save way at last, and a sad tragedy fell upon the community when Sam Pritz, the clerk at the village store, took the fair Sally from the grasp of the leisurely Seffy. But Seffy, like his father, had a bulldog tenacity. There were many years to pass before Seffy came to his own—much suffering all around, ana Just a pleasing hint ol melodrama at the end to enhanco the unreality of the whole.	^
