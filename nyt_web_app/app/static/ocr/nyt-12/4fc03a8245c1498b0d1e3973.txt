Evelyn Sharp’s story of the adventures of Micky (" Micky/' London and Now York:	Tho Macmillan Co., $1.50,) is de-
signed for older as well as young readers. The result is that it is hardly likely to absolutely hold the attention of either. Micky and Tristram—or probably more properly speaking Tristram and Micky, since Tristram was 12 and Micky only 6, were left at home with their father and the servants while their mother and an intermediate brother went off to Australia for the latter's health. The adventures of the two boys during their mother’s absence is told with considerable humor at times. A ilttle girl and her great aunt
(the latter by far too good to be true)
move Into the empty house next doer, and
little Bettine's adventures straightway
get mixed up with those of the boys. But
Micky has an affair strictly his own which results in his losing and finding himself in a most remarkable fashion.
The book is designed to inculcate manners and morals in the young, and if it accomplishes this end there is little doubt that it will be worth while.
