This is a story of love, of sacrifice, of cattle ranching, and of heroics of all kinds. David Kingdon, a young man of rare personal attractions, had married, before the story opens, Clairette,* a young woman with whom he later proved to be sadly mlsmated. Clairette as time passed spent less and less time with her husband and more and more in her native city of Jonesville, or traveling on the Continent. It was during one of her Con- : tinental tours that David visited New York and met Sylvia Newman. Sylvia was no ordinary young woman. She was beautiful with a beauty that " did not appeal to the masses,” She possessed *' a charming rippling mouth, a firm little chin," a forehead of dazzling whiteness, and a “ shining gold-dusted mass '* of , hair. Even before David had a right to love Sylvia that “ human touch" which binds soul to -soul had already gripped them. Therefore when the providential news of Clalrette's death by shipwreck reached the bereaved husband he hastened to Sylvia and together they fled to Kansas City to be wed.
