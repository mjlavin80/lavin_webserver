Paul Jones, LTu. B.,' Is the author ot a law book which is singularly interesting to a considerable class of readers, and it seems to have been for him, in a way, a labor of love. It Is " privately-printed,” and very well printed, too, In neat binding; with gilt top that sets the seal of personal nicety on it, as if to emphasi/ie the fact that it is not the ordinary professional, still less the ordinary trade, product* It bears evidence of a lot of painstaking work, is written in a style Excellent for its purpose, and offers very few of those slips of the pen or proofreader that are apt to invade in f6rce the pages of the amateur. An “ amateur," as we have intimated, Mr. Jones is in the good old sense of the word, since he is plainly fond of his subject and of his task, but he is far from showing himself one in his mode of. treatment or in the results he aims at and quite remarkably reaches.
The title of his book is " The Commercial Power of Congress,” and his object is to trace the history and show the present authoritative interpretation of that pregnant declaration of the Constitution of the United States:
" Congress shall have power • * * to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian tribes.*' At the present moment much attention is being given' to the application of this provision to the effort to regulate what are popularly known as “ trusts ’’—usually with a very large T—and to the effort to regulate the charges of transportation companies. But whatever authority may finally be recognized as lodged in Congress for these two purposes— very vague and complex and important purposes they are—it must be relatively a novel outcome of more than a century of legislation and adjudication under the clause quoted. Previous to this outcome there had been an immense development of commerce and of the varied interests and activities involved in commerce, and the ** commercial power of Congress ’’ had been slowly assuming force and extending its scope until the effect of its exercise had gradually entered into the daily life of the people. So completely was this the case that public opinion may be said to have been rendered almost unconscious of the existence of the power and of the intimate and important consequences of its exercise. The fourth generation since the adoption of the Federal Constitution is passing away. It is a generation used to the daily employment ojf the highest forms of steam and electricity—a generation that goes to the Pacific from the Atlantic more easily than George Washington could hope to reach New York from Philadelphia, and which knows what is occurring in Manila more promptly than news could reach the first President, in this city, from the other side of the East River. It is a generation with which the trade of China is larger than was the total trade of the continent when the Constitution was adopted. And practically the law which has “ regulated ” the evolution of these enormous commercial changes has flowed from the score of words In the Constitution above quoted.
It was the beginning of this wonderful evolution that caused *' the Fa-
thers V to put these words Into - the Constitution. Nay, it was* the needs "already arising from this nascent evolution which, more than anything else, gave rise to the Constitution itself. Because under tlie Articles of Confederation there was no certainty or stability, but great confusion, In the trade*with foreign nations and among the several States; because currency and customs dues and the laws of credit were varying and conflicting and domestic and foreign trade were bound in a hopeless tangle, the Constitution was seen to be imperative. The convention showed1 great wisdom In framing the provision
*	for power to remedy these intolerable evils. The general principle of Federal regulation was stated; the .general principle of powers conferred and powers reserved was also stated, and' then the Congress, greatly aided* by the Supreme Court, proceeded slowly and gradually to work out the problem as it presented itself from year to. year. .
Mr. Jones has undertaken to trace this process in a manner not only satisfactory to the professional lawyer, but to be understanded of the people, and he has had remarkable success. One admirable feature of his book Is the very full series of references he gives to the court decisions. Of these we hav^ only one complaint to make, i'olfowing the custom of fiis profession, he rarely gives the dates of decisions; to the lay reader these would be extremely useful. And we wish he had felt like making an^ndex, and an adequate one, though we know it would have been a tiresome task. But these suggestions seem a little grudging where there is so much good work to be grateful for.
