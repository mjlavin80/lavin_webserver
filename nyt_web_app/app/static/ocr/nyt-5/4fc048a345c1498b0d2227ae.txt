W. J. Locke's Brilliant Book.
THE MORALS OF MARCUS ORDEYNK.
By William J, Locke. Cloth, 12mO. l^p. -J0 3. New York:	John Lane. $1-50.
Concerning " The Morals of Marcus Or-deyno " one Is tempted to paraphrase the famous chapter on Snakes In Ireland. Mr. Locke has written a brilliant book, one that commands the reader’s interest, but the protagonist is sadly to seek in tho things that give dignity to manhood.
It has been said^and, to a certain extent, truly said—that to discover flaws in the character of a novel Is not part of the function of criticism; the sole question is, How does the author handle these characters? It seems to us, however, that this depends upon the author's own ] attitude toward his creations. If he pre- ; sents them with absolute aloofness we ; have only to inquire whether they are I true to life. If he engages our sympa- ■ thies for vice or weakness, if he commits ; high treason against goodness by making it unlovely, then we reserve the right of protest.
Both these things Mr. Locke has done in his latest novel. The three characters for whom, while under the writer's spell, our admiration is compelled, are Ordeyne, Judith, and Carlo tta, ail of whom have “ thrown the Sacred Cap of Good Repute over the windmills.’* Ordeyne, for years a tutor, brings but one friendship out of his association with youth, that of an “ inconsequent libertine ” devoid of conscience and of honor, with the single redeeming quality of Impulsive kindness. Ordeyne himself has a connection with a woman of mind and feeling who, however, never wakens the deep passion which possesses him when his life is invaded by an example of the most perfectly fleshly feminine ever portrayed—the eighteen-year-old Carlotta, reared in a harem, a kitten's temperament in a beautiful woman’s form—without intellect, or with intellect asleep, as soulless as Undine, loving luxury and petting, but giving nothing in return, devoid of human feeling for sorrow and pain. Sin and shame do not exist for her, and although the author assures us, almost on the last page, of the tardy birth of her soul, the animal Carlotta Is the heroine of the book. Judith, refined, spirituelle, clever, charming, had been lured from her first husband, “ thus breaking his heart, poor man, s6 that he died soon after”; had married her seducer, who “ deserted her for a barmaid,” and Is introduced at the age of thirty-six, having held for eight years an anomalous relation to Marcus Ordeyne. Such are the characters who carry us along with them. On- the other hand, the respectable aunts and cousins are so painted as to evoke contempt, while the “ converted ** Mainwaring is simply nauseous. Prom all tho characters the capability of repentance seems to bo absent. Mr. Loeke represents his hero as engaged ’upon a “ History of Renaissance Morals," and, truly, his ** quaint passion for the cinque-cento Italian M seems to have resulted, both In himself
and in his choseh friends. In a sort of cinque-cento recrudescence.	Ordeyne* s
chosen field of researcii is one of Mr. Locke’s many whimsical and witty touches.
The' story is told In the form of a diary, with all the authors well-known power and distinction. It is entirely original in conception, and the plot is carried out with great skill. The conversations are particularly clever. It is one-of the few present-day novels which, once begun, it is Impossible to lay aside. Ordeyne's tenderness for the beautiful feminine, “ et praeterea nihil," that he loves so blindly and absurdly, Is very touching. It is the love that both gives and forgives everything, demanding no return. But, after all, goodness; just plain goodness, is the difficult and heroic thing In life, and we are sorry to. see ; Mr; Locke’s brilliant pen descending from the heights of *4 Where Love Is u. to lower i levels of moral miasma and mirage. The ! passages of fine feeling, the emotion that rings true in "The Morals'-of Marcus Ordeyne/' even - the partial atonements -of the close, do not efface the general impression that the pure life Is the.limited life, that genial virtues blossom beat alongside " the primrose path' of dalliance.** Whatever Mr. Locke does is done -so well that it behooves him more than , the general . to see to it that it is well j worth the doing,	I
