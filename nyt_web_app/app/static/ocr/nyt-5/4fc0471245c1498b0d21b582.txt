A remarkable example of modern labor saving machinery is a volume, the first of a set, entitled " Auction Prices of Books.” It is an alphabetical record of * the items in the “English Book-Prices Current, the publication of which began in 1S8G, and of those in the American Book-Frices Current, which dates from 1834, together with many auction quotations of earlier date. It is, therefore, primarily a price list of all the important rarities, sold in Great Britain or America during many years. But even as a price list it is peculiarly a labor-saving device, for it brings into small compass information obtainable hitherto only at the expense pf much searching through many volumes. Those who have hunted through the eighteen volumes of the British .Prlces-Current and the ten American volumes will appreciate the value of "Auction' Prices of Books."
The new work has still other commendable qualities. The lists of works by an author are-in many cases so complete as to serve as a bibliography. For example of this completeness, in the volume now published, covering the alphabet from A to Dick, may be noted the entries under Boccaccio, which occupy seven and a half pages; under the Brownings, six and, a half; Bums, nearly four; Chaucer, four and a half; and Bible, twenty-seven pages.
This magnum opus, has been compiled by Luther S. Livingston, editor of American Book-Friccs Current. lie has followed the existing rule of excluding books which have sold for less than £1 in England and ?5 here; but within the limits imposed by it has included these broad classes:
1.—A11 books in English, or printed in Great Britain, from Caxlon’s time to the present. 2.—All books relating to America, wherever printed, and in whatever language. 3.—All incunabula printed in Europe, and many works of Continental provenance of a later date than 1J520. Fie has, however, excluded non-English
oolts of the seventeenth and later cen-iuries, and "freak books "—Grangerized copics extended by matter inserted.
Only seven hundred and fifty copies of the book will be printed. Its importance and value are so apparent that it is-likely to become itself a rarity in a very short time. A noteworthy fact about the work is its rapid publication*. Instead of dragging over years, the last volume will arpear within four months of the first.
