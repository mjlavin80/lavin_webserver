It seems necessary to say at the outset I that Mr. Rogers in this account of I Thomas H. Benton has assumed more a I than properly belongs to the biographer— he sits in judgment upon matters not only J of fact but of wisdom and right, which the most eminent writers of the livos of great men have agreed to consider out of their jurisdiction. Naturally some of these deliverances of Mr. Rogers, especially some of his strictures upon the courses of men like Monroe, Clay, "Webster, and Calhoun, strike the reader as superfluous.
Yet the story of so interesting a man as Thomas H, Benton (with his own "Thirty Years’ View ” to draw upon,) cannot be made uninteresting, or any account of the period of his life dull, if the reader has any sort of knowledge of American history. Mr. Rogers’s estimate of Benton Is as follows:
■	He sat for thirty consecutive y*-ar.^ in the l7nited States Senate^i record never reached be lore the civil war, and since then seldom surpassed. Much of this time he was a commanding figure, some time.s dominant and always useful. Over all his contemporaries he had the advantage of a clearer view of tjie great problems of the age, because unvexed by ambition; in uprightness and purity of character he was excel'ed by none. The names or Clay. Webster, and Calhoun are household words, and their careers are well known. Kenton served longer than any one of them, is responsible for more sound legislation than all ot them put together, yet only the student of history knows anything about him.
The author’s account Is especially informing in regard to the great Missourian’s part as Jackson's lieutenant, in the fight against the National Bank, concluding with the dramatic incident of expunging from the record the Senatorial censure of the President. Mr, Rogers counts Benton the bulwark of the Union in those times, apologising for him (on the ground of "guiltlessness') when he was led into what seemed support of Calhoun's policies. He h.is a lively account of the nullification business, and the Webster-Hayne debate.
He declares, too, that “slavery was not in its outward aspects the horrible institution that it seems to us now or that it seemed to the Northern people at the time,” and relates what may he called the "original Boolter Washington,episode" when in 1828 all the plans ot Benton and others for gradual emancipation in Missouri were knocked into a cocked hat by the news that "Arthur Tappan, the merchant prince and philanthropist of New York, had entertained colored people at I his private table**’
