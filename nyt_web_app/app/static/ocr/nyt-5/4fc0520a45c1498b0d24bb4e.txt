FACTS AND ll)I!AL8. Short Studica of Life and Literature* By Philip Gibbs, Author or Knowledge Is Power.’* liimo. PP- 324. New York:	Longmans, Green
In a way this volume ■ Is a curiosity. Some thing about most things under^the sun may be found in it, all seasoned with the sort of didactic sauce proper to little lay sermons for the plain people, who are not quite so plain. The matter appeared originally in provincial weekly papera in England. First there are what the author calls v serious soliloquies” expressing cheerfully commonplace views upon such, questions as " How to be Happy Though Poor,** “ Marriage and a Man’s Career,’* “The Divine Right: of Selfishness,” “ The Saving Gracefof Humor." Then the author chats about the beneficence of fairy tales, about holidays, about *' the 'necessity of poses,” about city noises, and what folks have latterly again (reverting to Horace Walpole’s word) begun to name *' serendipity.’* Going on you find some very every-day philosophy, remarks on old books and new, on the lost art of letter writing, on whether Bacon wrote Shakespeare.
That would seem to be enough, for one book, but this passes to a historical retrospect of the Victorian era, (some twenty
pages,) remarks on Frencn writers—Dumas, Rousseau, Huso, 55ola, Voltaire— (twenty more*pages.) a short history of the French Revolution, (twenty-five pages,) some explanation cf psychology, (twelve pages,) .a survey of ancient religions, (forty pages,) a consideration of the problems or business success, (fifteen pages,) and finally something about the
“ art of nations/* ten pages more.
In short, the book aspires to be a sort of elementary substitute for a liberal education—a university extension .course on things ope should know-all in the compass of a duodecimo of moderate thick* ness.--'. 'X - -	‘	■	■	■	-
