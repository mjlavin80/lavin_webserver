A Story of Psychic Mystery.
THE TYRAWY OF THE DARK. 33 y
Hamlin Garland. X^p. -iyu. Harper & Brotli-ers. $1.00.
Mr. Garland's new "book lives up to the weirdness of its cover decoration. It is the story of a “ Psychic ” who has, or who believes she has. the mysterious power of communication with the world of spirits. The influence possessed by her ghostly *' controls" constitutes ** the tyranny of the dark,” from which it is the aim of her scientist lover to wrest her forever. It is safe to assume that in regard to spiritism the author holds his hero’s point of view, and it is a little difficult to determine the object of the story. One would say that Mr. Garland denies spiritual manifestation, and yet accepts as facts a series of marvelous phenomena, inexplicable upon any other theory than that of ghostly interference. At one point of the narrative it seems as though the author recognizes the exist-ance of psychic powers, and of a mystic “ fourth dimension,” and is inclined to urge upon scientific minds the investigation of these things “ of the dark.” At i another he seems to shut the door upon the occult. The astonishing events related are declared to be “ within the personal experience of Mr. Garland himself." But what does he believe about them, and what does he intend his readers to believe? If not spirits, what? At times he appears to make a Svengali matter of the whole business; again his recorded facts smite that theory in the face. Upon the whole, the subject is left hanging In mid-air, with, perhaps, just one conclusion; that in the interest of sanity it is a pretty safe subject to let'alone. Yet, so long as there is death in the world the great question of life must always he: “ Our beloved ones, shall we meet them, and how?” In one form or another humanity must always be “ building its bridge.” Spiritism is but the reply to the wall:
I look for ghosts; but none will force Their way to me; 'tis falsely said
That there was ever intercourse Bfetween the living'and the dead;
For surely then I should have sight
Of him I wait for day and night
With love and longings ^Infinite.
It is with a sense of disappointment that we perceive that Mr. Garland- helps us not at all with the bridge-building across the a^ful chasm.
Regarded'as fiction'simply "The Tyranny of the Dark ” is too much encumbered with laborious arguments and citations. If the strange occurrences related are, in truth, facta,- theyr would have gained in both force and fascination by being frankly so presented, with, perhaps; such elucidation as has satisfied the author’s own mind. The book: w0uld be improved if divested of its fictitious form, and presented as a contribution to the documents of psychic phenomena.
That Mr. Garland has told : his story well it is needless to say. Qrice- beginning it no reader is likely to lay it aside-until the end is reached. But he will close the volume with a sense of 'confusiori, not at
all sure what ’Mr. Garland'would-be at—
i
'wishing that he had given us the -thesis without the fiction or the fiction without the thesis, and feeling that this incursion intO'the occult has but helped to make ** darkness visible."
