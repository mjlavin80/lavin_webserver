Mrs. Austin's cxeellcnt translation of | this monumental work only covers the first six volumes, up to the general j1 i t-leal situation of laH.V The present edition Is wry tin ap ant] exceedingly well printed. As a popular narrative it is a splendid stimulus for ihe study of German on the part of the reader who would peruse the narrative lo its very end. As history it stands in the front rank on account of its exhaustiveness and freedom from prejudice, and the edition In which it now appears makes it e.asily accessible a-3 supplementary reading for the student whose purse is most meagre.
Although Ranke’s work is unprejudiced, yr.-t the reader can hkrdly peruse many pages before realizing: that it Is a I^u-theran who writes. In the author's ” History of the Popes." which preceded the “ History of the Reformation," the same notle impartiality is noted, although the atmosphere is not otherwise than Protestant. His narrative proper is fortified with the citation of innumerable authorities, ninny of which in the original impart their informa lion in obsolete and provincial forms. On this point it is worth while to note a paragraph from the translator's pi (. face:
To securo the render, therefore, against any errors I may have fallen into, and in order that, if important, they may be pouitcd out, i have placed the original wiihin reach. I lu.pe the translations may ! give some idea of the light these notes | throw on individual as well as national chaiactei. We find in them one sourcc of the vigor and animation of the portraits, and the dramatic vivacity of the scenes, wit*, which this history abounds.
