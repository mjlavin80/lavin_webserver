As Dr. Gulick again points out In this .preface, the book has a double purpose: . ** To study the interdependence of social and psychic evolution, illustrating the general principles by an examination of Japanese developments,” and " the study of Japanese characteristics and development as depending on universal principles of social and psychic evolution.*1
4* SPIRIT ” OF THE JAPANESE.
George Meredith has -written an intro- j duction to ** The Japanese Spirit,” by : Okakura-Yoshisaburo, in which he writes of the book:

./ and a BoysVStory.*
I	3,8	Zola	wrote of it, as
' m	VerestQhagia painted It—but
r& el	war ma^e more horrid and
vAPitiless still by a desperate Oift	10k	situation and the use on both
sides of the latest modem mechanical refinements, all working together fov the first time—such war it is the aim of these articles of Richard Barry to describe. The articles themselves are mostly collected from various magazines, and involve a deal of repetition, but a better notion of the conditions under which the Japanese worked and foight during the siege of Port Arthur is undoubtedly secured by. having the scattered matter thus assembled.
Mr. Barry crawled about in that network of trenches bo eras© of which the I	Japanese at	last burrowed into the fort!	ress, he saw	little brown men who peeped
rifle in hand between the protecting sand bags fall dead at his elbow, he saw some of those bloody charges in the teeth of the I	Russian rifle fire and machine guns, he
watched the	little men patiently digging
ditches, he crept into the bloody angle where the shelter of the living was built partly of rotting bodies of the slain, he was offered cigarettes and tea (in lacq^ier cups) in that gruesome fortress. He is his witness tliat he saw the Russian sharpshooters pick off the wounded as they writhed and crawled upon the dreadful ground between the lines of besieged and besiegers, and tr^ gazed upon stricken men dying by slow inches—dying for days —in that zone of fire where it would have been suicide for their comrades to bear them in, though they could ^sometimes throw to the poor wretches biscuits ,and canteens of water.
He saw bodies horribly torn and man-sled borne rearward, and had even the chance to dodge bullets himself. Generals talked with him kindly, Japanese officers showed him all there was to see, he watched the Russian use of searchlights, of star rockets that revealed night
I movements of the assailants, he heard the thunder of the great coast defense mortars brought ovsr from Japan to reduce the Russian works—even took pictures of these dreadful engines in action.
Of all these things Mr. Barry tells, not avoiding. but rather insisting- upon, the slaughler-pen details. Besides, he talks of Gen. Kodama, wbom he calls the real I director of the war. He interviewed Gen. I Kodarna, by the way, the great mnn I (who is very small) sitting the while I curled up in a large armchair wearing B only a kimono and having his bare" toes I tucked under him. Cherc: Is an interview I with Marquis Ito also—in a second-class I railway carriage in Japan.
I The book is on the whole more to be corameoded for its material than the manner in which the material is used.
RUSSIAN HISTORY.

RUSSIA, THE LAND OF THE GREAT WHITE CZAR. By E. C. Phillips, (Mrs. Horace B. Looker.) 12mo. Pp. 186. Cloth. Illustrated. New York: Cassell &. Co., Ltd.
The above three books, like others on the subject which are now appearing,
, are of interest apropos of the current events connected with the country of the Czar. The new edition of Miss Parmele’s account has been brought down to the Russo-Japanese war and the recent massacres in Russia. She writes in her new preface:
If this book see’T’jB — have departed from the proper ideal of historic narrative—if it Is the history of a power and not of a people—it is because the Russian
geople have had no history yet. There as been no evolution of a Russian nation, but only of a vast governing system; and the words "Russian Empire” stand for a majestic world-power in which the mass of its people have no
Ipart. A splendidly embroidered robe of Europeanism is worn over a chaotic, undeveloped mass of semi-barbarism. The reasons for this incongruity—the natural obstacles with which Russia has had to contend; the strange ethnic problems with which it has had to deal; its triumphant entry into the family of great nations; and the conditions leading to the disastrous conflict now in progress—such is the story this book has tried to tell.
The little volume contains a summary, ” complete and picturesque," of the rise and progress of a great people in simple 1 language and concise form. Besides the index, including principal names and events, there is also a list of the Princes Of Russia, from Rurik down to .Nicholas II.
In view of the recent social and industrial upheaval in Russia and the very great interest taken by British and American people in the progress of the Russian working classes toward liberty, a new edition has been issued of Stepniak’s chief work, ” The Russian Peasantry/’ which
'deals with their agranaii condition, their; ; social life/.and.* their' religion.Owing to the death of the author, who also published volumes on *' The Russian Storm-Cloud,’*_*• Russia Under the Czare," and, */ Underground Russia,” in lS05, the book | has not been brought down to date,, but, i as Is pointed out in the short prefatory note, the Russia" of to-day is not "different from the Russia of a decade ago. The present volume is in popular form, printed in large type on thin paper, and bound in ; red cloth.
I Mrs. Looker’s volume on Russia Is in the form of a story of the doings of two i little Russian boys, one of whose father I has. been sent to Siberia accused of Ni-i hilism, but who is later released. In the course of the story descriptions are given of the customs and manners of the Russians, peasants, and other classes, their religion, their impressions of their own country; pictures and descriptions of Moscow, St. Petersburg*. Orenburg, the " Yar-mark ” at Nijni Novgorod, and the " story of the Crimea.”. The illustrations are from photographs, and show interiors and exteriors of some of the palaces and churches, scenes in villages, streets ot some of the large cities, roads in Siberia, &c. The author will b€~ remembered by her books, ** Peeps into China,” ** Bunchy,” &c.
delivered at the University of London, are compendious and explicit In a degree I that enables us to form a summary of i much that has been otherwise particu-t larJy obscure, so that we get nearer to i the secret of this singular race than we 1 have had the chance of doing before.
i The author tells briefly what he considers to be the essentials to an understanding of Japan to-day, its political, i religious, and social qualities of basic importance. The book will appear in a few days with the imprint of James Pott & Co.
SOMEWHAT PRO-RUSSIAN.
THE CASE OF RUSSIA. A Composite View. By Alfred nambaud, 'Vladimir G. Simko-vitcb, J- Novicon, Peter Hoberts, and Isaac A. Hourwich. 12mo. Pp. 387. New York: Fox, Duffield & Co. $1.25.
This volume consists of a number of independent contributions, the purpose of which is to promote an understanding of Russia and gain for her by that means a wider sympathy than she seems now to possess in the world at large. Most of the matter, however, is somewhat vitiated by having been written some time ago, taking a false color from notions of Russian strength which existed before the present war.
The articles trace the history of the rise of the Russian Empire from a petty dependency of the great Mongol dominion; they touch^upon Peter the Great’s part in making semi-Oriental Russia a European power; they show how the Czar's Government has been constantly thwarted by the European powers proper, and how those Balkan States which Russia hoped would come to roost under her wing have become enamored of independence, and so bar her perpetually from Constantinople.
Then they trace events in the East—in Persia,* in Turkestan, Manchuria, always giving Russia credit for the best intentions, and finally they attempt to get at the psychological traits of the Russian, show that absolutism is a non-Russian system grafted upon the people from Asia or German Europe or both, and to exhibit the nature of the religious intolerance which rests so heavily upon the Jews. The book tries to cover so wide a field~as to leave little room for skillful presentation of the ideas advanced.
A STORY FOR BOYS.
"At the Pall of Port Arthur” (Boston; Lee & Shepard, ?1.2o) is a book designed to dilute Russo-Japanese war interest into entertainment and (perhaps) instruction for boys. Mr. Edward Stratemeyer, the author, has taken two heroes of his, who have appeared in former stories, Larry Russell and Luke Striker, and taken these Americans into the war zone, there to be captyred by the Russians, and then recaptured by the Japanese, in whose navy the venturesome pair take service so as to see the war at close range and be in at the death at Port Arthur.
JAPANESE CHARACTERISTICS.
Dr. Sidney L. Gulick’s volume, " The Evolution of the Japanese,’’ is appearing this week in its fourth edition, revised and enlarged, through the Fleming H. Revell Company. It contains a new* preface and numerous changes in the text, which have been turned into notes aiyl placed at the end of the chapters to which they belong. In the course of the preface the author indicates the alterations he has made:
Fuller acquaintance with the people since the manuscript for this study was prepared has brought into greater prominence in my own mind certain traits of Japanese national character. Important among them is the universal trait of emotional repression, discussed in the text under the head of " Stoicism.” *	*	*
Another most important trait is doubtless that of ” gi-ri.” a term impossible of adequate translation into English. The two syllables of the word stand for two Chinese ideographs, which mean " justice,” " propriety," " duty,” and ** reason,” " meaning,” " principle." •	*	•
A third trait needing additional emphasis is the sense of gratitude. •	•	* stm
another important feature of Japanese character is the exceeding gentleness and culture of the common people. *	*	*
Closely connected with gentleness is the no less striking feature of a universal 'obedience to rulers. • * * Quite as important as any other is the ability of Japan in administrative organization.
•	*	* Attention should also be drawn
to the peculiar national feeling about money. Direct acceptance of fees is felt to be degrading. *	*	*	This trait Is
doubtless due to refined feeling in regard to the appearance of greed or covetousness. *	*	*	The	present	war	is	bring-
ing to light * * % the readiness to die in. battle and the utter disregard of danger manifested by the common soldier.
