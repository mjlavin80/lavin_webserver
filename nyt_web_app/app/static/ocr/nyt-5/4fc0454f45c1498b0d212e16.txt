Revue des Deux Mondes for the loth of 1 ' April, a series of letters from M. Hip- ■ polyte Taine to his family during the Commune in Paris and during a week at Oxford toward the close of the terrible outbreak. M, Taine was in Paris on the morning after the assassination of Lecomte and Thomas; the next day he went to Orsay, a little town on the river Ivette. ten miles south of Paris, returning from there several Umes to deliver his course at the university amid the early scenes of the insurrection, then on the 17th of April, when Thiers and the Assembly at Versailles were engaged in the final efforts for the recapture of ; Paris, retiring to Tours, and from there passing on the 24th of May to Oxford, where he delivered a short historical course and met a host of interesting Englishmen.
It is needless to say that the philosopher, critic, historian, and intensely patriotic Frenchman was plunged in the deepest gloom by the domestic disaster following on the heels of the tremen-: dous defeat at the hands of Germany. His gloom stopped little short of despair. In each succeeding phase of the revolt he saw renewed signs of the approach of the '* Terror/’ A3 late as the 5th of April, after the ultimate success of the Vessailles troops seemed assured, he wrote:	The	general impression re-
mains. The Parisians, under the exaltation of the phrases of their journals, and of their deep-seated vanity, persuaded themselves not only that they could resist the Government, but that they could crush the Germans. Having failed, they are convinced that they were betrayed by their leaders. It is impossible to get them away from this line of reasoning. The present insurrection is at bottom socialist, ' The employer, the bourgeois, is exploiting us. He must be suppressed. There is no such thing as superiority or specialty.
I,	a workman, am, if I choose, capable of being the head of a concern, Magistrate, General. By a great stroke of luck we have rifle1?. Let’s use them and establish a republic where workmen like us may be Ministers and Presidents/ "
The reader hears in these intimate expressions to the author’s family the tone of the historian of the “ Revolution,” the keen, proud, sincere, persistent hunter for the id£e maltresse.”
" The horrible thing about it,” he cries,
“ is that men like Elisfce Reclus of the Revue des Deux Mondes Ss among the insurgents.’' The future looks very black. His only hope is that the Due de Eordeaux may ** have the heart to abdicate or the good luck to die.” Otherwise 41 the Republic, after events such as these, can only be provisional with us.” At Oxford his “ sensation of ; solitude, poetic, picturesque, carefully | guarded, is charming.” “ How happy they, how unhappy we!” From those tranquil precincts he looked out with inexpressible envy on a people who in I all classes ** admit and Cpply univer-! sally two principles unknown in France:	(1) When the majority has
spoken, submit frankly, seriously, with! out any mental reservation of violating I the decision by a coup d’etat; (2) per-
mit the minority to say and print what suits it.”	-
He is lost in admiration for the manner in which individual liberty is protected in England. An employer who had caused the arrest of his servant on suspicion of stealing property, afterward found, pays him, on the advice of the Judge, £200. A man arrested by mistake for another of the same name recovers £400 from the detective. A meeting is held for the advocacy of “ the social republic.*’ The orators declare that the “ Queen is a worn-out woman; is, moreover, only a rusty old' I cogwheel in an antique social machine,
| and that the Chief Magistracy should be filled by election, and they are sur-p rounded by policemen to protect them from interruption.” For such liberty and such restraint his own people he finds utterly unfitted. M. Taine lived to see many of his fearful expectations, proved unfounded. The republic has now lasted twice as long as th« most
stable of the forms of government that
' ^ . *
have succeeded each other in France since the close of the eighteenth century. It has withstood very severe shocks and with increasing steadfastness. One cannot help suggesting that it has achieved these really marvelous results by virtue of the very freedom which, “ quite naturally, M. Taine so deeply distrusted.
