yew Torfc Time* Hook Review:
Recently 1 imported a book by I^ouls Tracy with the title " The Strange Disappearance of Lady Delia,” London, TtJOl, Pearson, publisher. I also purchased a book by Gordon Holmes called '* A Mysterious Disappearance,” (New Tork, 1005, copyright, K. J. Clode.) The latter story is now running serially in a daily newspaper. On comparing the two, I found that the chapter headings were identical, and they were the same, paragraph for paragraph, except a change In the proper names, and occasionally in phraseology. Are Louis Tracy and Gordon Holmes the same?	F-	B*
