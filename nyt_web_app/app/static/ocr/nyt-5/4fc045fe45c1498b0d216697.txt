Jfctc York Times Book Rcvlcic:
The editors ot " The Garden of Years and Other Poems,” a small volume of verse by the late Gay Wetmore Carry], published about six months after his death, have just been informed that it contains, uiuJer the title of " A Fragment,” on Page 120, part of a poem called " Abba Father," by William Canton, published by Stone & Kimball in 1S9G, in a collection of verse called *' W. V.—Her Book.”
Before attempting to conjecture how this mortifying blunder occurred, it seems only fair to the editors to-etate that the book was made up under the most extraordinary difficulties. The only real guide as to what the author intended it to contain was an uncompleted table of contents, the manuscripts having been mutilated, scattered, and in some instances entirely destroyed, by the fire which occurred at his Swampscott house a few days before the development of his fatal illness. It was with infinite difficulty and pains that, by putting together scattered fragments and searching through files ot magazines for several years back, the poems named in the rough draft of the table of contents were got together; and the material seeming insufficient in quantity, some four or five additional poems were chosen from the confused collection saved from the fire, consisting of unpublished poems and cuttings preserved in scrapbooks. Among these was the copy ot the lines referred to, dated, but unsigned, and without a title. The only explanation of its presence there is that it was probably a " note ’* of lines to be quoted, made in the earlier days ot his reviewing work for the magazines.
The editors, in thus endeavoring to do justice to the young writer who has passed away, beg to apologize for their blunder to the author of the lines, to his publishers, and to the reading public.
