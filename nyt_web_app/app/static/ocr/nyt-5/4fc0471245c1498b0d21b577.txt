A MEDICI PRINCESS.
Editb Sichel's New Book About. Gath-erine, Regent of France.*
N her latest book Miss TCdlth Sichel, already known as a student of French history, has produced an extremely interesting and comprehensive history of the first two-thirds of the life of Catherine de Medici. No life of Catherine at all complete could well otherwise than , interesting:; for that Queen, though not immoral, as was Cleopatra, in many respects resembled that *■ serpent of old Nile,” and the period .of her power Is one of the most interesting In modern' history. Famous men and women pass before us in endless^ procession:7Cond6, Cdugny, Jeanne d’Aibret, Queen of ??avarre;
, Henry of Navarre, ** La Heine Margot,*’ Diane dc Poitiers, Bernard Palissy, Ron-sard, and his fellow-poets of the Pleiad;
. and great events* events which hav« had lasting effects on Prance and the world, occurred while she ruled France as the power behind the throne.
Hitherto Catherine, like Lucrezia Eor-gin, has figured as a sort of stage villain, surrounded by astrologers, with prison closets always near at hand. Tn fact, however, says Miss Sichel, " half French, half Italian, with Medicean craft in her
I- veins, Catherine was too diplomatic to be anything positively: frankness, even in I sin, would have been lo her a breach 1 not of morals, but of manners. She dealt In negative evil-a disease no less actual ; and perhaps more poisonous than the common sort ascribed to her.*' One real i feeling she had, apart from ambition and j self-interest, and one only, her love for her husband, a love never returned, that led .her to bear with dignity the constant trial of his affection for T)Iane de Poitiers.	-
Catherine was eminently endowed with common sense, in this lay her power; in this, too, lay her weakness. For though common sense makes a good administrator, unless larger Qualities go with it it does not make statesmanship. Catherine had not such larger qualities, and hence .she failed in great matters. Her only pivot was her personal power; her sole aim to keep the Regency at any cost. Hence her tactics changed even oftener than the moon. At one time she was a Catholic of the Catholics; at another, she closed with the Huguenots. 7*’our main currents shaped her course, says Miss Sichel—Diane de Poitiers, Philip of Spain, the Guises, and the Huguenots. With the first and the last of these alone does the book before us deal; the Guises and Philip are merely incidents, while considerable part of the volume is devoted to Diane, and more than half to the ^e-. formers and the Reformation.
Of religious beliefs Catherine had none, but she inclined toward the new religion for intellectual reasons—the Huguenots were " people of understanding," she might have said with her son Henry of Anjou. She had a strong taste for their belief—only a taste, however. Vet for years it was strong enough to keep Spain complaining constantly or her heterodoxy. At one time the Paris mob rose against her because she insisted that the right to punish heretics must be reserved for the Magistrates. But when the Huguenots revolted, her altitude began to change; when they became a political danger everything had to yield to her intention to save her Regency. Yet even two days before the massacre of St. Bartholomew f she married her daughter to the Protestant King of Navarre, allowing him to withdraw from the church that he might not hear the nuptial mass. But that was the final suggestion of her old liking for the Huguenots* Always rebellious to her, she turned on them at last- Her opinion did not change; but they had become dan- i gerous lo h^r rule, and for safety’s sake, not for religion's, she became and stayed ! their enemy.
One of the strongest currents driving Catherine was Diane de Poitiers, Duch-esse de Valentinois, mistress of her husband, Henry 11. Legend has treated Diane as it has treated Catherine, only in the opposite direction; it has made her beautiful and virtuous, except for her single fault. She was not beautiful; she had never been so. Virtuous she probably was. She was sevenleec years older than her lover, and maintained a curious motherly rather than loverlike care over him from the first to the last, until Henry's death, when she was nearly sixty. Upon thv whole her influence over Henry was good. She found him a sullen, silent boy;
I she made him a man, a poet, a King. His affection for her developed from a calflove into that of a man for his wife; and their union was in effect a happy marriage. She loved and cn red for the children of Henry and Catherine as if they had been her own; they were as much at home at her castle of Anet as at Atn-boise, where their mother lived her lonely life, Henry reproached Diane when the children misbehaved, exactly as if she had been their mother—altogether, it was a curious menage.
Through Diane alone could acce.^a be

had to Henry; she received Ambassadors at Anet, and entertained them nobly; she made her lover pay some attention to his wife. No wonder then that Catherine, though the niece of a Pope, turned toward *he Huguenots, whom Diane hated.
In Miss Sichel’s'' opinion the failure of the Reformation In France was due to several leasons; the congenital skepticism of the French for oneV^ the dissensions among the Huguenot leaders for a second.- There was a party of the Prince de Conde. a party of the King of Navarre,
. another of the Constable de Bourbon,, and Coligny without a party. Then the lack, of a middle class in France affected greatly the chances of the Reformation. In Germany and England and Scotland the Reformation was led by Luther and Knox, both of the middle class; in France it was led by aristocrats; and, says our author, “ when the people are led by aristocratic leaders, the movement is apt to end in incoherence. The old feudal relations assert themselves, and the difference 'in rank Is too great to allow of any real tie betweei the Captains and their followers; for the chiefs, though they may fight for truth and liberty, are not fighting for the needs of the people, which they neither know nor understand.”
Chapters in the second part of Miss SicheKs history deal .with the literary movement in France in the sixteenth century—that begun by Ronsard and/ the Pleiad, and offer an interesting comparison between Ronsard and the Klizahethan poets of England. A third chapter discusses Catherine as an amateur.-of the arts. "Lake all her contemporaries, she was a collector, more from competition with others than from the love ot what she collected/* She drove haru bargains; she even neglected to pay her bills for what she bought. Architecture was *he one art about which she was keen, aut *£ven as to that she had no real taste. .
The other arts did not flourish under Catherine. There was no real school of painting; the portrait painters alone flourished. But their works were not considered only as art; they took the place of cartes de visite, they were useful in politics, and were judged by their : practical importance rather than by their i artistic completeness. The typical man of the time, however, was not architect or portrait painter, but an ornamenter, a I skilled craftsman, Bernard Palissy. He wished " in no wise lo be the imitator of my predecessors.** He was always trying i new processes, inventing itiem, testing.
experimenting; and so it was with the | others—their scientific spirit made their art unsatisfactory as art.
Palissy’s story of his long fight to produce white enameled pottery is a part of French literature. For eighteen years he sought , the secret, through poverty ever growing poorer; and at last be found it. If he had but known, he might have had it for the asking from any Italian potter; It was his "fate that he did not know. But when he had discovered the process he became famousr-his fame lasts to this day, and the platters and dishes that r he made still command the admiration of collectors, though never really artistic. It Is typical of the time that Palissy should have been a Huguenot, in spite of his Court patronage, and also^lhat it was owing to his own imprudence rather than to any objection to his religion that he was punished and finally *13ed in (he Bastille.
; Miss Sichel brings the story of Catherine down to 15U2, the year of the massa-ere of St. Bartholomew. It tnay be hoped that she will think it worth while lo eon-1 tinue the study of this ** paradox of indecision and masterfulness." though possibly the period described in ihe present volume Is more interesting Hi an that that yet remained of Catherine's life.
