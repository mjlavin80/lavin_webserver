It would, certainly be a pity if any, even those who are least fond of Mr. H. G. Wells in his psychic and prophetic moods, should fall to read his “ Twelve Stories and a Dream” for fear of finding themselves launched upon some such wildly scientific imaginings as characterize "The War of the Worlds ” and most of his previous work, for there are at least seven out of this baker’s dozen of stories which reveal an entirely new phase of his talent. Even the remaining six deal with matters only mildly beyond the bounds of experience, and all are written with an effectiveness and skill that are beyond criticism.
Humor is about the last quality which a past acquaintance would lead one to expect in any work of Mr, Wells’s, but that is just the surprising turn that his genius has taken at this apparently late day, though there ist still enough of the pseudo-scientific cropping out at intervals through the book , to.prove that he has not had such, an entire change of heart that he is no longer tempted to transfer to the readers of fiction the possible or probable scientific achievements of the future. Strango to say,’ however, it is Just* the two or three of the stories most nearly in his old vein that one would pick' out as the least clever and Interesting in this collection, while, not even Ja*-cobs himself ever concocted Spoiler char-, deters or-incidents, than enliven the gpms entitled "Mr, Brisher’s Treasure,” ‘‘Mr.-Ledbetter’s Vacation,” and “ Miss Win- j chelsea’s Heart” There is not even a hint in any of them to remind one of anything that H. G. Wells ever, wrote before, and yet:'there'is not a sign of the novice. He can" apparently depict, at a moment's notice, a Mr. Brisher as good as if he were the product of a life study of cockney dialect and manners instead of
thq imagining-..of a, man whose thought.
have been busy with the'wonders of time and space and that strange, realm,of earth where things not quite! explicable happen.
Of the latter class there are here two very creepy" examples called “ The Story of the Inexperienced Ghost ’* and “ The Stolen Body.” In the first it is cleverly suggested that there are people who will -find it as hard to be successful ’ghosts ds successful dwellers on the earth, and that the little matter of haunting requires both a strength of character and experience that are far. from being the universal possession of ghosts. The particular spirit referred to In this tale' came to haunt, but forgot his cue,.as it were, and-couldn’t vanish. He had a sad time until a sympathetic .mortal .helped him out and incidentally ' vanished himself. " The Stolen Body " explains how dangerous it is *when disembodied spirits are" always hovering in our' vicinity, • yearning to return to this life, to engage, as did a certain Mr- Bessel and, Mr. Vincey, in con-( certed attempts to pr'oject their own apparitions through space. Mr. Bessel succeeded so well that, in his temporary absence from his own body, a most evil spirit got possession of it, and for twenty hours things looked dubious for Mr. Bessel.	.	”	....	.	•

•	The “Magic Shop ” is a delightful picture of the kind of miracle that so easily takes place for children’s minds among inanimate objects,'and "The Valley of Spiders ’* is the one gruesome, unpleasant thing in the whole book.
There are other,tales, but enough have surely ‘been mentioned to , show jtlio Vsi-* Tied entertainment which Mr. Wells offers and to “Indicate our' opinion that he has never ^offered any better. ■
