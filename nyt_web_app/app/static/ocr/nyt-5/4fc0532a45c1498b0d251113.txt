[^Erroneous Stateincnts In Cap^- Bat-
r tine’s ** Crisis of ttre .Confederacy.**
teaifoofc Revioco:
[E recent review of Capt. Cecil Battine's book, “The Crisis of the Confederacy,** was most interesting. While the book in Question may be entertaining and successful as a literary venture, It can scarcely be of any value to the ** military student,” owing to some of the glaringly erroneous statements which it 'contains. The author not only lacks much correct information, but also the cold-blooded impartiality of the true historian, as his decided leaning toward the Confederate cause abundantly proves.
Capt. Battine of the King’s Hussars says that Gen. Grant " from the start commanded troops superior in number, resources, and morale, and except at Shiloh, (where he was defeated.) was opposed to Generals of moderate capacity." Southern apologists never fail to underestimate the Southern forces and to exaggerate those of the North. "While the Federal Army was probably one-third greater in actual numbers, its fighting 1 strength was about equal to that of the
Confederate Army. From the beginning to the end of the war ttie Federal commanders were handicapped by the fact that they were operating in a strange and hostile part of the country, and were obliged to detail whole brigades to guard their lines of supplies, which reduced their fighting strength by many thousands. It also appears that the Confederates had a peculiar method of counting their men. Only those bearing arms and serving the artillery were included. In the Federal Army every man wac counted. On Pages 2JK) and 291. Volume II.,
** Personal Memoirs of t\ S. Grant,” I find the following statement:
■* In estimating our strength every enlisted iran and every commissioned officer present is Included, no matter how employed; in bands, sick In field hospitals. hospital attendants. company coots, and all. Operating in nn enemy s country, and being supplied always from a distant base, large detachments had at all times to be sent , from the front, not only to guard the base ol supplies and the roads to It, but ali the roads leading to our flanks and rear, i
*	•	* The manner of estimating num- |
bers in the two armies differs materially. In the Oonfederate Army often only bayo- i nets arc taken into account, never, I be- ! lieve, do they estimate more than are handling the guns of the artillery and armed with muskets or carbines. * *	*
Officers and details of enlisted men are not included. In the Northern armies the estimate is most liberal, taking in all connected w.th the army and drawing pay. He I I-e«*J was on the defensive.
*	•	* The citizens were all friendly to
him and his cause, and could and did
j furnish him with accurate reports of our I every move. Pear guards were not ncc-tsi-ary for him, and having always a railroad at his baclC“large wagon trains were not required. All circumstances considered, we did not have any advantage in numbers.”
According lo the foregoing statement, i the Confederates must have had ihou-I sands of men who were not countcd, which accounts in a measure for the j apparent difference in numerical strength between the two armies. I don’t believe that the “ morale " of the Federal Army was supwior to that of the Confederate Army, as claimed by Capt. Battihe, especially in the early part of the war. In speaking of the Federal troops at Shiloh, Gen. Grant says;
** Three of the five divisions were entirely raw. and many of the msn had only received their arms on fhe way from their States to the field. Many of them had arrived but a day or two before and were hardly able to load their muskets according to the manual. Their officers were equally ignorant of their duties. Under these circumstances It is not astonishing that many of the regiments broke at the first fire. •	*	*
Better troops never went upon a battlefield than many of these officers and men afterward proved themselves to be, who fled panic-stricken at the first whis-tie of bullets and shell at Shiloh."
Capt_ Battine is the first man I have ! ever heard say that the Federals were " defeated " at Shiloh. On that memorable Sunday morning, the-Gth of April. 1862. when 4ft,000 Confederates suddenly burst ui»on the Federals, 33,000 strong, and drove them Trom their encampment back toward the Tennessee River, it was only a temporary success. They were checked at nightfall, and had failed to crush their enemy, as they confidently expected, Again I refer to the " Personal -'Memoirs of U. S. Grant," in whitXi he says: *' There was in fact no hour during the day when I doubted the eventual defeat of the enemy. * • • It was a case ! of Southern dash against Northern pluck and endurance. •	•	• So confident
was I before firing had ceased or the 6th that the next day would bring victory to , our arms, :f we could only take the ini- : tiative, that I visited each division com- 1 mander in person before any reinforcements reached the field/* After speak- : Ing of the position of his troops on the following morning, Gen. Grant continues:
" In a very short time the battle became general all along the line. This day everything was favorable to the Union side. We had now become the attacking party. The enemy was driven back all day, as we had been the day before, until | ; finally he beat- a- precipitate -retreat.-
r * * * : The 'result was a TTnipn victory': I that gave the men who achieved it great' i confidence in themselves ever after.”
: According to James Grant Wilson, •' The ground remained in the hands. of Grant* and the object of the attack was unat-
•	tained.” C. IC Adains, in his article 4* Confederate States,” speaks of the Confederates being- In ** full retreat" at" Shiloh. William Cullen Bryant says: “ At last Beauregard ordered a retreat, * Don’t let this be converted into a rout/ he said to Breckinridge, who commanded the rear guard.” Gen. Robert Edward Lee was not at Shiloh, and Is evidently classed with the Generals of ** moderate capacity ” by Capt. Battine. Geh. Lee was not only the idol of the South, but
-	much admired at the North for his genius as a General. He possessed all the qualities for success as a soldier, and easily won the enthusiasm of his troops. His presence on the field of battle was equal to a reinforcement ot thousands ot men to his army. Equally great in tactics and strategy, he-was a complete master of the art of war. It strikes me that before attempting to write American history, a foreigner should correctly inform himself as to all the historical facts connected with his theme; otherwise his work will have no value.
