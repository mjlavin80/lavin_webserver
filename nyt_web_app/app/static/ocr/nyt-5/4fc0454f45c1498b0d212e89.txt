Books L. XXI., and XXII. of Livy's “ Ab Urbe Condita " have been edited, in one volume, with an introduction, commentary, and index, by Emory B. Lease of tho College of the City of New York, (12mo, Pp. lxxii.-4r,St cloth, in the Gilder-.sleeve-Lodge Latin Series. New York: The University Publishing Company.)
In preparing the volume, the editor writes, he has been guided " by the conviction that Livy's pre-eminence in the world of letters rests on his mastery of literary expression, that the language of Livy is alike his chief charm and the student’s chief difficulty.'' His aim, therefore, has teen to call the student’s attention to those peculiarities of style that have given the prose of the great Roman
historian his fame and its characteristic quality: and he emphasizes the important part that Livy played in the development of the Latin tongue. In the lengthy introduction Prof. Lease, writes concerning Livy’s life and works, the early Roman annalists to whom Livy refers, the " History of Rome,” the syntax and style of Livy—his archaisms, poetical usages, colloquialisms, grecisms, neologisms; some hints on translation, a list of topics suitable for discussion of the relation of Livy’s narrative to Roman aqtiquities and Roman life, and a chronological table. The commentary takes up the second half of the book, and in it are not onlv explained certain terms, events, &c., in the history, but references to authorities are also given. There are several maps and plans in the book.
