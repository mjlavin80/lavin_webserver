It is not often that a traveler makes so charming a volume of such slight material as the late George Gissing has made of this. The novelist, now so untimely dead, wandered for several weeks among those sleepy—often	fever-haunted—towns	of
Southern Italy which were once the cities of Magna Graccia—that Greater Greece which appealed so strongly to Mr. Giss-ing and for whose sake he undertook the wanderings.
He journeyed by steamboat from Naples to a little coast town called Paola, thence he drove over the Calabrian Mountains to Cosenssa, where, according to the story, is the grave of Alaric, hidden somewhere beneath the waters of the Busento. Prom Cosenza, where the inn (of the Two Lions) was very bad—Gissing is quite English in his attention to inns—he traveled by rail to Taranto, called of the Greeks Tarentum, lunching upon the journey at a way station called Sybaris, after the Greek city of evil and luxurious memory. Of the famous ancient city “ 110 stone remains above ground,” and until recently the modern stopping place even was called BuffaJoria. At Taranto, where the inn was good, the city furnished the traveler .with much to hang his pleasant talk upon—mingled talk of observation and historic reminiscence. At Cotrone—of old Croton a vast walled city of twelve-mile circuit, now a mean village in a parched and malignant climnte—Mr. Gissing fell sick of the fever* of the country in one of the worst inns In the world. There he lay miserably many days, and had strange visions of his beloved dead spid gone antiquity. He writes, too, of the doctor of Cotrone, an excellent and polite man; of the landlady of the worst of inns, of the fat cook who sometimes waited upon him, of the boy who brought him papers, of the noise of perpetual conversation outside*
Crawling out at last, he went for his health's sake to Catanzaro, a city set on a' bill and much visited of earthquakes; a’ city, too, which, unlike nil the others, was never Greek, However, the climate and the people were delightful. At, Catanzaro it was that hospitality reached heights undreamed of in duller lands. For It is related that a gentleman of the place, dining at the favorite caf£ of the city and seeing a stranger also dining, rose and approached the stranger with a deep bow, begging that he might have the honor of paying the stranger’s bill. He c6uld not bear, the gentleman of Catan-zaro, that a guest within the gates of the city should be at any expense.
Gissing’s story passes to Squlllacc, Which id also set on a hill, but is of , squalor unspeakable, and has no savor I of hospitality; then runs on pleasantly I about- Casslodorus, the monastery of 1 whose old age was hard by, about Cas-sfodorus's grotto, which is now entered by the* railway tunnel, and finally about Reggio, which, standing ' sentinel at the Straltsf of Messina, 'used to be. the gate, ot Italy SScilyward.
