Vcw Tort Times Book Rcvicic:
Emma Carlton’s comments on “ Serendipity '* in Thb Rev lew for April 28 are vivacious and interesting reading, but her closing sentence, graceful and suggestive to the fancy as it is, has yet Its ineffective point.
Would she have classed among " inadvertent trivialities " the detection of the ” unpublished marriage " instanced in the quotation from WaJr>ole if she bad remembered that this was the secret marriage of the then heir presumptive to the throne, afterward James IE., to Anne Hyde, called ** Mrs.” Hyde by the courtesy custom of the day, the daughter of a subject whose already paramount influence in the newly established royal Cabinet would be greatly increased by this connection?
Certainly it was with no care-free mind and with no mere recreative Interest that t>ord Shaftesbury observed the mother's deference and interred therefrom the marriage that might be so pregnant with results to the whole nation. m. g. l», New Tort, May 2, 1005.
