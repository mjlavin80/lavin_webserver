I The book describes needlework in Eng: land from-the “period when the social . life of the women of England was very
■	different from what it has been during-I the past few centuries” down through the eighteenth century. However, it does -not provide descriptions of every important example of embroidery existing, and contains only accounts of examples that,
, in the author's opinion, are “ undoubtedly i English," although attributed by other ; writers to French, Burgundian, Flemish,
I German, or Italian workers. The question of ** stitchery ’* has not been dis-, cussed.
The eight chapters have been divided into the following periods: The Anglo-Saxon, the Norman and Early English, the " Great" period, (between 1270 and 1330.) the period of decline and revival in embroidery, (between 1330 and 1530,) the sixteenth century, the seventeenth century, and the eighteenth century. A long list of " useful books of reference ” has been provided. There are also many illustrations of notable examples,' In halftone, and four are In the original colors. The pictures include photographic reproductions of stoles, copes, altar pieces, fragmentscfrom tombs, coverlets, ’wearing apparel, samplers, and other articles, each of which Is described In the text.
