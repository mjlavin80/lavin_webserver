When paradox meets paradox then comes the tug of war. For The London Daily Chronicle Gilbert K. Chesterton reviews James Huneker's book on the modern or recent European dramatists called " Iconoclasts,” to which we have lately referred with a note of admiration. He objects to the title because it is uncomplimentary. “ In the whole range of human occupations/* exclaims this amiable idol-smasher, “Is it possible to Imagine a poorer thing to be than an Iconoclast? It is the lowest of all the unskilled trades." On the whole, however, Mr. Chesterton likes Mr. Huneker's book, as might have been expected, but he finds it infected with the 11 loose modernism of the association of the idea of art with the idea of mere liberty and contempt of limitations.*' In the mood in which Mr. Chesterton wrote he be-^ . * ■ ' lieved in the limitations of art and the righteousness of social conventions. That is why he deprecates Bernard Shaw’s private and personal contempt for his own Candida, which- Huneker reveals in this book. " Candida *' represents to Mr. Chesterton (In
-	thi3 mood) *' a most. square . and- manly piece of moral truth.” - ;':V*	.**	-	>	*
