Eustace Miles's new book, ** A Boy's Control of Self-Expression," aims to " get the boy to realize his responsibilities, not morbidly, but sensibly."
Let us compare his body and mind, as Shakespeare does, to a garden. In that garden a	boy	can plant at	will	good
plants or	bad	weeds. The weeds	will
almost seem to plant themselves. The plants he	alone	can plant, at	least	after
he has reached	a certain ape.	* *	* In
other words, let him turn his mind away from the weeds of thought and to attractive and useful occupations.
The " ideal which the author tries to describe is " purity "—purity in thought. It has*been his plan to keep In sight of a single idea, and that is:
Fairly considering all that I know now, what training of body and mind should I choose it I were allowed to become a boy again," and if I wanted to prevent the most ;serious mistakes as easily as possible and' with as little attention to them aa. possible, so as to avoid morbidness or crankiness or priggishness?
