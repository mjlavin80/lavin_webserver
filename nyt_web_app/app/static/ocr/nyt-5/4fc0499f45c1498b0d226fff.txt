MIR ABEAU.
Charles F. Warwick’s Boole	tfr**
Protagonist of the First Period of the French Revolution.*
. WARWICK lias not presented anything nw in t>*s volume descriptive of Mirabeau and the part he played in the early scenes of th* French devolution. Nor was it his object or expectation to do so. I-IIs original design	to traee
briefly the causes of the Revolution, and to ■group its principal events around Mirabeau, then panton, and lastly Robespierre —the men who 'were the manifestation of the Revolution in its three iistiactive periods. The present book is the first of this projected series. Few periods of history have been more voluminously and minutely studied than this, and -Mr. War-. Wick found material which he has freely used, abundantly at his hand. .
; The mastery of that material, rather than the discovery of new additions to it, the clear and logical presentation of it, that was his task- Nor is it to discredit him to say that he has scarcely drawn any new dc-ductions or formed any new estimates rrom it. Most of the possible
■	deductions have been drawn, mcst of the possible estimates formed, in one way or another. - It is his credit that, he has . made a readable, intelligible account of the exciting, in many ways complicated and rapidly moving series of events of which he treats. He dees not go too deeply into analysis or philosophical speculation. His survey cf the events and conditions of things that led up to tho volcanic upheaval of the oppressed classes in France is rartidly sketched and.picturesque; his pictures of the personages clearly outlined. There is no great distinction in his style, little compelling five in his accounts of people and events; not much subtlety in bis judgments. He is sometimes prolix and sometimes repeats himself. Clarity and intelligibility are the merits of the book; and they are valuable qualities.
The story is tegun with a survey of the state of the Court and of the people under Louis XIV. and Louis XV.—the wanton profligacy of the one, the growing wretchedness of the other; the abortive attempts of Turgot' and, Necker to • improve the fiscal affairs-of the country, the strong intrenchment of the privileged classcs that brought this to naught. Louis XVI, was a dull, but well-meaning, Prince, fairly decent In his condurt. and utterly incapable in his rule; in a court of vice and immorality an example of probity and chastity. Marie Antoinette was, to say the le^st, a very foolish woman, lacking in tact, disregarding the duties she owed to the public and her exalted office of Quern, neglectful of the proprieties of life. Yet this utter disregard of public opinion, thinks Hr. Warwick, may be taken as a proof of her honesty, and it is unfair to judge her by r. rule we would apply to-day, without consideration of her surroundings and her lack of a strong hand to guide hen
Miratcna first appears upon the sccne as the commanding figure in the States General, convened at Versailles in 17SI); a perhona'ity so striking that the strongest men dwindled in comparison:
He was the most picturesque figure in the Assembly. His reputation, his wild career, his escapades, his vices, his Imprisonments, his love affairs, his extravagances, h:s v.*ritlngs. his eloquence, his r.bilitv, were known throughout all France. The story of his life was an epic.
I Carlyle ca’ls him of a genius equal in strength to Napoleon’s, but a much hu-maner genius, almost a pcelic one, with wider sympathies of his own, and appealing far more persuasively to the sympathies of men. Some of the historians have accepted without question the astonishing
(statements and pretensions of the Mira-beau family as to its origin, as has Carlyle. But the facts, determined by later and more precise investigators, are that Riquettis (that being the family name) were not descended from any Arrighettis, nobles exiled from Florenca, who settled In Provence, nor did that intermarriage with the Medici, which the great Mirabeau affected to regard as the one blot on the family cscutcheon, ever take place. On the contrary, they are traced back to an enterprising merchant of Marseilles, who accumulated a fortune and bought a castle and a pedigree. Gnbriel Honor6 came by his remarkable qualities rightfully, as the history of his line shows. The story of his stormy, swash buckling youth is one for a “ historical novelist ’* of the current or recently declining school. Fights, imprisonment under letters of cachet, constant turmoil, especially with his father; amorous escapades of all sorts, make up the sum of his earlier years. His elopement with Sophie Monnier, their life in poverty together	in Holland till they
were tracked down	by his father, who
I	had never ceased to	persecute and abuse
him with-more or less reason, form the most striking episode of these years. The

; charge against him for this piece, of busl-f^ j ness, an^hls subsequent plea for< the re- -turn of his wife, in which he made his, own arguments before the courts, established his fame is" tho first orator of Franco. But they did not put an end to his adventurous career with the sex, nor to his wanderings and vicissitudes.'
He was in debt head over heels, at times almost penniless and depending on his wits for shelter, but his spirit was unconquerable.	•	’
What energy! What industry!' What prodigious activity! What mighty projects filled his brain! . He wr*otet he argued, he thundered *on every public question and all France—aye, the whole world-listened. * * * He could write on any subject at the shortest notice, and had the faculty of easily gathering, his information from many sources. '	-
When the States General was caljed together,'Mirabeau, rejected by the nobility from the place he claimed among, them, stood as Deputy^ for the Third Estate, and-entered upon a political campaign such as had^neycr then been seen, traveling from place to place and making the first “ stump speeches ” perhaps ever ' made. He was a " practical politician,’* versed In the arts and tricks of the modem school. In the sessions of the States General he chafed , at the empty address of the King, outlining no policy, and the bookkeeping calculations of Necker. A far-seeing statesman instead of a mere financier might have made concessions, conciliated the commons, effected reforms—the Revolution might have been bloodless, and Mirabeau felt that he had the power within him ’to effect these results. His coursc in the early days of the Assembly was a marvel ' of shrewdness, even guided, as Mr. Warwick would have it, by a prophetic vision.
It was always for the preservation of the monarchy* through the establishment of drastic and thoroughgoing reforms. Less than two years elapsed before he died— two years marked by swift moving events, but they closed before the Revolution had
reached its crest. In those two years he
. it .
passed through strange vicissitudes. Feared and hated by the aristocratic side as a leader of the insurrection, he yet stood for a conservatism that might have accomplished the ends toward which _the forces of the Revolution were tending. But the folly and weakness of the King and the prejudices and obstinate suspicions of the Queen prevented his attaining this object, and his own course brought him under the ban of the Radicals.	*
He had the greatest confidence in his ability, if he had the power of tho throne back of him, to stay the Revolution and to establish permanently a-constitutional monarchy. He could not acconfpHsh this by organizing a party among the Deputies. He was not a party man or a party leader, but he had supreme confidence in himself. He saw the growing . power of Robespierre and Desmoulins, and courted them, using them to gain his own ends. He desired a place in the Ministry where he could strengthen the King in his weakness and supplant the shortcomings of Necker.
The Court began negotiations with him at length, but the Queen's hostility prevented his entering the Ministry. The dealings of Mirabeau in these negotiations are not wholly understood. —ifrhey were ^naturally kept secret. But it Is clear that after decays of various kinds he entered into a definite treaty with the Court in 1790. He received a monthly ** pension"; his debts were paid, and promissory notes for 1,000,000 francs were given him. He was to give the King in return " loyalty, 2eal, activity, energy, and a courage surpassing all that is probably expected of him.” The Court still opposed him. His efforts to win over Lafayette were in vain, and the latter’s dislike and fear of Mirabeau made him proof against his appeals, cajolery, flattery, and schemes. To earn his pay from the King Mirabeau had to maintain his popularity; it was a difficult and dangerous position. The changc in his manner of living made everybody suspect the source of his new prosperity; but he thundered as usual from the tribune, and in no word gave his enemies opportunity to impugn his loyalty to the Revolution. Nor did he, as Mr. WarTri^k^points out, at any time change his views; he was consistent in advocating with all his might the principles for which he had contended from the very beginning.
And fo, in judging him, we must be guided in our judgment by the standard of his period and the conditions under which he was paid. As Justin McCarthy says, quoted with our historian’s approbation;
Mirabeau took money from the King because he was a loyal and avowed supporter of the monarchy. No serious student of the career of Mirabeau, putting himself with any vitality Into the place of the man, need feel in any degree called upon to avow shame for him.	_
He was elected President of the Assembly. but the tide soon turned decisively against him with the Jacobins. He was fiercely attacked in the Club, and there was open war against him. By the end of 1790 he felt his vital forces waning, and In March of next year he succumbed. Whether he died by poison or not is still an unsettled question. The city was profoundly moved by his death. Business and amusement were suspended. But Marat and Robespierre rejoiced and did not conceal their rejoicing, and Desmoulins denounced his public career and political principles.
In real statesmanship, in comprehension and grasp of intellect it is Mr. Warwick’s judgment that Mirabeau stood alone; Carlyle called him by far the strongest practical intellect of his time. He was essentially the orator of the Revolution, a time when inflammatory elo- i quence had a peculiar power; and there is 1 no one of his period in France with whom he can be compared, and Mr. Warwick advances it as one of the strongest proofs of the belief in the greatness of Mirabeau that it is a mooted question whether or not, if he had lived, he could have saved the monarchy and turned the forces of the Revolution in another direction.
