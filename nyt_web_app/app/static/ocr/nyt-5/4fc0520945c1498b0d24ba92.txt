To link in one romance the glamour of Elizabeth’s England and the Oriental mag-niflcence of her Indian contemporaryt Akbar the Great, shows a bold and adventurous imagination. This thing Louis Tracy has done, and the story he has woven of such rich material is a good story to read whenever of an idle evening you are in the notion to cheat yourself ; with borrowed splendors and lose yourself In the ageless land of dreams.
Good Queen Bess is dead when the story begins, the wrecks of the shattered Ar: mada have strewn the Scottish coast, his I ** Sowship '* James Stuart rules at "Whit-haJI, but the Englishmen are the same Englishmen who flattered and courted i Elizabeth and sailed and fought with Drake. Mr. Tracy takes two such adventurous Englishmen, one of them a huge fellow, with the strength of a yoke of oxen, and gives them fit parts in a I game to fit the times. First they incur the royal displeasure by rescuing two pretty English girls from the very palace of the Spanish Ambassador, and, the authorities abetting, are kidnapped by the Inquisition and sent toward Spain. However, in the harbor of Lisbon they escape to a Portuguese ship bound for<India, and so fare around the Cape of Good Hope and come to Delhi and Agra, where that beautiful Princess, Nur Mahal, is about to begin her shining career. This Nur Mahal (whom even cold history counts one of the seven women of the world, with Helen and Cleopatra and Mary of Scotland and the rest,) is the candle about whose fierce and lovely flame all the moths of Mr. Tracy’s romance flutter. Walter Mowbray meets her—yellow-robed, dark-eyed, lithe, capricious—In the garden of her father’s house, that old Persian merchant he was, who, coming a stranger to India, rose to be First Minister of Akbar, and Roger Sainton, the giant, (whom the Orientals called the man-elephant,) notes	j
that the wonder woman looks upon his	I
companion kindly. As she docs, though, a	I
Rajput Prince and the Emperor's own son and heir, Jahangir, are even then at daggers’ drawn for the honor of her rosy hand. Thus the stuff of which tragedies and epics are made—the slaying of many men and the wreck of dynasties. Great Akbar, Orientally scornful of his graceless son, gave the lady to wife to the Rajput Prince, his rival, but Great Akbar was presently gathered to his fathers, and the graceless son has his innings as Emperor in his father’s room.
So the plots multiply and the adventures throng under the hot Indian sun or the 1 teeming Indian stars. Now Mowbray is	j
fighting1 hand to hand with Jahangir	I
himself; now he flees northward with Nur Mahal (a demure widow) by his side; now he stands with the Princess in a millet field and tells her of his lady love in London town; now he rescues Christian prisoners from Jahangir’s minions; now he is himself in chains; now he stands by the Emperor's side and fights against the rebels while Nur Mahal looks on. And the man-elephant; now that huge bulk jests ln heavy Yorkshire dialect; now he casts a ton weight of stone upon a tiger, toppling over the royal throne and the Emperor in the act; now he falls a victim to the mature beauties and soft wiles of a captive Portuguese Countess. Again be fights through a mile of enemies with the plump figure of this lady resting upon his left arm, and then he slays a great
war elephant with two mighty strokes of a huge iron bar.
Jt is romance which rides a great pace with a free rein—a canvas made of broad, sweeping strokes and effective In measure and degree according. It will not bear close critical inspection of course—but it will reward reading
