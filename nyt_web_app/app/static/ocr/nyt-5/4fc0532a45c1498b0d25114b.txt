A novel of the hour that will be widely read and much discussed is “ Jorn Uhl/' translated from Gustav Frenssen by F. S. Delmer. Its passage descriptive of the battle of Gravelotte has already been praised by critics far and wide aa fit to rank with the battle pictures of Victor Hugo. One English reviewer calls it “ the most perfect example of artistic impressionism we remember ‘ to have read in any work of modern times.*’ The story treats of the simple life and commonplace struggles of a peasant-bom hero, told without much regard for form, but full of true (not idealized) humanity and the feeling for the beautiful in inanimate nature. Frenssen, its author, a native of a villag^ in Schleswig-Holstein, wrote two novels before thia which attracted little attention. But this has made him famous.
