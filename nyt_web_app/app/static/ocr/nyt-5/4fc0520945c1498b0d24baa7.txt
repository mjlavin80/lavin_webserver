THE CBCVISON BLIND. By Fred. M. White, Author of *• Tregaathen’a 'Wife.” *■ The Robe of LucJfer," &c. Illustrationa t*y Victor Prout. 12mo. F*p, 37 8. New York: R. P. Fenno & Co.
Here Is a new and Ingenious application of that old saw about the hair of the dog. Since story writers have most practice in the concoction of plots, what could be more logical than to employ a story writer to resolve a real mystery into its elements? ■ Yet neither private persons nor the police so far have formed the habit in cases of conspiracy and crime of consulting the criminal novelist. Wherefore It is most considerate of Mr. White to give the hint In fiction. He weaves a most elaborate conspiracy, and has the young ladies most interested In discovering and checkmating the viflain and devising counter-plots, seek the advice and help of the most popular novelist of the day. By that means, of course, the process of untying the knot is as complicated and devious as the original process of knotting it. Which strings out the story good and long and provides a surprise in every chapter.
Mr. White has further taken a hint from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle as to the use of fierce dogs, and avails himself of a mysterious telephone message at night and of a meeting with a beautiful girl in the dark. The ringing of that telephone bell, in fact, ushers in the story, and, with the meeting of the unseen girl just afterward, provides the eagerest thrills which the book in its course affords.
