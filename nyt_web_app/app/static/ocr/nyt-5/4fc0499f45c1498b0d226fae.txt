Permit me to make an inquiry as to the meaning of something which appeared in your ** Boston Notes ** on May 13. The note states that ** The Daughters of the American Revolution have recently placed . a monument above the grave of Toma-chi-chi, the Indian -friend of Oglethorpe, buried in the city, that his grave might for all time defend it against his people.”
,	“ Buried in the city! ” What city? One
i might infer from the fact that your notes come from Boston that the old chief was buried in that city. The truth is he was buried in the City of Savannah, Ga., and a large irregular rock weighing several tons stands as his memorial in the little square on Bull Street in front of the Chatham County Court House. A suitable inscription on this rock tells the stranger who Toma-chi-chl was and gives the dates of his birth and death. During
-	the past Winter a fine stone coping has been placed around this memorial, and it may'be that this coping is the "monument ” referred to*	B.	D.	G.
