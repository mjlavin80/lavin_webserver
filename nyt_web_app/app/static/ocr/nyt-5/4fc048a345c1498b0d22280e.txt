THE EYES
ON BECOMING BLIND. Advice for the Us# of Persons Losing Their Sight. By Dr. Emile Java]. Translated by Carroll E. Edson. 12mo. Pp. xl. 191. New York: The Macmillan Co. $1.35.
There i3 a singularly sympathetic qual- ! ity in this little book which gives it ar. | appeal to a much larger class than that for which it is especially intended. Dr. Javal is a Parisian oculist, who, by an ironical trick of fate, became blind when he was sixty-two years old. For the benefit of the similarly afflicted he has given here some advice on matters of greater or less moment that he has de-ri%*ed from his cfan experience, backed by the intelligence and the scientific knowledge of a medical man. He found that there was nothing on the subject except what related to the instruction of tlie blind young, in technical ways, or concerning the organization of charity for the blind poor. He has avoided all such things, and confine^ himself to suggestion in the practical, ev.eryday matters, small and great, that may contribute much to the comfort, convenience, and happiness of those who become blind as he has. And he has done this in such a cheerful and helpful way. with so much Insight into the psychological problems that accompany the coming of blindness, and with such a positive charm of style, that the book *s a pleasure to read even on the part of those whose interest is not immediately claimed by the subject.
His first charge is to oculists not to deceive their patients with false hopes when there is no hope, but to prepare the incurable to arrange their lives iii anticipation of the inevitable outcome. Everything should be done to give the blind the maximum of freedom and inde-s pendence by providing them with the means of doing for themselves as many things as possible. He wishes to disabuse them of certain -illusions, one of the most, widely spread being the notion that the loss of one sense increases the acuteness of the others. It does not; but by concentrating, attention upon them, it brings greater keenness in’ interpreting the information they furnish. * Thus, it is possible to increase, not the sensitiveness of touch, but its usefulness. Readers of the Braille or other systems of raised letters know how to feel with their finger tips better than other people; but their sense^ is no more acute. For Dr. Javal says that It is much more difficult for him to read with his left finger tip than with his right, although the sensitiveness of the right has been verj- noticeably diminished by the rubbing.
He has suggestions for manual occupations for the blind, though he does not give much encouragement for them, and for professional work with the help of secretaries. Neatness, hygiene, the most convenient arrangement of the dwelling, how to eat tidily, how to walk best, with and without the assistance of a guide, how to smoke—lt Is an error to suppose that the blind lose their taste for tobacco because they cannot see the smoke—are some of the minor, yet important, subjects he touches upon.. For vigorous exercise he prefers the tandem bicycle; dumbbells he finds, with many others, an • intolerable bore. Traveling alone Is not at all impossible for the blind. Devices to aid the blind in writing are discussed in a practical way. The reading and writing of Braille, the abbreviated system of raised letters,'is sho^n to be a rather dishearteningly slow process, but it is indispensable, especially for the young.. and for the more isolated. The culUvation of the memory is important for the blind, and Dr. Javal gives an interesting chapter to it. Of the international language,
Esperanto,” as an aid to the blind, he seems to have great hopes, and thinks more highly of it than of VolapUk.
An extremely interesting chapter Is devoted to what Prof. William James .has called the ** sixth sense/* the sense of obstacles, which many, especially of the congenital blind, have shown. Dr. Javal himself finds that he does not possess It, but believes that it may perhaps be cultivated. He adduces many facts observed by others that he thinks may be made the starting point for. ctiidy_to discover the
