^ JOHN INGLESANT.
Life, Letters and Literary Remains of the Author of That Famous Book.*
EADERS of “ John Inglesant ?»
. and of " The Little Schoolmaster Mark '* cannot fail to have a peculiarly personal feeling for their author; and that personal feeling will be deepened by the reading of ' these volumes. -Yet no writer of romance ever had a less eventful life, perhaps, in its outwiard manifestations, than J. Henry Shorthouse, and entertaining in any ordinary sense thia biography of him is not. His wife has-. . prepared it with devotion and sympathy. The first volume contains her account of his life, interspersed with many letters. The second is filled with a number of
•	nig early essays, mostly read at the meetings of the Friends* Essay Society of Birmingham, a few stones and three
poems.	*
We gain from this account of him a
■	strong impression of the spiritual quality which was above all else the distinguishing mark of the man; -also of the placid, thoughtful, gentle nature. The contrast between his outer and his Inner life was striking. He was devoted from his boyhood to business, the conduct of chem-. Jcal works in Birmingham, established by his great-grandfather; his family were
I Quakers, and he naturally did not look forward to the usual English university course. As a boy he was delicate and nervous; his study at Tottenham College was soon discontinued, and at the age of sixteen he entered on his business career, only in the leisure intervals of which was his literary work accomplished. He remained in commercial affairs, in. deed, till the very end of his life.
Yet it is a mistake to suppose, as some have supposed, that he was without early advantages; or that because he was . brought up as a Quaker the artistic side of literature was kept from him. He early came under the influence of Hawthorne ; Wordsworth was his constant companion through life, and he was submitted in his boyhood to the spell of Tennyson. After his marriage and while his preoccupation with business was greatest, his wife discloses him to us* studying. Greek, reading classics and divinity, and fascinated and engrossed by seventeenth century literature. As a boy he was a dreamer, one whose imagination acted the part to himself of guide, philosopher, and friend: a born poet, idealizing every- j
-	thing; a student of history with a fac- j ulty of appropriating every fact, how- j ever small. So he is represented in the ; description of one of his cousins, and it ! is not a matter for surprise that in those j days business was not very congenial to : him, or that he usel to call his father’s I office in Birmingham " The Hole.*' But { his dreaming days ended with his mar- j riage, and his wife pictures him as the { business man; going regularly to business j at fl, coming home to dinner in the middle I of the day, and returning to town .till j nearly 7. when it was time for a high tea; j then writing and studying, and rarely go- j ing out in the evening.	j
“ John Inglesant *’ occupied him for ten years. The story of its origin, as Mrs. Shorthoii::e tells it, is a curious one for a work of such-power and imagination:
Tie would often say half playfully to me. **1 should so like to write a book; if it was only quite a little bool; which nobody read I should like to write one/’ Then when he felt that he had collected materials for a work he said:	" I am
« quite ready to begin a book, only I want a plot.’’ By and by he found just what lie wanted—the story of a knight who, on returning from a crusade, met and forgave the murderer of his brother. Round this one incident was woven the story of “ John Inglesant."
And after it was done he had little
idea of publishing it. certain that no
! publisher would accent it. Only by the urging of a friend who offered to subscribe £1<> toward prinnng it privately was he induced to go on and finish it; and it was. in fact, privately printed after its completion, though he then needed no pecuniary a-ssi stance in bringing it out. after more than one publisher had declined it. It is amusing to read of the modest and retiring author’s amazement at its reception, and of his intense surprise and great pleasure at Alexander Macmillan's request to be allowed to publish it in the regular way.
ITe was at once brought into the most brilliant and distinguished literary society of England.
!_ The letters are, of course, full of his references to it, and they throw much iight on his purposes in writing It, and on his own character, literary views, and religious tempenuncnt. The leading thought in his mind in writing '* John Jnglesant " was first, as lie tells a correspondent. that ** ordinary life in past ages was itself so full of interest that nothing is nc-edful but to recover the minutiae to make history as interesting as romance.”
Human lile has never presented itself to me as divided into well-defined and

elaborated plots'-and 4* unities," ‘but/as jogging along In haphazard fashion, making an acquaintance and a friend here,: an enemy there, forgetting them, losing sight of them, and very often finding nothing come of the most ‘ promising events. Through all these, doubtless, runs a chain of circumstances which gives unity to the whole, but it is often -very difficult to perceive even when the whole clue is in your hands.
It is " a philosophical romance,” not a mere transcript of any particular age, whereby he explains the fact that the concluding pages are not exactly in accordance with the spirit of the period of the book; a "kind of allegory, and the characters are not expected to speak solely as ordinary men." It Is also, as he repeatedly observes, ** a protest on behalf of culture of every kind against .fanaticism and superstition in every form," including "the fanaticism of work; to “ exalt the unpopular doctrine , lhat the end of existence is not the good of one’s neighbor, but one’s own culture,” and it is “ totally opposed to the popular idpas of religion (or the popular religions of the day.*’)
And 1n " Little Schoolmaster Mark ” another aspect Is shown. Is religion always to be a stranger and alien at lifers feast? ’* he writes to Boyd Carpenter, say- 1 ing at the same time that the book was the story of one of the many failures to ri&conciie the artistic with the spiritual .aspect of life; and in itself it is a^ experiment how far a purely artistic tale can be made the medium of philosophical and religious instruction. The stir made by •* Little Mark" is suggested by his . account of a letter from an evangelical lady about It, in^ a terrible state of dfs- j tress “ that the young should be taught ' that the good are not happy, and that they will probably die young"! To this “ terrible shriek ** he adds:	*’ I am very
sorry for the good people, but I cannot help it. Nothing seems to me more pathetic than the helpless state of prostration a very little plain speaking throws them into/*
But there Is much more than talk about his own books in these letters. There is delight in the success of his friends’ achievements; there Is discussion of the work and the views of many other men, and there Is perhaps more than all else the copious outpouring of the man’s philosophic, spiritual nature, and a constant formulation of his positive views about religious matters, In which his soul was Immersed. They are serious, sincere letters, and show the high character of the man, his preoccupation with higher things, and they are full of gentleness and fine consideration for others. He was an intense churchman—his conversion from the Quaker faith of his forbears took place in
■	bis young manhood—and he has not much paticnce with the position of Roman Catholicism on the one hand or dissent on the other, or agnosticism in any manifestation: yet the note of intolerance is not often struck.
:	The early essays contained in the second
volume are not at the present time of engrossing interest. The later. essays In-elude Mr. Shorthouse’s contributions to periodicals and an essay on the Platonism of Wordsworth. The book is a worthy and illuminating account of a man whoso mcst characteristic work is not destined soon to perish.
