Arthur N. Wollaston, C. I. E., has revised and enlarged his book. Half Hours with Muhammad,” which appeared some years ago and is now out of print. The name has also been changcd to " The Sword of Islam," and E. P. Dutton &: Co. are bringing the new edition out here. It has been written more for the general reader than the scholar; the subject has been treated of, the author writes in his prefare, in a way suitable for general information. He adds:
At a time when the East, with its bright imagery and ever-varying romance, is gradually arousing the attention of the less emotional West. lt_has been thought advisable to enter the lists with an en-de&vor to aw&k^n Interest in the history of a religion and its followers—no Incon-: siderable number of whom bow the knee of submission to the Emperor of India. For nearly half a century destiny has linked me with the East, and I shall be more than repaid for any labor bestowed on the present volume If, haply, readers of the hour cast an eye of favor upon a work the interest of which centres in Eastern lands and Eastern peoples.
The book deals with the history of Arabia before the time of Muhammad,
the time of the Prophet, the Omoxyad and Abbaside Dynasties of Khalifs, the Crusades, the Sultans of Turkey, the pilgrimage to Mecca, the Sunnis. Shias, and minor sects of the Muhammadan religion, &c. There are several illustrations from photographs of places of interest in Turkey, Arabia, Palestine, and elsewhere.
