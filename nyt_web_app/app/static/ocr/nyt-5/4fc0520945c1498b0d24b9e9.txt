TRUSTS, POOLS, AND CORPORATIONS.
Edited with an Introduction by "William Z. Ripley, Ph. IX, Professor of Economies, Harvard University. One volume. Pp. xuc.-477. New York:	Ginn	&	Co.	12mo.	Cloth.
A new book from so eminent an economist as Prof. Ripley of Harvard would command attention at any time. This volume, however, has an unusual Interest, for the reason that tt differs radically from the many economics textbooks that have preceded It. It is a compilation of special articles, mainly by other well-known legal writers, on the great cases which have arisen relative to the status of corporate bodies. These cases extend over a period of thirty-five years, from the Michigan Salt Association, a type of the earliest form of pool, in 1868, to the recent Northern Securities Company and the United States Shipbuilding Company.
The introduction is a clear and unbiased discussion of the trust problem and of the allied economic questions of wage rates, the effect on prices of industrial combination, and kindred topics.
