In his introduction to "Bushido:	The
Soul of Japan,” by Dr. Nitobe, William Elliot Griffis, the well-known Oriental writer, speaks of Dr. Nitobe’s work, what “ Bushido " means to Japan, &c. He writes:
During three years at Rutgers College, New Brunswick, N. J., I was among scores of young men from Nippon. * * * I found that Bushido, about which we often talked, was a superbly winsome thing. As illustrated in the lives of these future Governors, diplomatists, Admirals, educators, and bankers, yes, even in the dying hours of more than one who ** fell on sleep ” in Willow Grove Cemetery, the perfume of this most fragrant flower of far-off Japan was very sweet. * * • At Fukin, in the province of Echizen,
*	* • I looked on Bushido, not as an exotic, but In Its native- soil. In daily life I realized that Bushido * ♦ • formed the universal creed and praxis of all the gentry in the castled city and province. In it, as a living school of thought and life, girl and boy alike w£re trained.
*	* * Japanese feudalism " died without the sight " of its ablest exponent and most convincing defender. To him it is as wafted fragrance. To me it was *’ the plant and flower of light.” Hence, living under and being in at the death of feudalism, the body of Bushido, I can bear witness to the essential truth of Dr. Nitobe's descriptions, so far as they go, and to the faithfulness of his analysis and generalizations.
Dr. Nitobe, the writer continues, shows
himself *4 admirably ” fitted to his task;
he is *' a true interpreter and reconciler,"
and he says much in praise of the author as a scholar and practical man. G. P. Putnam’s Sons announce the book for publication in two weeks.
