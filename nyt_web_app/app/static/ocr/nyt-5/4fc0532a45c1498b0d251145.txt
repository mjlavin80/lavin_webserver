This book aims to teach the youns how to apply the fundamental principles of right and wrong to ihe problems ol citizenship and the State. Each chapter Is written in the form ol a. dia-. logue in which the teacher appears to converse In ensy language with his scholars, pointing out the meaning anti beuu-ties of some poetical and prose selection dealing with the different elements of I patriotism and National life. In addition i to these dialogues, more elaborate selec-| tions are appended, including portions i from the best speeches and writings of ; Washington, Jefferson, IJncoln, Hamilton,
| Everett, Webster. Ruskin. Clay, Horace I Mann, Charles J. Fox, John Bright, and j Pericles.
In his advice to Instructors, the author gives this helpful suggestion, which id ' well worth remembering:
Do not talk too much about the words " citizenship '* or ’* love of country. There is alwavs a danger of making valuable words or phrases commonplace by oft repetition. Our purpose is to build up a mass of sentiment or feeling In the minds of the young w'ith regard to citl-zpnstiip itself. It is the sense of only in this relationship which we should work upon without definitely talking too much about duty.
