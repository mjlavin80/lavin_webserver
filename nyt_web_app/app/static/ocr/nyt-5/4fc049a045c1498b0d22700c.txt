A Trial for Murder.
THE ACCOMPI.ICE. By Frederick Trevor Hill- Pp. 32G. 12ISO, cloth. Harper & Brothers. $1.00.
A dramatic murder trial with a perplexing maze of testimony and a most unusual part played by the Foreman of the jury, is the theme of Mr. Hill’s new novel. If lie had not felt It needful to complicate the narrative with a love story, it would have gained in both unity and interest—one likes his courtroom fiction without the frou-frou of coquettish skirts. To several incidents of the trial we fancy a lawyer would take exception; but they will not disturb " the average reader '* when he finds himself gripped by tho fascination of mystery and of contest.	.
The chief faults of the book are matters of artistic finish. The character of the defendant might well have been more elaborated; her attitude toward her counsel and their future fortunes might have j been, to its advantage, the culmination' of j the story. There are dropped threads, a I feeling that things are unwisely hurried : up and huddled together at the close. The book would have gained much by a careful rewriting; it is really so good that it is a pity not to have made it better. As it stands, however, it is a tale that will not disappoint any reader' of ’ his excitement and his thrill, of that joy of losing himself in a story, to bestow’ i which is no mean mission—is, perhaps, the chief mission—of fiction.	~
