& Mains. 75 cents.
While Mr. Wesley Johnston has used an old title, he has given an entirely new version to the familiar story. Instead of house building, we see character building and follow Jack Hursley from childhood to manhood as his life work continually broadens. There is a deep moral sentiment running through the book, and it is Quite possible that it may be classed as one most suitable for a Sunday school library. This Is true, but the volume is as different from the old-fashioned M goody-goody Sunday school books," that seemed to leave the human element of children wholly out of reckoning, as black is from white. If aU children read books such as this in their Sunday school days, it is safe to say there would be less juvenile complaining about religious duties, and the feeling of repugnance would be less • keen in future years.
The characters are all cleverly drawn, and one’s interest is not allowed to lag. The scene is laid in a country village i which has its share of sour-minded Chrls-tians as well as those who possess the : ordinary amount of common sense and buoyant good humor. The picture of the district school, where Jack almost thrashes the teacher when that worthy uses the ferrule upon his sister; the church gossips, the petty jealousies, and the noble sacrifices of life are admirably portrayed.
Jack does not become the man he is by inherent goodness of his own. The moral of the book may be said to lie in the fact that sensible methods of teaching, the influence of example being relied upon even more than the imparting of book knowledge, will have a greater effect In building up useful lives than any amount of preaching. Jack discovers, much to his surprise, through the minister’s love of rowing and open-air sports, that a man can enjoy life and be a preacher, too. The minister helps Jack In his studies and teaches him many things that are of great*
use to him later in. life: hut, after all. It was the influence of the minister's life, devoid of all clerical sombreness and his kindly treatment of all classes of people, that left Its greatest Impress upon Jack while he was bunding his house.
