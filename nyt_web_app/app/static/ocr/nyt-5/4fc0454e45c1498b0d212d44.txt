possess rather meagre literary merit. But “ of the sacredness and importance of the office of poet no man ever entertained a more exalted opinion/' Prof. Steele, in his article on “ The Poetry ot Longfellow," finds much of interest and significance in both the “ Tales of a Wayside Inn *’ and the " Birds of Passage." He makes a good point in his classification of Longfellow as a poet of the individual, uninfluenced by social reformers, almost unmoved by National perils and triumphs. “ He will never/’ writes Prof. Steele, “ become the ideal poet of a new social organization. Keeping his eyes steadily fixed on the individual, he writes, again and aejain, of his moral betterment."
