, er. ■ No one conversant with ‘-practical [ ^politics" can fall to recognize the por-; traits. - Few are the cities, villages, or j counties of our'broad land that have not their " rinjj ” or ** machine," with a Wade, I Carroll, and Higbie well in evidence. One
1 would be justified in despairing of the
future of this Republic, but that ten right-
i eous men would have saved Sodom. Mr.
Flower does not forget the righteous men.
One of the many merits of his book ts-
that it is not one of unalloyed pessimism.
Azro Craig, a “ haysedO " legislator, deluded for a while, but slowly awakening to a comprehension as shrewd as .his purpose was honest; Allen Sidway, - forceful and enthusiastic; Taylor; McHugh; the wear-brained, brave-hearted women, Mrs. Trumbull and Hazel Hoyne—these are as true to life and as strongly delineated as the J* grafters.” We read of them, and of their ultimate triumph, and take, courage. Slaves of Success ” is hot only of absorbing interest, but, if as widely read as it deserves, cannot fail of being a pow-* er for good; . There is no better way of. scattering the crawling , things that work and thrive In darkness than by turning over the atone of concealment and letting in the light; no better way of encouraging and multiplying the. few politicians who agree with Jefferson that "the .whole art of government consists in being honest," than by convincing each lhat his
—strength is as the strength of ten
Because his hearths pure.	*
Both these things Mr. Flower does, and does in the most convincing way, not by " pointing a moral,1’ but by letting his story speak for itself.
Stories of Politics.
SLAVES OF* SUCCESS. By Elliott Flower. Pp.	riiustrated by .Tay Hambrfdge.
llimo. Cloth. Boston; IC\ Pace & Co 51-50.
“ Slaves of Success ” consists oT eight sketches, the last almost a novelette, in which searchlights are thrown upon the j methods of the political ** machine." and the crooked ways of ** graft.’' Mr. Flower writes brilliantly; he is sure of his ground, and he does not hesitate to expose i those things thru are the shame of yur Republic. John Wade, Ben Carroll, Tom Higbie, are ail excellent examples of i ” practical politicians.”
Wade was politically unscrupulous, but personally honest. *	*	* This
means that he was not a boodler himself, but that he was not above helping b^odlers in order that he might use them politically. He would not offer a man money, but for a political price .he t would let him steal it from others, or ! from the State. Carroll, on the other j hand, used politics for his pecuniary ad- 1 vantage; with him power had a cash value, in addition to being personally gratifying. He. liked to rule, but lie played politics principally because it put him in the way of making money.
Higbie was Carroll's lieutenant, put forward to " do the dirty work." How this trio, sometimes working In concert, sometimes in secret opposition to each other, manage to gain “ the necessary vote,” to " reform the reformer," to get " a mortgage on a man,” to put through a railroad job, and to gain their political objects by various "ways that are dark,”
Is most forcefully set forth' by Mr- Flow-
