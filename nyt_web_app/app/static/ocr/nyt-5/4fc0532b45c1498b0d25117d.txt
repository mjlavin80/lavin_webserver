HE mischievous child has lately been revived in fiction with large pecuniary results, and, probably, to the edification of many English and American consumers of light literature. Mr. Edgar Jep-son, who wrote “ The' Admirably Tinker," ; has now written another of the same sort called "The Lady Noggs,’* wh'lcli, we; have no doubt, will enjoy equal popularity. Noggs is a favored nickname of an eccentric little' girl, who is a peeress in her own right—Felicia, Lady Grandison, or, as her friends generally call her, in defiance of the Peerage and etiquette, Lady Felicia Grandison, perhaps because she is little. Felicia is the niece and nearest relative of the British Prime Minister, a tired bachelor with a taste for German philosophy, and she dwells with him, pleasantly, In a manorial house somewhere north of London and not too far from Piccadilly. She is very pretty and has a reasonably good mind in a rudimentary state. She meddles in a love affair and brings about a marriage that promises to ,be reasonably happy. She plays practical jokes, such as making “booby traps” with pitchers of water placed totteringly over doorways, and " applepie beds,” (whatever they are;) she climbs trees and tears her clothes, and she runs away to the woods when she Is rebuked. She has the conventional British dislike of ** sneaks," who, in her category, include everybody, who complains of ill-treatment; she has an uncontrollable taste for investigation.
A poor child from the London slums is temporarily sheltered in a cottage near Felicia’s home. From her Felicia learns things about the life of the London poor which strike the infant peeress as painfully interesting. She puts them before the King’s Cabinet. Felicia is a rare I child.

Felicia has already made a host of friends through serial publication. To many she is as well known as the more or less admirable Tinker himself, who, by the way, is a neighbor of hers, and is concerned in some of the exciting incidents in which she is also involved. The Tinker is a droll boy "who seems, viewed superficially, to be as matter-of-fact in j all his doings as one of Jacob Abbott s ! young heroes, but is found, on closer examination, to belong, with Felicia, to the realm of pure farce, j The story In which Felicia is the central ! figure is a typical contemporary English | novel of the lighter sort. The author af-| fects a familiarity on his own part and that of the reader with the ways of the aristocracy so intimate that explanations . are quite needless; he views the gravity I of statesmanship humorously and affects a sort of amiable and reticent cynicism which suggests the very best modern , British breeding.

Of the charm of Felicia, safely confined within the pages of a book, there is i no doubt whatever. Wis view her as affectionately and cheerfuly as our ancestors used to view Little Pickle and Nan the Good-for Nothing on the theatrical stage. But in real life Felicia would be intolerable. Her badness would not be interesting if one came in physical contact with it* She would surely ruffle the temper of a saint. As an everyday companion she would be as impossible as Molifere’s Mascarille, who, we fancy, would be about as agreeable a companion in the flesh as Dickens’s Quilp.

Nevertheless, the object of these few remarks is to cordially commend Felicia, within her suitable literary bounds, as a pleasant holiday companion. Take her up for Summer reading, by all means. ” The Lady Noggs, Peeress ” Is published by Messrs. McClure, Phillips & Co., and it is a book to bear in mind.
