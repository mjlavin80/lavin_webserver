In commenting: on McLandburgh Wilson’s now famous Roosevelt quatrain in Tom Watson’s Magazine we spoke of the poet as “ Mr.” Wilson. It seems that we should have said “Miss” Wilson, as tfie poet is really a lady, and her full name is Elaine McLandburgh Wilson. So we are politely informed by -a magazine editor who has accepted much of her verse. One of our readers, in sending us a proposed substitute for the first couplet in the Roosevelt quatrain, mentioned the “ two young ladies who call themselves McLandburgh Wilson/* but we thought he was joking. Moreover, our friend the magazine editor does not intimate tha-t Miss Wilson is twins. We protest that our error as to her sex was excusable. McLand-burgli is not a feminine name. We have known , a lady named George and have heard of a girl named Spottsylvania, but even those precedents did not suggest to us that the masculine looking and sounding McLandburgh might be the name of a ! woman. But the Elaine, of course, explains the i mystery. We regret the mistake, and are glad to have been put in the way to correct it; and we hope that Miss Wilson' will write many more little poems as stimulative of elevated and patriotic thought as her Roosevelt couplet. We assure her that we have received many letters commending it.
