It Ip n*>w muny years since William J. j Rolfe, then master of the High School In J Cambridge, Mass., tentatively put forth i an edition of “ The Merchant of Venice,” i attractively printed and illustrated, and ! accompanied by an unusually large collection of informing: and discriminating: notes. It was published in a noat, brick-red volume bearing tho imprint of Harper j & Brothers. The success of the little j book called forth other plays of Shake- I speare presented in a similar manner, j
At that time the Rolfe Shakespeare was practically alone in its field, which covered both high schools and colleges. Before long, however, imitators appeared. By some his Shakespeare was deemed j hardly elementary enough for high school pupils; by others it was thought to be, with its expurgations and always moral notes, hardly sufficiently strong and stimulating meat for college students. Still the Rolfe Shakespeare held its own very -well. It was promptly amplified in college classes and curtailed by high school teachers. Naturally, it was easier to amplify than it was to curtail. Dr. Rolfe realized this and determined to give hts aid. The revised edition of Rolfe's Shakespeare (forty volumes, square ICmo. New York: American Book Company. 5(tc. each) is the result.
The more important and popular plays have already appeared in the revised i edition, and were noticed these col-I umns about eight months ago. We now have before us " Antony and Cleopatra,”
*■ Twelfth Night,” " Henry ‘ VIII..”
“ Comedy of Errors,” ” King John,"
" The Taming of the Shrew," '* Much Ado About Nothing,” *‘ Richard II.,” and " Henry IV.,” Parts I. and II. Dr. Rolfe has been constantly In touch wfth the progress of Shakespearean literature during the last thirty years, and his revised edition not only presents the elementary phases of the latest approved scholarship, but also certain editorial and educational features in form or material which the earlier edition did not possess.
