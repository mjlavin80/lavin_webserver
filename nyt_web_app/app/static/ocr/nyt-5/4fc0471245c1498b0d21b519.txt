The author of the apt couplet we quoted from Tom Watson's Magazine last week, touching’ the noisy and broken sleep of President Roosevelt's sword within its scabbard, it seems, is Mr. McLand-burgrh Wilson, who writes frankly admitting the feebleness of the preceding couplet of hia quatrain and modestly doubting our estimate of the merit of the lines we quoted. But in this case Mr, Wilson clearly made the mistake of dashing off a trifle too quickly. A number of our readers have been endeavoring this week to improve his quatrain for him by writing new lines for the first couplet. For instance, Mr. D. H. Hanckel would have the verses read as follows:
Our President " a big stick M keeps—
Bad manners he deplores!
His sword within its scabbard sleeps,
But, mercy! How it snores!
The author of this declares that he knows his lines do not compare favorably with Mr. Wilson’s closing couplet, but he merely ventures them as a suggestion. Another of our readers offers as the first couplet:
Eternal vigilance he keeps;
For peace his prayers he pours.
But, really, one does not pour prayers. We fancy that the ablest suggestion we have received to help out Mr. McLandburgh Wilson's Roosevelt poem, and give it permanent literary value, comes .from Mr. Benjamin C. .Nevius, whose proffered couplet is:
i	Far distant isles he grips for keeps.
Slays bears and snakes by scores.
As an alternative for his own second line Mr. Nevius suggests:
And childless homes deplores.
These communications, of course, merely Indicate anew the widespread interest and affectionate regard of the multitude for the subject of Mr. Wilson’s verses.	•
