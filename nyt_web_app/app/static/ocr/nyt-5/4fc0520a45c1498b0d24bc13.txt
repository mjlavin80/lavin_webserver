The title of Mr. Howells's new story, preliminary announcement of which was made in The New York Times Book Review two weeks ago, is ** Miss Bel-lard’s Inspiration," and the Harpers will publish the book next week. It appears from further revelations of the nature of the story that it involves the case of a young woman who, while she hesitates to take or leave a suitor for her hand, studies the practical aspects of achieved matrimony as they appear in the lives of two couples who are staying in the same house with her in the New Hampshire hills. One pair is dgyoted and middle aged, the other is made up of two persons " on the verge of separation for no other reason than that they are too much in love with each other." By the way, the suitor—an Englishman—Is staying close at hand to watch and assist in the weighing process. They say the end is "perfectly satisfactory.’*
