HERE are two kinds of historical writing. The first is Inexact and readable; the second, exact and unreadable. Once in a while, ho^tf-ever^ an English historian appears who strikes the golden mean. Such a writer is Dr. Greenidge, the author of a history of Rome during the later republic and the early prlncipate, the first volume of which has just appeared.
It may be said at once that Dr. Green-idge revivifies Rome, which had been reduced to the deadness of classicality. He recreates the Eternal City in the sixth century of its existence, and with exactness and grace shows us its life, its pol -tics, the causes of its troubles, how it met them, and what the final issue was.
The first volume of the six volumes in which Dr. Greenidge plans to compress his historv covers some twenty-nine years, from the time of Tiberius Gracchus lo the Consulship of Marius, B. C. 133 to more correctly, A. U. C. C20 to A. TJ. . 649, for the Romans, strange as it may seem to us, did not count their years backward. In that short period occurred the two agrarian movements, led by Tiberius Gracchus and, ten years later, by Caius Gracchus, and the Jugurthine war. The turning point in the history of the republic was reached when Tiberius was slain, thereafter everything tended to a monarchy. which was reached nearly a century later, when Caesar became dictator
for ten years.	-
When Tiberius Gracchus became Tribune, B. C. 133, the city had got beyond the simplicity of its early days in everything except name. It still had Consuls, Tribunes, a Censor of Morals. The first najnea were the Chief Magistrates; the second were still the guardians of the rights of the poor, but though thirty years earlier the people would hastily put out their lights when it was whispered that the Censor Tiberius Sempronlus Gracchus was passing through the streets, in B. C. L33 the Censor had become more historical than useful, though the people admired a stem official as an ornament to a famous list. The city had grown wealthy; it had become the home of the wealthy classes, while the country had become merely a place of refreshment, when business and ordinary pleasures were suspended. Property in the city had increased in value, sq much so *' skyscrapers '* were built, and the poorer nobility had to live in flats. Vast “ islands ” or flat houses were built and let out In floors or rooms to those who wished or "had to stay “ in town,” but could not afford whole houses to themselves. The separate houses were larger than formerly.
Meantime the Senators had entered trade—not always personally, for to do so was forbidden—but through their freed-men; they had gone into land speculation, however, for It was permissible for even a Senator to buy and sell land. Their chief source of income, indeed, came from their landed possessions. The Knights, however, who formed the second rank in the city, could and did become business men. They farmed the taxes, were the bankert and importers, operating in large and permanent companies. While the Forum was still crowded when a famous lawyer pleaded, the courts were not the only attractions there; the great Basilicae were the Lombard - and Wall Streets of the time and crowded continually by buyers and sellers, lenders and borrowers. As " high finance *’ grew higher manufactures and retail trade declined. The trade guilds remained, but they were busied rather in ceremonial matters than with their trades. The freedmen carried on the retail business of the city—non-citizens, or men of defective citizenship. Dr. Greenidge calls them.
With agriculture, however, even the noblest Senator rould deal without derogation. And so in time it came about that the Senators became the owners of most of the land. Great estates took the place of small holdings, farms were turned Into sheep walks and cattle ranches. Between the millstones of the rich and of the corn-exporting provinces the small holder often enough was glad to sell his little property lest a wealthy neighbor might seize it legally or-illegally "while toe himself was absent In the army. And upon the great estates of the rich were herded thousands of slaves, among whom the poor citizens were not wanted even if they sought employment. .Citizens were subject to military duties, slaves were not; the great landholders had no use for the former, therefore. In fact, ho one except the Generals had any use tot them; they had been crowded out of all occupations except the army.
Such was the state of - affairs when .Tiberius Gracchus came to the fore with his proposed agrarian reforms, attempts to give back the land to its former hold-
ers. Gracchus, as Dr. Greenidge '•points out, was not a mere demagogue. He had respect for vested rights, did not propose to touch the vast leaseholds; his proposals were really conservative, a return to long-existing statutes, and to enforce them he authorized a commission of three to hear and determine all cases arising under them.
Over the passage of the bill a great popular tumult occurred. Marcus Octavius, a Tribune and friend of Gracchus's, interposed, as was his right, to prevent the bill from being read, ''and a second time did the same. Gracchus then caused his deposition, and the bill was passed. Gracchus, his brother Caius, and his father-in-law were elected Commissioners. But, though the board could give land to the poor, it had no money with which to help them cultivate it. At this point Tiberius prepared a bill to use the legacy of Attalus, King of Pergamon, which he had left to the Roman people, for the purpose of starting in business the people to whom land had been assigned.
At this time the annual election of Tribunes took place, and the question arose as to the right of a Tribune to reelection. The election began, but the Senators interrupted It. They and their attendants " rushed " the election crowd, reached Tiberius, and clubbed him to death, and with him 300 of his adherents. Not one was slain by the sword.
But the law having been enacted, it remained in force—a curious instance of logical inconsistency, much like that of the Medes and Persians, as told by Daniel. The commission was active, and in six years the number of its citizens was increased by nearly a quarter, almost all of them new small holders. Thus Gracchus's failure proved a success In the end.
Caius Gracchus was not a mere imitator of his brother, but he trod so closely in his footsteps that his reputation is largely lost in that of the elder. Dr. Greenidge relates his hopes and his fate no less interestingly than he told of those of Tiberius. Space prevents any more than a mention of him, however. Of Cornelia, the mother of the Gracchi, something must be said. Of her writes Dr. Oreenidge:
•	•	* That strange feeling which a
great and beautiful life has often inspired, that it belongs to eternity rather than to the immediate past, and that it has few points of contact with the prosaic round of present existence, had almost banished from Cornelia’s mind the selfish instincts of her loss. The memory of her sons drew no tear, her voice conveyed no Intonation of sorrow or regret. She spoke of them as though they were historical figures of the past, men too distant and too great to arouse the weak emotion which darkens contemplation.
At her villa near Misenum she lived quietly, surrounded by all that was best in letters, exchanging gifts and letters with the great men of the earth, and there she died, possibly the only mother who shares equally with her sons a fame that has lasted for twenty-one centuries.
