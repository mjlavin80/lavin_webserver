LETTER WRITING
Prof. Cook of one of the Chairs in English .of Tale and Mr. Benham, Fellow in English of the same institution, have compiled under the title of “ Specimen Letters,” and Messrs. Ginn & Co. have published in a neat, thin, and portable, though hardly pocketable, twelvemo, a selection of *' Epistolary Correspondence,” as they used to call it in the eighteenth century. The range of the selection is unlimited, since it includes Cicero, Pliny, Tragan, Mme. de SevignS, and Voltaire. Of these foreigners the selection looks judicious, and the translation is well and " currently ” done. The other eighty-eight letters, forming both the bulk and the weight of the volume, are English or American, beginning with Addison and ending with "Ellen G. Starr.”
One's fh-st reflection is that this Is
*
a work of supererogation. Some fifteen years ago, or perhaps twenty, one W. Baptiste Scoones compiled, and the Harpers on this side of the Atlantic published, a similar but much more extensive compilation, entitled Four Centuries of English Letters.” A most worthy work it was, seeing that it involved on the part of the compiler the j wading through several hundred vol-| umes to present to the modern reader ! what was still alive for him, or most 1 alive Tor him, in all this before unI sifted chaos. And a delightful book it [ was, what Sir Walter Scott called . Boswell, a “ parlor window book,”
! meaning a book that you could take
■	up anywhere, read with interest, and ! lay down when you had anything more i pressing-, when, for example, your host or hostess appeared. Readers and possessors of that volume are inclined to believe that the work has been done 1 once for all. And yet it does not appear that Prof. Cook and Mr. Benham have ever seen or heard of it. Sof at least, we infer from the fact that, in a preface acknowledging a number of obligations, they do not pay the work of their predecessor " the cold tribute of a passing- glance.’’
This is a pity, as the duplication of work always is. It would have been a perfectly legitimate undertaking to revise and amplify Scoones and bring him down to date. Many good letters, some of the best, have been published since his compilation appeared. But the present compilers have gone only to the most famous and familiar sources, whereas Scoones searched all haystacks for his needles, and, as he really knew what he was looking for, his industry was rewarded. The present compilers, in their English letters, begin with Queen Anne’s time, upon the
ground that the letters extant of preceding periods “ have a somewhat stiff and archaic air.'’1- But if they will take the trouble to consult Scoones they will discover that some of his most valuable finds are letters of the seventeenth century and even earlier. They themselves own the value and charm of some letters preceding the period to which they have limited themselves by taking from Dorothy Osbourne a definition of the nature of a letter which might serve as the motto of their volume and the key to their method of selection. But there can really be no comparison between their work and that of their predecessor, to which theirs yields in value and interest In quite as great a proportion as that in which it is inferior In bulk. No judicious person who had his choice of the two compilations would hesitate to prefer the earlier.
What a pity! Because, as an avowed supplement to Scoones, such of their work as he has not anticipated would have a distinct value. For the sake of this supplementary matter the possessor of Scoones’s book may very well desire to possess theirs also, while to the reader who has not Scoones their book is very well worth having as perhaps the best that can^now be got. As we have been saying' the art of letter writing did not die out, ** as certain Anabaptists do vainly talk,” when distances were lessened and cheap postage came in. But it is true that the modern man, to write as good letters as the ancients of the eighteenth century, must be subjected to their conditions. He must be remote, unfriended, melancholy, and, in the sense of having abundant leisure, slow. When he has also a literary turn and a turn for friendship his letters may be as good as any letters ever were. Witness Stevenson in Samoa, than whom a more complete and entertaining letter writer never was in English. To the unhappy who do not already know Stevenson's letters, If such there be, this volume is very well worth having for them alone. Since it is also worth having by those who have not Scoones, and by those who have Scoones, the combination of the three classes makes up a public equal to the wildest dreams of the compilers and publishers of “ Specimen Letters.”
