There is in this thick volume, in which Gen. Oates has recorded his opinions and recollections of the war between the States, much matter which the future historian will be glad of; yet, as the General himself speaks frankly as a partisan, (and sometimes unguardedly.) his worlc cannot in itself be courtted history, save in the minor theme— the career of the Fifteenth Alabama Regiment, in which the ahthor served,, and of which ho rose to be commander. That regiment was concerned in some half a hundred battles, and Oates was with it till he was wounded before Chattanooga. It served with Jackson's corps In the Shenandoah Valley, in the seven days’ battle around Kiclimond, in the Maryland campaign, at Fredericksburg, and was a part of Longstreet's corps at Gettysburg, at Chickamauga. :md at Chattanooga. Gen. Oates give'-^accounts of all these battles-^speclatiy^ of Gettysburg, (with speculations on what might have been there.) and of most of the other famous battles of the war. East and West. He gives his story, too, of each of the Confederate Generals and their careers and campaigns, praising and criticising freely and quoting the praise and criticism of others. In this manner he deals with Albert Sidney Johnston. Longstreet, Braxton Bragg. Stonewall Jackson, Joseph E. Johnston, Jubal A. Early, the Hills, Daniel H. and Ambrose P.; John B. Hood, Nathan B. Forrest, and Gen. Lee himself, his view sometimes agreeing and sometimes disagreeing with the accepted estimate. No doubt what he has to say will contribute mare or less to the final verdict in each case.
Gen. Oates has, moreover, an account of Jefferson Davis, of whom he is not utterly a partisan, and of Abraham Lincoln. Me introduces his more than 800 pages of text with a historical exposition of the right of secession, and maintains that but for a cumulation of errors which he points out the Confederacy might have achieved a permanent place in the family of nations. Throughout the book takes the character of a personal account of an affair very dear to the author’s heart, and while he has no narrative gift he brings out many useful and entertaining facts. For instar.ee, details of the methods of forming and equipping a company or a volunteer regiment at the beginning of the war and of the jealousies among the raw officers. Gen. Oakes relates, by the way, that during the Confederate occupation of Hagerstown, Md., a lady “ said she wished the two armies would hang the two Presidents. Jeff Davis and Lincoln, and stop the war.”
The author, who was made Brigadier General of Volunteers in the late war with Spain, includes in the volume of his warlike reminiscences a summary of that little conflict and some account of his own troubles in securing a brigade and in getting sent—or not getting sent— to the front. As a matter of fact he saw no service in the Spanish-American war. Appendices give the separate history of the Fifteenth Alabama Regiment and an ! epitome of the organization and services of the other four regiments of Law's Alabama brigade.
