LORD SALISBURY
Interest in a Remarkable Man Reawakened by the Publication in Book form of Some of His E,arly Assays in The Quarterly Review.®
Written for The New York Times Book Review by MONTGOMERY SCHUYLER*
INCTE the British publication of these volumes, The London Saturday Review has observed of them, with equal accuracy and ingratitude, that if they appeared now for the first time as the work of an unknown writer they would attract no attention, or worda to that effect. Of course with accuracy, seeing: that the six articles, (really only five—two of them being a review subdivided for the convenience of the. " Quarterly,”) deal with topics which by very dint of their " actuality ” in lKtiI-4, when they were published, have now become topics to be dealt with, if at all, no longer in a " journalistic,” but in a historically retrospective and perspective view. With ingratitude, because Lord Salisbury was one of the writers who gave The Saturday Review that strength which in old days moved the British earth and heaven, in the shape of an authority which, In the days of the present vilipender of one of them, it has come to be without. All the same, one Is bound to accept the Bunsbyan conclusion, and to admit that if these essays were how to be reproduced as the work of a man who had done nothing else, they would not command attention. In other words, the interest which attracts readers to them Is the interest In the man otherwise so remarkable who wrote them at a time when, as Lord Robert Cecil, and as a private member of Parliament at odds with his noble parent, he found It necessary to do something for his living, and found writing for it the readiest means, succeeding so well that, according to Bagehot’s words, written after he came to his marqulsate, he was the only member of his order who had both succeeded to It by inheritance and had shown the ability to earn his living,	*
It does not at all follow that because the attraction of the reader to the essays Is biographical and extrinsic, they will not repay it by their intrinsic interest. That one of their readers has found them to do so is the occasion of these remarks. They are all characteristic, naturally, of the position to which the author was committed by birth, and the Tory organ in which he wrote by its reason of being. There were gigantic articles in those'cTays, as there still are In such of the quarterly race as survive the monthly and hebdomadal competition, and appeal to “ the careless and interrupted listening of these tumultuous times,” and Lord Robert's articles seem even excessive in length, judged by the standard of their own kind, averaging apparently, for example, several thousand words more than Macaulay's* In the twentieth century, each one of them would be esteemed worthjr-of going between covers by Itself as a booklet. That they are partisan goes without saying. There is no more ferocious polemic than your British publicist unless it be your Scottish theologian, whom mankind no longer reads, and the anonymous contributor to The Quarterly was distinctly of the race who, as Emerson put it, converted the histories of Greece and Rome into English party pamphlets. Although the essays are divided by the present editor into those of biography and those of “ foreign politics," they are all really political and all really polemical. When Johnson was complimented upon the impartiality of his supposititious reports of speeches In Parliament, he made answer: " J. saved appearances tolerably well; but I took care that the Whig dogs should not have the best of it.” Lord Robert Cecil, it seems sometimes to his readers, might have said the same thing with the omission of the saving clause. And the partisanship Is the more remarkable that the reader of another country and another generation finds it difficult to name I any really important issue, after the French Revolution and the first Reform bill, upon which Whigs and Tories divided, while the Reform bill had been for a generation an accomplished fact before these essays were written. Electoral reform wag, to be sure, still an issue, although, after the great concession of 1832, it might well have appeared that the rate at which the remaining steps toward universal suffrage were to be taken was no great matter. In fact, however, the Gladstone'bill for the extension of the suffrage was to come in 18G6 and to

C be the 'occasion of *he most bitter and exciting: debate Trhlch the House of .. Commons had witnessed in the lifetime of those who took p&rt in it, while Disraeli was to take the suffrage finally out of politics the following year by the same device of which he had accused Sir Robert Peel, the device of “ catching the Whigs bathing and stealing their clothes/’
Of coarse there was no question
•	about how a Cecil, whether heir apparent or not even heir presumptive to the marquisate, would stand on either ofHhese questions, either upon the historical question of the French Revolution, or upon the present political question of the extension of the electorate. Both were 4‘ leveling measures, and it was against leveling artificial distinctions among men that the essayist was committed by the fact of his birth. He is natally and prenatally opposed to the way the world is going. His idea of Government Is, we will not quite say the beautiful state of things that now exists in Russia, . nor yet the state of things which existed in the seventeenth century in England, whereby, according to one vehement radical of the times, certain men come into the world with boots and spurs to ride, and a much larger number with saddles and bridles to be ridden. But it is that of the England of the eighteenth century, in which a bold peasantry, their country’s pride, ordered themselves, in the highly char-acteristical language of the Anglican catechism, " lowly and reverently to all their betters.*' Under the patriarchal scheme of things, the consent of the governed is not so much denied as taken for granted, the natural rulers of the people receiving carte blanche in advance from the masses to govern them not after their own crude notions, but according to the superior counsel of their " betters.” It is the same ideal which certain old-fashioned Southerners in this country from time to time present to us as the solution of the negro question. Of course it is understood, in either case, that the refractory catechumen, if it be Hodge, or the “ insolent negro,” if it be the Southern Afro-American, who insists upon '* wanting to know, you know,” is to be frowned down and discouraged.
This aristocratic ideal is a very comfortable ideal for the class in possession. What Colonel Bungstarter and the Marquis of Salisbury have In common is their attachment to it. And the sympathy of the British '* landed aristocracy ” with the landed aristocracy of the South, albeit or even because this latter was founded on subordination to the extent of slavery, was doubtless, in addition to the desire to see the American Union broken up, at the root of the sympathy of the British ruling classes with the Confederacy as against the Union during our civil war. This sympathy Anthony Trollope, an entirely credible witness on such a point, makes one of his High Church characters express at a dinner party,
** the Archdeacon professing an opinion that the Southerners were Christian gentlemen, and the Northerners infidel snobs.” But such a scheme of politics and of human society is so entirely against the way the world is going that what is singular and remarkable is to find it professed by the man of whom Walter Bagehot explained, when the man was Viscount Cranboume, and by the exigencies of British politics Secretary of State for India, though he had never paid any particular attention to Indian affairs—** he can get them up, because he is an able, educated man, who can get up anything,” a man who had shown himself capable of earning his own living in the open market of anonymous political writing, where nothing counts but the power to interest on your merits, a modern man, who even knew about chemistry. To find such a modem man holding such obsolete opinions is the same sort of anachronism that strikes i us when we find the Japanese Generals, i | more Occidental than the Westerners in the practical application to war of ! the latest mechanical appliances, and who, as we are given to understand, beguile their leisure with Spencer and Darwin and Huxley and Helmholtz, yet assisting at some kind of mass for the repose of the souls of Japanese soldiers and sailors killed in action. To account for Lord Robert Cecil’s political position, or even for that of the Marquis of Salisbury whom he became, and who, at the time of his death, was described as the typical aristocrat in British politics, we have
to allow for the gr\at British instituv tion of Snobbery. By reason of . this institution the British. aristocracy are" stV* almost as potent outside of the law as they ever were by reason of1 their powers within the law, when they made it, and of them the chafing Briton may still exclaim:
The dead but sceptred sovereigns who still rule Our spirits from their urns.
In these essays the faith of their author in the old patriarchal, or arlsto-cratical, theory of British Government is for the most part implicit, and to be taken along by the reader as a constant guidfe to his specific opinions and expressions. Occasionally it becomes explicit, as in this passage from the essay on "Poland”:
It is a striking testimony to the value which the world places upon a traditional title, that men who have achieved a great success by their own courage or ability are scarcely ever satisfied to rest it on such a ground. They almost always press History Into their service and torture her into proving that the Power they are setting up is either the revival of some buried right, or the copy of some ancient model. Napoleon used to scoff a.t this Weakness, and to boast that his first patent of nobility was dated from Montebello. But when he came to establish a dynasty he did not think himself secure against the associations that hung around the exiled Bourbons unless he could surround himself with associations more venerable stilL
It does not matter that Napoleon’s abdication of his position as *' the armed soldier of democracy ” for that of ftrt adopted scion of the old rfegime was one of the causes of his weakness and his fall. What Lord Salisbury has in mind is the case of a parvenu, say a successful stock broker, dr American millionaire, who might acquire the next estate to Hatfield, and endeavor to strengthen his position with a fabricated pedigree hooking him on to a Crusader, such as is alleged to have been manufactured for the social uses of our esteemed ex-countryman, Mr. W. W. Astor. The unquestionable moral is that, at least in England, a Marquis is still a Marquis.
But to reconstruct history from that personal point of view is a parlous enterprise. Not that Lord Robert Cecil had any notion of reconstructing history or of doing anything but earning a fairly. honest living by writing in London, as Samuel Johnson had done, a century and more before. But the implicit view of the next heir but one or but two colored his views of life as the implicit views of the son of a booK-peddler whom it were flattery to call a bookseller had colored his. Heredity and environment are two facts from the combined effects of which nobody can escape. And perhaps one is justified in becoming gradually weary of the point of view of a banished Duke in Bohemia, who still retains orthodox ducal sentiments. Assuming him to be an " able, educated man,” one might expect his remarks to be rather deeply tinged with cynicism. And one quite finds that to be the case with these writings. They are all, one may say, colored by the point of view for which the author has never felt himself bound to account, simply because he was born to take it. The essay on •* Lord Castlereagh,” formally a rehabilitation, and a most skillful rehabilitation, of a, statesman discredited by the sarcasm of two generations, is essentially a disparagement of ” modem," which is to say “ Whig,” which In turn is to say ” Liberal,” political ideals. Not one of them escapes the censure of this superior young writer. But first we must extract from this same article a passage significant as showing the placid faith of the young writer that he would arrive at the 1 point of being responsible for the foreign policy of Great Britain, and as showing also what we may call the traditional and hereditary ability of a young man who had never held such an office to take the high official point of view:
His enemies had many things to avenge which political partisans are slow to forgive. He had not only excluded them for many years from power, but he had succeeded in spite of the prophecies of evil with which they had pursued his policy. He had attained the object which they had declared impracticable, and carried through to a glorious triumph the measuras which they had stigmatized as imbecile. Forced to admit the success of his policy, they were forced to avenge themselves upon his motives. Against criticism of this kind a statesman who has the foreign policy of an empire to conduct is almost defenseless. The obscurity in which diplomatic transactions are necessarily shrouded will probably conceal from
. ..1 ....• , the1 public eye jthe cir^umstances , upon: "which his justification rests. The ne-. cessity/of sparing; the feelings of powerful monarchs or ministers -^elsewhere,. and of hiding , the/faults or,, follies of men whom it would be Injurious to English interests to offend often forces him to be silent where silence is interpreted by his enemas as confession. Lord -Castlereagh was not the man to jeopardize the meanest English interest for the .sake of refuting some calumniator. of his own good name. The tyranny of ..the Southern monarchies* and the assumptions of the Holy Alliance" had aroused an abundance of bitter and resentful feeling amonc educated Englishmen. It was easy to persuade men that the Minister who always, as became his office, spoke in public with courtesy of the allies of England, shared their maxims of government, and acquiesced in their policy to secondary States. Thus the belief that Lord Castlereagh was the arch, enemy of freedom all over the world was widely spread-, and came to be almost an article of faith with the school of writers and public men who prepared the English soil for the Reform bill and reaped its earliest fruits.
One can imagine, nay, one can almost recall, Lord Salisbury as Foreign Minister in the House' of Lords, a generation after these words were putting ’ forward these same considerations which he adduces in the defense of Lord Castlereagh, as explanations why he could not explain some questionable passage in his own foreign policy. It has been admitted, even by Liberal British critics, that aristocratic government is apt to have a dignity and a steadiness and continuity in foreign affairs which a democratic Government is likely to lack, and such an exposition as that we have just cited tends to explain the admission.
One'thing these essays have in common, and that is a disbelief in the people. Nothing so delights the noble author as to find the multitude, the populace, making a fool of itself, and he Is always looking for such occasions, Of course that Is in the part. A popular delusion is his favorite quarry, and he naturally labors to show that every popular enthusiasm is a popular delusion. We are continually coming, in these essays, upon passages which prefigure the stern joy with which their author thirty years afterward, and as Prime Minister, found himself in a position to notify the French Government of the day the British refused to take official part in the Paris Exposition of 1859, upon the ground that Her Majesty's Government was not by any means clear that the taking of the Bastille was an achievement worthy of historical celebration. " So hot, my littl^ man,” is what it always pleases him to be able to say of the condition of the British mind under the calorific effect of 41 burning questions.” At the beginning of the essay on "Poland’' he makes explicit profession of this point of view:
There are few positions more embarrassing than that of men who hold moderate opinions in regard to questions upon which excitement is run-ping high. They are regarded by each side as combining the demerits of an antagonist and of a deserter. The pursuer of the golden mean must be content with the intrinsic value of the intermediate course which he selects. He will win no human sympathy and must submit to be cast out as crotchety by every enthusiastic mind. An enemy is more tolerable than a friend who advances to your aid encased in a panoply of ” ifs ” and " buts.” It is still more irritating when the lukewarmness of your ally takes the form of historical precision. Nothing can be more aggravating to them, at the moment when men are nerving themselves for a death grapple with an overwhelming foe than to have their bravery subjected to a pedantic literary criticism and pared down to the stand: ard of a set of pettifogging facts.
' This is prefatory to an Interesting and well fortified pooh-poohing of the historical wrongs of Poland, and to an attenuation to a pale pink of *' the bloodiest picture in the Book of Time.” “ It involved no breach of treaty so flagrant as the seizure of Silesia; It was accompanied by no deception so shameless as that treaty by which Clive made England the mistress of Bengal.” And, in this essay, as also in that on Lord Castlereagh, what the essayist describes as ” the modern doctrine of nationality ” is elaborately disparaged. We are told of Lord Castlereagh ;
The idea seems scarcely to have dawned upon him that any one had laid it down as a political dogma that no two peoples speaking different languages ought to be under the same Government, and that any amount of revolutionary confusion was preferable to such an enormity. * * * There is no doubt that to the philological law of nations he was obstinately deaf, whether he perfectly understood it or not, and that if he had understood it better he would have disliked it more. The poetical or literary law of nations met
•.with quite as little favor at..hls hands-By his conduct in' the Greek question he evidently did not assent to the mod' ern theory that the territorial limits of a nation ought to bev settled according
-	to Its literary history.' He never understood why the fact that Aeschylus had written in: Attica, and Pindar had celebrated the games of the Morea, some five and twenty centuries ago, furnished in itself any reason for changing the Government under which Attica and the Morea happened at the moment to be. Possibly he would have been equally impenetrable to the argument that because Dante was a citizen of Florence, or Virgil composed poetry in Rome, therefore a German ought not to reign in Venice.
The article on 44 The Danish Duchies ” is an apparent exception to the rule of decrying aspirations to nationality. Here we find something like sympathy expressed for the people of the Danish Duchies who were then in danger of the fate which .has since befallen them of falling under the Prussian yoke. But one finds that In this particular Instance it happened that the author disliked Prussia as represented by Bismarck in the Frankfort Diet, and also that he saw his way to a telling political point against the “ Whigs,” as represented by Lord John Russell and Lord Palmerston, who happened to be in power. The point against them, made again in the article on " Foreign Politics,” Is not only telling, but fair, since there is no doubt that England's desertion of Denmark, after encouraging Denmark to count on her assistance, was a disreputable transaction. The Prussian " junker ” the essayist seems to resent as a kind of pinchbeck imitation of the British nobleman. The exposure of Bismarck, in particular, though he Is never named except once in a footnote. Is so unsparing that if the *' Iron Chancellor ” read the exposure and traced it to its author, his rather clumsy sarcasm upon the author fifteen years later, at the Berlin Conference, as “ a man of lath painted to look like iron, is entirely explained. The essay is by far the most interesting account accessible of the •' Schleswig-Holstein question,” an unraveling of the tangled skein which bewildered so many in its day, and it is animated by an extreme dislike for Prussia, extending even to “ the sublime and divine German language ” which " is being blasphemously excluded from the village pulpits and parish schools ” in Schleswig, where the inhabitants preferred to speak Danish. The essay is perhaps the most valuable and interesting In a volume in which everything Is interesting excepting the review of “Foreign Politics,” of ’which the interest was journalistic and Is past. If It have a rival, it is the review of Stanhope’s Life o£ Pitt, avowedly a counterblast to Lord Macaulay's biography In the “ Brittanica,” and to Lord John Russell’s edition of Fox’s correspondence. It Is very instructive to read this re-i view after re-reading the biography. It is quite as readable as Macaulay’s sketch and far more credible in the explanation it gives of Pitt’s political victory over Fox by ascribing it not to his “ eloquence/' but to his character:
There is no blindness so unaccountable as the blindness of English statesmen to the political value of a character. Living only in and for the House of Commons, moving in an atmosphere of constant intrigue, accustomed to look upon oratory as a mode of angling for political support and upon political professions as only baits of more or less attractiveness, they acquire a very peculiar code of ethics, and they are liable wholly to lose sight of the fact that there is a stiffer and less corrupted mortality out of doors. They not only come to forget what is right, but they forget that there is any one who knows it. *	*	* And thus
we have had the spectacle, even in later days, of party leaders of considerable intellect laboriously and carefully ruining themselves in the esteem of the nation and heaping blunder upon blunder from which the meanest of their followers would have been competent to warn them. They have failed because they have been blind to the elementary truth that a character for unselfish honesty is the only secure passport to the confidence of the English people.
Which is all very well, but the whole purport of these essays is that the confidence which ” the English people ” came to show Lord Salisbury was never really reciprocated, except to a select section of them. All through these volumes distrust of 14 the people ” is writ large. Of the dispositions made by the Congress of Vienna, in the article on Lord Castlereagh, it is said: ‘‘It was impossible for any statesman to consult the wishes of the peoples, for the simple reason that the peoples had no enduring and settled wishes to consult.” Burke could not draw against a na-
Sbf ifeUr 13 o rk Sint <*9
I	tion the indictment which Lord Salis-
bury found no difficulty in drawing against all Europe. It follows that a Government founded upon not merely the consent of the governed, but upon their assumed capacity to govern themselves, was the object of the particular animosity of the noble writer. If the United States of America were all right, then obviously he was all wrong. We |	were in trouble in those years (1SC1-4)

B	ten and published, and our troubles

except with a sneer, and to point a moral at our expense. What else could be expected of a “ people," a populace, who do not know their catechism nor acknowledge their " betters"? We are, in fact, the terror of his tribe. He does his tribe an injustice when he says: " The universal sympathy that has responded to the appeal of the Poles will forbid the statesmen of England to watch the drama that is being played out upon the Vistula with the same lazy disregard with which they have studied the disintegration of their old rival in the West.” " Lazy disregard ” may hav<j been the feeling with which Lord John Russell received the expostulations of Mr. Adams about the
I building of the Alabama, but it is by no means the feeling with which an aristocratic statesman watches the success or failure of an effort to overthrow all his political theories. It was the keen satisfaction of a prophet whose prophecy is in course of fulfillment with which the Confederate successes of the first years of the war were i watched in England. “ That kind of I freedom which is conferred by univer- ! a sal suffrage, and which is flourishing : in such fascinating beauty in the State j of Maryland just now," is his recogni- j tion of the necessity the Government at 1
[Washington found itself under of garrisoning Baltimore. And of the arbi- ! trary arrests at the North, undoubtedly a blot, and, or because, a useless blot on the history of Lincoln's Administration, we find it said: "This is the pattern method of dealing with con- ! spirators that has been set up for the admiration of the world by the model Republic." Really, it is a bouquet of flowers. But we can afford to look at and inhale these blighted blossoms better than could the gatherer of the nosegay, if he had survived to see this day, as he did survive long enough to give mortal offense to Spain, in 1898, by his reference to us as a living and to her as a dying nation.
Very well worth reading on many accounts these essays are. But perhaps most of all as showing how a highly cultivated modern man and acute dia-lectition may still represent and embody
*	an antiquated theory of politics. Dukes
I	and squires there doubtless are and
I	will remain who continue inarticulately
I	to cherish Lord Salisbury's political
|	ideals. But it seems a safe prophecy
I	that nobody who is able to express them
so skillfully will much longer continue lo profess them at all, and in particular that nobody who professes them will ever again come to be Prime Min-
Iister of Great Britain. * M, S. New York, May, 1005.
