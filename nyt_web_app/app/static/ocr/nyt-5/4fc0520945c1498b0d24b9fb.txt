PARLIAMKNT.
N tho Latent volume of the "Story of the Nations" penes Mr. L Cecil Jane undertakes to describe the origin nnd grmvth of tlie Hritish Parliament. IK* calls his book “The Coming of ParliJmcni." though its sub-title. "England from I**r*> to 1GG0," is really more descriptive. Of course in tracing the development of I'ardament English history nrust be studied, but Mr. Jane, in spite of his assertion that he has laid “ special strpss " on Parliamentary growth. h<L5 really made that almost incidental to his account of England during the period named.
I'our chief causes served tn develop Parliament from its beginning in 1265. The first of these was the extinction o! leudalism. and the rise in the importance of the foot soldier. The influence of the baronage and knights on the Government had been due to their value in war. So long as their help was needed in battle they were important in peace; conversely, if war could be waged without them it was no longer necessary for the King to conciliate them. And Crecy and l’oitiers were won for Edward III. by his archers—the common people. Mr. Jane th'*r**fort* seems justified in saying that ihe Hunlred Yeats' War marks the first step in the transfer of the power of the kingdom from the nobility to the Parliament. more especially the Commons.
With this improvement In the position of the common people it was not strange that th- Parliaments of Edward III. showed independence of spirit at times. The Commons decided to meet apart from the nobles, and then insisted that money given by them should be spent for the purpnse for wl-ich it was voted— a long step tow ird the modern idea of a representative body, fn this reign, too. began the practice of impeachment, and in tne Parliamentary conflict between the followers or the Black Prince and those of John of Gaunt Mr. Jane notes the first political parties.
In KtfW the Commons impeached and deposed Richard II. and placed Henry of I*ancaster on the throne. He Was dependent on Parliament for his position and for his ability to maintain it; and for this reason he and his successors (Henry V. and Henry VI.) ruled constitutionally, while Parliament strengthened its position as master of the purse string and gained an influence which it did not reach again for two centuries. But the Wars of the Roses, lasting from Uoo-to 4S.*, demolished the Parliamentary structure almost wholly. The King's Council assumed the functions of the people's representatives, and Parliament became simply an advisory body, convened to give a show of legality to the measures of the rival leaders of the war.
The baronage perished in the Wars of the Roses, and a restricted franchise, brought about by Henry VI.-the famous " forty-shilling freehold." though Mr. June does not say so—made it easy to pack Parliament in the Crown's interest. It was a packed Parliament which gave to Edward IV. for life the proceeds of various taxes and imposts, thus enriching him so that he could get along without further Parliamentary aid. Henry VII. reduced the assembly to its lowest state; he had seized many estates of the adherents of Edward IV. and Richard III.,
U so that he was rich; he further devised the plan of fining heavily the wealthy persons who broke his sumptuary laws, and thus he, too, was freed from the necessity of a Parliament
Henry Vril,*s break with the Church offered another chance for Parliament to gain power, though it made little immediate use of it. Then, too. the introduction of firearms brought about the need of trained soldiers—a standing army, in fact; even Henry’s wealth-did not support one, and he had to turn to Parliament, which, however, gave him only half of wIurThe wanted. Practically, during all of the sixteenth century Parliament, though It existed, had little vitality, only 1 occasionally showing signs of active ll^e. The Tudors were strong rulers. Elizabeth compelled Parliament to confine Its attention to ordinary business; she roundly rebuked It for daring to ask her to marry, and told the Commons that they talked too much, and that freedom of speech meant the right to say yes or no. It was not until 1601 that Parli^ ment prevailed on Elisabeth to cease granting monopolies. ** The Commons," 4 says Mr. Jane, " had placed their power,
as It were, in commission; but they reserved to themselves the right to resume it as soon as they deemed it advisable to do so. and to take again the same position they had occupied In Lancastrian times, when their power was at its highest."	x
That time came when the Stewarts sue- ! ceeded to the English throne, nnd in the

first session of the new reign the Commons asserted their privileges as matters of right, not of favor. James resisted, and, except for the Addled Parliament, which he dismissed before it had passed :l single act, rub'd without a Parliament from KKJCi to liiiai. The body that met in the latter year impeached Bacon and other *nien, and nmde a strong protest against the encroachment of the King. Charles I. was in opposition to Parliament from the beginning, and dissolved the first thr‘*e assemblies of his reign in anger because they refused to give him what he wished. He was not wealthy, like Henry VII. and Henry VIII., and to raise money attempted to impose taxes without consent of the people. This, as every one knows, brought about tlie great civil war, which resulted in the King's death and the establishment of an English republic. There is no doubt that the Long Parliament's methods were as unconstitutional -as those of the King, but Parliament aimed to preserve the liberties of the people, while Charles sought merely to ag-‘grandize the Crown. The disease was desperate. and so were the remedies.
At Cromwell’s deatli his system collapsed, and a new Parliament promptly recalled the Stewarts to the throne. A11 the events of the Rebellion had served to exalt the Commons and to lower the Lords. The former had managed the war against the King, had directed the affairs of the country for a time, and at' tained recognition both at home and abroad as the actual source of authority. They i revealed their power in recalling Charles II., and by doing so they had *' arrived," as the slang of the day has it—Parliament. In Mr. June's phrase, had " come." The end of feudalism was the first step in its progress; the fait of the baronage another; the creation of a local feeling under the Tudors, and the expul-| sion of the Church from the political i field a third; the last was the successful fight against the absolutism of the I Stewarts.
; Mr. Jane’s book is Interesting reading, i even if he sometimes tangles the thread of his story of Parliament.
HOUSE OF LORDS.
Kosmo Wilkinson explains in his introductory chapter to “ The Personal Story of the Upper House " of the British Parliament the scope of the .volume:
How the peers of England, frdm being an estate of the realm, grew into an ln- I dependent parliamentary assembly; how, and by what personal agencies, the hereditary Chamber became in a sense the parent of the elective; on what issues, by j what degrees, it co-openitod with other agencies to establish the House of Commons; how then, from seeing In that 1 (’hamber its natural ally, if not its political offspring, the upper house gradually i discovered in the lower a rival and a foe. Such will be among the earliest points > to be touched upon in an inquiry to be conducted, less in the spirit of constitutional histories than from the point of i view most likely to find acceptance with those who read to be interested as well : as to be informed. Descending in contemporary direction. 1 shall show how ; differences of opinion between the two chambers, arising out of the great issues raised in the seventeenth century, gradually became a parliamentary tradition and periodically reappeared in varying degrees of intensity.
