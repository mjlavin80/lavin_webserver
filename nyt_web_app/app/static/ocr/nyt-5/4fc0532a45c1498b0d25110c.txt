H^^The things of the oilnd *' excite a lljeurlously active interest Jn Paris, to ^vwhlch no other capital affords a full ^parallel. Explain it how we will—by the intellectual centralization of France, by the power of Paris to drain £.the provinces of their talents, by the $ Influence of the Academy and the In> ’
vi stltute, with the great teaching bodies—
J:
r the fact remains that a writer in Paris
-	who discusses letters, and morals aa . reflected in letters, falls naturally into
>	a tone of confidence in the interest of his readers that no American writer and no English writer, for that matter, seems to be able to adopt,
i One result is that French critics are ^iriore numerous, that the work of each 3 of them is apt to be more varied and , more interesting than is the case with us. Within the last generation consider the range and quality and the reputation of such a group as that which included Sainte-Beuve, Ferdinand Bru-netl£re, Taine, Scherer, and, more recently, Jules Lemaitre and Georges Pel-lissier. With the exception of Taine, all these able and prolific writers have . been engaged in almost continuous comment on current literary product, including, as occasion offered, the prod. uct of the great Frenchmen as it . been republished. And M. Taine was . an exception only in the relative sparseness of his contributions, many of
*	which were of the same general char. acter. And there have arisen among the critics schools with aims and methods of their own, the ** exploitation" of which has given to the public con- .
■	siderable collections of volumes that evidently are read and paid for. No English-speaking community can present the record of such an experience. Apparently In no English-speaking community is there the active, what the economists would call the " effective," demand for discussion of books. Without that demand we cannot have what the French unquestionably have, a body of respectable and telling criticism. I ike St. Cecilia’s cherubs, *’ Nous n’avons pas de quoi.”
This reflection occurs to us afresh, as, we think, it will occur to many who may happen on the book, in reading the " Etudes de Literature et de Morale Conteraporaines ** of M. Georges Pel-lissier, a writer to whom we have already called the attention of our read-era It is an extremely interesting little volume not only because the writer is Ingenious, candid, temperate, informed, and informing, but because it reflects the interest of which we have spoken, and gives us a charming and engaging series of glimpses Into the workings of the French mind. It will be noted that the studies are not of literature alone but of contemporaneous morals, and in this is the source of much of their attractiveness and value. M. Pellissier, though he has a pretty grift of sarcasm and irony of his own, is essentially a serious man. He has ideas worked out with patience, held with enthusiasm, and advocated with intens? earnestness not only as to literary standards, but as to human duties and responsibilities and the attitude of thinking men toward the movement of the time and the race. He hn-g ideas of great definiteness as to the forces shaping the destiny of France and the*

French people, and if he is rather; a cosmospolitan than a. patriot it is because he recognizes that humanity is greater than any one mass of beings, and that what is sound and wholesome and just a*id helpful for the Frenchmen of to-day Is determined by the nature of all men and by the Ideals which, more or less blindly, all men pursue.
It is, indeed, as a revelation of the moral earnestness of what must be a very considerable part of the intellectual class in France that M. Pellissier*s volume best repays study. But it is extremely profitable on the more purely literary -side. The study of .'* Sainte-Beuve and Taine ■ and Contemporary Criticism," the one of the ** Academy of the Goncourts,*' and especially that oh " The Peasant In Our Modem Literature," are sound and well-developed examinations of important phases of literary life in France, with direct and indirect bearings of the greatest interest on all literary life. Incidentally the polemic the author wages with M. Bruneti&re, though it has in it some suggestions of partisan heat quite unusual with him, throws much light on the intellectual movement of the day.
