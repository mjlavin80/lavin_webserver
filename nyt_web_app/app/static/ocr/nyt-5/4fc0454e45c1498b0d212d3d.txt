What errors negligence of this ru!- has bred ! What misdirection it has perpetuated! Into how many labyrinths, where truth was not to be found, has it led men! What can be more useful or 1 holier Ilian inciting the reader to bewaro of pretension in speech, in morals, in 1 politics, and	In	piety? To keep as	clear
