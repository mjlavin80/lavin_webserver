Out* readers continue to manifest great Interest in Mr* McLandburg Wilson’s felicitous quatrain touching the unsettled repose of the Innate martial spirit of the President of the United States:
His sword within his scabbard sleeps, But, mercy! how it snores!
They continue, also,—-their efforts to
produce a first couplet for the Roosevelt
quatrain more apt and melodious than
Mr, Wilson’s, originally contributed to
Tom Watson’s Magazine, which was as
follows:
Our Presidents a man of peace. Preparedness he implores.
Now, the first line ofWilson’s couplet Is not so bad. Of course, with ;the qualification, our-President is a man of peace —a man of'*peace ever alive to ihe possibility of war and, Jts stimulating cffect on latent patriotism. But of ".preparedness " we are compelled to say* os Polo-nius said of " beautified “ 'Us a vile phrase.” Moreover, It spoils tBte-'metre, and fojc these reasons ■ we have-been urging that the quatrain be rebuilded. Last week we printed a few suggestions from our readers for a new first couplet, and this week our .mails have been , burdened with many letters containing oiher suggestions. For instance, a " Constant Reader ” proffers:
In arts of war he’s trained, yet keeps His eye on peaceful scores,
but this seems open to criticism. What are “ peaceful scores "? We must have no ambiguity in this matter? ** Constant Reader’s ” suggestion, however, la much better than "a tinker’s,” which ts positively unintelligible:
At M weaklings ” now and then he leaps,
E’er wobs the “gods” encores!
We confess our inability to follow this tinker unless he means that the President habitually “ plays to the gallery," in which case the idea is not well expressed.
I Much better, in its patriotic quality, and as a statement of fact, Is this couplet from another reader:
The peace of justice well he keeps,
And unjust wars he scores!
“ Scores," it may be needful to explain,
1b here used in the sense of ‘ denounces." Another rhymes '* snores,” in three sev- i eral specimen couplets, with *‘ bristling shores." " neutral shores," and " strenuous shores," the neutral shores being the best kind for any nation to have.
As yet, however, the quatrain as Mr. Wilson originally wrote it has not been greatly improved upon. " Preparedness " is a halting and ineffective word for verse, and the word " implores " scarcely fits any of the President's moods. But we fear the lines must stand as they were written unless the poet himself chooses to revise them.
