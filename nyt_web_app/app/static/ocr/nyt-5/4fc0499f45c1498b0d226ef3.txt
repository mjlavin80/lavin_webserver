Herbert Paul's Third Volume, Covering the Period Between 1865 and 1876.*
HE third volume of Mr. Paul’s “ History of Modern England *' brings the story down to the period 1SG5-1873-0, a very important decade, as ' is seen when it is recalled that it covered the disestablishment of the Irish Church, the Franco-Prussian war. the Alabama arbitration, and the beginning of any real attempt to 1 solve the everlasting Irish question.
All of these matters, and others of consequence to England, Mr. Paul treats fully and in a most charming style. His book is exceedingly good reading. The great biographies of the last few years— Tennyson's. Manning's. Gladstone's, and others—he has turned to with eagerness; in consequence, his book contains touches that one looks for in vain in older histories; little anecdotes, side remarks, that lend life to the story, just as Cromwell’s wart lent character to his portrait.
The third volume begins with the change of Ministry following Lord Palmerston's death In 18G5, the Russell-Gladstone administration. A sentence on the second page of the book is indicative of Mr. Paul’s freedom of opinion and speech. In describing the make-up of the new Government he says:	“Sir Robert
Peel was, however, removed from the Irish office, to which he bad been appointed by a mere freak of Lord Palmerston's, and for which, ns for any other office, he was quite unfit.** Such language may not reach the dignity of ordinary history, but it certainly makes history interesting reading.
Almost at once Lord Russell found himself confronted with the Jamaica question—the alleged uprising of the negroes, which had been suppressed so ruthlessly by the Governor of the island, Mr. Eyre, (Mr. Paul, by the way, with characteristic English indifference to details, never once gives Eyre's full name.
It was Edward John Eyre; he died less than four year ago.) Following that came the cattle plague and the reform bill, on which last the Government was defeated. Then came Derby, with Disra-ell as leader of the House. The latter promptly introduced and carried a reform bill of his own. based on Gladstone's, and passed it. He became Premier on Derby's resignation, and his Ministry was defeated on an Irish question—the disestablishment of the Protestant Church ot Ireland, and Gladstone, returning to power, put the measure through Parliament. An important measure of this time dealt, with trade unions, giving them a legal right to existence; another was the first Irish Land act, of which Mr. Paul writes: " Its interest and value lie in the recognition of a great principle and an intolerable wrong." In this administration. which Mr. Paul calls *' the climax of Liberalism,” the principle of expatriation was recognized for the first time by British law, and the civil- service was reorganized and opened to every person. Somewhat ,1a ter the army was “ reformed " and the purchase of commissions abolished. To us It seems curious that army commissions could ever have been the subject of ■ bargain and sale, (between officers; not, of course, between politicians and the appointive power.) but it took the Queen’s intervention to put a stop to the custom, and even then a large sum had to be paid to officers deprived of their 4* right " to sell their commissions in the army.
In his clear account of the Alabama arbitration, Mr. Paul says, of our American arbitrator, Charles Francis Adams, that, because of his services to peace,
“ he ought to have a statue at Westminster as well as at Washington.'* To Americans, who look at the Speaker of the House of Representatives simply as the leader of the majority, who forces majority measures through the House, and keeps the minority in the background, Mr, Paul’s comment on Mr. Brand's election as Speaker of the House of Commons should be enlightening. He says that ** rightly or wrongly, Mr. Brand was always suspected of an unconscious lean* ing toward his own side.” Think of an impartial Speaker in Albany, Trenton, or Washington!
The Irish University bill caused the fall of Mr. Gladstone's Ministry in 1873, but Mr. Disraeli refused to take office, and Gladstone had to retain power for a few months. The general election of 1874, however, brought Disraeli " for the first time in possession not merely of office, but of power.” Then began the development of imperialism—which may be said to date from Disraeli's purchase of the Suez Canal shares previously held by the ICh4dlve of Egypt. It was followed by the interference of England In Egypt; and that, in 18S2, by the revolt of the Egyptians, the armed invasion by EJngl&nd, and the practical annexation-of the country-to Great Britain. Great oaks from little
acorns most certainly do grow, but Queen Victoria's assumption of the title of EmI press of India cannot be considered an oak.
Valuable chapters of Mr. Paul’s book deal with the troubles of the Established Church, and with the literary, intellectual, and social progress of the country* They round out a book which otherwise would not deserve its title of a history of modern England, but would be rather a political history of Parliament.
