Love and Sacrifice.
AN AMERICAK ABELABD AND HEI.OI8E.
A Lore Siory by Mary Ives Todd. 12mo. New York:	The Grafton Press- f 1.50.
Here is a book obviously written with a purpose. The emancipation of mankind in matters of religion especially occupies much of the author’s attention. The Reverend Abel Allen of Boston, pale and aesthetic—the modern Abelard— is tbe adored idol of the feminine members of his flock. Impervious to their charms, however, he pursues his solitary way until Heloise Mills appears upon the horizon, then suddenly the Reverend Abel discovers the mean in gr of love.
Helofse is not orthodox in her belief,
nor can she tolerate the orthodoxy of
Abel's creed. After the death of her
father Heloise disappears from Boston,
and the Reverend Abel Is cast Into the
depth of gloom. But through the means of
marked newspapers, whicn she happily leaves behind, he traces her to Los Angeles and in his mind’s eye already sees her the bride of some Western unworthy. Jealousy gnaws Htce a worm i’ the bud/’
I anA by and by the Reverend Abel lan-j guishes and grows paler than ever. It Is during his illness that he suddenly sees the broader religious course based upon science rather than faith. He resigns his pastorate and seeks health and Heloise In Los Angeles. ‘ *
However, just why Heloise persists in her refusal to marry Abelard, just what she expects to accomplish, and where it all lead3 to in the end, it is hard to dls-cover from the story. After carefully reading the 337 pages of arguments and rather dreary love story, one is inclined to ask of the author, what's the use? "
