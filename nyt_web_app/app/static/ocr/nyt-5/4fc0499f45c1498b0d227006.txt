This little comedy of Mr. John Kendrick Bangs’s (“ The Worsted Man.” Illustrated. 24mo. New York:	Harper	&	'
Brothers. 50 cents) is based on the Frankenstein theory. A man made of cotton and wool comes to life to flirt madly with eight guileless Summer girls. The scene is laid in a country itotel guiltless of male quests. The girls :>ing wailing songs to the music of " PiRR*:ore,” *' Patience,” &.c., but one, more energetic and original than the rest, creates this soft, cotton-brained creature, gives him to drink of the waters of the famous springs upon which the hotel bases its advertisements, and there breathes before the delighted girls Mr. Woolley himself.y One
thing Tilr. Woolley lacks which makes him quite safe—he has no heart to either give or lose. But there did Miss Patience, his creator, reckon without the bellboy. That prudent youth had gathered all the lost hearts of the season before, and at a sacrifice disposes of them to the cunning Woolley. Some, it is true, were scorched, some quite cold, others battered, and one was broken, but they did well enough. Mr. Woolley with a heart apiece for each girl does sad damage, but he meets his just deserts when the girls, each taking him by a thread, unravel him for his wickedness. The little comedy is undoubtedly intended by Mr. Bangs for acting in amateur theatricals.
