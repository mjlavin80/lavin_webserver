yew York Tim vs Book Review:
I haven't yet read the May magazines, but have read Schiller and a great deal of what has -been said about him; never yet, though, until now, .an article like that on page 206 of The New York Times Book Review of May 6, which comprised In few. words the true spirit of Schiller. I think tt would be well worth while for your readers to know who w.rote that article. It is an Intellectual pleasure to centre Into a personality ideas so truly expressed by a writer who has such an affinity of soul with the great mnn ho commemorates.	B.	M.
