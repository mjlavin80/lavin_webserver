. Xrevathan's “ American Thoroughbred ” and Prof. Roberts’s New Book.*
ALTHOUGH \ Mr. Trevathan dedicates bis volume to the late W. C. Whitney, and Prof. Roberts is more or less of a scientist, both authors early in their books take oc~ caslon to say ** there Is no £ native horse of Arocrica.’* And yet Mr.
^ Whitney - spent thousands of dollars," £(£-equipped a costly expedition to the Bad &l*ands of Wyoming and the Dakotas, and t had mounted at the Museum of Natural
*	'History in this city the skeletons of u •* number of fossil horses solely for the (; purpose of proving that the horse was a
native product, anti not an importation!
f£ Mr. Trevathan was certainly aware of [ the fa'ct, for he has talked with the writer \ about the matter. And Prof. Roberts
*
*	must have been familiar with the re-i searches and claims of the late Profs.
I Marsh and Cope and their demonstrations
*	that the fossil horses of the Bad Lands were the true precursors of the mustang Of the plains and the ponies of the Soulh
. American pampas. What is to become of the ecnippus, the erohippus, the protu-hippos, and all the other hlppuses that it — has cost so much money and required so much study to prove were the true ancestors of the thoroughbred of to-day, when two such authorities airily brusti the whole elaborately wurked-out theory aside as unworthy of their consideration? It would seem as if both had trusted too much to Yorfati and Frank Forester, when rt*ey prepared their introductory chapUrs, instead of accepting the later and poss-iblv better informed authorities on the origin of the most useful of all animals. And Air. Trevathan even goes so far afield as to say, There is no evidence, historic or prehistoric, that the horse ever had habitat upon this continent previous to the coming of the white man.” If that is so it would seem as if Prof. Bumpus should hav» ihose fossil horses removed from the Museum, so that the lesson they are designed to convey may no longer mislead tho public.
Aside from this little trifle that must perforce puzzle the well-informed reader a bit, both have prepared volumes that are both interesting and useful, though j both are marred by typographical errors J In the names of both horses und owners that ought not to mar such volumes. For these the careless proofrciiivr rather than the author is of course to blame.
Mr. Trevathan treats of the horse as an aristocrat; Prof. Roberts deals with him as a commoner. The first finds him as tlfo animal who “ has ever been the companion and the faithful servant of man." and revels in the Social Register of horsedom. Prof. Roberts looks on him as the burden bearer, the helper, and only incidentally as a means for furnishing amusement and recreati/'p for mankind. He has made a book for the breeder of the useful, and has certainly managed to crowd a host of hints as to breeding and information as to what and how to choose and lmw to care for the product that can be of grfat t^lue to the breeder, even though the successive chapters have a flavor of lectures prepared for the students in a course of "Horse Breeding Taught by Mail."	.
Virginia's place in history is certainly forever assured, for, as Mr. Trevathan points out, she was the mother of race hors<*s and races as well as of mere Presidents. It was to her soil that the first thoroughbred of which there is any record- Bulle Rock—was imported from England. It was to her soil that the great Diomed. an English Derby winner, was imported after he had won fame as a sire in England. and it was on a Virginia farm that his even greater son. Sir Archy. was 1 foaled. There is hardly an American nice i horse ('f finality, a true top-noteher. but has the blood of these great racers flowing in his vt'ir.s. Sir Archy's blood it was that foundt-d the thoroughbred stoj;k of Kentucky, and of that Mr. Trevathan says:	"	No other product of the Slate,
not even her whisky, has yielded to the old Commonwealth such an enormous an-"nunl income." And to-day there are i " irrore thoroughbrt-ds within her boun- \ daries than exist in all the oth'*r States of the I’nion."
And for these reasons it has come about, according to Mr. Trcvathaifs theory, that wherever the gentlemanly btood of England t went thr-re, too. went the tt^srougbbred, j and with them went horse racing. It took j much delving of musty records to secure [ the sueeincl history of racing in Virginia, j Maryland, the Candinas, and other States i that he has compiled and t'-lls in narra- : live form. With thr- nam< s ot tlie famous horses go coupled the names of their own-ers—Washington, PincknTy, Wilson, Alston. Rutledge, Hampton. Taylor, Johnson, Andrew Jackson, Ferguson, Ran-

dolph, Selden> Lee, Lightfoot, Carter, i Fairfax, Custis. “ All these, themselves gentlemen of the very* best breeding and of private accomplishments, the real F. F* Vs.,'■were the breeders and racing men of the time." And when in course of time the sport In which they indulged with , passionate fondness found a foothold in New Jersey and New York it enlisted the sympathies and fortunes of families that bore such Illustrious names as Stevens, Delancey, Hunter, Livingston, Van Ranst, Morris, Gibbons, Jay, Purdy, and others > of equal social standing. The ownership of the_thoroughbred and the racing of | it has ever since been a e “ fancy" of j the gentlemen. Even now. when com- j mercialism dominates racing, and its feature as a sport, pure and simple, is lost sight of except at the country clubs and hunt clubs, the gentle bred looks Upon racing as his sport, and the " climber *’ ! and social aspirant looks upon H as^ a means to the opening of portals that even his golden keys will not otherwise open, i But it Is to the horse show rather than the race track that such most naturally ! drift. The former gives a better chance for personal display and does not necessarily require the same love for the horse, i i It is upon this social side of thorough- j i bred ownership that Mr. Trevathan lays ; | more stress than upon horse-breeding. He is not at all technical. He recites tho . stories of the glorious performances of Sir Archy. " the first horse of grandeur ! of Blank. American Eclipse, Sir Henry, Black Maria, Boston. Fashion, Wagner, p Grey Eagle, Peytona, and a score of | others of the days between the Revolution and the civil war. Those were the days when horses ran races of three and four mile heats, and in one of the races he tells how Black Maria had to run twenty miles before she won the race in which she started—five four-mile heats.
Boston, Mr. Trevathan concludes, ntter a thorough study of the matter, was " the greatest horse that ever lived this side of the Atlantic." He was so far superior to all other horses as a four-miler that his owner was obliged to keep him in the stable in order to prevent the breaking up of race meetings, as for years no other animal could he found who could even make him extend himself. t.)n his behalf the owner of the animal made a challenge that has never been equaled for its audacity, and yet it was not accepted. That challenge was to run Boston against any two animals in the world, taking them singly, in four-mile heats, for n purse of .$4a.(X>0 a side. And yet it was but a few weeks after the challenge that Boston was defeated in straight heats by the mare Fashion in a race for a small purse. That led to the great race, “ The North vs. The South." for ?20,000 a side, in which Fashion beat Boston, winning the ffrst heat in Ttte*/*, the fastest heat ever run up to that time by several seconds. And yet, says the chronicler, *' though beaten, it was conceded by the judges that Boston had acquired a more vast renown by this splendid performance than by his thirty-five previous victories combined.”
To get to the practical horse. In 1JKX) there were ’J] .‘Jlti.ws horses in this country. one for every :!.« inhabitants. Tlie IS.250.(UK) horses and 2,0iK).ftO0 mules on the farms ol the country do work equivalent to the labors of tt5.000,000 hand laborers, estimates the author of “The Horse." and at one-twentieth of the cost of human muscular energy, which is ample proof of their economic value. That Is the test on which Prof, Roberts bases his continuous plea to farmers to breed always the best nnd thus gradually eliminate the badly formed, badly tempered, spavined and unsound from^ American farms, highways, find race tracks. The bette’* the blood the betier the offspring is his constantly reiterated lesson. He lays great stress on the imperative necessity of the exercise of intelligence in the selection of sire and dam according to their natural e\-c-lienees. Pedigrees which are nol charged with the blood of ' the best families should not be depended on blindly. a:= individuality is better than a mere mass of name-; iImi do not carry -with them strong inheritances. He im presses, constantly, tlie necessity of proper '-limativ influences and suitably balanced foods for the su'-ressful breeding of ;i horse, whether dr.»oght .tnimal. roadster. general purpose horse, pony, hunter, or thoroughbred racer. He proves that there is more profit in horse breeding i when inlelp:;. :it ly conduct* d than in any j other agricjltiii.il enterprise, and shows In simple language how succcss may be j assured.	!
While some ht-rse li>v< rs nmy not agree with *i11<• *>f los estimates as to tin* relative vaiu-s of j.unities or breeds of horses, all will certainty commend his theories as to breeding, for tiiey are based on tlie suaiid* st of cnmnmn sense and devoid of hobby tiding in favnr of anything but a sound and handsome animal, whatever the breed. So. too, will horse- ! men generally agree with his estimate of the three.quai leK-brcd hunter—that he is the “ best all-around horse in the world," and that while " th*- Englishmen have the best hunters, the American breeds the best saddle horse in the world." That saddle horse is, of course, the Kentucky or Tennessee type, and not " the Eastern horse with his high-school gait— a perversion of taste,” th£t, fortunately,
finds a 'habitat only in and about the New York riding schools and-horse shows —never about the home of the man who knows what a good horse nnd an easy saddler really Is, an animal of the Denmark or Black Squirrel type.
There is so much of hard-headed horse sense in this volume of Prof. Ro'berts’s, when he confines himself lo the writing of breeding, selection, feeding, training, and driving horses, that it seems a pity that it cannot -be placed in the hands of every young farmer and farmer’s son in the country. Compliance with the instructions it eontains would mean better horses generally, and his theories carefully followed would add millions to the wealth of the country. What ho has to '.say about the driving or riding of horses should be committed to memory by every man or woman who has the handling of horses, for he very truly holds In that chapter that ** hands" are something that the average American knows nothing whatever of, and that of all fundamentals that is the most necessary to the proper manipulation of man's best friend.
CHARLES TRACY BRONSON.
HINTS ON HORSES.
In this book Capt. C. M. Gonne, R. A., tells how to judge horses, how to buy them, ride them, drive them, and depict them. He attempts to answer in simple language, and with the aid of pictures, such questions as What are the points of a horse? WhaL are the things to look for and what are the things to avoid? How am I to .tell a good horse when I see one? &c. As he points out in his brief introduction, the book makes no pretense to deal with tho subject exhaustively. It is the result of many years of personal intimacy with the horse and of careful observation of his proportions, his movements. and his habits.
The volume deals with the measurements of the horse, the head, knees, legs, hoor.s. mane, mouth, eyes, tail, thigh, fetlock, movements, amble, &c.; there are hints on docking, trimming, breaking, and in conclusion ('apt. Gonne has added a few notes on riding, driving, and harness. The volume is issued by E. P. Dutton & Co. Tlie illustrations consist of photographic reproductions and fae similes of pencil drawings by the author.
