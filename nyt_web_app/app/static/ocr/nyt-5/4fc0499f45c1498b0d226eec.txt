Charles Scribner's Sons are publishing : this week.the first three volume of the j new biographical edition of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson, each volume with a biographical note by Mrs. Stevenson. They are: " Kidnapped/’ '* David Balfour," and " The New Arabian Nights." i *' Kidnapped,” Mrs. Stevenson writes in : the preface, ** was suggested after her I husband stopped collaborating with W.
[ *E. Henley in writing plays. Stevenson and his wife were looking over some old I records of trials in the Old Bailey during 1700. Among the papers was one describe Ing the trial of James Stewart fur the murder of a man, which Steven&on “ r«ad I with avidity.*’ He used much of the story in the record for *■ Kidnapped,” besides taking out the character of Alan Rreck*
** David Balfour,’’ the sequel to ■* Kidnapped," was written in very " distracting circumstances*” Mrs. Stevenson says:
With the natives on the veree of war, -and amid the most kaleidoscopic i>olitical changes, uncertain as to what moment his personal liberty might be restrained, hit* every action, misconstrued and resented by the white inhabitants of tho island, the excitement and fatigue of my husband’s dally life ' might have seemed enough for any one man to endure without the additional strain of literary work.
The stories In ** New Arabian S?lght3/' we are told* first appeared in a journal called ** London/* edited by "W. K. Henley, which had been launched by Hohert Glasgow Brown at the time when Stevenson and his cousin,' Robert Alan Stevenson, ” a genius bo unusual,” as Mrs. Stevenson calls him, had formed the plots i of ** The Suicide Club,” ** The Rajab*t Diamond/’ "The Hansom Cab,” *,rJhe Dynamiter/’ and “ Prince Otto.” The ! tales appeared in the London magazine, together with various pieces of verse by Henley and Stevenson, but the journal was doomed to failure. “ The New Arabian Nights/* writes Mrs. Stevenson, for some five or six years ** lay hidden between the covers of the defunct journal. Mr. Keegan Paul advised against their republication, thinking the talvs too fantastic, and likely to injure the reputation of their author. There was not a pingU story, poem, article, or novel ’ written by my husband that was not similarly condemned by some one ot his fricncto and literary advisers/’
