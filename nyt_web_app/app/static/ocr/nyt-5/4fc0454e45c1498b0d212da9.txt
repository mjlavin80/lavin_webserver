Essays by Vernon Lee-
THE ENCHANTED WOODS AND OTHER ESSAYS ON THE GENIUS OF PLACES. 33y Vernon Lee. Cloth, 8vo. Pp. X.-321. New York:	Jobn Lane.
Very charming are the essays in Vernon Lee’s latest book, " The Enchanted Woods.” They are not very deep; many of them are quite superficial, but they arc charming, and if not full of thought themselves, may easily cause thought in those who read them. A “ ragbag,’' their author calls her book, in a letter of dedication; “ take this new ragbag of impressions with you nest time, my dear,1' she writes to a friend, “ ♦ * * and pull out some of the contents at random. For the only justification of ray idle wanderings is if their sunshine and' romance may amuse, for a moment, people more useful, though not more willing, than myself.”	'
Vernon Lee has lived many years in Italy, and most of the essays in the new volume deal with aspects of Italian life. But we are inclined to think that those referring to non-Italian subjects are more interesting1.
Take this little divagation on travel, from the essay which gives its name to the volume—an essay, by the way, that recalls to some extent Kenneth Graham’s wonderful children’s stories, ” In the Golden Days.”
My gTGwing belief is that tho journeys richest in pleasant memories are those undertaken accidentally, or under the stress of necessity; moreover, that the most interesting places are those we stray into, or just deflect toward, as we wander for the sake of friends or work, or even in humbler quest of cheapness of living cr economy of health. * * • As we continue to live, and see more of our own and other folks’ lives behind, or along3id*3 of us, there arises a dim comprehension of some mysterious law by which the good things of life, all the happiness—nay, the very power of being happy—are not life’s aims, tut life’s furtherance, and their truo possession depends on willing and uncalculating response to life’s manifold and changing beckonings and behests.
*	* * ah wo can do, while thus traveling we know neither whence nor whither, is to keep our eyes clear, our feet un-deflleu, to drop as much useless baggage as possible, and fil'T’our hands with the fruits and herbs, sweet or salutary, of the roadside.
The author lai'£hs sometimes at the Germans, but she can appreciate them, too. Her ridicule is not bitter. They possess, she notes, ■* a genius for contemplation of an aesthetic, sentimental, yet homely kind.” And this genius Vernon Lee finds responsible for much that is beautiful in Germany.
It is thia spirit of roast veal in ruined castles and coffee and cinnamon cake In haunted forest glades which accounts for the Alpine landscapes and charming household details of Durer and the little masters; accounts also for the lovable side of rough, dogmatic old Martin Luther; and nowadays for whatever Is sane in the genius of Wagner. * • • The Germans enjoy themselves through several senses at once, in a confused, suffused, permeating manner which does away with definite images and thoughts, (and hence with literature and the plastic arts as an adequate expression,) but accumulates a vast bulk of indefinable emotion. Their feeling for the Rhine is typical of this. • * * You cannot paint the Rhine; you cannot even describe it. But you can set the Rhine to music. And as she has done by the Rhine, so Germany has done by all her deep, inexplicit emotion, making those Indefinable moods of hers, sensual and spiritual at once, melancholy yet pleasant, into music, complex and yet perfectly fused, inde-: finable and soul-subduing as they.”
Vernon Lee hates to see what she knows i she ought to see. She is unconventional in that respect. Thus, when she should«d have been '* doing ” the French Exposi- 1 | tion of 1900 she was exploring the “ Left i i Bank ” of the Seine—she is conventional 1 enough to think that she has discovered | that place herself. The " pleasantest and ! (such is human perverseness!) the most : suggestive impression ” she derived from , Mont St. Michel was the insistence of j her landlady, whom she had not seen ; during her Btay, that the maid should put a little orange flower water in a glass of water the author had asked for.
There used to be rules of grammar—* i that relatives must have antecedents; that a sentence tnust contain a verb; that
