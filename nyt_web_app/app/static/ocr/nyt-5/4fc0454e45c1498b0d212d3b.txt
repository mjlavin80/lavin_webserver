Every new book of Dr. Mttcfiell's is eagerly awaited by a large and appreciative circle of his old readers and enthusiastically welcomed by them when it finally appears. Not only does he alI ways have a good story to tell, but he tells it in a way to deligbt the lovers of a | beautiful style. Famous for his charac-tt-^'ttmwing, he has a rich store of medical | I experience from which to choose odd and unusual people, ** Constance Trescot " Is ! not a candidate for the fame of the Great i | A.merican Novel, as many claimed for 1
Hugh Wynne,” but it is a worthy sue- I j cosior of ■' Characteristics.’1 It will be I the more welcome that it never appeared in a serial form.
I Constance Trescot has the title role and the principal part, but one feels a little as : though she had usurped both from her I sister, Susan Hood, who, it is easy to see, is the author’s favorite character.
I Her face had * * • great power of expressing both kindliness and mirth. She •was slight, but of admirable figure, and possessed the mysterious gift of grace. For the rest, she was unselfish, seriously religions, and perplexed at times by the , comic aspect of things, hardly realizing the fact that a ready sense of humor had often been as useful in helping her to endure the lessor trials of existence as tho religious faith which she hold to with the simple trust of a child. L,ife presented itself to her in a relentless simplicity, and consisted of things rfght and things wrong, with oversensitive self-reproach when either seemed too amusing. She was, socially speaking, fearless, and occasionally outspoken to a degree which embarrassed others, but never Susan 1 Hood.
■* There are no better judges of men than old maids and slsters-Jn-law,’* she tells Major Trescot; “they look down from a heaven of neutrality where there is no giving in marriage." " To the very humorous love comes with difficulty,” says Dr. Mitchell. But it Is her saving sense of humor that prevents her from sinking under the dull platitudes of her ! childishly obstinate old uncle, Rufu3 : Hood, who claims that the right of States i to secede was based on the undoubted I right of individuals to secede from States.
. It is her solid common sense that res-I cues her from the incubus of her unrea-i sonably selfish sister Constance.
The book falls naturally into two parts; the first shows us Constance, the wife j who loves her husband with a singleminded intensity almost terrifying to wit-I ness. She is one of those women, ** hap; plly rare,” who desires to absorb, so to speak, all of the thoughts and feelings of the one man, and who, as time goes on, becomes 4calous of his friends, and even of his work, and, at last, of every bour not given to her.
The second part is a most absorbing psychologic study of Constanfce, the widow, whose every faculty is bent on making life a hell on earth for the murderer of her husband. Her ingenuity In devising fresh methods of torture for her victim, her strictly rational and coldblooded avoidance of the dangers of monomania, betray the physician in the author. Another delicate study of the travail and growth of a human soul is the unfortunate villain, Greyhurst, a lovable character at bottom, but forced by the logic of events Into a hateful, and finally a villainous and tragic situation.
