The/point I wish to make Is that I very seldom respond to efforts on the part of the author to produce tears; but sometimes the very gayest scenes will have that effect, perhaps by way of contrast, but usually by some far-fetched suggestion.	w.	B. W.

New York Times Book Iicnieir:
Surely, confessions of the quiet tears we have shed in our solitude over books would be most searching psychological testimony, did we but tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth on the subject. But, as might be expected, so far the correspondents have all agreed on almost the same books and scenes, and those have all been too obviously meant for tears. I imagine I have something new to say on the subject, and would like above all to hear If any 6ne else can add to my experience, and perhaps explain it. Be It noted at the outset that, although | my sympathy is -warmly with Russia In the present war, that conflict did not, consciously at least, enter my mind in connection with the following-:
The last thing in a book that made my 1 eyes fill with tears wa3 a description of j a cavalry parade on the Field of Mars in J St. Petersburg, ln Alexander Verestcha-j gin’s ** At Home and in War.*' No author could a(m less at sensational effects; no , author could tell his tale more simply, even dryly. He was then in a military school, and It was the lines of those fresh youths, in gay uniforms, but on rather : Indifferent chargers, that he particularly mentioned. It was just at the words " waving white plumes " that my heart swelled so that I was compelled to stop my reading for a long time. I think that was the effect, not so much of what I read as of the association of ideas it called forth. In the space of a second I saw those lines charging in battle, saw them rushing on, with fierce, set faces, before so rosy, young, and smiling; saw them clashing against the enemy with i horrid, barbaric yells, or deadly, cruel silence, more terrible still; and the next i moment, with horrid clash and din, crushed, bloody, torn, tumbled; and then stark and dead.
The picture in the book had exactly the l same effect on me as the strains of Sousa’s march, " Under the Double Eagle"; that depicts tho Field of Mars , in every note, the festal array of a cav-airy parade, sunshine, and youth. But by both is also suggested to me that fine ! scene in Tolstoy’s ‘‘ War and Peace," where Nikolai Rostof, on staff duty at Austcrlltz, Is crossing a field between the lines of the enemy and his own army, and the heavy Cavalier Guards come charging on, to cross his path, he barely escaping being crushed with his small horse under their onward rush toward 1 the enemy; and seeing them afterward , all but annihilated. They suggest the one animated line In Von Moltke's " Franco-I German War," where he describes the Hanoverian Uhlans, at Mars-Ia-Tour, being unexpectedly supported by a squadron of the Dragoon Guards, who “ on their return from a reconnaissance, plunging over fences and ditches, fell
■	upon " the French lancers In the flank. Also the terrible cavalry m$16es going on there during those four days.
But above all, they both suggest what I seems to me the saddest thing in all the world: The beaten soldier, in hiding, alone, after the fierce conflict, his own i fierce excitement dead, his cause lost, his comrades lost, his faith lost, for the time at least, in himself and In everything else, in heaven and on earth. Could ever a man more wish himself dead on the battlefield with the others! I can remember or imagine nothing more stirring In literature than the extremely simple account of such a soldier, a tall, fierce French cuirassier, one of the few survivors of Bonnemain's division after the battle of Woerth. in Erckmann-Chat-Han's *' Plebiscite.**
I am haunted by a vague remembrance of a scene very similar, in even simpler and fewer words, In Grote’s “ History of Greece," almost quoted, I believe, after Thucydides. It mentions a last, lost foot soldier, hiding in a small wood after one of the battles in tho Peloponnesian wars, I believe. No historian can well be more unimaginative ^than.
