Veto TorJc Times Book Rrcletc:
Vour correspondent S. A. Bender in the issue of April 29 wrote in a commendatory vein of " Two Practical Heroines.** So far as the merit of the story and the bea.nty of the author’s diction are concerned I coincide with his opinion, but I cannot bring myself to feel that the character of Viola is a natural product of any clime. Her virtue is abnormal. Her view of the proper course is not that of the young woman jus I arrived at the age of romantic impulse.
Duty preconceived becomes a soluble quantity under the ardent, forceful pressure of a natnre attuned to love. This remarkable character is far beyond my conception of the ** real ’* young woman.
I wish to enter a woman's protest. This picture of Viola, representing her as superior to every Inclination and prompting of her nature as originally implanLed, must surely have had its origin in the author’s imagination.	A. G. GRErY-
