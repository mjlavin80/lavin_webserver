Our cable dispatch, last week announced the forthcoming publication ot a new Life of Moltgre \>y H. Trollope, a son of Anthony Trollope. Pew of us remembered probably that Trollope, when he died, in 1882, left two sons, for neither has been known, hitherto, as an aspirant for literary fame. There is room for an Engllsl* Life of Moli&re, as there is none now in print, so far as we know, except the biographical sketches accompanying: translations of his works and in encyclopaedias, and the book by Mrs- Oliphant and F. Tarver, published in 1879. Few of the French* .biographies are satisfactory.-The way is clear for a coherent, sympathetic book on the great comed1an*s caret}, based on the knowledge of the man-gained'through recent research.
