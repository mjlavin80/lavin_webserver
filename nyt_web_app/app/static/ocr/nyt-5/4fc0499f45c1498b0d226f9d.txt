As writers of romantic literature Agnes and Egtrton Clastle have long ago won their spurs. In their' latest Dook they have lost none of their brilliancy of description; the hot splendor of India and the quiet coolness of a deserted English country hoitrc are contrasting enough scenes for their skill. The story itself deals with the tardy awakening of a woman’s soul from an apathy almost deathlike to acute feeling,	-
As a girl Rosamond Temple had married Capt.
