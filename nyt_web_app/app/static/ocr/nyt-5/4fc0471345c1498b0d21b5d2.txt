N a resent number of yourv paper I asked to be told “ where -I •was'at.” I asked t6 l>e~p!aced:IIke a fly on a : pin; accompanied by the" proper label; in order that I might;’ on: being interrogated, give forth tjhe 'proper answer. I have it now! In Other words, I know now! I am a drab-Colored American moth that is flying about a dazzling and begemmed candlestick intricately carved,'all filijgree-and gold, iiv the central cup: cf which reposes a; cleverly molded candle fashioned out of’ the worst of waxy refuse and colored with'the commonest*of aniline materials, r know, too, now, that the candle burns Tsritti a 'pale, sickly light, which is blue &id-fascinating. reminiscent of a jack o' lantern c.eoping ov'er an ivv-covered grave, followed by a general phosphorescence resultant to"‘the-decaying (<>r c’eca-1 dence) of a body cr the clammy nothingness of a spectral''form.
; Yes. I frying about this flame. I can . remember now .as I flew toward this flame of evil I met a moth coming out"
(a European species) whose \vl::gs still smelled of ‘-Violate contact they had had.

*' Brother," said I, “ I thank thee and will return’ thy favor. As thou wilt fly without I pray thee beware of something lately spread to catch the common f'y, and known, brother, as r fly paper. 1c is thickly covered w*th the sticky, vlsJii stuff formed of the ingredient? cf the historical novel, the * pcpular ovtr a night’ romance, the Wall Street’s biogra-

“'Wherever we spe^.k of immorality or evil we will pleasantly mark it, so-that all good people will not mix evil up vith good, and thereby sin and be1 made unhappy/ The sweetening dr^rv^s great hordes'of flies—they come in twenty editions and a half million readers—who r^ad and intellectually buzz tnemselves into a sordid oblivion.	.

For a flame kills, and perhaps Henry James has been thft downfall of some man who b'echought the first,French dancer he met was a duplicate of Mrae. de Vionnet In “ The Ambassadors.*'
But, oh! the countless thousands that have been sent to a dusty doath following false standards of conduct fr.thioned by novel writers who had their I^croes and heroines made of such superior ctcff that anything short of an *' Immortal ” w&^ld havfe declined to‘play the parts were they eventually dramatized. Women, mothers, there are who send Uieir daughters on their honeymoons believing that marriage is a Summer sea on which they will sqfl in a lovely, chastely carved boat. wonder girls’ h^?rfs are broken. Yes, the mother wns a well-meaning woman, but that doesn't mend a heart.
No novelist can hope for der-thless fame in this age unless he faithfully portrays-the mental phase accurate!5'. Dickons' portrayed the e^ery-day workings men and women. T*Uh an ur^uing f;JeiIty. They raiWd a^inst him at the time for throwing mud at ^he established <—der. Just so slavery was once practiced bytnose of “ trained iind judicial ” rilnds, ft<id the few who opposed it were shouted down by; the elect. To-day there are mental crimes to expose ?nd punish, Gagins in the minds, not tidies. We have evolved beyond Dickens, George Eliot, snd Ccott. charming as they are. Men’ and women who write to reach the front ranks in the procession’ must depict every phase of a character cr step-Cown and out, hissed from tl’ie stage. A novel that chows rot the character sinning, (and every one of
-	us sins,) as well ps clothed in our Tietter' robes, is false, "here is a c^y against one-sided fcograpny now. Sc .he day it,' too, will have *0 present si:i as well as goodness. We all know a iovel should only be a seriss of intricately ambroid-' ered and correctly stated biographies. We cry out for frankness? Do we reailv want ii—in our friends, in ourselves; or in those Hint write for 'us?
To express the mind's doings cne has to be clever. And groat truths are always intricate, else why would it be necessary for theologians to wrangle over Christ’s ! sayings? A good thing, a simple thing, is i alv.rays paradoxically’clever and brilliant, ! and nearly always is pronounced either evil, immoral, or a f&nure until it ls- understood. Joan of Arc was lately cssron-ized. Wagner is just -being1 born to the , world. The next century will be the one to know that Henry" James was r.ot immoral in his writings. Why ere we'always looking for the evidences of the “ Decameron ** or ' the' ’ " Rubaiyat ” in every clevei* thing read? Isn’t; it a
•	low aim? Why, tc hear-the way the wind blows at times one almost'looks to hear
that when Henry James lectures”' upon Balzac he means only ihe“ Droll Stories.” .;
'James Lane Allen; in 4* The Mettle' of ■; the Pasture," asked that we young'Ailier-lcans try for a better moral plane* as -he mettle of our National trait. I^et us pray , It ^will come throiiSh knowledge, not faar, *ike the two IHtle l^.ys, c-ne of whom touched not tho tart jelly because of fBar of his mother's law, while ther other <ZMn’t ‘because he s-ld he had t**sted t>.e jolly, ana while he’could eat it,:-there were lots of other things in the pantry he wanted more. Sorre of us wun't read .hooks because of the evil in' them—this "laws "w;H break if v,e read them, while-others pick up and enjoy t^em; never looking for the suggestion of evil, because; arter all; It Is only tart .Jelly, and in the bookish-pa-ntry' there are so many other things. I hope Americans ■will make of our literature -just what we have made (*( our Katfonal iball game, the cleanest, finest, Severest yame in the world. You can be offended at a ball game; but if you’re normal you wsn’t.
Thls: sniffing of the *air: fort evil, this perceiving of a malappropriation of tho •temples of the mind and body in the lives of all the new oharacters- in our fiction, is the very force that is impoverishing the strength of its blood ahd tilnning its sorpuscles. Kor a character In :flctl6n js worse off than a real c_sie in life; it can’t ?iren prove an alibi. How can a nian call himself an optimist and at the same time believe high mentalities soar only for the lowest of aims, to sneer, and that they . fly toward the most commonplace goal of j life, an astigmatic perceiving and viewing of the laws that govern propagation of spocies. Svery phase of life knows about every conceivable method cf breaking th*1 “social la-sr," and why great novelists should think of writing novels to gratify .ttelr propensities to sneer,'(a thing any schoolboy does at the s®lf-same thing,) and at the same timft present in a dazzling,' bewildering vra.y one of the commonest things that Eappen, is b^yend me to for a moment entertain.
Go into the amphitheatre'cf a first-class medical school during a surgical cUnic. zicposed to the \ lew of a couple of hun-rired men may be the poor, Cured body of
■	s'jme frail woman of the streets undergoing a critical operation, for which hap-^ pily she will be charged nothing that shall deplete her slender parse. Are-fthose students spoiled cr rendered coa/se, by that sight? Axe they making ribald jests or vtilgar remarks? Are they having their moral edge dulled? No, they are not. It is;part of life that they should ree and do * these things, and, strange to'-eay,' while" that very woman‘mdydgtire in :the ddwn-j fall of one of them 'a, month later, shte is nothing but a source' of help and strength to them to-day, albeit not without s'lffer-
i.’ig and exposure. Why can’t we Americans be that way with literature? Why ^an't we have the mettle of the pasture
1 ii! us to took on life dissected and realize
.that it is for* cur proficiency and our good? Ah, why can't we be superior to this looking iar evil?
Is a delicate dissector Kke-Edith Wharton writing “The Sanctuary” to sooll us? Is Henry James writing about tSat loveliest of all women, Milly Theale, in order to pollute us young Americans? The subtlest of mother’s loves was never more' oeautifully ueoicted from' any1 pulpit in -the land than in “ The Sanctuary." The greatest of martyrdoms in literature, that of Milly Theale, who laid dawn her Life for her friend, was meant to be a lovely .imitation of Christ by 'a clear, delicate American girl, who counted her own as nothing. Perhaps • we read these things' too fast at1 times, perhaps we-approach them to be amused, perhaps only to criticise, perhaps only to say we can read them. Anyway, if tSacir authors wFBte them flippantly, and we can in the reading extract beauty; why are we not to do1 .it^ It may be some of the disci pies codded as they1 wrote, but still God's hand made the result perfect I say this, if Jimes, Wharton, ai.d their disciples be decadents, then may I join the choir, invisible that sings where they ^l .'slng in what's boyond.
