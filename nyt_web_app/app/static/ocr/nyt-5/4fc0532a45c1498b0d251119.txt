Published originally in 1873, these essays of the late Sir Leslie Stephen have a modernness and a freshness which will t'ommend them to the many who have not lead them before. They are introduced hero by two papers (both originally printed in The (Quarterly Review)—one biographical, written by James Bryce; the other critically appreciative, written by that other historian, Herbert W. Paul. However, ft is safe to say that more wili be learned of Stephen by reading his own essays than can be gathered from these rather dry lucubrations of his admirers. The reader will get a positive sense of exhilaration as he passes from the last sentence of Mr. Paul's paper on Stephen to the first sentence of Stephen’s paper I on *' The Broad Church.” It is a quick change from dead words to living words.
Most people know that Sir Leslie Stephen began by being a Scotsman and a clergyman at Cambridge, ana that he presently gave up his holy orders to become what is called a ” free thinker." The virile articles here bound together are those in which the free thinker, with singular fairness and vigor, applies plain speech to the peculiar situation in which the Christian religion finds itself tn the present age. He discusses (he so-called Broad Church ” in England, particularly the range of unbelief In the litern 1 meaning of the formal articles of the Church which is allowable in a clergyman, i the real nature of the ** Broad Church " attitude ...toward the sundry scientific | methods and doctrines ^of the time—espe- ! cially Darwinism —the difficulties, in short, which fire-involved in ‘‘the fruitless endeavor to force new truth into the old meld." To Stephen’s mint] the whole business is as if one should say he believed in witches, only straightway to ex- j plain that witchcraft was not a. diabolic power, hut a diseased mania. That, of course, is merely a roundabout way of j asserting a disbelief in witches tn any real sense.
