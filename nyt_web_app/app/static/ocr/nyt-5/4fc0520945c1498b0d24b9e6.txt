Keto York Times Hook Rcvietc:
In ” The Color Line.” a book written by Prof. William Benjamin Smith of Tu-lane University, at New Orleans. La., and recently issued from the press of McClure, Phillips & Co., New York, there Is a constant use of the term ** Mulatto,” (Page 68;) “ Negro,” (Page 60;) "Negroid.” (Pages 170 aad 172;) Colored,” (Page 165;) “African," (Page ISO;) "Blacks." (Page 17.*?,) and “ Afro-Amer-lean.” (Page 18ti,) ail of which. It is presumed, have a reference to the descendants of the black African race living in the United States of America, and the words are capitalized by the Southern university professor. Do these terms express certain definite ideas, or do they all mean the same thing? The gentleman who uses them doubtless believes them to be synonymous terms, whereas in their generally accepted meaning and usage each expresses an idea which is definite in itself, which, when used interchangeably, are liable to convey an ambiguous meaning.
1.	Hence the word " mulatto.” when referred to the non-Caucasian or non-Indian races in America, is rather a descriptive word. It implies the idea associated with the complexion or color of an individual’s skin, or a collection of such individuals. By no stretch of the imagination or process* of reasoning, when tho word ‘ mulatto " Is used by the ethnologists, do they mean the offspring of a black person and a white person. It is rather descriptive of a portion of the ten million inhabitants of the United States, and it includes but a very small proportion of our American negroes.
2.	The same Tiay be said of the word *’ blacks." which Is a descriptive appellation, the same as the word “ white,” neither of which, as a rule, is ever capitalized. The evident conception in the mind of the author is a race of people who are non-Caucasians, living in America. presumably negroes, and it Is an imposition upon the English language to use the word in a sense other than what It properly signifies, namely, the darkest of all color. While the historian Froude and a few other writers have used the word to designate a black-skinned person, it does not accurately express the idea which It is intended to comprehend, namely, the non-Caucasian English-speaking people of Amerfca. some of whom are mulaltoes. quadroons, and octoroons, who are regarded as non-Caucasian, and are not comprehended In the term *' blacks,"
3.	The word ** colored." when used to imply or include the negro race in the United Slates or British colonies, is also open to objection. Modern ethnologists do not use the word to designate a race of people. Grant that the word does mean a non-Caucasian or a dark-skin.ied race, it may include the Hindustanis of
India, Turks, Japanese, Chinese, as well as the ten million of non-Caucasian English-speaking peoples of this hemisphere who may be “ wholly or in part of African descent.” The Malay of the Philippine Inlands is as much colored as the colored man " in America, yet the thousands of Japanese, Chinese, and other dark-skinned colored people are not comprehended in the term colored. The word, while it is a convenient term to use, nnd expresses certain ideas, is nevertheless scientifically inaccurate because it Is not a definite ethnological term expressive of definite racial characteristics and affinities.
4.	Another word which has been largely used to express ideas identified with the ” colored people in America," which has been used to include in its meaning the non-Anglo-Saxon element of the American population, not including the aboriginal inhabitants. Is the word “African." .Vs an ethnological term this word has not retained its original significance, which, according to its generally accepted meaning, signifies a native or Inhabitant of Africa, a black man, a negro. Archbishop Trench In his little book “ On the Study oT 'Words ” tells us that there is a good deal of knowledge conveyed by the history of words, and that the meaning of words, like the fashions of society, are constantly undergoing changes. So also with" this word ‘'African." In the Cape of Good Hope, the erstwhile Orange Free State, and the South African Republic are thousands and thousands of white people who were born, reared, and educated, and who reside in those places. They arc inhabitants of Africa. The iate -Paul Kruger, eje-President Steyn, and Gen. Cronjo are native Inhabitants of Africa. They were*;

of oth er'white peopl e, are; therefdreboria- . fide Africans,'" So that a" white 'Africa nowadays is not an anthropological anomaly.	. .	a .	. .	/
5.	“ Negroid ’*' is * another ^-term which, according to the Standard Dictionary, is-defined as ” resembling negroes," but the term- does not include :!n;its comprehon- . slon the negroes of. tho United States of America. A resemblance to' is ‘not identical with a ra6o. When the word was first used by Prof, Huxley, and later.by/ our own Dr, Brin ton and other«fJUneri-\ cans, they referred to certain tribcs 'or.-races inhabiting the Polynesian anfl-Fhll* . ippine Jslands, and the word ls 'fiever^ meant to Include the dark-skinned Aryans of the United States.
a Prof. Smith also uses the term “ Afro-American ” to designate the non-Caucaslari element of this country* It means, according to the Standard Dictionary, an 'American of African descent. This term is ambiguous because there are thousands and colonies of white people in America, who are settling In America, from the Boer republics. They are just as much Afro-American as the *‘ colored people ” among whom they are now settling. Again we have the anomaly of a " white African ” living in America.
The only term, then, which the ethnologist and linguist may use, having a clear and definite racial meaning, Implying prognathous maxillaries, a prominent zygomatic arch, a dolichocephalic skull, and all the other distinguishing characteristics of the race, which include all shades, all grades of racial affinities and racial singularities, a word which differentiates (Itself from all other words, which is not indefinite or ambiguous in its terminology, a word that will include all the non-Caucasians in America and the world, is the one simple, little word ** negro.”	JAMES	M. BODDY.
