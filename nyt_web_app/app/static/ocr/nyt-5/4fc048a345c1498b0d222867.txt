BALZAC AND JAMXS.
An Impression of the Art of the Author of “The Golden Bowl,” Suggested by His Lecture on the Author of the “ Comedie Hu-maine/’
Written for The New York Times Book Review by ELISABETH LUTHER CARY,
HE audiences wlio have listened this year to the lecture of Mr. Henry James on Balzac have enjoyed a peculiar privilege quite apart from their interest in the subject or the speaker. They have been taken frankly into the workroom of art; they have been addressed with the air of high comradeship, the assumption of interests and adventures in common, the confidence in the response of initiated minds, with which a painter or musician or writer addresses his fellows in the art he practices. It was a very fortunate note to strike, recalling the intimate relation between speaker and audience so seldom revived since the great “ citizen of the world ** g;£ye his interrogatory lectures in the Greek gymnasia; and certainly in no other way could the layman have been made so clearly to feel the dignity, scope, and poignant interest of the art of fiction.	'
The lecture itself is not yet properly subject for' discussion, remaining as it still , does a matter of echoing remembered phrases, free from the bondage^ of the printed page. It is enough to say of it that it opens a wide window through which the irre^ sponsible general reader may catch glimpses of the responsibilities attending a serious novelist, and that it forms the occasion for the attentive special reader to ask certain questions concerning contemporary fiction—what ground it covers, how rich it may be in impressions and suggestions of life, whether it is large or small in spirit, closely knit or loose in texture; whether It is filled with moral and artistic energy, or whether, like the languid angels of Ferugino, it floats drowsily in space; whether it reaches the deeper issues of human existence or pauses timidly on the stout surface of the obvious; whether it has the beauty of truth or merely the prettiness of soft and shallow idealism.
For the professional critic there is a danger in the attempt to answer these questions, pertinent as they are to all works of genuine quality; a danger composed of false perspectives, restrictive limitations, short views, distorted views,;' blind views. The innocent reader, however, intelligently curious * as to why he likes what he likes, is distinctly at an • advantage; he may in his .privacy make without vanity the great assumption that he is equal to the analysis; he may drive straight at it with an ex, hilarating freedom from diffidence, with perhaps a I comforting sense of belonging to the mighty public ! by which the ultimate decision is made; and should he arrive at even a dim perception of the animating intention in the work upon which he has been feeding and of the extent to which mastery has been achieved in it, he is bound to be at least himself the happier for his knowledge. There is the’ charmed sense for him as of a pleasant secret between him and his author.
The work of Mr. James, particularly that of these later years, invites such analysis almost with insistence and by the very intricacy of Its art. Elusive in more than one direction, it is nowhere more so than in its evasion of labels. Call it in any instance the novel of manners, and In the same instance it is perceived to be a record of spiritual. forces; call It the novel of society and it puts on the, face of pure psychology; call it realism, and a re-^ flectlve imagination smiles out of it; call it poetic, and its-consideration of the actual becomes fairly a rebuking element. All this in harmonious combination suggests nothing but life, and it is indeed only as a representation of life, of life on and beneath the surface, that we can with profit to ourselves discuss it. What commonly is forgotten by the careless or, indifferent reader is the fact that it is modern life, that it is life studied and reproduced in the presence of the model, not in accordance with old traditions but in pursuit of a new tradition, more flexible,. more inclusive, and more exacting, to which the novels of the early Victorian period with their great qualities, bear something the same relation as that borne by the novels of Thomas Nash to those. of George Eliot. Twenty years ago Mr.. James, writing of Daudet, reminded us that

plicated as the world grows older: “ It needs,” he said at that time, “ a more and more patient art,, a closer notation,, to divide it into its parts.” We have only to: rush ,to extremes and ask our-: selves how much of the truth of our century such a method as that of the “ Beowulf ” could convey to us to persuade ourselves that the complexity of our modern society cannot .be-xeduced in its portraiture to abroad., simplicity. The art of letters, since it Is neither so simple nor so formal, neither so limited nor so abstract as the art of painting, has in such portraiture a chance so extended as to make the exclusive application to it of the rules of its sister art an absurdity. . The - fiction of th&, present to be life-enhancing or even life-communicating . must inevitably consist of a multitude of close observations of appearances behind "which ’works the Imaginative and constructive intelligence. So, at all events, one must infer from the .large vacancy that exists for the alert reader in modern fiction from which these observations are' absent, as well as from the confusion that exists where they are present without the competent co-ordinating intelligence to animate them into more than merely galvanic movement, and to unite them in a composite significance.
If the inference is not unjust it is obvious that mastery in fiction implies to-day a richer product than it implied fifty or sixty years ago. It implies more labor on the part of the analyst, a .more implicit devotion, a more positive dedication to his task. It might be said that Balzac, writing more than fifty or sixty years ago,-was as completely.as possible dedicated to his task, but as a matter of fact he was dedicated only to a part of it. A large area of life was smothered for him by superimposed appearances, through. which, with all his intellect-, ual energy, he was unable to penetrate. His colossal edifice has empty corners and blank spaces which are against its making at every point the indefinable enchanting impression .of. a.house that has leen' “"lived in." With his

clou sly defined as one of the lovely; Umbrian Madqnnas, conceived^ .by the; young Fiorenzojdi; Ikirenzo. An artist; —If we do not let Word imply, too wide a hospitality—should know betterr than a layman the difficulty of shaping a conception in strict conformity to the great laws of art without recourse to already accepted models, and no doubt it is. to, artists that we must Jopk for,' the most nearly adequate judgment of any work of hard-won beauty, especially any work that escapes from a classic tradition ..without losing the classic spirit.
For the rest of jus, however, who are occupied .with .art only at second-hand, -there seems to be;but one .question—
-	or one class, of ^uestions-^-to .ask of .a -novel:. Does it, give us pleasure, does it liberate us from a narrow or hackneyed mode of thought, does it open for the mind a broader- field of interest or show a new form, of beauty or truth? If it does, it serves our: simple purpose, which cannot reasonably be other than to get out of life as much as possible of enriching and enlarging experience. This claim for the work of Mr. James is made by the larger number of his attentive readers with a certain clear perception that if this tonic quality is present they are willing to take for granted the method that conveys It as sufficiently an | artistic method. When we are asked ! ! to consider the development of the I moral consciousness of such a child as , Maisie in an environment *which; presses with the weight of vice and , deception upon natural innocence and delicacy, we may require a degree of courage to face with the author the . facts involved, but only the tamest of; us can fail at the end to experience a thrill of exultation communicated by the lovely bursting into bloom of Maisie’s tortured moral sense, and an Impulse io cry bravo! to the com- j pie ten ess with which the actual nature of a child has been realized.	!
In “ The Golden Bowl" we are as far as possible removed from the hackneyed development of a theme responsible In the .world of literature for many failures and few successes. The contrast between Thackeray’s treatment of his Becky and Balzac’s treatment of his ValSrie formed a part of the text of Mr. James’s lecture, and if on our side we set ourselves to looking at Charlotte Stant in the light of her creator’s attitude toward her, we perceive how amply his sympathy has been given, not to her errors, but to her humanity and her struggle toward escape from the final doom. A study at once so pitiless and so pitiful it would be hard to match in fiction, and its brilliancy is enhanced by the deeper tenderness, the fuller benignity with which Maggie is made the embodiment of human kindness.
It will never be said of the art of Mr. James that its lessons are those which he who runs may read—perhaps the most amazing thing about it is the fact of its appearing in an age when so many pages of print are swallowed “ on the run.” But there is nothing less probable than that its interest will be exhausted by the present generation; nothing more to be counted upon than that it will to the future appear the most important achievement in fiction of the period it so subtly reproduces.

ments of human nature so important as to leave for some successor a new field. His all-encompassing .love of reality took insufficient account of the pressure of complex circumstances upon the individual soul. His divination stopped, in fact, at the door of the soul. At this door his sorcerer’s rod declined to bend, and he passed on, splendidly . unconscious that ..any region of speculation had refused him.
With the novels of Mr. James there Is the excitement for the adventurous mind of entering this new field, these undiscovered regions of reality. There is also the confidence that nothing less than reality will meet us. Sincerity is the sternest of masters, and when it is of the essence of an author’s work there are no lapses in fidelity to the thing seen. And if we have reality, have we also art? That is the question repeatedly asked concerning not only the work of Mr. James but the work of other analysts not so constantly guided as he by the imaginative vision. Have we composition, atmosphere, texture, organization, perspective, architectonic construction? Have we especially an artistic relation of values? Where these words are used not pedantically but with even a limited sense of their inspiriting significance they surely are not impertinent, although it may be a lively pleasure for the actual artist to get away from them in order to feel more richly and justly the very thing they represent; in order to feel as richly and justly as possible his art. It very well may be that only the actual artist, the man who has tried in one way or another to bring into being an organic product of art, can fully estimate the form and substance, color and value of an idea set forth as in such books as “ The Golden Bowl,” “ What Maisie Knew/* and “ The Awkward Age.” Certainly if one has grappled with any artistic medium, pigment or marble or words, and learned its power to co-operate and to betray, he would seem to be in better case than the uninitiated critic to appreciate the victory that consists in forming from imponderable elements a creature of visible character and tangible quality, a firm little figure like that or Nanda, of Maisie, or Maggie Verver, standing light and clear against a background of infinite complication; in an air thick with potential issifcs, as delicately poised, as gra-
