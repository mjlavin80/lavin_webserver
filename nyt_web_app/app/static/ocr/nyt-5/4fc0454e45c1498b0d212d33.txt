Kao York Times Boor, licvUw:
In The Review of April 20 a correspondent makes some comments on my letter concerning obscure literary allusions, He saya he wonders if I ever read ** Paradise Lost.” That is precisely iny ease with regard to him.
The story about the derivation of the name of Antwerp he gives is such a well-known one that it is to be found even in Baedeker’s Guide. I read it in Belgium twenty years ago. It is not the *' ludicrous ” one that Lowell had in mind when he wrote. And as to Gano, in the " Song of Roland,” he Is always Ganelon. What, then, was the object of applying an unusu&l form of his name to a Massachusetts Yankee except it was to mystify the reader?
The same may he said about his allusion to the wight that was tarred and feathered, The Roman's question ” Quid ad Mercuriam? ’’ can well be asked here.
Isaac D’Israeli has a chapter on “ Professors of Obscurity ” that is worth the reading, and Lowell himself said that there was ” nothing so simple but that Uncial letters and the style of Diphilus the Labyrinth could obscure."
In closing what 1 have to say for good and all I would not like to appear as one who underestimates Mr. Lowell. There is no more dignified figure than he fn our literature; and aa for the man I con say of him what he said of Edmund Spenser: “ He was so nobly pure; so far removed in every way from our common ancestor who swung by his tail from the limb of a tree”; but he belonged, as the editor of This book Review says, to a race of authors to whom recondite allusions were the very breath of literary life.
