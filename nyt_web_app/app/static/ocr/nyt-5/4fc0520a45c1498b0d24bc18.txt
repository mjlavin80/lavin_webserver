HE world over, only three medals are given for acts of bravery performed i?.. presence of an enemy, the Iron Cross of Germany, our. own Medal of Honor, and the British Victoria Cross. Of these the last named undoubtedly Sranks highest. Fifty thousand men got the Iron Cross after tho war with France; most of our medals of honor have been given for bravery, but others were given for sentimental reasons—the men who guarded or carried Lincoln's coffin re--ceived medals; some men had special act3 of Congress passed giving medals to them, and at leasf one man .took his medal without authority* but in the fifty years since the Victoria Cross was instituted only 520 men all told have received it. It Is hard to get; no act of Parliament will award it, no pull with the Sovereign as Fountain of Honor. One has to risk his life to get it, and if he goes wrong afterward it is likely to be taken from him. So one must be brave to win it and keep " fit ” to retain it—there can be no doubt about the Victoria Cross ranking the other medals bestowed for bravery.
A very interesting account of the 520 men who have won the cross has just bedn published by Mr. Philip A. Wilkins. It makes a good-sized volume of nearly 450 pages, with photographs of all the recipients that could be obtained, and besides the official notices of the acts for which the medals were bestowed, fuller accounts of the various brave deeds. Many of the acts were done to save life; some, and those fhe most exploited, to save the “ Queen’s colors,’’ or to defend guns. There Is a sort of sameness about the accounts, for even bravery may pall on one.
It is a wonderful list of brave men, that of the Victoria Cross. The decoration was instituted on Jan. 20, 1836, and its bestowal was made retroactive to the-beginning of the Crimean War. Mr. Lucas, mate on her Majesty’s ship Hecla, was the first person to, receive it, for throwing overboard a live shell which had fallen on the ship's deck. He is now a Rear Admiral retired. The first enlisted man to get the medal was Sergt. John ICnox of the Scots Fusiliers, who lost an arm at the Alma, but stayed in the army and died a Major in the Rifle Brigade. Sergt. Luke O’Connor of the Twenty-third Foot won the cross at the Alma for carrying the “ Queen’s colors ” when the bearer was killed, although he himself was wounded, .and when he retired, at the age of fifty-six, he held the actual rank of Major General.
Gen. O'Connor is not the only V. C. who rose from the ranks. ** Wullie ’’ McBean was another. He was an Invernesshire plowman when he enlisted in the Ninety-third Foot—the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. Because he rolled as- he walked the Drill Corporal abused him, and a friend suggested that he thrash the bully. ** Na, na, man,’* said McBean, “ that'll never do. A*m goin’ to command this regiment, an’ ’twould never do to be brought before the Colonel for thrashing the Drill Corporal.” McBean kept his word, becoming Major General, and commanding the regiment. He won the cross for killing eleven mutineers at one of the fights around Lucknow—a feat that reminds one of the Paladins or of a fairy story.
Four civilians have gained the cross— William McDonnell, a Magistrate, who cut out a boatload of fugitives from under the fire of the Sepoy mutineers; Ross Mangles, an Assistant Magistrate, who volunteered to help relieve an isolated post besieged by the Sepoys, and carried a wounded soldier on his back for six miles under a fire from the mutineers, stopping from time to time to keep the Sepoys at bay; Thomas Henry ** Lucknow ” Kavanagh, who made his way out of Lucknow through the mutineers’ lines with information for Sir Colin Campbell, and the Rev, John William Adams, who served with Sir Frederick Roberts in Afghan, and rescued two men from drowning under a fire from the Afghans.
Most famous of deeds that have won the Victoria Cross were the defense of Rorke’s Drift and the saving of the “ Queen's colors ” of the Twenty-fourth Regiment during the Zulu war of 1S70. By some error of judgment, Rorke’s Drift was abandoned except for 104 officers and men, and 35 sick men. Between 3,000 and 4,000 Zulus attacked the place on Jan. 23, the fight lasting for twelve hours without cessation. The defenders lost 17 men, the Zulus some COO.
Only a day previous the Zulus had attacked and wiped out the second battalion of the Twenty-fourth at Isandlwana. Lieuts. Melvill and Coghill were ordered

The roll of Victoria Cross wcarer3 contains an undue proportion of Irishmen. There are ninety-seven c"1 the fighting race, Kelly and Burke Shea,” on the' list, and probably a score of others .whose ; birthplaces arc not given—nearly a-quarter cf them all come from Ireland, ranking from private to Field Marshal. And three negroes have" received the decoration: William Hall, Captain of the Forc-top, H. M. S. Shannon, at Lucknow, while in Peel’s Naval Brigade; Samuel Hodge oi tho West India Regiment, and William Gordon of the same regiment. The cross was given last to Lieut, wauacc Wright' for gallantry during the Nigeria campaign of li)03, when he led 40 men against o,000 natives, driving them back and routing them.	.
During the Crimean war 111 men received the cross; the Indian mutiny won It for 1S2; 2 men got it during the Abyssinian campaign; 16 in Afghanistan, and 23 in Zululand, In 1S7S and 1S79, and 7S during the Boer war. The .navy has had 43 wearers of the decoration, while the Twenty-fourth Foot, now the South Wales Eorderers, has had 10 its men decorated.	man	has yet won the
cross a second time. Gen. Baldwin of our army holds two medals of honor fir gallantry—a record unique among the lighting men of the world probably.
