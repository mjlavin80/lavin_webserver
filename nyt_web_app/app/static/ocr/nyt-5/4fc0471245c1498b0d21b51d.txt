If this story illustrates any phase of life more than another it is the ease by which a wife and riches may be gained. The young hero, Walter Lythgoe, Is sent to the Greek islands-of the Mediterranean to Obtain for his uncle, the head of a prosper: ous baking ftowcler concern, all the crude cream of tartar he can finch A letter of introduction to an American missionary on one of the small islands admits him as a welcome guest. Prom this point to the i*nd of the volume his business is a mere Incidental. - He falls desperately in , love with the beautiful Greek servant girl employed in the missionary’s familv. Visitations with a Scotch student to an old monastery on the Island reveal the mystery of the girl’s life. She turns out to be an Italian Duchess, descended from an ancient family of Dukes and nobles whose fortune was confiscated by the monks years before when one of the old Dukes fled to the monastery for safety with his gold and jewels when his land^was devastated by war.	'
Needless to say, the young American baking powder agent and his Scotch friend
discover everything, the suspicious death of the Italian noble, and the presence 'of his treasure in the cells of the monastery. The^fecovery of the wealth against the cunning machinations of the monks supplies a number of exciting and tragic events to sustain interest in a story which otherwise is rather lightly worked out. 'The Greek servant girl, who has learned to love the American visitor, remains true to him when greeted with the information that she Is a Duchess, and. more satisfactory still, an heiress in the bargain. It is useless to ~ say that they arc married and everything ends in a blaze of happiness, and we hear nothing, more ot Walter Lythgoe's search for crude cream \)f tartar.	.
