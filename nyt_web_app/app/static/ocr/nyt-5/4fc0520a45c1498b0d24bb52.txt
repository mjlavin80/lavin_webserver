Mr. Sidney Low, in The London SJtandard, has ! been taking: to task both Rudyard Kipling and Frank Bullen for seeming to know nothing whatever of Herman Melville and *' Moby X>ick/’ which Mr. Low justly calls *' the splendid prose epic of the South Sea fishery/’ A new edition of Mr. Bullen’s admirable “ Cruise of the Cachalot ” has appeared in London, and simultaneously a letter to Mr. Bullen from Mr. Kipling, full of compliments to the book,-has been printed. Mr. Bullen is of the opinion that his book contains the first account of a cruise of a South Sea whaler from the seaman’s poiftt of view. And Mr. Kipling infers that no other book “has so completely covered the whole business of whale ■fishing, and at the same time given such real and new pictures.” Mr. Low urges both these gentlemen to make the acquaintance of Melville and his ** Moby I>ick ’* without delay. Melville’s book, by the way, is out of print in England, though it still may be obtained here. We trust that Mr. * Low’s sensible remarks may soon lead to the early publication of a new English edition.	"
