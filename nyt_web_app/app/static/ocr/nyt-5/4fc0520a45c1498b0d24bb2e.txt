THE BRITISH EMPIRE
The Hon. George Peel supplements his book on The Enemies of Eng* d land " with a second on ** The Friends of England,” for which Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. are the American sponsors. It is introduced, very happily. With a quotation, by way of motto, from Pericles, apud Thucydides: “ For we have planted eternal memorials of our enmity and of our friendship i throughout the world."
, The writer really deals, however, with i friends who may become enemies, and whose enmity would be important and dangerous to the British Empire. For it seems that, of the two dangers that lie before the British Empire, “ the first may be summarized in the phrase the United States,” while “ the second may be summarized incorrectly but conclusively as the Yellow Peril.’' The first pertains to the doubt whether the success and growth of the United States may not make what may be called Anglo-Saxondom transfer its allegiance across the Atlantic. The second is whether the success and growth of Japan may not raise a movement for the " solidarity ” of Asia under the hegemony of the Island Empire of the East. Practically the two dangers are lest we should in time annex Canada, if not Australia, and lest the Japanese victories should result in the loss of British India.	.
Truly, there would not be much left of the British Empire if Canada should come our way' and India Japan's, in which case Australia would doubtless set up for itself. In that case Great Britain would shrink to much the same position as that now occupied by Holland, her maritime and commercial rival of three centuries ago. And yet the nations by which these perils would come are to be enumerated among the friends of England, the United States, if we may pay any attention at all to the current effusiveness on both sides, her best friend, and Japan not only her friend but formally her ally.
It is the working out in detail of the two hypotheses to which we may have referred that will constitute the main-interest of the book for American' readers. That is by no means all of the book, only a small part of it. Curiously, the American peril applies only to men of English race or traditions, the Yellow Peril to men of entirely different origin and associations. As to American expansion in the Far East, * Mr. Peel fails, quite naturally, to real-' ize what a casual and unintended result of the war with Spain it was, and seems, to impute it to deliberate policy.

man squadron in Manila Bay during Commodore Dewey’s occupation of the harbor we might very probably have* turned the islands adrift. It Is quite true that we have no notion of turning them adrift now. But it by no means follows that we have entered into the European rivalry for- the conquest of China. As to the Yellow Peril to British India, Mr. Peel seems much to overestimate the “ solidarity ” of Asia. As a matter of fact, not even in the ^primary ethnic classification nor in that of language are Asiatics akin, while in religion, the other great bond of union among men, they are quite irreconcilable. The notion of stable alliance between the Mohammedans of India and the Buddhists thereof, or of either with the Confucians of China, seems perfectly chimerical. When Mr. Peel speaks of Asia he seems to be thinking only of China, which it appears that he knows very well. The chapters of his volume, which are not only highly interesting but really brilliant, are those which relate his controversy with one Ah Hok, whom we strongly suspect to be a creature of *
Mr. Peel's own imagination, and whom he adduces as the spokesman of Confucianism against Christianity. These are particularly well worth reading, and indeed the whole book is worth reading as a sober and well-informed discussion of the great questions of world politics with which it deals.
