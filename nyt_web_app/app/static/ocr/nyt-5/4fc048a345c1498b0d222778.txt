HEN Grove’s "Dictionary of j Music and Musicians ” first , began to appear in parts, in j 1870, it was to be " In two Volumes"; when the second volume was Issued it bore the inscription M in three volumes,” and the three had grown to four at the appearance of the third volume, four years after the firet was Issued. With the completion oC the fourth, in 1889, came an appendix, then a few pages of final additions and at last a supplementary index volume. This tale of ^ adventure supplies some of the reason, at least, why Grove's Dictionary, though by far the best work of its kind in English, and in some respects superior at the time of its issue to any other musical dictionary, was ill-balanced and carried out with unequal degrees of excellence. The plan of the work grew with a rapidity that threw its perspective out of true. Furthermore, its extremely English point of view dwelt unduly upon minor Englishmen and upon the records of music in England. A new edition is now publishing ■ by the Macmillan Company, under the editorship of Mr. J. A. Puller Maitland, a well-known English critic and student, formerly critic of The London Times and one of the contributors to the first edition. The first volume has appeared, extending from A to E, and the work is to be completed In five instead of the original four volumes.
An attempt has been made, says the editor in his preface, to restore the balance between the earlier and later letters of the alphabet that was disturbed by the extension of the scale of the work as it proceeded. Of course additions have been made to represent the changes that have come over the aspect of the musical world since the volumes of the first edition appeared. Many hundreds of names have reached an eminence in the last quarter of a century that made their inclusion necessary, and many new reputations have been made among both creative and executive artists. Standards of archaeological research have changed, and investigations have led to new-views on.many subjects relating to musical history.
All this is in evidence In the new Grove. It is not, the editor avows, a new book. The old arrangement has been kept. A new distribution of space, In juster proportions, has been attempted. Less need, for instance. Is felt by the editor for an exhaustive treatment in regard to English musicians since the appearance of more detailed biographical works of reference, in which full justice is done to lesser men. The notable articles by Sir George Grove on Beethoven, Mendelssohn, and Schubert that were the glory of the old edition are retained, with only such corrections and additions as he himself would have made. In general, nothing has been lost of the recognized excellences of the first edition.
But the book, it Is clear from the first volume, is still an English book, and the point of view is English; English musicians and the record of music in England Btill have a place that may seem undue to many outside of England, The revision, In certain cases, does not seem to have been brought down to date so thoroughly as it might have been in the record of deaths and the enumeration of published works. That an encyclopaedic work of this kind, dealing with facts and details of enormous variety and Intricacy, extending over centuries, should be free from errors cannot be expected. The procuring of authentic data and the latest facts about musicians of the present time is often beset with singular difficulties. That absolute control should i be exercised over the production of scores of different contributors— tjje first volume Is the work of no fewer than 103—Is impossible. It ^ould not be difficult to go through the new volume of Grove and make a list of errors and omissions. It Is more gratifying to note the excellences that make it unquestionably the most valuable work of the kind In English, and at present superior to any other in any language, considering Its encyclopaedic character and the substantial quality of its most important articles.
The list of contributors is still a notable one. Many of those who wrote for the first edition are dead, but their work In general is retained, and corrected and extended as indicated by the use of brackets for the new matter, and often with the initials of the corrector. The list of t&ose who are dead, headed by Sir George Grove himself, Includes William Chappell, . James W. Davison, Ferdinand Hiller,
El) f JCcUr Jlork Siuics
A. J. Hlpkins, Francis Hueffer, C. F. Pohl, E. F. Rimbault, Dr. Spitta, Sir Arthur Sullivan, A. W. Thayer, and W. S. Hockstro. It will grieve some to observe that thfs last-named fine old Britfsh scholar's use of capital letters, quite as delightful and as incomprehensible as FitzGerald’s, has been leveled down to the ordinary practice of the modern printing office.
There was much to do to remedy insufficient treatment of great men in the first edition. The article on Bach has been extended by matter added in the appendix by Dr. Philipp Spitta, the chief authority on the subject. Mr. Maczewski wrote the original article, and it is hardly adequate, even Jn its present form. Bach ought lo have had as well considered a critical discussion as Sir George’s own of Beethoven and Schubert—or perhaps even of 2^Ien-delssohn. The additional data as to the extension of Bach’s music in England do not meet the necessity for a more thoroughgoing treatment. The meagre three columns originally given to Chopin have grown to eleven, both being the work of Edward Dannreuther, recently added to the list of deceased contributors. The inadequate paragraph on Bizet has given place to a more comprehensive notice, though even that does not do entire justice to the genius of the man, Berlioz receives more circumstantial treatment from Mr. W. H. Hadow, whose sympathy with the French pioneer is well known; his essay, critical in spirit and skillful in literary expression, has three times the space of the article it supersedes. A new article on Brahms, by the editor, Mr. Fuller Maitland, was much needed, and does justice to the composer, whose position has gained a. more commanding preeminence in the perspective of twenty-five years and is destined to gain still more. Dvorak only succeeded in getting Into a footnote in the first edition. Now, of course, his place is worthily recognized, and again by Mr. Fuller Maitland. On the other hand, that colorless English replica of Mendelssohn, Sir William Sterndale Bennett, still has nine columns, though his music, even in England, has practically passed into the limbo of oblivion.
Of the new reputations that are recognized by entirely new entries, the most important is that of Eiger. The Russian school has emerged beyond the boundaries of Russia to such prominence as calls for discussion of £ftlakireff, Borodin, Dargo-
-	mijski. Cul had already gained a mention In the appendix. The younger Frenchmen, too, claim a place—Bruneau perhaps rather a disproportionate one in his four columns, and beside him Charpentier, CHausson, Che vi Hard, Duparc, and Debussy. No doubt the reserve with which these men, especially Debussy, are treated will displease their ardent admirers, but they have not yet proved that they have made a lasting impression on the art, and it is no part of the function of a dictionary to make propaganda. The mysterious prophecies about Boito's operas. *’Nerone" and ** Orestiade," that appeared in the appendix are repeated in the new volume —it is still intimated that they may be ** among the greatest musical dramas of the day,” and Signor Mazzucato announces that ** Nerone ** Js beyond question *' a magnificent literary work,” but the public has not yet been given any reason to believe that they even exist.
Several technical subjects receive treatment that was omitted before, as "Acoustics ” and " Automatic Appliances/’ An Intelligent discussion of counterpoint from a modern point of view is substituted for the mere definitions that came under that heading previously. A similar enlargement might profitably have been made of the article on ** Chamber Music,” which touches an extremely important and Interesting phase of musical history never yet, apparently, adequately developed by any musical writer in accordance with its Importance.
One of the features of the revision Is the greater attention paid to American music and musicians. The names of a number of American composers appear with a discussion of their works, and there is a fuller account of some of the most ^important concert institutions with their records. A feature of the American edition of the dictionary is the inclusion ot a number of full-page portraits. The choice of subjects Is appropriate, but it cannot be said that the portraits themselves are always successful as woiks of art.
