the average citizen this book by the Secretary of the Equitable IJfe Assunmce Society will furnish a deal of information about a very mysterious science. The average citizen in question will probably skip the mathematical portions as soon as he sets a general notion of the principles and practices they are intended to explain, but he will end by bavins something like an idea of the reasons of some such things which have often puzzled and hardly less often (perhaps) ex.LSperated him*
Mr. Alexander has adopted the plan of supposing an imaginary life insurance company undertaken by ordinary business men quite ignorant of the " science ” of the tiling. By explaining to them step by step how they must meet the problems which ari.se, he inducts the reader also into the mysteries. lie shows how the actuary, starting from mortality statistics, arrives at a pretty accurate measure of the expectation 01 life at any given as1.', and so is able to say what premium each insured person must pay, and he shows how the bare sum sufficient to provide such insurance must be " loaded ” to allow for the expenses of running the business. For instance, the calculated rate for ifl.OOO of ordinary life insurance at thirty-five years of age is $21.OS per annum; the loaded rate,” the “ office rate.’* the rate actually charged, is Mr. Alexander shows how the actuaries calculate a “ level *' rate as an equivalent for a series of premiums increasing as the insured grows older, and he explains tire various forms of insurance other than the ordinary life policy—the endowment plan and the various combinations of that plan with the ordinary life plan. The general principles are comprehensible enough, though nmny of the figures are intended for people who are preparing for an insurance career. Further. Mr. Alexander gives a clue to what is meant by a " reserve," and shows why it is that a company with insurance in force to the amount of $171,550,895, and assets of S3G,S54,227, can have liabilities Of only $23,3S7.640, and so a surplus of $7,46ti,CStx We may not follow him here, but the explanation lies in what may be called the time allowance.
Again air. Alexander devotes a chapter to proving that “ no company can afford to grant insurance at less than cost ”— which seems simple enough. He also explains why it is that a man who has paid Jiis premiums, say, for two- years and1 their repents of his bargain can’t get all his money back. It appears the man was insured for those two years on a basis calculated for a much longer term, and the price was made accordingly. Moreover, Since the insurance company cannot withdraw from the bargain and the insured
-	can withdraw when he pleases, the fact that he will lose more or less of what he has put up serves to prevent the use of his advantage, while if he -does, withdraw in spite of the penalty. It gives the company a compensatory advantage. Further on Mr. Alexander discusses the present tendency to be liberal with backsliding policy holders and. how far it is a good thing. By way of contrast he quotes the rigid older rules.
One of the most prominent of our American companies (a company which now rives its policy holders world-wide freedom) began by issuing policies which were so framed- that they became “null and void ” and all payments under them were “ forfeited to the company ’ for any one of the following reasons:
1. The non-payment of any premiums 2;
Death by the insured’s own hand. 3.
Any untrue statement in the application.
4. Death upon the high seas. f». Death in consequence of a duel. 7. Death m the known violation of any law of the United States or of any State or province wherein residence and travel are permitted. 8. Residence or travel south of the southern boundaries of Virginia and. Kentucky between July 1 and Nov. 1; at any time beyond the settled limits of the United States and the British provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick;
0	Military or naval service, the militia, not in actual service excepted.
The author does not neglect, of course, explanations of the differences between stock companies, where the profits are professedly the property of the stockholders* and mutual companies, where the-profits, by theory at least, are divided Oamong the policy holders; He shows,, too, how the two plans are combined^ and Indicates something of the difficulty of arriving at an equitable apportionment of dividends. Mr. Alexander shows again how all-important is the stabiUtr of an
insurance company; tow that virtue is the basic virtue which makes insurance really insure, and how therefore the placing of the premiums to*r high is an evil easily reparable^ (by dividends or otherwise,) while placing them too low inevitably brings ruin. He further explains how necessary it fa that an insurance company shall constantly renew its strength by insuring itew lives, and an-

swers another question which has puzzled laymen, viz., why it is that though premiums arc* estimated cn the basis of average mortality, only selected lives are actually insured. The reason, he says, is simply that so long as life insurance is not compulsory the natural tendency is to bunch insurance on the weaker lives and .so give a mortality of insured persons very far above the average.
The book goes on to explain the elaborate machinery of a modern insurance company, and provides and analyzes samples of policies and business statements. It discusses annuities and vigorously combats the notion that there is any gambling element in insurance. Moreover, laudatory testimony of clergymen is 1 rinted.
In short, Mr. Alexander's book is not cltcgether an explanation of what insurance is; it is a plea for insurance, a very lc ng and intelligent insurance agent’s argument for insurance in general and the old-established companies in particular. The book is certainly informing. It is not altogether solemn either. It has its humors both intentional and unintentional.	,
