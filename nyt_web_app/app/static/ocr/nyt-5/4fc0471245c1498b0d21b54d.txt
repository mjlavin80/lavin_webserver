Tn tha June number of Harper* 3 Bazar Margaret Deland has some observations in her familiar manner " concerning: saints,’* wherein she notes particularly that overdevelopment of unselfishness which is the highest form of selfishness. “ The Baddy Baby," by Juliet Wilbur Tompkins, is an “ amusing’ record of happenings during: the nurse’s afternoon out,** In the same number, James Huneker has a paper on “ Bernard Shaw and Women*1' Mr. Huneker asserts that Mr. Shaw is the man who " discovered and popularized the Unpleasant Girl.” Mrs. Mary E. Wilkins Freeman’s serial, “The Debtor," is continued, and there are illustrated articles on “ The Chicago Woman's Athletic Club " and " Among the Illustrators," besides shorter papers. The papers which deal with fashions are as entrancing as usual and very appropriately concern themselves with June brides and the Summer girl’s armament.
