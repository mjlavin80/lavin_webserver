N the opinion of The London Academy, officially expressed by its editor, “ William Cullen Bryan ” is not entitled to " a place beside Homer, Shakespeare, Milton, and Dante.” The editor does not refer to Mr. William Jennings Bryan, who has never claimed a place in that galley, but to the author of “ Lines to a Water-fowl ” and " The melancholy days have come," and in thus slightingly omitting: the ultimate “t" of the poet’s family name this English critic, of course, makes doubly effective the sting of his rebuke to Americans who fancy their country has produced a few good poets. The ire of the editor of The Academy is stirred up by an article or “ symposium ” in our contemporary The Critic, in regard to a recent " slump in poetry." The editor la moved to ask “ why the cry should have been raised In America.’* Have Americans produced any poetry worth mentioning? Certainly foot, and Poe, Longfellow, and the aforesaid " William Cullen Bryan are not worthy to be mentioned in the same breath with the aforesaid Homer, as, doubtless, many prosperous contemporary English versifiers, known to the editor of The Academy, are. Moreover, this editor exclaims, “ Who are Woodberry, Moody, and Edith Thomas, who is Riley, who is Markham?” Well, they are humble persons who write agreeable verse, and we are inclined to think that the editor of The Academy knows all about them, or just as much about ;them as American read- -era of contemporary verse know of - Robert'Bridges,
