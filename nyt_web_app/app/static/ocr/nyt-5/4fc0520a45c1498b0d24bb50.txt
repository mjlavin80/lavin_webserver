Jfettf York Times Booh Review:	.
The time for writing a strictly impartial history of our civil war has probably not yet arrived; Yet it is doubtful if we will ever obtain more accurate accounts of the various military movements involved In that stupendous conflict than those written by foreign military attaches of the several armies,* and the foreign writers who from the voluminous material at hand have written critical histories of those movements in later years. .	*	■
I regard the recent volume by Capt. Cecil Battine, a British cavalry officer, entitled “ The Crisis of the Confedbracy.V as one of the most valuable contributions to military history that has yet appeared.
Your' correspondent Getorge F; Shrady, Jr., in The Wew 1'ork Tiires book Review of; May C, appears , to think differently. He attacks Capt.- Battine’s book as a merely “ literary venture ” of little, or no value to the military student, “ owing to some of the glaringly erroneous statement** which It contains."	.
The gravamen of Mr. Shrady’s criticism lies, first, in. the alleged -statement— that Capt. Battine invariably claims that the Confederate v. forces were inferior in numbers to the Federals. The very facts which he gives 'to Vefute this statement, .viz., extracts from Gen/Grant’s Memoirs, * prove the truth of Capt; Battine's claim. It has never* been seriously disputed, and
all the statistical information relating to^ tho numerical strength of the two'com-* liatants proves beyond’any question, that the Confederates were greatly inferior.
It is true ~that In many battles the numbers actually engaged-were nearly equal.
; This often resulted from the superior tact-1 ical ability of Confederate commanders'
! and the corresponding failure of Federal commanders to*bring fhelr full strength ;‘iiit;o action or use their .preponderating forces simultaneously, at ‘ critical points or .at the proper moment.*.	.	.
■	rfhe second charge is that Capt.. Battine is J the first military critic who" has deV scribed the. battle of Shiloh as a;, defeat of the Federal Army.-.- Thooanswer to that is—he does nothing of the kind. The wordL “ defeated " is interpolated by Mr. fehriady 'in his quotation from. Capt. Battine’s . book. The Captain does, not attempt to . . describe the battle, of "Shiloh .at ‘all. It has no part in the Crisis of the Confcd-^ eracy ” of which-he treats. He mentions it merely. In speaking of Gen.. Grant's .transfer from the Western field,to the.
. E|\st, and says:	.	.	;
In truth Grant’s career in the West' must be considered one of the. most fortu- . nate in history. From the start he commanded troops • superior in ' number, -.re-, sources, and morale to the adversary, and except at Shiloh he was opposed to Generals of moderate capacity,*	*	'
This Is literally true. It is also obviously true to any careful reader tof Capt. Battine’s book that in referring to' Gerterals of moderate capacity fie'referred solely to those who had opposed Grant in the West. Concerning the battle of Shiloh ' Capt. Battine says further:
Easy success had made him [Gen. Grant J careless, for at-Shiloh ..April C he was surprised by the combined' forces of Sidney Jbhnston and Beauregard and'his i army was almost routed. The fall of •Johnston and the indiscipline of the raw Confederate- forces,- among whose ranks -the victorious- onslaught had spread dis- . order, saved the Federals from disaster.
This also is doubtless true, and is quite different from stating that Grant was defeated. •	.	,	;	.	..	.
An army saved from disaster by whatever means is not defeated.	.	.
It will always-remain a disputed conjecture ‘-what- might have happened' at Shiloh had. Johnston not fallen or-had Bragg’s assault upon' the left of Grant’s ■army at the close of-the battle on Sun-* 1 day been supported by an advance:of the-entire Confederate forces; just*as it will ever be a disputed question whether Lee's army might.npt .have..been annihilated by.
•	a .counter-charge by Meade, after the re-L pulse of Pickett at Gettysburg'	-
.. Such possibilities of warfare are f re- * ..quently /discussed by Capt. :Battine,: but -he is remarkably careful.not to: magnify' ' the failures or successes of either atmy1' during the “crisis"' of which hfe writes.
I am quit<x sure that his bpok must be re- . garded .by real military .critics and espe-'.
