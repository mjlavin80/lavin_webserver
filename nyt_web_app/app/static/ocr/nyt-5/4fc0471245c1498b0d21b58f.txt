Ncto York Times Book Review:	.
E.et me preface these few . sentences with the apologetic statement that I ara not a great novel reader. It Is probably ignorance of the taste of the modern reader and writer of fiction which induces the state, of ..disapproving - surprise in which I find myself.	...
4- short time ago a friend of mine recommended to my notice a "Western novel entitled " The Pioneer." Her reason for recommendation’ Swas that the heroine was " very attractive, and so* well- done.’',; On reading- the-book..I found that. the.
“ attractive" heroine from my point of view merited the description Heqtor gives of Cressida when she is brought into the Trojan camp. That the character is drawn with great skill and understanding no one can deny. From the first to the last this young woman—her name is Jane Allen* and she is twenty when you meet her, twenty-five when you say good-bye— is consistent and true to her t^pe. She is less like a. novelist's creation than a living being that the novelist has known and watched and been making stealthy mental notes about.	.
Where my disappointed surprise comes in is in. the matter of her lack of character in the first place, and in her elevation to the part of heroine in the second; Her' author has painted the portrait- with provocative reserve* and subtlety; but we can’t believe that Hiss-Bonner does not want us to understand that Jane Allen was bad. Bereft of ornamental graces and a seemly reticence, this is simply a study of a woman who is naturally immoral, or perhaps It is better to say unmoraL She is unconscious (because of i her youth,; good bringing up, and ignorance) of her immorality, and would be the first person, to be amazed at such an accusation. But from the beginning to thfe end her mental processes and actions are those of a woman who, if fate is kind; may stay on the straight and narrow path, but who at the first push in the other direction, takes the downward turn.
I do not cavil at Jane Allen as a character study. If an. author is interested in . such variations of the eternal feminine, I cannot 'say my1 taste does not run . along, r the same lines as his. What I do cavil at is that such a woman- should be boldly put forth as the heroine of a story, and that the reader should, be asked to pity and love her. . Miss Bonner has. deliberately 'attempted' to invest this woman with the most winning attraction, arid the fatal point in her attempt is that she-has ' succeeded. Jane Allen is undeniably- * 'charming.' It is not that you-are told so, ■ and then, her -charmingness is left to the , imaginationT-ryou feel,-it, land fall under.' its spell. In the early portion of the book* you innocently yield yourself to it; and think how sweet she was", and how abused .by fate. 'Then, hs her character ; is revealed in all its exasperating feebleness *and moral .obliquity, you experience an. outraged .sense, of having-/been decoyed to the verge of a passion for the .kind of .woman that a sensible man fears as Ulysses feared the sirens. * -'	■
, It may be clever to be able to create a figure of engaging vitality, but having created it, it is a pity that it is not a _ more improving acquaintance - for the reader. Out .of the depths of my ignorance let me ask—if the lady should not have some of that divinity which doth hedge a heroine—should not the woman who is the pivot of interest through some 400 pages be something more than a fascinating young thing without a shred of moral principle? And, above all, should we—having it plainly shown to us that Jane is far from what she ought to be— still be asked to bow to a charm to which our conscience tells us we should be proof and to which we are sulky and protesting victims?	■
