Among so' many . interpretations of Browning—the end ot which is not yet— this of Prof. H&rford’s has the advantage of the frank admission that It Is a contribution only, not in any sense a ** last word "—that mythical “ last word " which never Is nor can be so long as any subject retains its living Interest* but which, nevertheless, so many assume to utter. As a contribution to a study which seems even unusually fertile in contributions Prof. Herford's work is undoubtedly-interesting. His treatment of Browning tho poet and man shows considerable insight and uu-usual sanity. There Is, however, little in his point of view which is really new. H*«3 Robert Browning, except in ^hlnor matters, Is the Browning upon whom the critics have for some time agreed. Like the rest of the interpreters, of course, he is sometimes too interpretative, and sometimes too little so; but at large he will be found informing, even if th^reader is no Browningite—merely a man appreciative of poetry and more or less interested in the processes by which gTeat poetry is evolved out of the poet's life and consciousness.
The volume deals—as such volumes are apt to deal—a bit vaguely and figuratively with the poet’s life; it seeks to trace the influence of his marriage and of his ancestry; it enters into controversy (on the heretical side sometimes) as to disputed points ot Browningness; It gives a fairly satisfactory analysis of the longer dramatic poems, and Is withal very reada* hie. This “Browning" is, by the way, the seventh volume in a *' Modern English
Writers Series," which includes already a “Stevenson/* a "Matthew Arnold,” a “ Ruskin," a “Tennyson," a “ Huxley," and a “ Thackeray.”
