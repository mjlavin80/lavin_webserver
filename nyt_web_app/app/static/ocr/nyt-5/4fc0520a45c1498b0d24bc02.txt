The reviewer of The London Times finds in Andrew D. White’s Autobiography, which Mr. Boynton reviewed for us last week, further proof that “ anecdote is the form of literature in which Americans shine most," an idea no American reader would be likely to derive from this book. Mr. White tells a few good anecdotes, to be sure, but those the English reviewer quotes are rather too familiar to American readers to suggest that the autobiographer is an adept in the anecdotal form of literature. More to the point, however, are this reviewer's re! flections upon the frequently mentioned American lack of a class of professional diplomatists and Consuls. He believes that the real 'strength of our foreign representation “ lies in such personalities &s Mr. White, Mr. Hay, Mr. Angell, and many more who are able to alternate between service abroad and public or private' employment at home." The weakness, on the other hand, is that most''American men of a certain age “ have no ideas at' all beyond the transaction of business' according to American methods.” As for the general complaint that American representatives abroad are poorly paid, this English reviewer declares there is not an Ambassador in the world who does not think “ he "could double the Importance of his country if he had a better residence and an * adequate r salary." .
