names in history which are so familiar but about which less is generally Known than that of the subject of the present work. To most persons he is known principally. If not solely, as " Old John of Gaunt, time-honored Lancaster," the character In Shakespeare's “ Richard II.” The student of English literature rryiy recall that he was Chaucer's Maecenas, the student of church history knows that he defended "John Wvclii, and the student of political history remembers wgnely that he ct-tarkeJ ilie Speaker oi the " Good Parliament * and wes, in general, hostile lo rv-forms In government. But few people 1 know the realiy great place that he occupies in the history ii the later Middle Ages. The fourth soiT of Edward III., unquestionably the greatest subject in Englan.-l >:nd for years us vlrtunl King, titular King of Castile and Leon, progenitor of the Houses of I^ancaster and Tudor am! nnecstor of monarchs in Portugal and Curl ik*. John of Gaunt has i.ad to wait 50<> years for the honor of a biography.
Jtilin Plantagenot was born in the town of Ghent among his father's a.iies in 1340. just as the Hundred Years* War was really beginning. In spite of all his territorial titles, posterity was to know him best from the name of his birthplace. antf John of ** Ghent " in English became John of “ Gaunt.” At the age of nineteen he married Blanche of T-»un-''caster, a relative of the famous Karl Thomas of the days of Edward 11. In 13ft; all the I^ancastrian estates passed to Blanche, and in her right to Gaunt, who was created Second Duke of Lancaster.	the	next	forty	years Ga-.i*t
Is never ions out of public view.
Mr. Armitage-Smith shows that Gaunt's active interest in foreign politics and especially in the politics of the Iberian Peninsula is of earlier date than is commonly supposed. I‘ really began with-his participation in the invasion of Castile by his brother, the Black Prince, in "M»7. The purpose of this invasion ras to drive oftt the illegitimate and usurping h^ise of Trastamare, which 7/as aided by the King of France, and restore legitimacy in the person of Don Pedro, better known as the “ Cruel.” Gaunt won some distinction as a divisional commander, but the success of the Black Prince In restoring Pedro v"is ephemeral, and when he withdrew across the Pyrennes to his principality of Aquitaine, the Bastard. Enrique the Magnificent, easily rog:iined the throne of Castile. The natural result -if the Prince's aMiance with Pedro was to unite Castile under the house of Trast-am ire more closeiy with Charles V. of Pr irit-c, vho was now to be assisted in the struggle wth England by the fleets
*	of (' istiie. Then-fore, wh^n the Hundred Years* War reopened in 13**9 England lost the mastery of the seas. Tfce espousal by Gaunt of the c^ ’so of Pedro was perhaps th<* most imjK>rtant event in liis whole career.
It explains his second marriage in 1371 with Constance, the daughter of Pedro and heire,ss of Castile, the representative of legitimacy, by which he became titular King of Castile and Leon. Pis first mar-ri^ige had made him the gieauest feudatory in England. His second was the result of his desire to wsar a continental crown. Mr. Armitage-Smith believes that as early .is l'fT.'J. when he led an army to invade France, his ultimate purpose was to turn south and drive the usurpers from Caslile. In the invasion of France, Gaunt showed himself to be no strategist, and wore out his army in a futile military promenade. The French persistently refused battle, and Gaunt became convinced of the folly of the whole undertaking, but !><* did not abandon his Castilian projects.
The military failures increased the dissatisfaction felt in England toward the Government, and Gaunt as an unsuccessful General came in for a large share of it. The work of the Opposition culminated in the '• Good Parliament " of 1.I7U. Its work was entirely undone, however, and Gi.unt dominated the last Parliament of the reig-n of J-’dward III., which was packed in his int«rest. ’liius Parliament’s expression of loyalty to ttie young Prirce Richard .-hows that Gaunt had no sinister designs on the succession as had been hinted. He always remained Hue to the principle of legiLimism. Still his unpopularity at home continued lo grow. His defense of Wyelif in 1 .'177 brought h!m into conflict with the i5*shc*i> of London and with the city, which stood by its Bishop against Gaunt, however much it might sympathize with Wyelif. In i:t7y Gaunt tried without success to bring the French and Castilian fleets in the Channel to battle.
The popular hatred of the I>uke reached
f	*	»	■. -	.	7.	"
Its climax at the time of 'the Peasants'
Revolt, in 13S1, when -his Savoy Palace,- in /^London, was wrecked. The mob was intensely loyal to the young King, but heartily detested his uncle. Later on, in the reign of Richard II., hatred of—the Court favorites somewhat lessened popular animosity toward the Duke, but from about 1385 on, Lancaster ceases to play a great part in English history and turns again to Castile.
Don Juan, the son of Enrique^had been reigning' there since 1370. The house of Trastoman was too firmly established for Gaunt to succeed in winning the crown for himself. The Lancastrian claim to Castile. li*:e the Plantagenet claim, to j Franco, failed to take account of the I fo~ce of awakened nationality and the im- , possibility of forcing an alien dynasty upon a proud people. The Invasion o' Castile ended in 1388, when John of Gaunt and his wife, Constance, renounced their claims, and it was agreed that Katharine of Lancaster, their daughter, should marry Siirique, the son of Juan I, By this union the lines of Pedro and of Trastaman were united, and Gaunt's descendants one day ruled over Castile. Another of his daughters had married the King of Portugal.
The last important event in Gaunt's career was his third marriage with Katharine Swynford and the legitimation of their previous offspring, the Eeau-forts, through whom Henry VII. later traced his orig'n to the House of Lancaster. In I39i) the Duke died, at the age of fifty-nine, a.id his estates passed to his eldest son. Henry, wno was shortly, as the result of a revolution, to become King of England.	volume	con-

Mr. Arinitage-Smith has evidently done a great deal of work and gone through much dreary and uninviting material. He has turned cut a book that Is at once scholarly and eminently readable. Moreover, his work scarcely runs the risk of being superseded. His will probably long remain the authoritative life of John of Gaunt, and at present it is the only one.
