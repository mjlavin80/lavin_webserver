Kcic York Times Book Review:
It is a pleasure to receive a criticism so aptly and graciously administered as Mrs. ; Carleton’s in The New York Times book ; Review April 23. The writer of the criti- ; cism is further to be congratulated on : the coinage of the word " serendipper,** ; which should be welcomed to our language and allowed the same rhetorical ; rank accorded to its verbal ancestor of ’ Walpole extraction.
Apropos of the criticism on my article . on " Serendipity " in the April Criterion, -1 may perhaps be allowed a few words of ; defense or explanation. Although I was ■ aware that Horace Walpole had circum- ,, scribed the use of the word serendipity ! j to discoveries of things unsought, it , seemed to me that my usage of the word ; was justified on three grounds. First of , all, on the basis of Walpole’s own words,
*' This discovery I made by a talisman : whlcti Mr. Chute calls the sortes Walpo-lianae, by which I find everything I want,” that is, everything for which he had consciously or unconsciously been seeking.
Secondly, those who read the article in The Criterion will observe that in only one of the cases which I have cited did the discovery occur when the " serendipper " was in pursuit of his quarry, but several hours, or days, subsequent to the search, when the subject had been indefinitely dismissed.
Finally, like nearly every word that loses some of its original significance or wins an increment of meaning, even the , plight use which has been made of serendipity would seem to indicate a disposition on the part of writers to lengthen its etymological tether.
There are two other arguments in favor of abolishing the restriction which Walpole placed upon the use of serendipity. One is the very obvious lack in the Eng- ■ llsh language of any adequate word for ; the sixth sense which I attempted to de- : fine in the last paragraph of the essay on : serendipity. The other is the great psych- ; ical disparity—to the ear—between the spacious word serendipity and the very limited function—^accidental sagacity— which it is made to cover. For, reduced to its lowest terms, accidental sagacity is nothing more nor less than open-eyed alertness, of the Sherlock Holmes order, whereas coincidental sagacity is a complex faculty of which alertness is only one factor.	•
However, if a quorum of discriminating : authorities agree that " serendipity, pure ' and simple,” is a faculty which can • flower only in mental " dolce far niente," , the minority must be resigned, though not without a passing regret, since " coincidental sagacity *' wears no such becoming garment of syllabic occultness as its “ accidental ” brother, " Serendipity."	=
