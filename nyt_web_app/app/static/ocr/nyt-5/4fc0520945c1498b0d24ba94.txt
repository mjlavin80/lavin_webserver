Philip Verrlll Mighets, author of that *' Bruvver Jim's Baby," which was matter of some correspondence In The New York Times Book Review a year ago, has written another novel which the Harpers are about to publish. This time Mr. Mighels haa left the West behind him —left babies also behind him. His story is one of New York and politics and the ways of rings and ambitious and confident young men who join in with such rings in order to spy out the methods of them and so destroy them in the end. Mr, Mighela’s hopeful young man is called Hakon, there’s a “ boss" named Gray-stone who has a daughter as well as a machine and designs to make Hakon President and his son-in-law, there’s a Mrs. Meshe (eloquent designation!) who Is a siren and spins entanglements for 1 the honest politician’s feet, and there's the girl the honest politician really loves. The story is said to be one of strength and interest.
