HE novels of Gustav Krvns-sen,a Carman author nut well known in his own Holstein until llKr.i, are U> he reprinted by Messrs. Dana Estes & Co., anil the most important. *‘Jorn Uhl,'* is now ready.
The first two.
Die Sariilgriifin " and
“ Die Drei Getreuen." made very little slir; but *’ Jorn t*hl ” contains an account of the battle of Gravelotte anil also some heterodoxy, and tlie combination of th^ two was as irresistible in Germany as it always is in English-speaking countries. In consequence the author’s parsonage in Hemme was besieged by visitors and bombarded by Utters, and Its occupant found himself so severely blamed for certain of his printed utterances that he withdrew from the ministry and returned to his native village of Barit. His family, although humble, was one of the oldest in the place, and he was well qualified to define the position of sueh a stock in a remote village preserving its ancient traditions, nnd much of the interest of “Jorn I * hi " turns upon the relations of two families, onovrich and the other poor, living for centuries side by side. The hero is sacrificed to family pride atid does not see real happiness until the book nears its close.
Tin* publishers of “ Broke of Covcnden," Messrs. Herbert R Turner & Co., are leaving their present quarters on Summer Street and betaking themselves to the Essex Building, opposite the South Station, ascending to a height at which they can have perfect quiet and a wide view of the bay. Their next novel, Mr. George H. Picard’s "The Bishop's Niece, ’ will be published Saturday, and. although the comic clement is the last that one expects in a story of *' mixed marriages.” that is to say of matrimonial alliances between Catholic and Protestant, it is really Very droll, thanks to the demure eccentricity of his pacific Lordship, the Bishop of Isle Madame, and the contrasted orthodoxy of his brother, a domineering layman. The book neither proposes nor solves problems, but it is a neat piece of literary workmanship.
Mr. Alexander Jessups "The Charm of ’ioulh. a volume of verses, will appear at the same time.

“The Grapple,” Messrs. L. C. Page & Co.’s anonymous novel, will be followed by Mr. Theodore Roberts's *' Brothers of Peril,” but that can hope for no such good fortune as comes to the former novel, in the coincidence of the Chicago strike with its appearance, for it is a story of old Newfoundland. The illustrations are by Mr. H. C. Edwards and are to be printed in tint. The firm has just received the Toldo edition of a Japanese novel, of which they have secured the copyright, intending to reproduce its various quaiiitncss of decoration, but this book will probably not appear until Autumn.
The Bureau of Equipment has added the name of Dr. Gardner W. Allen’s “Our Navy and the Barbary Corsairs," published by Messrs. Houghton. Mifflin & Co., to the list approved for the crews’ libraries of naval vessels, and the work has been especially commended by Capt. A. T. Mahan because of its fullness of detail in the history of the years immediately preliminary to the war.

The June Atlantic will contain a paper on " The Cause of South American Revolutions,” by Mr. G. A. Chamberlain, and a most curious and entertaining article it should be, if at all adequate. Mr. Alvan P. Sanborn will contribute the annual " Letter from Paris.” and Mr. W. M. Cavot will define '* The Spirit of Japanese Art." Domestic subjects will be treated by Mr. George W. Alger, writing of “ Generosity and Corruption,*’ and by Mr. Ray Morris, discoursing on Federal Rate Regulations,” and Mr, WjGarrott Brown’s "The Tenth Decade” will be continued.
“ Village Improvement,” by Mr. Frederick Law Olmsted, and Mr. John Burroughs’s “Dull Plumage and Gay” wiil appeal Jo the beauty lovers.

Considering the vigorous condition of the myth of the Connecticut Blue Laws, in spite of the repeated exposure of its falsity, this gem from ** A General History of Connecticut,” written by the original Blue Law manufacturer, the Rev. Samuel Peters, is really valuable. It Is quoted in Mr. Goodspeed's May catalogue, from Page 110 of the history, and is part of the veracious author’s description of the Connecticut River:
