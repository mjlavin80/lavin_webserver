If a man is an outlaw, yet loves music, j ho may well hunger aiul thirst for It in the wildcrnessT therefore if he holds up a concert of amatv/.irs in a convenient town and calls for a sons at the point of two enormous pistols, who shall blame him? Especially if lie spares the coneeri-goers* pockets and makes the occasion I serve to introduce to the notice of an cmi-I nent composer a girl with a wonderful ! voice. That is exactly the performance of Mr. llornung's " Stingaree." who is | , not a gentleman burglar, but belongs to | an oidcr nobility of crime—the gentry of tho road.
•* Stingaree ” operates with excellent manners. gentlemanly feeling, a monocle : and high theatric effect in Australhi.
He “sticks up" (that’s Australian for hold up) not only concerts of amateurs but mail coaches, batiks—even officers of the Victorian police. When he slicks up" the mail the first thing he does when ho reaches a quiet, safe place is to pick l’unch ouL of the ruck and read it. I\ov he has been a London clubman and the jests of the old town are clear to him. When he is caught it is. of course, wh«*n | he is upon an errand of mercy, but jails cannot hold him. He does not pass, out of this series of Ingenious talcs before he has heard the girl of his first musical adventures sing again. In point of fact, he steps (with only time for a bath and getting into evening clothes) straight from the prison to the town hall, where the lady, bloomed into a prima donna, is charming all the good provincials. It may be added that Mr. Homung has left a perfectly feasible- opening for further •* Stickings Up of Staingarec."
