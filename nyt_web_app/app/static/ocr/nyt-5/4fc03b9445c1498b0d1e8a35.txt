G. P. Putnam’s Sons have received the I following biographical note sent them on request by Miss Myrtle Reed, author of " The Master’s Violin," •' The Book of Clever Beasts/’ " Lavender and Old Lace,**
&c.:
I discovered America thirty years agr*t and I liked it so well that I have not since left the country. When I came I had a pen in one hand, a sheet of paper in tho other, and was yelling for ink. At this my father knew that I was destined for ■ the fourth estate, and ran to the dictionary for a name that would look well in print. Hence my title, which everybody thinks a pseudonym, and the English reviewers insist to be the name of a ’* gentleman," one of them saying:	“	The	gen-
tleman who calls himself Myrtle Reed.” •Don’f"you call that	hard when I have	I
always been a perfect lady? After this	;
auspicious beginning,	the rest of my ca-	;
reer is history. See	chronicles Knlcker-
Vocker Press last seven years.	j
