yew York Times Book Review:
Two or three years ago, looking over some old letters, I came across an autograph by Thomas Carlyle. I have not been able to find the letter in his published correspondence; and, if it has not appeared in print, the letter has more than an autographic value, and it is clearly my duty to see that it is published. It is an interesting communication, not alone as regards the characteristic style, but on account of the nature of some of the comments.
Whj-.t Carlyle, wore ho alive to-day, would have written concerning those Greeks of the Mongolian race, the Japanese, may be left entirely to the imagination of our numerous pro-Japanese friends. But his opinion of the Russians seems, in	to have been pretty well
defined, and it is curious to find Carlyie at that time championing the cause of what he designates as '* the essential democracies " of Europe.
