; The -work of Mr. David Graham Phillips has so steadily Increased in, power and improved in style since the two studies of , newspaper life—crude, strong, and withal 1 a shade repulsive—with which he started : his career as a novelist, that each suc-cessivo story from his pen has ad: vanced his standing in a manner quite unusual in a day when first novels are more than apt to be last ones, so far as excellence Is concerned. In the three years between his *' A Woman Ventures " and M The Plum Tree,” Mr. PhillipaJjas taken big strides in almost every requl-site for the making of a deservedly successful story writer, a mode of procfedure that, persevered In some time longer would seem likely to land him finally in the higher ranks of his profession. As
for that matter, “The Plum Tree** itself will hardly fall to raise him out of the crowd for good and all.
Mr. Phillips’s stories have always been of the kind that depend for their value on their author’s evident gift for the analysis of the social conditions and social types with which all are familiar and for the mbre difficult setting forth of both with a power and vitality that make one of his stories nothing less than a glimpse into the realities of human motives and tho pleasant and unpleasant phases of modern life. * The Plum Tree ” is even less of a romance and a closer study in the character development of one or two persons than any of his former books have been, but in not one of them have the vigor of plot and action, and that precious sense of the humanness of it all, Kept his reader’s interest at a higher pitch.
The question in which one is at once absorbed is not whether Harvey Sayler will marry the object of his youthful love, but to what sort of culmination he will carry his youthful ambitions how he will reconcile his honest intentions and manly aims with the conditions prevailing in the world of business and politics in which every man must make his way. '* The Plum TreeM is an appallingly frank exposure of the methods of the cleverly organized brigands who so often manipulate the Governmental machinery in city. State, and Nation on this side the Atlantic, and Harvey Sayler is Mr. Phillips’s type of the more than ordinarily well-bred and well-intentioned young man who is easily attracted from the difficulties and hardships Incident to a start in any one of the more honorable professions to the alluring opportunities for speedy advancement open to those who can establish any sort of claim upon the dispenser of political favors, or, in other "words, get under the political plum tree. Alt the other types are those with which the newspapers have made us familiar—the vulgar city boss with his heelers and rivals, his somewhat more presentable counterparts at the State and National capitals, the powerful band of plutocrats whom the politicians alternately fleece and favor, and the various puppets and figureheads who are put up and down to please the blind and stupid public while politicians and plutocrats fatten at its expense.
Sayler himself, starting as a poverty-stricken young lawyer, attains the enviable position of supreme boss, not the King, but the maker of Kings, and it is with a masterly understanding of the devious workings of the human conscience, especially the conscience of' the practical politician, that Mr. Phillips has developed Senator Sayler from the shrinking candidate' who first presented himself for favors at the hands of Boss Dominick of Pulaski. The chronicle of the developing process Is not inspiring,
, except as Its exposure of the pitiable waste of good material in such a career may inspire some future attempt toward the betterment of present political methods, but that fact has, of course, nothing to do with the power and skill with which Mr. Fhillips has set out his analysis of the inner construction of an American National boss who wished to be and thought he was a benefactor to his country; who blandly promised himself beside his mother's grave to climb up by hook or crook to an eminent place in the world and then to use his ill-gotten power for great and good ends. It certainly forms an impressive and timely commentary on a subject that should be of supreme interest to every good citizen of the United States, and it can but set one to thinking to some purpose along the line indicated.
