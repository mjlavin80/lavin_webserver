Dr. Vinogradoff. who came from Moscow to succeed Str Frederick Pollock as Professor of Jurisprudence at Oxford, has started at once to " find himself " in his strange seat, and he hits done so with much effect, though it would be untruthful to say that he has popularized his subject, the growth of the manor In England. The subject, Dr. VJnogradoff says, has fascinated him, and it Is capable of attracting most intelligent persons. Of it, the Professor says:
When observing the classical world we are apt to fix our attention on the city. *' civltas,’* *' polls," as the most complete expression of ancient society. If we look out for something as marked and as peculiar in mediaeval life, it is impossible to choose anything but the manor as the subject of discourse. As in the case of the Classical City, economic, social, and political institutions and ideas are concentrated in its mold. It has not been devised or arranged by any ono Jn particular, but slowly evolved by the needs of generations. * * • Then, again, tlw manor In its special framework appears aa a thoroughly English institution, and at the same time affords the best example of the feudal organization which extended its sway over the whole of Western Europe. It may be said in a sense that by tho strong constitution and the customary self-government of Its manorial system England has got quite as mueh the start of her continental neighbors in point of social development as she obtained political precedence over them by the early development of her parliamentary institutions.
In handling a subject that promises so much Dr. Vlnogradoff has displayed an accuracy rare among holders of British professorships. He is exact, as S, R. Gardiner was exact; and the result, with him as with Gardiner, is a work that will never be read with pleasure, though It may be studied with profit.
