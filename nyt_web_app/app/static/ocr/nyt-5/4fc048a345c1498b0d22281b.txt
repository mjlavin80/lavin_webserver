Alajor Arthur Griffiths's Pleasant Story of His Long Life in the Army and the Civil Service.*
SPIRIT delightfully frank-even boyish—marks these reminiscences of Major Griffiths, and this charm of manner is not all. For the Major speaks from personal knowledge of a vast number of important and interesting things, and supplies bits of gossip and biography about a great company of distinguished Englishmen, many of whose lives, though properly a part of the past .half century, overlap into the present.
I am a soldier’s son, born In an Indian garrison, (Dec. 9, 1838,) a soldier’s grandson, with a host of relatH’es, near and distant, and as I write this I gaze at family portraits and miniatures in uniforms of a bygone day. My earliest associations were with soldiers; a soldier’s wife was my nurse; my father’s orderly carried me on his shoulders at the immature age of three to the Dame school, where 1 learned my A, B, C; my favorite toys were a wooden sword and the buttons off an old regimental coat.
Major Griffiths spent his early years un the Isle of Man—" iji those days a favorite retreat for old officers, veterans of tho Peninsula, India, and 1tVaterloo.” Thexo veterans were his lieroes, and even his first schoolmaster had been a.Lleu-r tenr*nt In a cavalry regiment. He relates of his days at the public school “ such as it was/1 a " Spartan institution/’ that the boys rarely got enough to eat, while “ in the matter of education ” they were "? not exactly starved, but much was left to chance and individual desire to improve.’’ Being a younger son and his father poor, young Arthur Griffiths had no hope of a start in the army—would have become a curate, perhaps—but for the coming of the Crimean war. That . exigency rushed him unceremoniously through an examination at Sandhurst and got him the otherwise unattainable commission in three days.	'
After some little training at a military depot at Birr in Ireland the boy shipped to the Crimea with a drunken skipper,
" who courted collisions by such close steering that it was a mercy we did not run down everything we met.”
Once, indeed, in the Bosporus when sitting in the cabin below, I was thrown out of my chair by’' a violent concussion, and rushing up on deck found that our madcap commander had fallen foul of another vessel, but was capering about the deck shouting: ” Shaved him by an inch! ” He was drunk, of course—he was always •drunk,
In spite of this fantastic pilot, however, the ship’s company got safely to the seat of war, and youth Griffiths joined his regiment, where his extremely youthful appearance gave him the name of ** the light company baby.” Serving in the trenches he found delightful—as young Aiajor Washington did the sound of his first bullets—and it was “ an endless and absorbing joy” lo give orders and be obeyed, “ not without condescension/’ by the war-worn veterans he “ was supposed to command.” It is in connection with these trenches that Majdr Griffiths records this sort of thing. " The pungent flavor of Worcester sauce," says he, ** recalls my debut as a soldier, and my first lunch at mess; there, too, I tasted claret for the first time ahd overcame my repugnance to olives.” The young officer had many boyish escapades and saw a deal of what went on at the siege of Sebastopol—thanks to the friendship of Sir William Eyre, upon whose staff he afterward served in Canada.
From the Crimea the Sixty-third Regiment was ordered to Halifax, of the military life in which town and of the officers stationed there Major Griffiths tells much that is entertaining.	.
Major Griffiths says that a?* a Second Lieutenant his regimental pay was 6s. fd. per diem, or £121 per annum, of which, after deductions for mess and band subscriptions, only a little less than £9 reached him. But . '* amusements were cheap, and we had plenty of spare time to indulge in them,** and "if it was not an improving life professionally it -was for the.most part healthy and cleanly, with little to be ashamed of from the moral side/' He“ speaks of cricket, skating, boating, hunting, and especially sings of the Nova- Scotia girls and the sleigh ride3, “snugly ensconced in the buffalo robes, with your 'muffin* by. your side, a halt at some hospitable settler's, and an impromptu dance In his bam, with a return journey in the crisp moonlight air/* The-Major adds, by way of explanation:
The “ muffin ” was a social institution of those days which may or may not have survived. Every young swain, by unwritten but acknowledged law, was permitted to make his choice of a partner for the season, with whom he danced exclusively and whom he drove in his sleigh and skated with, hand in hand. The M Bhie ‘Noses/* as the Nova Scotian maidens were styled, were "‘uncommonly attractive, direct descendants of the daughters of Acadie, as winsome as

I Longfellow's Evangeline, as simple and unsophisticated and as well behaved. Mrs. Grundy did not exist—or held her tongue.
E. A. Sothern, then unknown to fame and called " Douglas Stewart," was trying a season at Halifax, “ with poor resuits,*’ and the officers aided him. In “ The Heir at Law ” when Sothern played Dr. Pangloss and Mrs. Sothern Cicely Homespun, the author played Lady Du-berly—excellently outfitted, he says, with " petticoats, long stockings, and white wig/* He wis then eighteen, and presently went to Montreal as extra A. D. C. to Sir William Eyre, ile confesses:
My duties were rather social than military, to discharge the well-known functions, to take the end of the table and carvc, until happily, the dinner a IS. Russe became the fashion, to keep the visiting book and issue invitations. Sometimes. as befitted my youth, I played with the children, and was caught booted and spurred hiding under the table in some silly game.
This staff appointment was presently cut short by the War Office, which Major Griffiths admits was well. " I was rapidly j being spoiled, and was in great danger of becoming an insufferable young -prig/’ , He wont back to his regiment (and hard j work) for a while, and then was passed | on to the musketry course at Hythe, and soon after that to the Staff College at Sandhurst. As usual, he tells of the work and the fun at both places—about the Hindustani he learned, and the drawing master who (explaining compass work) in his embarrassment addressed H. B. H.' the Prince Consort as " Your Royal Compass,” the professor of chemistry, who was called “ Stinks,” and the professor of geology who was called “ Stones.” Young Griffiths’s. course at Sandhurst was interrupted by the stir of the Trent affair, which sent him back to his regiment in Canada, and when matters were peacefully adjusted with the United States the ice froze him up for the Winter in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. He presently returned to Sandhurst, and in due time got a post as Brigade Major at Gibraltar during the Governorship of Sir Richard Airy. There is more gossip of famous or merely singular men with much amusing matter about Gibraltar and the races there and the visits of royalties, and the garrison theatricals, In which Sir Arthur Havelock was ” leading lady.”
It was at Gibraltar that Major Griffiths was assigned to reduce the mutinous prisoners there to order, and this assignment -led to his retirement from the army and his permanent employment in the civil service as, in turn, Deputy Governor, Governor, and Inspector of . Prisons. Much of his volume deals with what he has seen in following that duty—most of it very curious, and all related in the spirit of what has been quoted. He tells, too, of his journalistic work, of his first novel,
“ Peccavi/’ of later stories like “ The Queen’s Shilling** and "The Thin Re-1 Line,” and his detective stories, his ” shilling shockers," he calls them, of which the first was ” Number 99.” Nor does h*j neglect account of his works based upon his knowledge ot and interest in prisons" and criminals—" Memorials of Millbank/’
“ Chronicles of Newgate,” ” Mysteries of Police and Crime/* Everywhere you see the same frank delight in his work and the same friendliness toward all the pleasant and curiouS things that may be parts of that work or thelife that goes with it. Yon would say Major Griffiths had enjoyed his •• Fifty Years of Service ’* in the living at least as much as you enjoy it m the reading.
