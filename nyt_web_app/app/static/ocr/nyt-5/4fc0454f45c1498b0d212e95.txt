These four stories-af~Mr. Hewlett’s are as rich in imagery and as glowing: in color as any that he has ever written. They are hot with adventure; they^throb with -passion, they cut through war and-bloodshed to their endings. Mr, Hewlett is more than, generous—he is profligate in the wealth of incidents that he lavishes upon hl3 readers. Yet* so boldly arc the stories conceived, so sure and hot scented the romance,'that every sentence seems to bear a vital relation to tho whole and the loss of one would cause a break like the dropping of a stitch in a closely . knitted pattern.	■	_
The first story, *' The Heart's K-ey," is " set among the hill country of J*ou-louse.” Lady Saill, daughter of Simon of Ventadorn, was *‘ a golden lady with . long yellow hair like Helen’s of Troy and of fierce face like the Siren’s when she had drowned a man. * * w liound her waist was a broad girdle of gold, plates of gold riveted together with hinges, and struck with sard and emerald, of tho sort they call a Heart’s Key, the girdle which virgins, must wear until they are wedded." Saill had fifty lovers, but it is only of four that Mr. Hewlett tolls:
Three were Jauffrai of Brieuc, a very noble youth, full of mettle, who made good songs; the Monk of Quesle, a man of the Church, who made better, and the Viscount Ebles, a great man from Roussillon, who made no song at all unless he were fighting, and then he sang a sharp low song like the whistle of a sword In the air, which indeed was the Instrument he played on better than any. As for the fourth lover, he was Guillem of Nantoil, a poor minstrel with a cropped head, meek eyes, and smooth face, Tvhom nobody thought a J over at all, and who in his service never lifted his looks higher than Lady Saill’s knee
And the story tells how to each of them in turn Lady Saill granted some ■ simple token, which made him think that to him alone would she deliver the Heart’s Key at last. But later, wnen they found themselves all fools together, they vowed vengeance on so false a lady, and banded in concerted action, hounded her from her own ancestral home across the snowladen fields of olive trees with none to care for her hut Guillem, the minstrel. And following her fortunes still further, Mr. Hewlett show£ how the baser dross of her nature was burned in the fierce fires of adversity, and how the pure gold that was there shone the brighter for Guillem, the minstrel, who dared at last to look higher than his lady’s knee. *
Capt. Brazenhead <jf New Canterbury Tales fame, long of nose and terrible of mien, is here, too, -succoring a pair of timid lovers and at the same time help; ing along a little private scheme of his own, mainly by the exercise of his nimble wit and the flash of his nimbler sword.
And again he has rewoven the threads of an old Italian legend dating from before the days of Dante and Giotto. Buon-delmonte de Buondelmonti had a tower in the City of Florence, and sought out Schiatta degli Uberti for^the purpose of forming a friendly alliance by marriage between the two houses where friendship had not dwelt before. But fate and a slip of a girl of fifteen spoiled their well-laid plans, and because Buondelmonte saw and loved Piccarda, the daughter of Forese Donati after he was already pledged to Cunizza of the clan of the Uberti, he was set upon and murdered at the gates of Florence.
And last is the story of " The Love Chase," which tells of the soft charms of Donna Emilia Fioi’dispina of Lombardy,
" very young, rather pale, partaking the nature of a dove,” whose lovers were many and whose smile was enigmatical. She twisted about her slim fingers the heart of that fiercest of men, Simone della Prova, ’called the Black Dog of Cit-tadella and Tyrant of Seven States; Cardinal f Gonzaga and his poet secretary, -young Nello Nelli, '* a fair youth with a golden cloud of hair." Simone pledged himself to her when she was twelve, and,^ , then went about his business, which was^ the slaying of men, and for four years | Emilia neither saw nor heard from him. Meanwhile came Gonzaga, seeking first to conciliate Simone, and later made the bearer of love messages to the gentle Emilia—messages which he delivered, but which he mixed generously with gifts and sweet words of his own. And lastly, held in the soft net of her charms, was Nello Nelli, caught without a struggle. Over the true love of these two hangs the Damoctean sword of Simone’s wrath and Gonzaga’s treachery. And v^hen at last it falls Emilia, with her same inscrutable smiie, accepts her fate, leaving it for the reader to decide whether hers was the wisdom of the serpent or the meekness of the dove.
