seem a smrvil basls on whlch.to found the
disruption of a partnership that has lasted four centuries, better-or worse, between nations. • 3. That Denmark, with a view to self-preservation and continuance, among the list of kingdoms, is desperately bent upon resisting said “ repeal or the' union ; whereupon ‘lias arisen desperate. fighting and slashing of throats, very intelligible to me, on both sides, and very lamentable, which surely ought to ehd as soon as possible. 4. That Denmark during those 400 years has "not taken the due method of conciliating and Incorporating and honorably, uniting, to itself the Duchies of SchleswigrHolstein; and that, It the chance be given it again, it must with-all earnestness and energy adopt and sacredly prosecute said, method—or it will be the worse for Denmark. 5. That being myself a friend to " union, an enemy to violence, quarrel, and *' disruption " of all but the quite inevitable kind, and withal caring almost nothing whatever about this temporary nonsense which has arisen everywhere (in Ireland, Hungary, Bohemia, Altland, Czechland, Deutschland) concerning nationalities and mere [or more?] genealogical reasons for repeal of partnership between -men or nations—I, for my own share, very much wish, and even incline to hope, that somehow or other some Just pacification of Schleswig-Holstein, some ** reinstatement ” of the union in poor Denmark (which naturally grudges to become zero among nations) may gradually prove pos- 1 sible, with amended conduct on the part of- Denmark in time coming.
This last is really all the practical conclusion I can arrive at just now. hnd I wish much Herr Bartelmann and the Holstein patriots, whose valor I respect and whose Injuries I sympathize with, would look at this side of the matter, too, and try to move their strength in that direction rather. To that issue, it seems to me likeliest, things will have to come at length. To that, or else to annihilation of Denmark as a kingdom—which latter also is a result painful to contemplate to the Teutonic or any other human soul. Deutsch and Norn are first cousins, after all, are they not? Brothers German, I should say, who have unluckily got into 111-blood in times bygone! They live very nicely here In this island together, divided only by the Trent, Humber, or Imaginary lines, and never dream of quarreling. A-3 to all that of Russian or other fleets on the Baltic frightening England, (alas, our terror lies elsewhere than there at present!) or of Russia crushing down the democracy of Germany, coercing the West into " iron despotism ” again, or, in fact, meddling at all with the West and its essential democracies or other Interests, I confess I suffer no disturbance of mind at all: but see well that If Russia do actually meddle with those extraneous matters. Russia will get such a
ffounding in the mortar (all Europe join-ng in unutterable and unimaginable rage at such a proposal) as will bray Russia to powder or make Russia wiser for a thousand years to come..	■-
These things are not worth to Herr Bartelmann. whose pamphlet is very bieder and tapfer, too, and whom I like very much and wish to stand well with; but do you, dear Miss Smith, write to him some appropriate synopsis of them when you next send a letter to Olden-bourg. And recommend me to Bartelmann, *so far as facts will permit; and come here again some day, and let us see and hear what the world is now saying to you and you to it.
With many kind regards from my wife, I remain always, yours very sincerely.

t Dear Miss Smith:	.
I have read your friend Bartelmann's ' I pamphlet and long letter, and perceive
■	without difficulty both that he ia paln-i fully in earnest, and also that matters 1 have fallen sadly out of square In Schleswig-Holstein lately. Something rotten in the State of- Denmark, it is very clear; and also presumably some things not altogether sound in the duchies, either! I am heartily sorry to see my poor brother mortals driven to such exasperation on both sides; and. if it lay In me to do it, surely I would take no rest till I had settled them on some just basis, if such were discernible! The following points come out with decisive evidence to me from Herr Bartelmann’s pleadings:
1.	That Schleswig-Holstein has by the letter of the bond and by his Majesty of Denmark’s marriage with the mantua-maker a decided right, as before law courts, to a “repeal of the union”; and likewise that their humor is desperately bent upon it just now. 2. That nevertheless they have, In fact, been united to Denmark for -100 years past; that law courts, with Judges in wigs, and scanning , the “ letter of the bond.” are (unhappily or otherwise) not the tribunal where such causes are tried in this world; that the one tribunal for such is the High Court of the Universe, not sitting visibly in any place and scanning the letter, but the spirit and the eternal propriety of things, a court very difficult to plead before, whose decisions are slow, but at last Irrefragable and unalterable; and that, in candid truth, the circumstance of male heritage and female heritage and of a poor royal blackguard’s marrying a mantau-raaker in the morganic [sic] manner does
