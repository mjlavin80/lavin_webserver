At the age of eighty-two Dr. Alfred Kussel Wallace is busily employed in finishing his '* Autobiography/* which will be published next Autumn. His paper on *' Natural SelectionM was printed before Darwin's “^Origin of Species,” the publication of which, indeed, was somewhat hurried by the appearance of Dr. Wallace’s paper and its original plan modified. In a talk with Mr. Jame3 Milne, which is reported in The Book Monthly of London, Dr. Wallace calls " The Origin of Species '* the ** great book of the nineteenth century, the book most far-reaching in its consequences on the thought and knowledge of the world.” Darwin and he were j friends to the last. Wallace declares he was not ' disappointed by the discovery that Darwin had an- j ticipated him, and had all the materials for his great book ready. '* Everything was for the best,” he says, “ as, perhaps, it usually is.” Wallace never kept a diary, but he has treasured many letters i written to him during his travels as a naturalist in ; South America, the Malay peninsula, and elsewhere, i which have served him well in writing his book. Dr. Wallace has had a select if not large acquaintance among literary folks, and has uttered many original and striking opinions on literary subjects.
