book— tho application to Ireland of the principle that all true national progress must rest upon a moral foundation." The author shows that the criticisms were inspired by a failure to appreciate the exac: purpose he had in his mind when he decided to write the book. He continues:
That purpose was to concentrate thought upon certain social and economic problems hitherto neglected in Ireland and to expound a practical programme of national development. Thought and work on these lines is to my mind the condition precedent to the solution of the Irish question. But our people have been taught by history and under present influences are held to the belief that all such efforts are doomed to failure until that question has been solved. . The foregoing pages may be regarded as one man’s endeavor to break this vicious circle in which poor Ireland revolves.
