MR. HUTTON'S TALKS.
Collection in Book Form of His Literary and Dramatic Reminiscences, Taken Down fay Isabel Moore.*
R. HUTTON thought that if 1 he could talk about his literary friends into an appreciative and discriminating phonograph he could put his reminisccnces on record. Isabel Moore has taken the duties of such a phonograph for a. large part of the “ talks ” in this volume, recording what Mr. Hutton said in the first person. Some of the chapters had already appeared in periodicals. The whole volume was subjected to his revision and correction, and it is his last word to the world in which he had so many friends and by which he was beloved. Mr. Hutton was a genial and cultivated litterateur. who knew many of the most distinguished literary, artistic, and dramatic men. in a peculiarly intimate and personal way. His collection of books and memorabilia was filled with personal touches.and recollections, and there were close tics that bound him to the -authors of many of them. He has told of them in this volume in a frank and engaging way. It is largely autobiographical, and gives many details of the narrator's adventures and friendships with the noted men and women who pass and repass through its pages. It is purely personal, and contains much of his own views, critical and expository, as to the quality of those people and their achievement.
It is unassuming, ''kindly. penetrating, and full of humor; and it possesses unceasingly the quality of charm.— As the last word, and the very characteristic word, of a cultivated, genial observer with a genius for friendship, it will give much pleasure.
Mi’. Hutton has some charming things to say about his boyhood and young manhood days—his days of idleness in school and strenuous efforts in the hop business, his friendship with Charles, the barber, who bought his books and read them—days when he was cut dead by a young lady with whom he had danced . the " varsovienne ” the previous night in Waverley Place, when she s^-w him in overalls, rolling barrels on skids on Broad Street; and he was ashamed of her. His first published article recalls the second . visit of Dickens, and his disappointment in the novelist's readings. The well-beloved characters : were1 never the same again:
; He introduced old scenes and old friends in .new shapes of which I do not-like to think- He killed my. Sam Weller and my Micawber. All these years I . have mourned doubly for the Ham who was “ diownded " in the sea- and taken away from me on the platform. For all these years I have been absolutely-Toot-less.
He recalls, too. an amateur dramatic performance in Liverpool in 1852, in which Dickens appeared; and, a year or two later, a performance o'f *' Dombey and Son." in which the most memorable feature was the acting of the part of Mr. Dombey. And, telling of it years later, he was interrupted by one of his listeners, who broke in with this:
Qome now, old fellow, that wort't do. 1 That hit of flattery is altogether too i invidious and too apparent. It was al- ' most my first appearance on the stage in , anything like an important part, and so far as I can remember it was before I had taken the name of Henry Irving1.
Mr. Hutton has several such little surprises for his readers, as when he tells of a little shell cameo portrait of his father which he was showing in later years as the work of a clever little Frenchman, by name unknown to him, when one of the guests, looking at it, his hand shaking a little, said:
He was a clever little Frenchman, was he, and you don't know his name? Well. I'm the. clever .little Frenchman, and my name Is Saint Gaudens. It is the earliest piece of my work extant, and when you and Mrs. Hutton get through with It, I v.ant it for Gussle and the boy.
The reminiscences of actors are many and interesting. Mr. Hutton/ who was for years a dramatic writer and critic, speaks of Booth at length, with many anecdotes of his extreme kindness of heart and his loyalty in friendship; and the chapter is indeed touching. There are -memories of Jefferson, Barrett* Wallack, Montague, Florence, McCullough, Mrs. Keeley, and Mrs. Maeder. Implicating Lawrence Barrett, one of the most amus-tag stories is of the christening of Mr. Frank Millet's baby in London, when Hutton and Barrett were present. The child was to be named Lawrence, and when the parish clerk asked what It was to be, Barrett spelled It out for him, 41 Lawrence," as his name was spelled. Hutton immediately corrccted him with “ Laurence," as his own name is spelled. And fhey shouted this at each other, to the amazement of the poor little official, till Mr. Millet stopped them with the remark that the father ought to have something to say, and. turning to the clerk, said:
4* Spell him with a * v.* " And ** Lavrence ” Millet he is by law.

chat about It is entertaining, full of all the incident and adventure of a dauntless and indefatigable collector's experience. It gives occasion, too, for much Interesting gossip concerning the origin of the different casts and the circumstances under which they were made, often ascertained by Mr. Hutton only after long investigation.
There Is much delightful discourse about Mr. Hutton’s many friends and acquaintances in the literary, artistic, and dramatic world in thi# country and in England, and of his experiences in England with them he is full of stories, many of which throw some pleasant little sidelight on somebody we all have heard of. He has also many mementos of them in the shape of autographs, sketches, droll impromptus of all sorts, notes and verses. Many of these are reproduced in fac simile, and they are likely to give the same sort of pleasure and amusement that-the originals gave to the genial and kindly owner of the hospitable library wherein these treasures belonged.
