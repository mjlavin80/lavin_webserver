Those ■ who; have- tik'sn1 up- the cudgels with or against Sir. James Mott have looked at his well-founded tirade too superficially* I * believe he < did not- fIre tils sViot without an aim, ■which v/as the great incubus on that frterature we who esteem our-country' foremost‘in many excellences and ’deslre it’so in all, all wish for. Allu-s'.ons, clear or obscure; similes, quotations, arid the like are the ponderous armor we are enjoined to wear when we sit down to compose—calculated to compose one. eh? Wiser was Balzac to don t£e loose monastic gown; DUmas to put: on a coat'out at: the elbows- or Thackeray the dingy' dressing gown. We are still the slaves—and yoke-chafed ones—of the English school, arid ape the New England one, for it is ndt^a new English one, alas! How laughable when the cockney haply deigns to praise1the'Motley or Prescott who writes I lllte Scott, (“Life of Napoledn," to :wit.)
WritingrUke; Stott damned our ffrst Iils-i torical novels—study Simms. Writing like James (Oh, G. P. R. J., by your leave !he is the great “James the Greater *' in England, in the reading rooms,' by your leave!) killed'The Ledger by the “ Professor *' stories so much preferable to that un-English Cobb—and fatal; writing-like Knowles	a	model In ht3 aeason)-
killed “ Spartacus,” " The* Bondman," and even “ Metamora.” If; Cornelius Mathews had,written fn £3ie English* style Dickens would not have ftSufTd ourrectio to ' his, gibbetinjg him as- Puffer" Hopkins,-and .his “ Chanticleer ” «J.M.’s.\ not C.

Eiglow Is only a’Sussed or Norfolk dialect, and not American of *the soil, intonfe; allusions, diction, aivd' references;

Now, who in America; Jtt the Americans, I might say; in fill -creation, ever saw- and heard 'a* nightingale? In' England: tourists crush, afl-! on tthe-Brooklyn Bridge, to go"on 'the' evicursJon ’ down into the' country1 to -hear a nighttn* .gale; it is advertised, as “ The' King will open the -Misses Prymm's needlework bazaar.” Do they hear anything? They ! may "hear something, but the* effigy woold ;be entitled to Eden' HnsSe honors who saw it. If anything be-heard-noticeable musically, it is " made in Switzerland.” -The wise say it is a: myth gottenJup for ' the &otel and railroad managers. . Yet th’e* writer, after' long- years, did seeded hear- one—perhaps, a lack a day, the one!

Our . student reiterates th3 duel with dulled :s\70i*ds on'a padded man in a Heidelberg fencing halV while a'Texan bout with tae genuine Bowie, or even the Barlow, 13 a 2fomerlc slaughter to that burlesque; the | novelist wants miir plaudits for his hero's I daft handling St the four-in-hand -w« ip * 2 on the Speedway, when- no Englishman j could trail aZ*.er an American wSio had learned thb‘ lariat and its-uses with up-No’th addenda.

But we must not write averse from the recognized ciiyle. We sball not be recognized In England by the Dons and the bulldogs fcf the collegiate Institutions, unless we lie down In iheir bed. They wanted Forrest and- McCullough to “tame down,” and not roar so the gods would call for them to roar again; Poor little Lotta, the' once irrepressible, they cowed her so that she~was -an inaudible “ stick,*' and Artemus Ward, he was supplied with a cockney interpreter at his wbow, intermediary for the* parturition cf the Angli-canly chastened American joke. An artist of our shores cannot hang in the National (Jallery unless after a Bayswater fixing bath. Whistler was not appreciated till he destroyed all the elarlty of his open-faced drawings by a- pTunge in London fog.
The fact is, we are all under the hler- j archy, like 2he Egyptians. The learned i who have'the arcana^ey want to write ! L so that” only- their1 pupils,* their sisters; j aunts, and'cousins,: snail be able to read-, j , HENRY LLEWELLYN WILLIAMS.
