human and appealing than are the plain Nantucket folk, and the labyrlnthian mazes of a needlessly intricate plot are far less attractive than the path to Uncle Riah's grooory. As v.as the case with ** The Woodcarver of ’Lympus," we should like the story much better without tho smirch with which the author just touches it. Passion and wrong are the very roots of many romances, but MJss Waller’s are so innocent and healthful that an episode of sin seems to be something extraneous and pinned on, r.ot an Inevitable feature of the novel- She has not yet learned to | keep her material well in hand. Certain j characters, which we are sure she intend- j ed to use and develop, rather almlesslv fade away; some might be dispensed with altogether; others would well have repaid expansion. The author’s art falls below her invention.
Nevertheless, “ Sanna " is a well-written, wholesome, breezy tale, a welcome addition to the library of Summer fiction, a distinct advance upon *‘ The Woodcarver of 'Lympus,*’ and holdlns much promise of still better work.
A Seashore Romance.
6ANNA. By M- E. Waller, Author or ■* The Woodcarver of ’Lympus." Cloth, 12mo. I*p. 399. New York; Harper & Brothers. $1.50.
Sanna is a genuine sea maiden, full of fearless life, as well as of beauty and coquettish witchery. We like her none the less because she suggests the Sheila for whom many young hearts besides Dr. van Dyke'n cherished a tender passion somewhere in the seventies. There will never be another Princess of Thule, but Sanna is a lovable -girl, sure to capture the reader’s sympathetic interest at her first appearance, and not to lose it until the curtain falls, upon her romance. She has the best possible setting in Nantucket, with its simple-hearted ancient mariners left high and dry on the sands hy the ebb of the whaling industry; its quaint old maids stamped with a sort of nunlike perpetual youth; all the neighborly, homely life of the place pervaded by the brooding presence of the sea.
Miss Waller has succeeded in transferring to her pages the atmosphere of Nantucket, which is just another way of saying that one will find her novel an ideal Summer resort, restful, original, with a peculiar charm of its own.
The more ambitious characters are less
