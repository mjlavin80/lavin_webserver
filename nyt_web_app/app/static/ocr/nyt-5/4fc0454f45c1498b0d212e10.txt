A Defense of the Danish Critic, Brandes, from the Attack of , w Cosmopolitan.**
Xcic York Times Book Review: '
DSMOPO LIT AN’S letter In The Book Review of May 13 contains some statements anent the Danish critic Georg Brandes which should not go uncensured. : In the first place, what is the meaning .of the statement that Prof. Urandes’s “ real ” name is “Maurice Cohen”? The full name of tho critic is George’ Morits Cohen Erandes. Old Mr. Brandes,. his father,
was a well-known broker in Copenhagen* Denmark. If the writer means darkly to hint that racially Brandes is not a Dane, but a Jew, this insinuation Is singularly pointLess. Is Germany readyto erase the name of Heinrich Heine from the list of its greatest poets because heM‘ too, might claim racial kinship with David, Solomon, the prophets, and the' founder of the Christian religion? Ought* similar considerations to prompt Russia to disown Antokolski, France George Bizet and, Sarah Bernhardt, England Disraeli, the Palgraves, and* Cardinal' Newman,' whti was of mixed Jewish and French origin, with no Anglo-Saxon blood in his veins?
I As for Denmark, it could ill spare the Je wish-born Henrik Hertz, one of its ablest playwrights; Melr Aaron Goldschmidt, its wittiest journalist and the father of its artistic prose, and, above all» Georg Brandes, the founder of its modern literature. And it is not only Denmark that is under obligation to him. The great Norwegians, Henrik Ibsen and Bjomson, would not have been precisely what they are but for Brandes'; in' Sweden such men as Heidenstam and Strindberg have acknowledged his influence;' in Germany- Paul - Heyse, Arthur Fitger, and many others have borne witness to his inspiring power.	. .	•
“ Cosmopolitan ” declares that Brandes vilifies all writers who manifest respect* | for “the teachings of the Scriptures, Old or New Testament*,” while his praise is reserved* for 7 shocking literature” only I Among the authors particularly praise^ by Branfifcs I recall* Hans 'Christian* Andersen, Wordsworth, Mickiewlcz, Joseph de Maistre, Esaias Tegnfir, Novalis, Soe-ren Kierkegaard, ’ and a * host of others' who, as far as I have been able to perceive, showed at least a fair regard for the teachings of the Bible. The poet whom Brandes of all has * treated most elaborately and with the,profoundest admiration Happens to be Shakespeare. He must, then,, according .to “ Cosmopott- . tan,*‘ be a particularly “shocking" writer. ;	■	■	‘ ' * ~ ' ‘ ' 1	* * ’	“
But “Cosmopolitan” gives proof** of his-accusations by quoting some words.of Brandes to the effect that “ vigorous and virile ” authors have invariably been charged with immorality by “ literary impotence.'* Brandes’s statement may be somewhat too sweeping; it is quite, possible, for instance, that neither Homer nor Sophocles was ever thus assailed. But I fail to see how the quotation might be so construed as to defend immoral writing. For, of course, Brandes means that the charge has been an unjust one. That it has almost invariably been made in modem times against literary innovators is a matter of common knowledge to all students of literature. Racine and
•	MoliSre endured the taunt, as did Goethe, Shelley, and Charlotte Bront§. ' InWetzer and Waiie’s great “ Kirciienlexikon _ the	mous Danish authors Holberg,
Oehlenschlaeger, and Hans Andersen are severely scored for their “ lack of moral principle*” 1	•	‘
*' Cosmopolitan r* waxes eloquent over the “ virile “ American literature. Yes, we have had some virile writers in this country, one of whom, Walt Whitman, was frequently accused of Immorality.
** Cosmopolitan ’* may object that Whit-i man’s position in American literature is not yet. wholly, undisputed. „ But he will not be able to demur to my statement that never has this country produced a greater novelist nor a nobler man than Nathaniel Hawthorne, And If he wiU kindly look the matter up in G. F. La-throp's life of his father-in-law he will learn that “ The Scarlet Letter " was received at its publication with the charge of immorality—“ French ” immorality at that!	-
Only one more word:	“ Cosmopolitan *’
informs us that Max Nordau is ** another of the prophets of misguided European youth.’* This is .news to me. But, if it be true, surely the misguided youngsters who fancy that pretentious pseudo-scientist a prophet could-not be identical with those who look up to Brandes as their leader. For throughout- NordauV most sensational—and for a while quUe popular—book, “ Degeneracy,’/ his tendency is to decry anything that Brandes praises, and vice versa. Nor does he omit to speak of Brandes himself In almost-the very terms of “ Cosmopolitan.”	-
T feel sorry for* the man, young or old, who allows himself to. be guided by a Nordau. and no less do' I pity him who never has felt "his love of liberty, his moral courage, all his manly qualities, in fact, stirred and strengthened by some passage or other in the works of Georg Branded.	-	Ji,
