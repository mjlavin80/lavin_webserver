The one hundredth anniversary of Schiller’s death has been celebrated with joyous manifestations which would have been more in accord, it seems, with a celebration of the centenary of his birth. This only proves, however, that the occasion of such a celebration does not count for much. The object of Germans the world over, and of much of the rest of mankind in sympathy with them, was to honor the memory of a grreat national poet whose influence was world-wide, and it made little difference that the one hundredth anniversary in May of his death was the day selected this year rather than the one hundred and forty-sixth anniversary, next November, of his birth. Presumably the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of that event, so glorious in the history of German letters, will not pas3 unnoticed four years hence. An interesting1 feature of the Schiller celebration is the exhibition of portraits of the poet, pictures of hia birthplace and home, and some rare Schiller autographst in the lower hall of the Lenox Library Building: on Fifth Avenue. This will be transferred in June to the Astor Library.
