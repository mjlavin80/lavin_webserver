^^gSSlAKING an entry in his diary ..j D Sg0|| of the death of Francis I
11. Palgrave—he calls him .1 ffl&V/Hll " Frank "—Sir Mountstuart
IM&fill Grant DufC observes: '*Manx
people found the torrential
rush of his talk intolerably, tirdsome* but I cannot say that that was my; experience." This is his characteristic . attitude toward most of the people and the talk of which Grant Duff's diary is-in . s6me way a record. - Sir Mountstuart is probably one of the last of the diarists. < He is at a considerable distance, it must ■ be confessed, from Pepys and* Evelyn and the more noted of their fellows, In the in; tcrest and value of his records; but there , have been few more industrious than he. , These two volumes are the thirteenth and ( fourteenth pf ;the notes which he began to select from his diary In 189G, and which extend from New Year’s Day in 1851, f^st after he had taken his degree at Oxford. They bring1 him down to Jan. 23, 1U01. when as a member of the Privy Council he took the bath to King Edward VII. There, he declares, he ends. The '* Notes from a Diary " arevpublished in New York by- Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. i	.
The chief interests of this diarist's life have been politics and administration; but he carefully avoids both in the matter he has selected from his diaries. He has ^ said what he had to say on these subjects in his speeches and in his other books. And he also avoids bringing in his dislikes. Agreeable subjects are the ones , he has preferred to discuss. How vast and varied are the " tracts of interest " that lie within the field of the busy man's life these diaries disclose. That they will be as interesting to other people as they are to him he does not hope; books of this kind survive chiefly in ** the largest libraries." He has accomplished his purpose if he has preserved “ some interesting and amusing things that would otherwise have soon disappeared/*
Not much that is human, especially lhat belongs to the^ upper strata of humanity, is alien to^ir Mountstuart. His observation, with extensive view, surveys mankind from China to Peru, and he rever omits the opportunity to extract what he can out of travelers from any of the intervening districts. , His acquaintance is enormous, and seems to embrace moat people of distinction in any walk of . life in England. Prime Ministers, Bish- , ops, poets, philosophers, travelers, politicians, Dukes. Duchesses, and the nobility ard gentry in general are the personages who chiefly .people hJer pages: ind , whose conversations, be-reports on all aginable topics. *' Wfc beat over a variety of subjects," be* observes of one of his own dinner parties; be serves the same sort of meal: between these four covers. A more inv-eterate breakfatefcep 1 and diner-out* it woiilif. seem, can TScaree^ ly exist. The Club, the XV. Cliib; the * Breakfast Club, <3 rill ton’s, the Literary ' Society, tho Dilettanti, the Omar Khay- '■ yam Club, are only some of the. scenes of his degustations: to cay nothing of his private invitations. .Anything and every- . thing from the table talk that strikes his fancy for any reason goes down o» his record. Of consecutive connection in his pages there is nothing; nor are such pages meet for consecutive reading of long duration. They are bed-candle reading. As such they will divert, interest, and offer diverse suggestion to different people.

All sorts of anecdotes that people have told one he jots down. Mr. J. R. Green once recounted his experience of Ruskin In a lecture at Oxford on Botticelli, which I he had gone to Oxford to hear:
j The lecture began with a few words ! about that painter. Presently, however, he said: ** Before I can make you understand Sandro Botticelli you must understand Fra Angelico and the monastic system of the Middle Ages.” Then followed a sentence or two upon Fra Angelico and J the monastic system of the Middle Ages, but ere long he exclaimed:	“Yet	what
is the pood of talking to you about Fra Angelico and the monastic system of the Middle Ages? All your sons have latchkeys," and the rest of the discourse was devoted to that subject.
Walking with Frederic Harrison, they came upon a Gothic building on the Embankment, the next house to the west of the Temple Gardens. Harrison said, “ I must really find out what that is.”
He walked across the street as he spoke and put the question to some people who were standing at the gate. It turned out to be the estate office of Mr. Astor, the American millionaire—a strange sign of the times.
An American who lives In Italy was asked if he knew the Vanderbilts. ** No/’ he replied, " it is long since I left the ; United States. When I was there they were only Vanderbuilding, you know.” Another friend told him one amusing story of Odo Russell and Beaconsfield. The latter, so Russell found, intended to address the diplomats assembled at Berlin in a French speech.
Knowing the Premier’s acquaintance with the tongue of the Gaul to be very imperfect, he was In despair, but as 'usual proved equal to the occasion. “It will," said he, "be a very great disap-Dointment.” "Why?” said Lord Bea-consfield. “Because," answered Odo,

" knowing that you are a great master of fcinglish eloquence, they have been looking forward to your addressing them In English as to a. great intellectual treat.”
" You don't say so,” was the rejoinder,-and the French speech was torn up.
They told him, too, of a remark made by George Darwin s son, a mere child about eight years old, which was ** simply astounding.” " What are metaphysics? ” some one usked, and some one else answered jestingly, " It is what you take after physic.” The child, it seems, was not satisfied with this—and might well not have been—but in a few minutes rejoined, “ 1 see what it is; you think, and you think, and you think, and then, you say that two and two are about five! ”
His literary friends give him an entertaining budget of gossip. Thus John Murray, the publisher, declared that there was one English poet for whom no font of type sufficed, a necessary preliminary to reprinting his works being largely to reinforce the '* l*s *’ and " v*s.” This was Tennyson, and the cause was the conStant recurrence of the word "lo-v'e-** in his writings! He mentioned also that Clark, the Edinburgh printer, had told him that he had paid £40,000 in wages to compositors for setting up the works of Waiter Scott for the’ house of Adam Black alone.
Animal stories delight him, as the . President of Magdalen’s account of an Aberdeen terrier, who prayed to the sun. A long ray of light on a cold Autumn day was falling- through an opening in the shutter, but it came down but slowly toward the floor. The dog, feeling very cold, did what he was in the habit of doing when he w'anted anything, and begged earnestly. ** He was evidently a fire-wor-shlppcr.” And the cat, who stopped a passerby by seizing her dress with his teeth, led her to the doorbell of his homo, wh'.ch sht, rang, and so gained his object of Icing let into the house, is to Sir. Mountstuart worth chronicling. He is
J evidently a collector of minerals, and records his acquisitions with a collector's pride—a beryllohlte. *' very nicely cut,” In its facetted form indistinguishable from ; rock erysta.1; •* the very rare green va* riety of spodumene," and many more. Plants and flowers have another corner in his heart, and'a frequent mention in bis diary; a specimen of a rare plant from South Devon charms him, ‘ as well as :	rambles in search of the earliest tilbs-
i soms, which he names always by their
■	botanical names. His versa.tility perhaps could not better be summed up than by the entry he makes of one July day in his life:
Mr. Siittxnaji, with whom I have had I sonic correspondence of late about Greeco I and squirrels, told me to-day that Watts I had said to him: ** If I had been a3 well r taught as Titian I should have been a I far greater painter." Un fler mot!
f Tbtrre Is a certain touch of actuality ■ In these ra-mbllDj^ records ttiat gives them Interest. And while Sir Mountstuart ; Grant Duff will probably never emerge.
[as a very striking figure in contemporary* English history, his diaries show him. as: a man In contact with some of the most Interesting phases of life at many poinf-a
