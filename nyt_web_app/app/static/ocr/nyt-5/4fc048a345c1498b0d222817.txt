Not- a Very Notable Contribution to the English Men of Letters Series.*
THOUT the humor of Irving or the fire of Motley or the Intimate touch of Parkman/’ says Prof. Peck of Prescott,
" he la superior to all three in poise and judgment and dis--tlnction/* So the professor places the author of 14 Ferdinand and Isabella” at “the head'ot all American historians.’' The estimate is based frankly enough on one of many conceptions of what history ought to be, and it is no part of the reviewer’s business to oppose it “ Poise, judgment, distinction ” are aU ad-mlrabla qualities, and if there are other qualities which have-helped to make great histories, and if we ourselves prefer that other kind of great history,’ let. us recall what Prescott himself said of Carlyle—or Tather wrote to Bancroft, who had loaned him “ The French Revolution ,,
I return you Carlyle with my thanks. I have read as much of him as I could stand. After a very candid desire to relish him I must say X do not at all. .’’The French Revolution ” is a most lamentable comedy, and requires nothing but the simplest statement of facts to freeze one’s, ■blood. To attempt to color so highly what nature has already overcolored is, it ap-
Sears to me. in very bad taste and pro-uces a grotesque and ludicrous effect.
*	*	* Then such ridiculous affecta-.
tions of new-fangled, "words! Carlyle is ever a bungler in his own business, for his creations or rather combinations are the most discordant and awkward possible. As he runs altogether for dramatic or rather picturesque effect he is not to be challenged, I suppose, for ; want of refined views. This forms no part of his plan... His views certainly, so far as I can estimate them, are trite enough. And, in short, the whole thing, both as to forme and fond,, is perfectly contemptible.
This merely to show how doctors (and historians) disagree. A demand for *■ refined views in writing history (of the French Revolution) is an echo of that Victorian age which objected to the plain j way of calling spades by name. Such a demand fits well enough . with Prof, Peck’s “ poise and judgment and distinc- 1 tion.” It does not fit the age of Kipling. The inference, of course, subtracts 1 nothing from Prescott, it merely recalls the notorious futility of all attempts to ■ arrange climaxes of literary merit.	j
. It cannot be said that Prof. Peck shows any marked fitness for the task he has j undertaken as Prescott’s biographer. For the most- part. his narrative is plain pedestrian '* copy " quite lacking in the distinction which the author praises In the historian, equally lacking in •• fire"*-’ and the “ intimate touch.” It seems, however, on the whole a fair and serviceable biography of One of the most interesting figures In American literature.
William Hlckling Prescott "was born of a distinguished. New England family at Salem in 1796, The elder Prescott was wealthy, (and growing wealthier,) and the son was reared under yery cheerful conditions. He was no little spoiled, in fact, for his parents had departed widely from the ancient Puritan rigor/ At Harvard, whither he went in 1811, he seems at first to have led a pretty gay life—to which, however, Prof. Peck refers in very vague terms,	-	.
In his second year at college, while tho students in Commons Hall were engaged in the immemorial academic amusement of throwing things from the table at each other, Prescott was hit in the left eye by a liardflung breadcrust The blow not only deprived him of the sight of that eye, but gave his nervous system such a shock and so affected the other eye that for most of the rest of his life he was unable to use his sight in reading or writing. This effect, however, was not immediate.
He was able to return (somewhat sobered) to college after an interval, and was' graduated in 1814. It was in 1815 that the right eye began to give trouble. For a time he could not use it at all, but afterward except at intervals he saw well enough to move about like other people.
All his life he was especially iond of riding and walking, and he did both alone.
For his health’s sake and his eyes* sake Prescott went soon after to the West Indies and to Europe, where he spent two years. He had. intended himself for the lawr but that was now out of the question. Upon his retuni to America he set valiantly about a course of reading—a course not precisely planned, but one which as it developed with use led in the end to his life work. This reading was of necessity pursued chiefly through other men’s eyes, and it embraced English literature, at large, Latin, French, Italian, and Spanish. Fortunately he had no need ‘at any time in his career to concern himself with bread winning.
It is not necessary here to follow the events of Prescott’s life closely. For a while- after. ;his misfortune he secluded turned to his old delight in his friends’ turned to his old delight in his friend's company, though he reduced his life to a very rigid system and rarely went to other men’s houses. He rode in the morning, worked for several hours with

bis secretary, rode or walked again In they afternoon. He had married (in 1820) Sn-' san Axnory, daughter of a merchant of" Boston, in which city and at his country f .places ^tNahant and at'Pepperell most' of his life was* spent,	.
Prof. Peck shows at gome length how, Prescott, following’ his studious : pro-!
-	gramme, • grew by degrees toward 'his vocation. His first writings—published in Tho North American Review—showed" little promise; in fact, the papers and essays which he contributed to that . ..periodical for many years are not remarkable. His taste for history of the glamourous and. heroic type'had always been strong. His study of Spanish brought liim close to the. fascinations of those most romantic and gloriously adventurous days when Spain was'at the pinnacle of her fame—the days of the conquest of Grenada and the discovery of America, Thence, after ten years spent In having hooks and manuscripts collected in Spain and elsewhere, in laborious reading and note taking, in sifting and digesting; and finally in writ-ingt (with his own hand by means of an Instrument called a. " noctograph/*) came " Ferdinand and Isabella,” which made Prescott's fame at once, with the critics at home and abroad no less than with the people. Afterward came ‘ “ The Conquest of * Mexico/’ likewise laboriously studied and prepared, which Prof. Peck, following the general opinion, ranks high-•est of all Prescott’s work. He regards it, too, as truthful history, save wherein, as the Aitecs are seen through Spanish eyes,' their institutions are expressed in European terms at best approximations. • That is, Prof. Peck, admits that Montezuma was not really an Emperor—any more than Powhatan in Virginia, was really an Emperor—-though the Aztec civilization was far in advance of that of.the, savage and astute chiertain who was so near beating out the brains of doughty John Smith. Prof. Peck notes, of course, the circumstance that Washington Irving yielded this Mexican subject to his half-blfnd countryman, and the graceful man-' ner in which the thing was done. •
In the same ornate and stately fashion
Tho Conquest of Peru ** was written, -and lastly the unfinished ** Philip II./* Which was the ripest fruit of so much -labor. Motley, whose view of Philip is as the world knows quite different, spoke with deep appreciation of what Prescott had done 'in ■ a'.field which' touched so closely upon his own. ........ .
. Prof. Psqk, by the way, does not forget to recore how Thackeray, when lie. caiue to America, was first entertained at Prescott's house.	'	'
Not the least interesting part of the book is the account of Prescott's visit to.JEng-and an 1S30, the honor with which he was universally received, and the great
he met- deluding Queen Victoria. At dinner, at the house of Lora Carlisle, writes Prescott, I was as near the Queen as at our own family table.- She has a good appetite, and laughs merrily. She has fine eyes and teeth,- but is short *■
Which shows that the blind historian was only blind In liie study. It is good to lememter him so, and not altogether os the man who in spite of one of the worst of human ills'managed to leave a handsome mark behind him. For he was always a cheerful man. with a liking for the things that other cheerful men like. Prescott died in 1859.
