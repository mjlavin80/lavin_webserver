BOSTON NOTES.
Theodore Roberts's “ Brothers of Peril 99—New Poetry by Bliss Carman—Some Autumn Announcements.
r Indian boy, brave, astute, and modest, such a pearl as the early European settlors found here and there on the eastern coast of North America, divides the interest of Mr. Theodore Roberts's "Brothers of Peril” with the real hero, the young adventurer whom various chances set on the Island of Newfoundland just as the Bcothic tribe, having grown large enough to develop more than one able chief, is breaking into factions. The boy, a chief’s son, begs to be taken to see the white man’s country, and, being accepted as a comrade, serves his friend nobly. The author in no way imitates Mr.
C.	G. D. Roberts, but he is developing a love of natural beauty that may lead him In the direction of " The Heart of the Ancient Wood.”

?ilr. Bliss Carman, self-exiled from New York, and secluded from the Californians who would like to show that they can admire some one besides the late Mr. Bret Harte, is .staying on the Pacific Coast, and working at" his new volume of poetry, " From the Book of the Valentines,*' the fifth in the "Pipes of Pan” scries. The third volume of his prose essays, " The Poetry of Life." is also undergoing revision, and both will appear in the Autumn.
All three books will be published by Messrs. L, O. Page & Co., w-ho will also issue an American edition of the little book privately put forth in 1003, by Mr, Richard Le Gallienne, under the title ** Odes fFom the Divan of Hafiz." Those to whom copies were sent praised the work enthusiastically, apd Mr. Wilfred Scawen Blnnt described it as " the quintessence of !vric poetry."

Among the Autumn editions *»r cJ^ssins in gift-book form will be the •* Memoirs of Benvenuto Cellini," from Roscoe’s translation, revised by Lulgl Ricci, and illustrated by four photogravures; a port-trait of Cellini, the portrait bust of Cosmo I., the celebrated salt cellar executed for Francis I., and the Perseus. Two English novelists will swell the list of Autumn reprints, Mr. E. F. Benson with *• Valkyries,’* and the Rev. S. Baring Gould with ” Siegfried.’1 The former book has illustrations by Mr. T, Noyes Lewis, and Mr. Charles Robinson has made the pictures for the latter.

The C. M. Clark Company is to publish, a novel by Mr. Matt. Stan. Kemp, the author of “ Boss Tom,” the novel of the anthracite strike produced by the Saal-field Company. The title has not yet been chosen from the many presenting themselves as suitable to a book of somewhat complex Interest.
Miss Ethel D. Puffer's “ The Psychology of Beauty,’* published by Messrs Houghton, Mifflin & Co., consists of eight papers, of which “Criticism and Aesthetics,” ” TheLAesthetic Repose” and "The Beauty of Ideas” have appeared in the Atlantic Monthly and the International Monthly. The others are "The Nature of Beauty,” ” The Beauty of Fine Art,” “ The Beauty of Music,” ” The Beauty of Literature,” and " The Nature of the Emotions of the Drama.* The mere titles indicate that the author has taken st very wide field; in truth, she has brought together the results of recent experiments with aesthetic elements, the various university and personal investigations Into the physiological psychology of aesthetic reactions, the great body of curious studies of the genesis and development of art forms, has added some experiments of her own, and. has endeavored to make a synthesis of these tendencies in the study of beauty to the end of making that a philosophical* intelligible theory of beauty.	*

Messrs. H. M. Caldwell & Co. are preparing a great -number of reprints for the holiday trade as is their custom, but they are also making ready a variety of other books, among which are ” The Value of Courage/* edited by Mr. Frederic Lawrence Knowles, who has given the book a Bcholarly introduction, and " The Value of Simplicity/' edited by Miss M. A. Barrows, provided with an Introduction by Mrs. Julia Ward Howe.	.

The series of ** Animal Autobiographies '* will be continued—” Yoppy," by Mrs. Mol, lie Lee Clifford; #* Nettie,** by Miss Gertrude Seloo, and ” Pup/* by Miss Ollie Hurd Bragdon. Pup is a gray hound, Yoppy a monkey, and Nettie a donkey.
1 The additions to.the Pleasant Street Series will be “JLUtle Hiidred’s Secret,*’ by Grace Squires, announced. early in tbe' year; "*raie8^ ©t Two *Perrtfer£ Crib
and Fly,” by Mr. Charles Welch, and ** The Bird Hospital," by Mrs. Caroline Crowninshield Baseom.
Mr. John R. Carling's 14 The Weird Picture," which appears this weok. is a tale of murders and ghosts and other fearful wild fowl, and of underground passages. This last feature, although not exactly new ir. English stories, may be i^ardcd as fortunate, inasmuch as the English papers abound in gossip about l>ano‘s Holes, in Essex, and some other places, and readers will accept almost anything subterranean as possible.
The—postponed publication of "The Breath of the Gods." by the author of ** Truth Dexter," is to take place to-mor- j row, and, inasmuch as me American Minister to Japan in 1004 and certain French diplomatists were last week mentioned as characters, it is necessary to siry that a prefatory note from the author declares that all the incidents are purely imaginary. The remarks made by peasants and servants arc the only part of th** story borrowed from life. The book is dedicated,
** because of faith and reverence." to Yamato Damashii.
Following these two will come the last novel in Messrs. Little, Brown & Co.’s Spring list, Mr. E. Phillips Oppt nJiclm's " The Master Mummer." This book adds one more to the imaginary realms now arranged in layers over the entire extent of Central and Southern Europe. The Princess of Bartena is the heroine, the " Master Mummer " the hero of the tale. In future this house will be Mr. Oppen-heim’s sole publisher, and will probably issue two of his novels annually, that being his yearly product, almost perforce. Cor when the English novel reader is once accustomed to receiving two books a year from-an author, he regularly demands two from the circulating libraries, and almost compels their production.
