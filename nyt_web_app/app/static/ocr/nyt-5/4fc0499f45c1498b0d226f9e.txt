■	the cf feet produced upon liim is precisely the effect that-Is Intended-*-that he Is left purposely in the clever maze which the author has devised for his entanglement. If such Is not the explanation of the Illog-leal ending- of the' book, there is only one other tenable—that Mr. .Picard's courage failed him at the last moment and he adopted the expedient of throwing the ro-' sponslbility on_ the reader,
! Perhaps this hypothesis is not wide of -| the mark. If it be true, Mr. Picard is/en-1 titled .to a certain consideration. • The late Mr. Stockton employed this method' of -evading- the responsibility in his " The Lady or the Tiger?” and others have done likewise and been forgiven. But the . particular thing for which one does not' feel . like forgiving Mr. Picard is his neglect—it has. eyery. appearance of design on his part—to' tell us _ frankly whether it was tho .Rev. Stephen Essex who abandoned his^ Methodism or Sarah Macleod who abjured her Catholicism. As.it stands, one must be either a Methodist or a Roman Catholic to answer the question. If *one ■ be a Methodist, it is plain enough that Stephen., remained theologically unimpaired, and If one bo a Catholie .it is equally certain that Sarah did not yield. And that, I am convinced, is the very obscuration that was' Intended,-	j.	k.	L.

When one has finished reading it he cannot help feeling that he has been dealt with unjustly, -that he hafi' been defrauded-of something he had every-, reason to dxpect. If it were not for the story's charro . and originality.- an elusive’' fascination that lures one on to the last: .word, it would not matter so,much,
