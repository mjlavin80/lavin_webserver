Dr. 'William Barry’s W®y of Looking at the Author of the-** Life -of Jesus.** *
L. BARRY’S volume on Renan falls several points short' of being satisfactory as an exposition of the reality behind the man who was an*, atheist, " devoutly and with a sort of unction." To tell the truth. Dr. BarTy belcngs to the race of biographers who by forgetting in the delight of psychic analysis the necessary more humanness of their heroes—the commonness of their day with ours—rather befog the man of their choice than realize him to the reader. Especially such biographers (and Dr. Barry) have a way of dressing up the crises of the man’s mental life in a subtlety of words. They seem reluctant to reduce the reaction to plain, everyday terms.
I So when Ernest Renan. Dorn Breton peasant, imbued in early childhood with the simple faith of his kind, brought up by the Church and trained for the priesthood. begins to change to the sentimental ** devout atheist," the process is invested by Dr. Barry with complexities and mistinesses which, while they may well have . existed for the mind in doubt, should not be allowed to blur the student’s comprehension of the real issue. 2n general the effect of the book is not of the presentation of a man, but of the use of a human figure to illustrate certain ideas. For instance, Renan is primarily not Renan, but the modern Abelard, the incarnation of the Celtic spirit, lie is reduced (or elevated. as you please) to a type. Nevertheless the thing modern men most want to know about the author of “ The Life of I Jesus “ is not at all what he typifies, (or may be made to typify.) racially or mentally, but what manner of man he was.
So much having been said, (less by way of criticism than by way of explanation,) ii may be added that of Renan the idea (his idea of him) Dr. Barry has written some excellently readable and true things. We may lay aside as irrelevant the notion that Renan incarnates the Celtic attitude of irresolution between yea and nay, we may pass over as unimportant the idealization of his processes of change from believer to unbeliever in Christian dogma, wo may fail to hold with Dr. Barry where he compares Newman with Renan and insinuates (without say-
Iing so) that the Englishman’s conclusion of the logical necessity of a seemingly illogical faith is the truth which the Frenchman missed by following what he thought severe logical processes. For all these are matters of widely divided opinion. Few of us. however, will dispute the value of Dr, Barry's summing up of the real significance of the famous 4* Life
I of Jesus.” published in June, 1863, a world scandal in a few weeks, and sold to the extent of sixty-five thousand copies by November. " On all sides men looked upon the volume as a banner, lifted up, which must be attacked or defended."
What. then. had Renan achieved?
B Something great. if not portentous. Thanks to his unrivaled command of language, to the color of his description, to the suavity of a sentimentalism which enchanted without rhetoric, he had transformed the Gospels into a publication of the day. * * * The “ Hebrew truth," to speak with St. Jerome, had been softened down to an idyl, which was not truly Eastern, but which corresponded to the decadent mood of ” Paul and Virginia.” and was sometimes more than a little cloying in its oversweetness.
That which was instantly admired and . which alone will not be forgotten in the " Life of Jesus,” was the Galilean epi-
Isode. The landscape gave birth to the character, not any well-interpreted documents. But again the character may be traced in Renan’s own history, with its varying stages; Brittany is the key to Nazareth, Paris shadows forth Jerusalem, By “ gently soliciting ” the inspired text
*	*	• Renan put together, in mosaic
fiishion. a sentimental romance which was colored from end to end by his own experience.
Thereafter Dr. Barry quotes contemporary commentators. Carlyle ” disliked the book and wished it had not beeo written.” ” Das ist nichts.” said German Tholuck. " Fwald and Keim were severe upon this romance * which professed to j deal with great questions, but which an-
Iswered none.’ *’ Mommsen, on the other ! hand, said Renan was ** a savant in spite of his beautiful style.”
So I>r. Barry proceeds to explain the : Renanian performance:	i
When tlie Romans besieged an enemy’s city they called on its tutelar gods to leave tt and follow them to the Capitol. This unhappy fugitive from the Christian ! altar was busy with a like incantation. He desired to make the Prophet of Nazareth an idealist who had set liiin the example. a free spirit in revolt against the hierarchy. The cause of Jesus was to be severed from that of the Church and to be identified with revolution. •	*	*
The supernatural would be vanquished if Jesus were left in his enemies’ keeping. But rebels have never known how to deal with a captive King, except to make way with him, and so it proved now.
The writer makes the meaning of this somewhat dark saying clearer by another passage:
From a scandal so arresting, and of such proportions, which has been perpet-

uated in thirty-three editions at home, with translations and cheap issues- in every European language, one result, hardly anticipated by its author, is becoming daily more evident. The “ Life of Jesus,” passing from technical theology, from catechisms and sermons, into literature, vindicates to itself an importance as the first. In every sense, of human biographies* and the centre of history. Between sacred and profane, the old wall of division has been broken down. It is Impossible for any man to explain the world without fixing his regard on Jesus. He is real to the present generation, even to those who do not believe, as He never was to the Voltairian or freethinker of a previous age. Theologians comprehend in a more vivtd fashion than ev^r before that creeds and dogmas are but aspects of His words. His works. His personality. Critics know that they have to deal with Him as a fact.
Naturally Dr. Barry descends sometimes from sermonizing on the text *' Rinan ” to narrative. He iells something of the life of the peasant lad who was born at Trfeguier in 1823, of what he learned from the good fathers in that I town, of his student life in Paris, at Issy, and SL Sulpice. of the loyal help and brave advice given him by his sister Hen-| riette, of his giving up the priestly life | after taking the tonsure, of his travels in Ttaiy and Syria, of the public scandal of his first lecture when he assumed the Chair of Hebrew in the Coll&ge de France in lStfci. of his further travels and his later life in Paris, lived like the rest of his life “ in a mental intoxication.” '* The renegade of St. Sulpice," says Dr. Barry,
” was now a somewhat worldly minded man, or as a witty friend called him, ‘ the dandy of the exegesis,’ compelled to look on while Paris was burning.”
We need not here follow Dr. Barry in his remarks upon Renanism as expressed in the “St. Paul,” (1869;) “The AntiChrist,” (who is Nero.) published In 1873; the “ Reminiscences of Youth,” (1833;)
” Philosophic Dramas," (188G.) and the “ History of Israel." (1888.)
Renan was elected to the French Acad--emy in 1878. making upon that occasion an address after his best manner. He died in 18U2.
