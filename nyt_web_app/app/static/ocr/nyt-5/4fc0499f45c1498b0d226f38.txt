Hiirm Jan Huidekoper was a young Hollander, a member of an old family that imiudes a noble branch, and has furnished the Netherlands with high public officials and other men of prominence, who moved to this country in 170*1 and gradually rose to considerable i wealth. But of more importance' to the j estimate of his importance in our history I is the fact that he was one Of the founders ] of American I’nitarianism, and a close friend of such men as William Henry Channing and James Freeman Clarke. The latter married one of his daughters, Anne. His son Frederic was the founder and first head of the MeSdville Theological School, an Institution which still con-j tinues to have great influence in liberal j religious circles. Among his living grand-I children may be mentioned Gen. Henry
■	Shippen Huidekoper, once Postmaster of I Philadelphia. To the teeming multitudes I that constitute the population of our present-day Repuoltc the man’s name is hardly even known. Yet he labored faithfully and well, was instrumental in the developing of vast regions that now
I are counted among the most prosperous in the land, and helped to establish institutions that continue to be useful in I the never-ending upward struggle of man-I kind. And his biographers are able to say | of him, although he had been dead since I IS.'H. that “ he is still a vital influence B in the community where he was revered I and loved.” As agent for the Holland I Land Company, an association of Dutch I capitalists that owned l.oOO.oOO acres of I land in New York State (including the en-1 tire site of the present City of Buffalo')
I and r»00,000 acres in Western Pennsylvania. he had intimate and praiseworthy connection with the work of building up i the region west of the Alleghanies.	|
Much of the material embodied in this 8 volume has been drawn from an autobiography prepared by Huidekoper for the , benefit of his grandchildren, which contains highly interesting details in regard to the conditions and appearance of this country at the end of the eighteenth century. That was in the days when Trenton, N. Y., was known as.Olden-barneveld and as the home of Dr. Francis Adrian van der Kemp, a friend of Huide-koper, of John Adams, and of De Witt Clinton, whose life work consisted in the translation of the records of the Dutch West India Company, owned by the State of New York. BuffaJo was a pretty village, and Pittsburg an insignificant town where the traveling Huidekoper witnessed the abortive attempt of two Frenchmen lo establish a shipyard for the building of ocean-going ships. Of New York City, young Huidekoper writes in his letters home:
" The pigs and cows running about the streets first disgusted me, and the more
I saw of the town the more I realized its inferiority to the majority of our Dutch j cities. Even the fashionable promenade j of tbe Battery, of \vhio"h om* hears so , much, has nothing to boast of except the view over Station Island and the river.”
Huidekoper was a close friend cf Capt. Perry, too. and an eye-witness of that famous commander's struggle to fit out the little flew that afu-rwa rd took part in the battle of I.akc ICrie. The hook is , full of instructive and charming reminis- . tences of those early days, as well as of later ones, when Brook Farm existed and j provoked the otherwise tolerant Huide- ; koper into referring to it as " a hospital cf invalids.”
