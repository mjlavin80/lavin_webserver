CHILLER is the German poet par excellence. Goethe, when he is himself. Is a world-poet, and- in some respects has more significance for the outside world than for Germany. Heine, when he la pure Heine, is *' universally human," and when he is	the other thing, is most distinctly
Heinesqu-3. But Schiller in all his qualities, good, bad, and Indifferent, is German from the finger tips to th.-‘ heart's core. He represents German idealism, the German struggle for liberty against bureaucratic tyranny, German domesticity, and even German sentimentality. Above all he has the German capacity of dealing with the abstract as if It were the real, an 1 the German tendency to formula and formalism.
He is especially the representative figure of the German poetic movement of the last quarter of the eighteenth century. He is the foremost fighter In the struggle of the emancipated German intellect and German fancy from the French shackles In which they had been enmeshed.
Not that he had not forerunners in that part of his activity which we may term his " Sturm und Drang '* period. His great friend and rival Goethe himself produced In his ,r Werther" and *' Goetz ” characteristic products of the same spirit of revolt
with which the earlier career of Schiller Is associated. Even the* *' RItterdrama *' which crowded the stage after “ Go^tz ” was in its obscure measure an appeal to the romantic and emancipatory feelings which g Schiller tried to evoke. The school of Sainte-Beuve and Taine perhaps attempts too much in trying to prove thu.t all great men are products of their age, since they also help to produce their age, but as applied to Schiller the formula holds good as well aa any formula can. Much that is characteristic In his utterances can be explained by the time and the clime in which they were first uttered*	‘
Remember the deadening circumstances under i which German Intellect had lain for the preceding century and a half. Not a poet of even the third rank had appeared except possibly Lessing. Prose writers were mainly occupied with the philosophy of history, like Herder, or with the theology of history, UKfe Lessing. Apart from his earlier contemporaries, Schiller had to>depend for poetical nourishment In his own language on Klopstock, Klleist, and Haller. No wonder he was a revolutionist in poetry. And If he looked abroad the chief spiritual influence then reigning in Europe, that of the semi-sane Swiss, Jean Jacquos Rousseau, tended to subvert all.the conventions and hide-bound pedantries that were governing all of the German Courts, in one of which Schiller was destined to receive his first Impressions of the world. The stress of his life'under the martinet discipline of Duke Karl Eugen ot Wiirtemberg were enough to have made any poetical soul a rebel.
I His father had risen from the ranks in society and ! in the army. He appears originally to have belonged *: j to the guild of barber surgeons who were privileged.^4' to draw blood both intentionally and unintentionally,^ and In that capacity, had been for some time a aortal of surgeon in the Bavarian hussars, from which he^I migrated to the Wtlrtemberg army, where he earned
; under the personal notice of Duke Karl Eugen, one of p i the most characteristic products of Little Germany.^ *He was one of those benevolent despots who attempt-,^}

It was while Schiller was still, a student at the military academy that he wrote his “ Robbers,” (” Pie R£.uber/*) partly tinder the influence of Leisewitz, " Julius von Tarent,” and still more under the repressed feelings of revolt against the pedantic tyranny of the Duke. In itself It is mainly a piece of rant with the crudest notions both of plot and characterisation, and would fail to reach stage honors even in a bam nowadays. f|’. But for its time It was epoch-making. It f^broke free from the French classical tra-; Editions, it dealt with real human feelings,
•	however abnormal and exaggerated, and ^ expressed the claims of the individual to
-	express himself with such novel force that it'ls no wonder It captured all young Germany. In a measure it expressed the Ideas of the contemporaneous revolution in America just coming to a close, and the subsequent French Revolution put into action. It was something for a student of the military academy to express even In dramatic form the conviction that if Germans were men enough, Germany would soon be a republic, compared with which Rome and Sparta would be nunneries. It is scarcely to be wondered at that Schiller dreaded the wrath of the Duke, who had four years before put into prison Schubart, one of Schiller’s poetical predecessors, for giving utterance to sentiments even less violent than these. Schiller fled the servitude of a military surgeon's life upon which he had just entered, and escaped to Mannheim, where his play was to be produced, and where he had hopes of earning a living as a theatre hack.
On the whole the Duke turned out to be not quite so black as Schiller's imagination had painted him. He still kept Schiller’s father in his employ, and so far . as Is known did not make any attempt to prosecute Schiller himself for his breach of conduct and practical desertion of military duty. But the awe in which Schiller stood of the ” benevolent tyrant ” remained with him for several years, and he wandered at>out from Mannheim to Lzip-sic. and from Leipsic to Dresden, writing dramas for the Mannheim stage. Two of these carried on in other directions the spirit of revolt expressed so well though so crudely in " The Robbers.”
The subject of “ Fiesco,” who headed a revolt against the Republic of France, had been suggested by a chance remark of Rousseau's, and the drama itself shows a much firmer grasp of stage scenery and a fuller knowledge of human nature, natural enough in the couple of years that bad elapsed since his first work bad appeared.
“ Kabale und Liebe " <" Intrigue f-^d Love ”) was even a further advance in dramatic capacity. Schiller showed here that he icould beat the contemporary dramatists like Iffland op their own ground, and tothwithstanding some crudities of plot formation, the book of the play showr*d quite a remarkable ttiitght for a youth who had been brought up practically in a monastery. The influence of the Duke's mistress was obvious In the | intrigue side of the play. Its Jove epi- ! sodes were inspired by Charlotte von Kalb, for Schiller had at any rate this supreme qualification for the poetical gift, that he was intensely susceptible to the ; charms of sex. With “ Kabale und Liebe” his period of revolt in its crudest form was to some extent over. Hr had found himself and obtained a reputation as the representative voice of the struggling spirits of Yount Germany.
"With his ‘ Hegira** to Leipsic, where he found a congenial circle and Koerner the father of the poet, a new spirit becomes manifest in the poet's activity. When for the first time he came into contact with congenial spirits, the result was seen in one of his finest lyrical outbursts, " An die Freudb.” This ** Hymn < to JoyM was in a measure the Spring
Mng^f^modern Germa^poetry. - Lyrics-
.ikve beeii written by'l^ssIhg^Gottsched, and others, ^but for ttie~ mostipart-^Jhejn "were Imitative and unreal. Here fofethe>! . first tlme a true po|t(c soul gave adc*^ quate metrical expression- to real and earnest feeling. Henceforward Schiller was to be as much known for his lyrics as for his dramas, and as a matter of fact his lyrics were destined to enshrine him more in the hearts of the German peo-pie even, than his dramas. Another change came with bis stay with the. Koeraers. His outlook on life broadened, and bis next drama, “ Don Carlos/* showed a , sense of the historic conditions of the dramatic situation not to be found in ** The Robbers,” and absent inexcusably from ” Fiesco.” In ** Don Carlos,” besides the clash of human passions, he dealt with the great historic forces of religious toleration and political freed omit was here that Sehiller gave utterance to one of his finest and best-known lines,
•* Die'Weltgcsehicbte 1st eln Weltgerlcht,” (The world's history is God's Judgment on the world.)
It was only a few years before that Lessing had produced his dramatic apologue,
** Nathan der Weise,’* and in the Marquis von Posa Schiller deliberately emulated the broadmindedness of Lessing's Nathan. Unfortunately the attempt to introduce didacticism in the drama, and above all to change the point of interest from the passionate love of Don Carlos to the philosophic convictions of the Marquis spoiled the work as a drama by Increasing its effect on the current political and religious opinion. The change from the earlier dramas was Indicated artistically by Its being written in iambic blank verse Instead of the somewhat bald prose in which the earlier three dramas had been composed.
How he managed to live during these *' Lehrjahre ** of his It is difficult to ascertain. For his plays he seems to have been paid at the munificent rate of about $5 for sixteen pages. He produced poetical year booKs entitled “Thalia," but the printing expenses nearly exhausted any possible profits. Poetry was ever a drug on the market. His friend Koerner at times came to his assistance; Baron Dal-berg, the Director of the Mannheim Theatre, gave him something for representations on the stage, but his lot was indeed an unenviable one from any worldly point of view for the seven years which intervened between his leaving his tyrant and obtaining his professorship at Jena, It I? needless to observe that it was just In the depths of his lmpecuniosity that he chose to get engaged. The hopes of all aspirants in matters literary was in those days directed toward Karl August ot Weimar, who had given such noble treatment to Goethe, Schiller visited him In 1787, but, unfortunately, Goethe was on his epoch-marking Italian journey, and so the poets
did not meet. But Goethe had, strangely enough, been pi-esent at a prize day at Stuttgart when the raw-boned Schiller had received commendation at the hands of his Duke.
Meanwhile thr studies necessary for " Don Carlos " had diverted Schiller’s attention from poetry to history, and his fragment oh " The Revolt cf the Netherlands " gave Gcethe an opportunity on his return from Italy to obtain for Schiller the professorship of history at Jena, which was to afford him the assurance ot’ a bare livelihood for the remainder of his life.
With the acceptance of the professorship in 1789 and marriage the following year, the second period In Schiller’s life begins, devoted mainly to historic and philosophic research, and leading to his immortal friendship with Goethe and the classic productions of his last years. Of his histories not much need be said. They were of that dear, abstract type which Voltaire has made so familiar to European letters. They were based on no original research, claimed no particu-lax novel point of view, but yet had the ^Immense French virtues of clearness of outline and definiteness of statement. His philosophic labors were of a somewhat higher type. The genius of Kant was then at the height of activity and ! fame, and Schiller became engrossed in the critical philosophy which seemed to release the human mind from the fetters of superstition while founding religion and morality upon a rational basis. The very absence of imaginative quality in the Konlgsberg philosopher’s dialectics had an attraction for the poet of an imagination all compact. He had at any rate the insight to anticipate modern psychologj' in one of its most striking analyses. The conception of art as the grown man's play is due to Schiller, and has been carried out into detail by writers like Herbert Spencer and Groos, while on the artistic side both Ruskin and William Morris have developed the thought In making true art the necessary outcome of Joyful ingenuity. It is somewhat curious that both great German poets should have anticipated some of the most recondite laws of biological science, Goethe with his typology and anticipations of Darwinism, Schiller with his ” Spieltrleb."
Almost simultaneously with this increased interest in h’story came the first glimpse into the magic world of Hellas which had transformed Goethe’s life. It is true fhftt Schiller had once gained a
Fchoql. --It. was VOss's Homer NWhlch gave
parallel., with the English Keats, who Icarned hls Hellenism from Chapman’s Homer, at once presents Itself. Still, his enthusiasm found expression in his fine verses ** Die Gtftter Grlechenlands,” which still'Stir the pulse as we see the Intrepid explorer first venturing Into the magic land.
The verses attracted Goethe, who had been repelled by the gaucherie of the red-haired, freckled poet, who had himself felt snubbed by the dandified, airs of the 'poet laureate of Weimar. The elder poet’s action, however, hr obtaining the professorship for Schiller naturally brought them closer together, and in 17D4 that im-i-mortal friendship began which to a certain extent may be .said to have created modem German literature. Bach poet supplied something that was lacking in the other. The somewhat cool egoism of Goethe was roused to self-forgetfulness by the idealism of the younger poet. Schiller's want of culture and breadth was remedied by the feljow-poet’s superabundance. Goethe gained fire; Schiller gained light and breadth. Goethe became less of a snob; Schiller, more of a man of the world.
It cannot, however, be said that the immediate results were beneficial or desirable. .In the exaltation of spirit to which their communion led, they determined on a series of satirical epigrams directed against almost all their contemporaries. These ” X-enlen ” are perhaps the least appreciated of either poet's productions. Some way or other the German tongue does not lend itself to biting sarcasm. The German mind seems not quick enough, the German temperament not ill-natured enough for bitter irony. But it was the indirect effects of the poet's friendship that told on one another. With the effects on Goethe we are not concerned. It made Schiller among other things the romantic balladist of German literature.
He was only transplanting in German soli a movement that had already shown itself In England. Blah op Percy’s ” Rel-Iques ” had attracted attention to the ballad poetry of Scotland and England, and the vogue of Ossian had spread throughout Europe a taste for the romantic. It was, strange to say, in the somewhat pedantic, abstract soul of Friedrich Schiller this movement was to find its most perfect expression. ** The Fight with the Dragon," '* The Cranes of Ibicus,” ** The Diver,” and ” The Pledge " are perhaps the best-known lines in German poetry. Tet it is characteristic that they are each and all didactic In "their tendency. It is the Kantian professor who speaks through the romantic lines.
These ballads, all written in the Summer of 1707, were preceded and followed by poems of a still more philosophic tendency. ” The Words of Faith,” *• Ideal of Life,” and the like are the versified ideas which attracted Young Germany toward the first half of the nineteenth century. These philosophic poems culminated in " The Song of the Bell,*’ with which it is natural to contrast and compare Poe’s marvelous poem fugue of *' The Bells.” The one deals with the periods of a man’s life In a solemn, didactic, and somewhat ponderous manner; the other presents the same periods with all the magic witchery of verbal music. One cannot but give the prize to the American. In all these lyrics the German love for abstract thought comes out and makes them characteristic German productions, while fundamentally the whole principle of poetry Is against the representation of the abstract. ** Poetry must be sensuous, simple, and passfonate," said Milton, and you cannot be any of the three about such figments of the philosophic fancy as the ideal, desire, and the like.
It was In the last five years of Schiller’s life that he arose to his greatest heights as a dramatic poet. In four out of the five dramas then produced he dealt with great historic events in the history of four of the chief European nations. In ” Wallenstein '* he gave a trilogy of the tragedy of the Thirty Years' War In Germany. The conflicts of Catholicism and Protestantism, of personal ambition and patriotism, of love and duty, were dealt with on a grand scale and with the grasp of a master. Catholicism and Protestantism on English soil had their part to play in the drama of ” Mary Stuart,” but here it was the contrast of the two Queens, Elizabeth and Mary, that gave the dramatic force to the treatment. Unfortunately for English readers, the historic background Is so false to history that it is difficult to appreciate the real dramatic power involved In the presentation. In " The Maid of Orleans ” the theme is England against France—or, rather, France against England—and we see the fruit of Goethe’s influence in the Greek nemesis that is at the root of the action. Finally in ” William Tell ” Schiller dealt once more with his favorite topic of liberty against tyranny, and this time, while nominally speaking of Switzerland he appealed to an audience that
■	was commencing to chafe against the i fetters placed upon Germanic develops meat by the iron hand of Napoleon. It is
.appropriate enough that Schiller's^ Swan Song ” should have Tjeen "one. of ^liberty. jHis ~ William Tqll ”~has been?; ever since' the most favorite of , German .classical ^dmmas- While wanting Variety of action# its vigorous denunciation of tyranny will always appeal to the lover of liberty. At the same time it Is to be observed that in all these dramas the liberty for which Schiller pleads is one based upon'‘law and order, though his earliest productions-had been imbued by the conditions which gave rise to the French Revolution. But Schiller was a Teuton at heart, he could not away with the " red fool fury of the Seine," which set at naught the claims of orderly development. . He was no where more German . than in his 'recognition of the need of strict obedence to a self-chosen Government.
Besides these original dramas Schiller did an enormous amount of work In the last few years of his life in translating and adapting dramas from foreign languages like ” Macbeth.” and even in making the necessary Changes in his friend’s ” Egmant ” to adapt it for stage representation. He left a couple of dramas in fragmentary condition, one on “ Dimet-rlus, the False Czar of Russia,” showing great promise. It Is gratifying to think that his labors reaped a due reward in the greatest popularity any German poet had obtained In bis generation, even exceeding that of Goethe. When ** The Maid of Orleans " was played at Leipsic he happened to be present, and was greeted by the whole audience, both inside the theatre and when he left it, walking through rows of men and women who received him with the reverence due to a being of another world.
Already the fell disease that was to carry him away was upon him. It was only by the most indomitable will he kept himself alive for the last three or four years. Time and again he had to desist for weeks from sheer want of strength. At the beginning of 1805 it seemed almost as if Germany was going to lose its Dioscuri, and each of the two great poets was convinced that his friend would die that year. It is a question whether Goethe could not have been better spared. Nothing that he did after 1805 was of the first rank, (the fifth act of the second part of ” Faust ” had been written before.) Schiller had been increasing in, mastery of his art up to the last, and ** Dimetrl " promised to be his most powerful drama In a purely tragic sense. But it was not to be. At the age of forty-four years, just as he had won fame, rank, and even riches as he counted riches—four hundred thalers ($300) a year!—he was taken away from the world he so enriched each year with new masterpieces.
Can we, however, say that he was taken away from the world? I observe that Mr. Wolf von Schierbrand in the April North American Review declares that Schiller's fame and influence has spread throughout Europe, and especially in the Englishspeaking world. As a rule the Englishspeaking world requires a very great effort to appreciate a foreign poet at all, and I doubt very much whether Schiller or his poetry has obtained a very deep hold In the English mind on either side of the Atlantic. True, Carlyle wrote his biography. but his biography was one of his weakest pieces of work, and written In a style utterly unlike Carlyle’s. The translations that have appeared of Schiller’s works, except Coleridge’s admirable version of part of the " Wallenstein,” have been beneath contempt. Lord Lytton was scarcely even a poetaster, and his version of Schiller’s poems and ballads is not even readable. Yet he is the only English writer who shows any real influence from Schiller. His perpetual reference to the '* terue, the goo-ood and the beyutiful,” Is undoubtedly a tribute to what is conventionally known as Schiller's idealism, in other words, his tendency to deal with pale and colorless abstractions. None of the Romance nations ever cared for any of the Teutonic poets. Schiller never appealed to any one in France or Italy except the professed students of German literature. It Is misleading, therefore, to think of him as in any sense a world poet.
But if not a world poet he is, however, the more definitively the poet of Germany. No other poet has appealed so strongly to the best and most Ideal Fide of Germany. It is true that when cne comes to the expression of the simpler emotions in the most direct of poetic language, Schiller yields both to Goethe and to Heine on the lyric side. There are no words of his equal in direct force to the *' In Allen Gipfe.ln ” of the one or the “ Du bist wie elne Blume ” of the other. But it is In his appeal to the abstract Ideals of life and thought that Schiller Is so distinctively more German than his competitors. Even here a distinction has to be made. It is the Germany and the Germans before 1848 who most thoroughly answered to Schiller's call. It was during that period that the misleading comparison between himself and Goethe was rife. It was Germany struggling against disruption, Germany panting to be free, that found in Schiller its true voice. The latter and more successful Germany does not take him at so high a value, and regards Goethe, the bureaucrat, Goethe, the man of affairs, as the true voice of thw nation, even declaring with Herman Grimm that ho was the greatest of all modem poets. But to those who see In the poorly paid pedagogue and scientist of Germany rather than in the successful soldier and business men of Prussia the most Ideal side of German life, Schiller will always represent the most distinctive form of German genius.	-	JOSEPH	JACOBS-
