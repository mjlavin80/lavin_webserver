Mr. Harbottle, who died just as his book was going to press, purposed to include all important battles of the world, and as many others as possible. He has noted, of course, all the important, and, it seems, all the unimportant battles in which British . troops have fought, and a great many important con-, flicts not involving such soldiers.	But
many other battles, especially of our later American history, he has overlooked. For instance, he omits many of the battles of our Mexican war—Vera Cruz, Cerro Cfor-do, Chapultepec, Molino del Key; various important battles of the civil war—Mobile Bay and Fort Sumter, for example; he does not mention the siege of Savannah during the Revolution. Gettysburg, too, in English fashion, he notes as a practical victory for Lee. He might have named the battle of Wounded Knee Creek, one of the last Indian fights in our history, or that at Leech Lake, the latest, and, it la to be hoped, the last fight of the kind.
There are many good things aboiit Mr. Harbottle’s book. In the first place) iet it be placed on record that he, though an Englishman, tells the truth about the
losses of the Light Brlgaae at Balaklava' The ordinary historian says, or gives thf. impression, that the brigade was practically wiped out by the Russians. In fact, however, though the British cavalry suffered severely, they were not wiped out, their loss of men amounting to less than 40 per cent.—272 out of 673. The loss of horses was very large, however.	.
It is to Mr. Harbottle's credit that he has included many little known battles of the. fierce South American wars, by which the provinces won their freedom from Spain. The battles of classical history he has noted very completely, too, and those of Continental Europe. A little more pains on his part, however, would have improved his book exceedingly. The location of the various battlefields is invariably ojnltted,	.
