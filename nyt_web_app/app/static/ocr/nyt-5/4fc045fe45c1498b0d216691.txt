HEW authors have had such an exceptional opportunity tor ' gathering material for a. "book p« that accorded to John Scudder McLain, editor of The Minneapolis Journal, who accompanied the com-ol the United States Senate on its £ tO	and	the	British	goldfields
Klondike In 1903. As a result Mr. _ a in has written an exceedingly inbook of travel, which not only Jgjtt^iHes the claims of the publishers that f&ltgliaa practically the accuracy and trust-^yrjrtTitnpgH of a public document, but it too, for its clear and well-gtold presentation 01 the conditions, needs, possibilities of the Territory. Mr. ^McLain has made his book thoroughly up 5^to date by compiling s ^atistJcal in form a-Ivtion as iate as 1004.
“■'■"VMr. McLain's observation has convinced film that the country is rich In minerals, “timber, agricultural possibilities, and fish-s, erica. Indeed, the author points out that t for years the fisheries have been more Important than the gold mines. It is surprising to find any one enthusiastic ^ about the agricultural possibilities of a
-	land that always has be#»n regarded as < one of ice and snow. A'aska and the Klondike and erold have been practically ‘i synonymous terms, yet in the Copper River region there are vast and rich deposits ~ of copper still to be exploited, and there are in this rrgion also petroleum wells in active operation.
Throughout the trip, which lasted for tpn weeks from June 20, the people of ; Almira showed every disposition to help .. the committee in its investigations and 'I were not at all backward in presenting " their grievances and disclosing their re: sources. In it all the fact stands forth ‘lioldly that the United States has been ' decidedly niggardly in helping along the development of its rich possession. Its commercial development is hampered by nothing so much as the lack of transportation facilities.
In striking contrast to this position of the XJnited States is that of the Canadian Government. The Klondike has better mining laws, and Canada has spent large amounts of money in providing good wagon roads, which have reduced freight . charg-?3 and greatly lowered the cost of living around Dawson by rendering possible the introduction of labor-saving machinery- It does not seem possible that the United States could remain unmindful of the fact that the territory for which Secretary Seward in 1867 paid Russia $7,200,000 has even under adverse conditions showed remarkable returns. The commerce of Alaska for the year ending June 30, l£KKt, amounted to over $21,000,-
000,	not including the gold output, which would add nearly $7,000,000 more. It ia officially stated that since Alaska became American territory it has exported gold, fish, and furs in about equal values to the amount of about $100,000,000, while, without counting the large sums employed in furnishing transportation to Alaska, the investments of American capital there have reached $25,000,000. The aggregate shipments of merchandise to Alaska from the United States in the same period have reached $100,000,000. V/hen Seward bought the territory the anti-expansionists set up a howl and said the United States had bought nothing but a few seals and a vast expanse of icebergs. It takes more than "seals and icebergs to develop a commerce of such dimensions, says Mr. McLain, and he adds that this is only a small beginning of what is to follow in the not far distant future. It staggers the imagination to think of what the country might do if it was helped to develop its resources to the full*
The author gives a glowing description of the sail from Seattle to Metlakahtla, Father Duncan’s wonderful community in the Territory, which was the first landing made. Here the author makes what must be a valuable suggestion to those continually in search of vacation novelties, particularly if they have the wherewithal to gratify their cravings for the unusual. He says:
The inside passage is said to resemble very much the	waters	along	the	west
coast of Norway, whose fjords have begun to attract	tourists	from	our	own
country by their rugged	and wild grand-
eur, and it seems to me that when their attractions become known for v/hat they are the ocean stretches of the archipelago between Puget Sound and the Lynn Canal are destined to constitute one of the most frequented Summer playgrounds of the world, as they	certainly are	the	most
charming. What a delightful place for a holiday cruise in yacht or launch, where quiet coves or landlocked harbors may be found for every night's anchorage, where game abounds on the islands and the waters teem with life of every kind, from the trout of the mountain streams to the sociable porpoise or the spouting whale. And not only Is there the charm of scenery, such as our continent nowhere else affords, and the opportunity for sport with rod and gun, but the hospitable and friendly native Indians, in their pictur-

If this Is startling news, imagine picking out Alaska as a Winter resort At Ketchikan, a short distance above Father Duncan's village, the thermometer rarely reaches zero, and the mean temperature Is about that of Washington, D. C. The Japan current keeps all the harbors on Its course open In Winter as well as in Summer, which ^ied ex-Gov. Swineford, who is a resident of Ketchikan, to say that if he were a resident of any State east of the mountains he would come here to spend his Winters in preference to Florida. While on the subject of climate, it might be .well to note that Mr. McLain found at Selkirk, not far from Dawson, the most successful farms in the British Tukon. One farmer there was reported to have cleared $3,000 during 1002 on his crops of hay and potatoes, for which he found a ready market in Dawson. Away up at Eagle, which Mr. McLain dilates upon as “ the city with a future," were found the best demonstrations of the agricultural possibilities of Alaska, and the gardens nearest the pole where important results were obtained. They produce large quantities or potatoes, cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce, turnips, and radishes, so that the possibility of raising such products successfully on the sixty-fifth degree of north latitude has been demon~ strated.
The restrictions on claim locating in the British Tukon guard against one man or a few monopolizing the whole of the rich mining district, while the Dominion laws are liberal to aliens, in that citizenship or first steps to naturalization are not necessary in order to take up a claim. On the Alaska side only citizens or those who have declared an intention to become citi-Eens may locate mining claims. On the American side, too, the tendency to grab everything in sight Is apparently not curbed. Mr. McLain says that, thanks to our defective mining laws, it is possible for the dog in the manger to play his part in Alaska to the limit, and he is doing it. There is nothing to prevent a single pT&spector from staking as much ground as he pleases, and where the indications are good he pleases to stake e\erything In sight. Under the same defective laws he can hold his claims Indefinitely without doing any work on them, and in nine cases out of ten is waiting in the hope that some one, thinking they have been abandoned, will file on them. Then if they prove valuable he is prepared to pounce on the one who has spent his money to prove the value of the property, and, aided by a lot of others of the same breed, compel the new-comer to pay a large sum for qult-claim or divide the output, or vacate altogether. Mr. McLain says that the Senatorial Committee took stenographic reports at all places of the recommendations of miners, merchants, and lawyers, and he says they will undoubtedly endeavor to change the laws. It appears, however, that Mr. McLain has been too sanguine on that scorc.
What Alaska needs more than any other thing at this time is transportation facilities, and Mr. McLain shows what the treasure is that is waiting to be wrested from the land.' In his chapter on transportation he shows the difference in the cost of living in the Klondike camps, where the Dominion Government has built roads, and on the Alaska side, where there are none. What these differences mean in the development of the country, he says, can be scarcely overestimated, as the road building has cut down the price of products in the Klondike one-fourth in fivt years. In the Spring of 1902, when flour was $7 a hundred in Dawson it was $32 a hundred on Chicken Creek, and so it was with bacon, potatoes, condensed milk, beef, and eggs. The trade of the entire Forty-mile District, says Mr. McLain, should be handled from Eagle, on the American side, but is practically monopolized from Dawson by the aid of a wagon road built from Dawson west to the boundary line. In Copper Centre conditions are even worse at this day, and Mr. McLain says that a Minneapolis man who recently visited that section reported hay at $600 a ton, oats and flour 35 cents a pound, butter $1 a pound, canned beef $1.25 a pound, oil $3.50 a gallon, a wash tub $8, and a joint of stove pipe $1.	^
The author does not venture to estimate how much gold there is in Alaska. There Is a saying there that " the gold is where you find it.** How much truth there is in this is proved by the find recently at Fairbanks. Fairbanks is 250 miles from Dawson and 500 miles from Nome, while the great Treadwell Mines are 700 miles from both these places. From his investigations, however, of the mineral wealth of the country Mr. McLain believes, and gives reasons for the belief, that " the business of taking gold out of Alaska h*LS scarcely commenced; that it will become a permanent industry—as permanent as coal mining in Pennsylvania—and that it will take generations to exhaust the mineral wealth of those marvelously rich and marvelously extensive gold fields,”
An extremely interesting chapter in the book is the description of the reindeer-breeding industry conducted by the Eskimos. As we have thus helped the Eskimos, : Mr. McLain thinks we snould also help the Indians, whose means of livelihood | have been try****** from them by our in-
