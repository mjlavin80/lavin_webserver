The purpose of this book is to bring before its readers some account of Russian life at the close of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries, and it portrays the home life at the Court of St. Petersburg under the -wholesome rule and moral influence of a wise and virtuous woman. Marie Feodorowna has the distinction of having reigned and ruled during the lives of three successive sovereigns, thus earning the right to bear the proud title of *' A Mother of Czars.”
In this "sketch” of the life of the wife of Paul I. and mother of Alexander
I.	and Nicholas I. of Russia, Mrs. Col-quhoun Grant has sought to dwell on the pleasing rather than on the dark side of Russian life.- She obtained her material from various works, both Russian and French. The first part of the present volume and the account of the prolonged tour which the Grand Duke and Duchess took when they visited the principal Courts of Europe as the ** Comte and Comtesse du Nord ” have been translated from the *' Life of the Baronne d’Oberklrch,” edited by her grandson, the Comte de Montbrisson. The Baronne d’Oberkirch was Marie Feodorowna^ devoted friend, who accompanied her on the tour and described it.
Before her marriage to Paul I. Marie Feodorowna was the Princess Dorothea of Wurtemberg. She reigned as Czarina for five years, her husband having been assassinated by conspirators, and her son, Alexander I., then ascending the throne. She died in November, 1828, in the seventieth year of her age. “ A Mother of Czars ” bears the imprint of E. P. Dutton & Co.
