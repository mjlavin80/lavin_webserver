There are almost as many false clues to the great robbery of Mrs. Van Suyden’s jewels as one has fingers and thumbs, and tho gullible reader, keen on the scent, barks madly up one tree after another only to find a few pages further on a perfectly sure clue in un absolutely different direction. This being the case, we have no hesitancy In pronouncing this story of " The Van Suyden Sapphires " an exceedingly interesting tale in spite of its thinning out toward the end. There are, after all, few detective stories that do not have weak links in their chains, and so the dragging in of the French maid Kstelle in tins instance and her foolish murder of the master criminal' may be overlooked.
The whole thing began with a young actress, Elida Yeats’s desire for notoriety* She had been inviied as a guest at the house party of Mrs. Van Suyden at her country home, Onyx Court. That in itself was an excellent advertisement, but Elida meant to have her name more loudly, trumpeted than by merely being a guest at a fashionable gathering. Therefore she borrowed from the jeweler Sonnen-thal a magnificent necklace of rubies with the intention of having It robbed while at Onyx Court. Sfie herself, for the sake of surety, planned to commit the theft, and as messenger to return the gems to their rightful owner she selected Miss Gwendolen Eustacia Bramble-stone, also a guest at the house party. Miss Bramblestone's part ^n the affair was merely to hand the necklace to Mr. Sonnenthal, and for this she was to receive a large and substantial reward. Miss Bramblestone was poor, and so she fell.
But had it been only the rubies that were stolen out of the safe at Onyx Court all might have been well, but the ancestral Van Suyden sapphires disappeared at the same time, and thereupon the web of evidence begins to knit.
Naturally, Miss Bramblestone (who tells the story in the first person) gets mixed up unpleasantly; also for a while the reader wags his head and rolls his eyes wisely in the direction of the. gay Ellda; then, too, there is another guest, a fiery haired gentleman who somehow seems to be no gentleman, and who, on the whole,
: Is a suspicious character. Besides these > there is a young farmer who is very ! polite to Miss Bramblestone, and who helps her out of a dilemma at the very outset, • when, in a panic of fear, she tries to throw the rubies intnisted to her care out of a train window, in the belief that she is carrying the sapphires instead; and later we see this same farmer as a sort of automobile Raffles. Baggerly. the red-haired guest, becomes more and more the object of Gwendolen’s suspicion and Gwendolen becomes more and more the object of Baggerly’s suspicion, and so the merry chase goes on, with Harry ; Glenn, the automobile Raffles, darting in I and out of the storyi to make confusion worse confounded, and Sonnentlial playing all quietly in the dark until almost the very last chapter. And for the sake of his feminine readers Mr. Carey lias sweetened his story, so to speak, with a dash of love, manifested in the steadfast devotion of Captain Duncan McCracken to Gwendolen, which, in the face of the most appalling circumstantial evidence against her, remains unshaken.
