IDNEY McCALL’S new book. '•The Breath of the Gods." might properly have Mr. Kipling's lines on " the fool that tried to hustle the East ” for Us motto, for its whole burden is the impossibility of changing Japanese nature by education evolved by the Occidental mind and heart, and the hopeless futility of endeavoring to turn aside the high resolve of the Oriental intent upon his Ideal of duty, patriotic or religious. The American characters are the Minister to Japan in 1004: one of his secretaries, his wife and daughter; the daughter’s Japanese schoolmate, and the handsome French secretary of legation whom she loves.

of recent years.
Messrs. Little, Brown & Co. will issue
the book to-morrow.

Its companion will be Mr. Roger Po-cock’s M Curly." The Yankee's natural aversion to a useless quarrel, leads him to avoid the Irish land question as a subject of fiction, inasmuch as he knows that he cannot possibly treat it without displeasing both parties in the actual dispute, but, being English, Mr. Pocock has no such scruples, and his book is chiefly concerned with one of the cases in which the tenant’s hatred of bis landlord survives emigration. and causes him to follow any road that leads to vengeance.

Remembering the case of the James boys and certain other well-attested criminal cases, it does not seem prudent to deny the possibility of any of Mr. Po-cock's tales of wild adventure, and no one of his humorous stories surpasses those related in Mr. Andy Adams’s three books, by Mr. David Sponsilier, who does not retract one word of them even to-day. when he Is a Quiet resident of Colorado City. Mr. Adams’s publishers—Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co.—announce the seventh printing of Miss Margaret Sherwood's " Daphne ” and the third of Miss Edith Rickerts " The Reaper," and of "The Matrimonial Bureau,” by Miss Carolyn Wells and Mr. Harry P.

This book differs from its author’s first novel in having a serious love affair for Its chief interest, although many of its chapters are as purely comic as the tale of Mrs. Jim’s own courtship. The scene is one of those small towns in which nothing can be hidden, and most of the characters live in the additional light which blazes in a church and Sunday school organization. Mrs. Jim’s opportunities for arranging the love affairs of persons of differing ages arc manifold, and not one does she neglect, and the curtain falls upon a village deeply interested In the question ** How one may be happy though married.’’	m	m

Messrs. John W. Loco & Co., being now established In their new quarters in the Rogers Building, are busily engaged In preparing a volume of " Epigrams and Aphorisms,” - drawn from the novels, plays, essays, and other prose of the late Oscar Wilde, and containing all that is necessary for forming a Judgment of the man’s best abilities. To understand his moral influence it is necessary to read all his work and to know something of his time, and current comment betrays amazing ignorance In regard to both. It is customary to talk of the cosmopolitan information forced upon the newspaper reader, but when one reads some of the criticism of the aesthetic craze in general, and Wilde In particular, one wonders if the general glare of illumination may not blind rather than enlighten.
