The Macmillan Company is issuing " A Middle English Reader," edited by Prof. Oliver F. Emerson of the Western Reserve University, who has provided also a grammatical introduction, full and copious notes, and an exhaustive glossary. The volume is intended, we are told, to serve as an introduction to the language and literature of the period called Middle English; that Is, the centuries between 1100 and 1500. The introduction Is based on lectures to students beginning the study of Middle English; the selections have been arranged on the basis of the great dialectal divisions of the language during
the period—the Midland dialect, the dialects of the north, south, and the City of London, Kentish, Old Irish, Old Danish, &c.—and accompanied by explanatory notes, while the glossary, besides giving the meanings of the different words, accounts for the forms of words on the basis of the dialectal differences in Old and Middle English. Such information concerning each selection, aa. what is known of the manuscript, its date, author, place of composition, &c., is given, as well as explanations in points of grammar, history, life of the times, &c.
