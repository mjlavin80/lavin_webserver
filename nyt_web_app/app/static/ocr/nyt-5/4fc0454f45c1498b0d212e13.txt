NEW POETRY.
Volumes, by Clinton ScoIIard, Wallace Rice, and Owen Seaman.*
HE, “nature poems” that find their way- to the light at this season of the year : are naturally numerous and are most of them inspired by the kind of interest In nat-
■	-	•	u*e that is allied either to
science or to sentimentality. We do not often hear a deep, resonant note of true nature worship,-such a. nnte as Meredith strikes in Ills least utterance concerning ■; the wise and lovely Earth of his imaginative vision. It is a pleasure to find in ;Mr. Scollard’s latest volume this serious tribute to the inspiration of the eternal EWorld in its larger, anC at present unfashionable, aspect. The &tanza is taken from the poem entitled The March of .the Ideal”:
.'Whichever be the plan.	.
. isature through mankind, or through Nature man,	;
~Tis Nature	great idealist,
:-Fashioning from out the sombre morning ; mist	b
^<:N*I?tainst of roRC ^nd hills of amethyst; ■ ;Moldmg with incomparable toil J£fPm out the base essentials of the soil ' immaculate iily-tower,
-	AH grace sweetness centred In a
■; flower;	'
'Prisoning within one small wood-war; bier's throat	:
'Ecstatic note upon ecstatic note.
: Tis those close cleaving unto Nature,
; then,	,
;Who are the master spirits among men.
-	Idealists,
^Holding their noontide and nocturnal
r _ trysts
w^fit is lofty, elemental, pure—
T.he essences divtne that shall endure.
An Interesting anthology called 4* The
•Athlete's Garland *‘ expresses a vigorous
Jove of the open air and out of door
games and pastimes, which is far from
being a negligible eminent in the nature
^worship of the present day. and which
has at least the advantage of immense
sincerity. In lusty physical exercise the
.hypocrite has little, chance, which no ,
.doubt accounts for much of the unform-
;ulated enthusiasm for athletics existing
In most minds of an essentially honest
tendency.
Remembering Emerson’s moderate delight in any form of exercise more exacting than a neighborhood stroll, it is amusing to find a passage from his “ May Day ’* entitled “ The Seed of Athleticism." ■ Wordsworth and Stevenson are also j pressed into service with perhaps inadequate justification from the athletic point or view. In the main, however, the poets Who have sung of cricket and basket hall , and tennis and curling and skating and I ■running have been thoroughly inspired with the spirit of their sport, so much so, indeed, that it is quite comforting to come occasionally upon some stanzas that com- I bine tho literary with the athletic flavor, j .as in these by Wallace Rice, (the com- j piler.) called “ In Elizabeth’s Day,” ‘
Who would not give the treasure Of very nvmy lives
*	If some kind fate would pleasure . To let him ho where Ben is
A-playing Kit at tennis,
Or playing Will at fives?
: The racquet ne'er so deftly . Is turned. whoever strives,
The ball flics ne’er so swiftly .As thought nnd tongue where Eon is
*	A-playing Kit :it tennis.
Or playing Will at fives.
When the literary' touch fails and the desire to shout in numbers becomes uncontrollable. (here is always the resource of parody. The best parodies of the best poets at their best moments are not lightly to be spoken of, but there are almost as many grades of parodists as of poets. Wordsworth's mood of solemn simplicity offers a tempting target, and Mr. Owen Seaman shoots close to the bull’s eye in his modernized “ Lucy Gray," the first four stanzas of which will quite suffice to give the quality:
Well I remember .Lucy Gray In skirt of two-some L-ut.
For on the links one Medal day
*	I boshed her winning put.
.	1
And often through an	oversight,	I
When she was still	alive.	'	I
My head delayed her pellet's, flight And spoilt a spanking drive .
Hard by a sporting course, she kept,
All sandy from the sea;
No keener artist ever stepped Upon a human t^e.	i
You still may hear strong men at play . Blaspheming on the green,
But I regret that Lucy Gray Will never more be seen.
This is not. perhaps, a kind of poetry that will appeal to Vze romantic imagination. It has at best the character ascribed by Scott to his awn versification—” a hur- i ried frankness of composition which pleases soldiers, sailors, and young people of bold and active disposition,” but at its worst the present generation is bound to like it better than the sentimentality and unreality of the earliest verse ot—say, Tennyson, 3ince it breathes of their own vigorous modernity.
