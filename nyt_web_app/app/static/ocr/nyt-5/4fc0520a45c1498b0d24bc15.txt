The -world knows that Hawaii was once ; a toy kingdom and King Kalakaua an amiable toy monarch reigned over it. This is a story of that time—a story of a girl named Florence, who went over to marry one young man and actually married another, not so young, but worth ?11,000,000.. There is a lively designing, widow in the story and a handsome Eng- ’ lishman with a hyphen who keeps the royal livery stables And Is deeply dis-. approved of by the millionaire. The fact is he carries about with him a vague air -of wickedness, though beyond treading, on little girls’ toes when he dances and making one rather late call he doesn't do any tiling particularly dreadful. He falls in love with Florence, of course, and the widow doesn’t like it. Also a young American naval officer falls in love with Florence. But Florence has fallen in love with the man with $11,000,000 at the very first meeting—with the man, not his mill ions.
The story tells how they dance on the decks of the old warships in the harbor— American, British, Russian—but the Ger-\ man ships are the new kind, not nice for dancing. The story tells also about Hawaiian life and how Florence lived in a bower of a room in the house ot a half- ' breed Hawaiian lady of royal descent, how she taught two little Hawaiian Princes their lessons, how the King came to see her and made her " Painter of Rare Fishes to His Majesty,” and how she made aai awful mess of the only rare fish she ever tried to paint. However, the King gave a real " surf-riding party " all in her honor, and -was altogether delightfully kind.
The author tells you, too, about the missionary-descended aristocracy, about the countless foreign Consuls, about a dapper Japanese Count and an Imposing Chinese Mandarin, the last the father of a groat many daughters, half Hawaiian, with beautiful Paris frocks. The author dwells rather lovingly upon frocks In several places, by the way, and takes a very evident delight in her Hawaiian Arcady and the day-dream life there. The worse things she lets happen are a little accident with a tandem in which nobody gets much hurt and two rather spectacular affairs with a young gentleman who is shockingly but very harmlessly drunk. You can see that she quite believes in all sorts of old-fashioned notions of love and innocencc and childlike happiness.
