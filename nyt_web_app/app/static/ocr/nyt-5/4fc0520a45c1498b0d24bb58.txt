Mrs. Boyle will probably be recalled as the author of several very entertaining short stories of Southern home life, but this is her first effort at anything like a Ions connected tale. The scene and time are the South just before and during' the days of tlie civil war. Serena was beautiful, as was to be expected—but nioi*e than that, she was amiable, educated, spirited, and endowed with the courage of a long line of worthy ancestors. It was Carl, her twin brother, whose spirit was weak and who, when the stirring days of battle came, turned white feather and fled, leaving Serena to take up her' father's sword and maintain the honor of the family.
But it is not only as a Joan or Arc that Serena gallops through the story. There are lovers galore to cross her path, but the lives of two in particular are twined and twisted with hers. And for all her coquetry Serena was a good and earnest little lass, whose love was well worth the striving foV and who in Hie end was quite worthy the affections of Horace Baldwin.
In the course of the story Mrs. Boyln. has brought to light a picture of the underground railway scheme which was to have been the means of freeing the negroes. It was Serena who turned from his purpose the traitor .to her mother's hospitality, and later, when the crazed negro, Lame Jake, headed a band of lawless hlaclc men that marched straight toward the big house to destroy it, it was Serena's cairn voice and steady aim which quelled the insurrection and averted tne tragedy.
