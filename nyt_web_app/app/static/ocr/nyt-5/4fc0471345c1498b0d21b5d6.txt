A life of Stanton embraces the period | from Buchanan's Presidency through the j turbulent era of reconstruction under Johnson. It thus, in Mr. Flower’s words,
" gives as by a searchlight from within the only story of those prodigious epochs that is not disconnected or fragmentary or in some feature misleading.** To Iris eye Stanton is “ the most majestic, civil figure observable in the rebellion horizon,
* * * the dominating spirit and power in tlue quaking Republic during seven of its most tumultuous and eventful years/' His achievements in those years, according to Mr. Flower's tabulated list, number twenty-nine; and this portly volume is devoted to describing them in detail. The j author has a luxurious and picturesque I; flow of language that abounds in superlatives. Mr. Stanton (purposely, as the historian believes,) left no private letter books or other material for biography not. to be found in official records or seen in hia public acts—a fact that makesr the labor of compiling a volume giving a true picture of what he did laborious and difficulty
Mr. Flower believes that what he has done “ annihilates much that has heretofore been accepted as ‘ history/ and reverses the positions of many of the foremost actors of the century*” Public* records, testimony o£ actual witnesses, and a number of letters, nearly all new to the public, are the material upon which the book is founded. Tlie story is a thrilling one,, and Mr: Flower's style lets; no opportunity* fair an impressive and picturesque point to escape and pamts the rajddly moving panorama of events in high colors. Stanton’s aggressive and
•	imperious personality; his absolute- conviction of the necessity for- quick and arbitrary action whenever the exigencies oC the situation demanded it, the hostilities he aroused, led to many critical situations. Mr. Flower is. his unvarying champion In upholding His wisdom, and : the justice and propriety of his actions.
Most of these episodes have become enrolled in history. Among the incidents j-. which he declares he makes public for i tlie first time is that turning upon. Me-CIeUan*s unsoldierly and insulting telegram to Stanton after the defeat at ; Gaines’s Mills on June 27. 18G2* Me-i Clellan had be«n ordered to attack. i ing defeated, he telegraphed Stanton that ! he was not responsible for the result, and, i closing, said: “ If I save the army now,' I j teil you plainly that I owe no thanks to*
I you or any person lit Washington, You | have done your -best to sacrifice the army.” '	,
| Had such* language been used in any | other country toward a superior the of: fender would certainly have been- cashiered and probably shot. But these words-were omitted from the copy of the telegram that was famished to Stanton and by him handed to Lincoln- How they
. were omitted is told tn the words of Major Johnson* Mr. Stanton's confidential cleric. Col. Sanford, supervisor and cen-sot of telegraphs, who received the raes-sage, declared to Assistant Secretary Eckert that the charge was false and . treasonable, and that, while it was doubtful if the censor had a-uthQrity to suppress ' a telegram from McClellan to the Secretary of War, yet he coaid not allow himself as censor to ba used to- hand it to the Secretary. The telegram minus the offen-. sive words* was recopied and so taken to . Stanton and the President; Neither .knew ' o£ Its mutilation. Neither the full nor the mutilated, telegram is now on file in.. the-War Department. McClellan’s Intention, was, as Major Johnson believes, to reach _ the public and shift the burden of his defeat from his.own shoulders. McClellan’s “ Own Story,” published in 18S7, charges Stanton with the mutilation:	That	Cbl.
Sanford's expurgation; saved; McClellan from disaster seems clear to Mr. Flower, who also thinks it has led easy-going ' writers- into producing some remarkable
" history."	—	•	■	.
