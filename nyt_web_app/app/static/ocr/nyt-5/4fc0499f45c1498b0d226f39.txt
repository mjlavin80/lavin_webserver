We h.'ivr mru^c irKthis volume some at- ! tompt to draw a pk-lure of tho ancient religion iff our earliest ancestors, the Gae- ! lie and the British Celts. Wo have shown i wh;it can l>c gathered of the broken rrm- 1 mints of a mythology as splendid in con-ceptlon ami as brilliant in color as th:i; of , the Greeks. We have trh-d io paint its divine figures and to retell their heroic stories. We have seen tnem fall from their shrines, and yet, rising1 again, take on new lives as Kings, or saints, or kniRhts of romance, and we have caught fading glimpses of them surviving to-day js the ! “ fairies," their rites stil cherished by worshippers who hardly know whom or 1 why they worship. Of necessity this survey has been brief and incomplete.
I Whether the great edifice of the Cellitj ! mythology will ever be wholly restored one can at present only speculate. Its colossal fragments are perhaps too deeply buried and too widely scattered. But, even as it stands, ruined, it is a mighty quarry from which poets yet unborn will hew spiritual marble for houses not made with hands.
Thus writes Charles Squire in his summary chapter to Ihe introduction of Celtic myth, legend, poetry, and romance, which Charles Scribner's Sons are Importing. The volume is believed to be the first attempt made to acquaint the English reader with the subject. The author deals with the ancient Britons, the Gaelic gods and their stories, the British gods, Finn and his Fenians, Arthur and his knights, and other celebrities of Celtic legend and romance, it is his aim to provide a book for those acquainted with Greek, Roman, and Scandinavian mythology which treats of a nearer source of poetry. References and explanations are given in footnotes.
