" The Poems of Michael Drayton ’* is a new tiny volume In Newnes’s Pocket Classics. (New York:	Imported	by
Charles Scribner’s Sons, $1.25.) The volume contains, of course, only the shorter pieces of the Elizabethan poet, including the odes and lyrics, ** Nymphidia,” and “ The Muses’ Klysium." Of course, the •* Ballad of Apncourt," the meter of which was adopted by Tennyson for his '* Charge of the Light Brigade,*' has first place. A bibliographical note and glossary will be found useful. There are no textual notes.
