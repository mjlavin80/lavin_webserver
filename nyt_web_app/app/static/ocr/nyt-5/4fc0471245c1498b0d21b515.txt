t'OLLOWINC. THE 8CN FLAG. A Vain Pursuit Through Manchuria. By John Foi, Jr. 12 mo. Pp. 1S9. New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons. $1.25.
Like the rest of the returned correspondents, Mr. John Fox, Jr.. famous for his " IJttle Shepherd of Kingdom Come." takes it very hard that the Japanese did not let him see their little war in Manchuria. He is particularly resentful because ihe Emperor’s officers, instead of saying " No " to the correspondents at once, were Orientally evasive and illusive—let the hope of seeing real war dance ever in front like a will o’ the wisp. Instead of nipping it in the bud. He complains that auite superfluous lies were told to himself and to Mr. Richard Harding Davis and the rest, and forbidding bayonets actually stuck under their noses. Further, he thinks the Manchurians much more human than the Japanese.
Really, Mr. Fox appears to have had a rough, unprofitable time of it upon the trail of Gen. Oku's army. Certainly he saw no carnage—such as " O " describes in his book. Nevertheless, Mr. Fox has made some very pretty copy out of his four months* stay in Tokio, as readers of Scribner's Magazine know already. That copy, to be sure, has anything but the martial blare; it deals at its best, and very daintily, with those darlings of tlie globe-trotting gallery gods, the Japanese women. Thus, when the author was first shown to his room in a Japanese house:
I had read of feminine service, and ^nxonliko (Saxon to Mr. Fox means what white man means to Mr. Kiplinpr.) I wns fearsome, *	*	* Straightway one little
maid came in to build &	nut
other swiftly unpacked my bag. laid out evening clothes, and rlayed the part of a blind automatic valet. Embarrassment, even' consciousness, fled like a flash, as it must flee with any man who is not a blackguard or a fool, and I ■im thinking how foreigners have lied about the women of Japan.
One of the same little maids brought the man whose glorious destination was the front ” his breakfast. She looked upon him with interested eyes and said she wanted to go to Korea, too—“ to fight," she explained, with a face that flashed
lieruic fire.
Mr. Fox speaks -prettily and appreciatively of fine Japanese manners, and makes Dolly dialogues with one he calls the Maid of Miyanoshita. The Maid helped the correspondent learn Japanese from a phrase book-most charming tuition it must have been. Of course, words set down in phrase books are not always tha most approved in polite circles.
“ That word," asks Mr. Fox, pointing to one. “ Would you use that word to
your-well, your mother? "
■■ jsTo,*' says the Maid, " I—don't—think -you—would use that word to—your mother.”
Then Mr. Fox tells tHls story about the hot baths, called Big Hell, whera bathing is very informal, and a thoroughfare passes close by. He ijuotes an Englishman:	_
“Most extraordinary!" he said. "Do v0lI know thev never minded tis at all
-not at ail. A chap had a camera, and one dear old lady actually Rlood upright when he was taking a picture. They asked me to come in, and 1 really think I would. but— gad, you know, there “wasn’t any room."
There is a^so a (juaint story of Kam-
ura-san. aged 13. who was enslaved to
a tea house, and whom Mr. Fox thought
to buy and «end to school—but the little
maid really wanted a husband—and there
is a rather valuable pen picture of Gen.
Oku. In addition you reacT anecdotes of a hard-mouthed brute of a horse, of a delightful Manchurian small boy, and of horrid Japanese oaths, extortions, regulations, restrictions, indirections, and deviations from the standard of truth which Is (according to Mr. Fox) the Saxon'* niiq rd
