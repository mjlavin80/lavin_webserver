HE perfected man, when Nature evolves him, will have a perfect memory. The human memory, in the present stage of evolution, is a rudimentary not to say a j pitiful thing. Man remembers just enough of what he has done and heard, read, seen, and said to indicate what his memory might be if the use of it were properly developed. It seems a strange freak of nature, until we ponder over it a little, that men with the best memories are frequently shallow-minded, while a giant of intellect has been known to forget the name of the street he dwelt in. The sim-pie explanation is that the memory is as uncultivated in one case as In the other, while the simpleton who remembers so much uses his brain for no other purpose to speak of. Probably the memory in every normal person is the same, while it is the most neglected of all human gifts.

Robert Houdin, the French magician, and his son, In preparing their remarkable exhibition called " Second Sight/’ , (which, of course, was an intentional misnomer,) used to walk through the Paris ! streets and glance in the shop windows, endeavoring to remember and name the articles exposed to view. After long prac- j tice they found they could remember i the names and positions of every article j in a crowded show window. Having thus , begun to train their rudimentary powers ! of remembrance, they constructed their I remarkable code of signals, variants of common words and phrases, inflections, tricks of emphasis, inarticulate sounds, pauses, and the like, by the use of which the performer, walking among the spectators and taking articles at random from them,, could communicate with his blindfolded assistant on the platform, who would name and describe each article and tell the dates of coins, thus convincing the astonished crowd that he and his principal possessed occult powers.
In the remembrance of the present generation Robert Heller and his sister have performed this simple trick to perfection. Mr, Kellar now does it very well. It Is all very easy when it has been mastered. The trick is all in remembering. There are, for instance, only nine figures and a cipher, and th^ date of a coin is easily communicated by the simple code, especially as coins of earlier date than the sixteenth century are very rare.
All our memories are capable of much more than that. It has been the idea of many philosophical writers that the mind never loses what it once apprehends. The man of the distant future will remember distinctly every strain of music, every combination of words, every harmony of color, every aspect of nature, every thought, every smile, every frown i that his experience comprehends. In the wisdom of his golden age we may be sure there will be few dull, foul, and trivial things to burden the memory.

B.	P. Austin or Rochester, N. Y., is the : author of a little work on " Rational Mem- i ory Training," the fifth edition of which, i in pamphlet form, has just reached us 1 with the Imprint of the Austin Publishing Company of Rochester* This contains a deal of matter, original and selected, relating to the memory, Including impressive anecdotes of Lord Macaulay and Magliabechi, which is pertinent enough but not absolutely essential. It is, in fact, a sort of rambling essay on the memory and the elusive science of mnemonics in i which we have found much interesting reading.	-
As for systems of mnemonics In general we infer that Mr. Austin does not think much of them. He does not care much for systems which teach you to remember one thing by remembering several other unessential things, yet the association of ideas is frequently a useful help to the memory. Mr. Austin, however, insists upon a natural association of ideas. His
11	rational method ” includes a daily exercise of the memory. He offers to tlie man or woman with a bad memory no easy method of transforming it into a good memory. He has not turned out a treatise on “ How to Learn to Remember Everything in Six Predigested Lessons.’' But his little book is full of good advice and practical suggestions. It is calculated to awaken a new reverence for the fair goddess of the Greeks, Mnemosyne.
