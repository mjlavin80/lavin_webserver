HE assertion is often carelessly made that the expenses of	the maintenance	of
Shakespeare's birthplace and the other show places at Stratford-on-Avon are almost wholly paid by the fees of American tourists. The recent annual report of the Trustees shows that of 31,000 visitors who paid for admission to Shakespeare’s house last year only 20 per cent, were	from	the United States.	By
far the larger number	(71^	per cent,) were inhabi-	j
tants of the British	Isles.	Mr. Sidney Lee,	as	\
Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Stratford Trustees, is now taking an active part in the management^?* ifte various properties held in trust, and seems hopeful of the future development of Stratford. The reserve fund of the Trustees is increasing, and they will make an effort to stop the growing exportation to this country of rare Elizabethan and Shakespearean books. Mr. Lee indignantly denies a report that the historical documents in the possession of the trust are in disorder and the contents of some of them unknown.
