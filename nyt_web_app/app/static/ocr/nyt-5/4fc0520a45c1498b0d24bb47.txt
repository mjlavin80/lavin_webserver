Napier Malcolm lias written m “ Five Tears in a Persian Town," which is about to be Issued by E. P. I>utton & Co., what he calls a “ short sketch.'* It should not, he adds, be mistaken for a book of travel. tta describes Yezd, where he lived for five years. He writes "about the Yezdl’s life, character, and . mental ^ attitude toward the missionary, and *' something1 of the way in which the modern missionary attempts to meet this attitude.’* An idea of the scope and contents of the volume may be had from the summary In the concluding chapter:
We have seen, first of all, the strange staccato effect of Persian scenery, particularly of that which meets-the-eye of tue Yezdi, and have noticed how this has influenced the Yesdi's mind. hen we have seen the extreme insularity or tne town, and how this has given rise to symptoms which "resemble intense fanatical biffo try. * * * Then we have tried to discover the essential system of Islam and to decide whether or not the Persian Shah has been greatly influenced, by the prophet's life and teaching. * * * An attempt has also been made to explain the religiosity of .the Mohammedan,. and to show that it is neither hypocrisy nor yet religion in the Western sense. Then there was a chapter on the Yezdi s character. * ■* * After that there was an attempt to show the peculiar nature of the search after truth that is just now going on in Persia, and very particularly in Yezd. • • * lastly, I have tried to show that towns like Yezd. present a field not only workable for one class of missionary organization, but approachable In many different ways.	-
