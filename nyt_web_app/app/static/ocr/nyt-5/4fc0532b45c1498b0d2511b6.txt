Iq your admirable criticisms on' “ Schiller ” during his centenary two weeks ago, so nobly celebrated by oar German Americans, you alluded to Bulwet ljyt-toh’s translations and some n>.herT as if they1 were the ne filus ultra.- -Scc^ I-happen- to have- Longfellow's opinion, cfirough his brother “ AiecM that tho unfortunate poet James Clarence" Uangan' was the happiest of all Schiller’s translators, and in fact of German anthology generally, from Schiller to “ The Midnight Review*’ by Count von de Seidlitz. For hazard; I extract a part of Mangan's' translation of Schiller’s "To My : Friends " and leave it to the poetic ear and insight of your readers if you parallel it with any other translations (fourth^ stanza):
The beggar at St. Angelo’s might gaze With ccorn upon our North, for he surveys
The one lone, only, evf;r-living Home.
All shapes of beauty fascinate his eye.
He sees a brilliant heaven below the sky-Shine in St. Peter’s wonderwaking-dome. . BUt even when beaming ^v^th celestial glory
Rome is the grave of long-departed
It is ^thtfgreen young plant, o»d not the
; And - time-'worn trunk. ttmt ^ bloom s^and ‘ cheers.	MKxSHAIn .
