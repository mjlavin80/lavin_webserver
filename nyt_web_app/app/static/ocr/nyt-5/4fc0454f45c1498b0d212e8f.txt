In his history of Muscovite civilization and the rise of modern Russia under Peter the Groat and his forerunners, " The First Romanovs, (lGKi-172r»,) " R. Nisbet Bain has endeavored to describe the social, ecclesiastical, and political conditions o£J3astern Europe from 1G13 to 172">, and trace the gradual transformation, during the seventeenth century, of the ** semimonastic, semi-barbarous ” Czardom of Muscovy into the modern Russian State. Peter the Great has been treated oOnot biographically, but historically. The author writes:
He is regarded, primarily, as the last and greatest of a series of native pioneers who lightened his task by preparing the way for him—men like Orduin-Nashcho-kin, Artamon, * * * and Vasily Golit-suin—all of whom in their degree * * * contributed to Jay the foundations of modern Russia. *	*	* But no detail,
however trivial, which can explain the policy or illuminate the character of the first Russian Emperor has been omitted.
It is “ an Indisputable historical fact," he adds, that Russia owes '* everything *’ to the Czars—" her prosperity, her greatness, her empire, her very existence." Mr. Bain speaks of the period of which he treats:
Like all periods of sudden transition, the century which divides the ago of Ivan the Great from the age of Peter the Great has its own peculiar interest, abounding, as It does, in singular contradictions and picturesque contrasts. Throughout this period, East and West, savagery and civilization strive Incessantly for the mastery, and sinister and colossal shapes, fit representatives of wildly contending elemental forces, flit phantasmagorically across the dirty ways of the' twilight scene. * * * This seventeenth centnry In Muscovy is also one of the most important periods of modern European history, for, explored with intelligence and patience, It can be made to yield up the deep-lying explanations of many things that trouble or bewilder us in the Czar's domains to-day, e. g., the backwardness of the people, the veneration for the throne, the venality and inefficiency of the public service, the vices and the failures, the ambitions and the exploits of Holy Russia. Finally, the subject possesses the rare and crowning merit of almost absolute novelty.
The illustrations include portraits of some of Russia's rulers during the seventeenth century and a plan of the City of Moscow at that time. The volume bears the imprint of E. P. Dutton & Co.
