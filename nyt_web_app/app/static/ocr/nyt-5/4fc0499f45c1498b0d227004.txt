ISS CART’S fine, subtle, and sympathetic appreciation of Henry' James as a novelist, which we are ^happily enabled to present to our readers this week, includes the reflection that the work of Mr. James is “ elusive of labels.” One may not truthfully call his novels romantic, realistic, or poetic, novels of manners or novels of incident by way of definitely classifying them. Miss Cary’s conclusion is that the later work of Mr. James, which may not be read by one who runs, will “ appear to the future the most important achievement in fiction of"the period it so subtly reproduces.” In the June number of McClure's Prof, Woodberry writes eloquently of a novelist whose work could always be definitely classified, who was enormously popular in~liis lifetime and whose books Prof. Woodberry says he reads " in the passing- years, always with a greater admiration of his literary power, sheer creative faculty, his high strain of feeling and human truth, and his wholesomeness for the daily sympathies and moral ideas of the democracy.” Scott always had something more than an “ elect ’* or “ initiated ” following. Mr. James, It seems to us, has chosen * to stray into literary by-paths, whither he has been attended only by a very discriminating few. We ate confident that Miss Cary’s delicate appraisal of his work is accurate, and that he* is a great literary artist who really observes certain aspects of social life and character, and correctly reports, after his own strikingly “modern” fashion, what he sees. But his works have not yet contributed,-as Prof. Woodberry says of the Waver-%
ley Novels, M to human happiness on the universal scale.”	.
