jKERE are sixty of the Pansy j books written by Pansy’s * own unassisted pen, seven , were written in collabora- ; tion, and a little company; of confessed novels, but there ; are no signs of weariness in * “ David Ransom’s Watch," her latest work, to be published to-morrow by the Lothrop, Lee & Shepard Company. Indeed, it lias the "best plot that she has ever devised, for not only does the evil that the characters do return to plague' them, but good deeds also bring their blessing’, and that is no easy matter to . manage In a story. Two threads of selfsacrifice run through the tale to meet at last, making ideal happiness for a little group, from which all the unpleasant folk have been eliminated by chances which the unregenerate reader will call blessed. The constant miracle of answered prayer or happy coincidence, as one pleases; the real mercy concealed by apparent misfortune; the sure return of the bread cast upon the waters are taught by delicate touches instead of by the old fashion of knock-down blows. Altogether, the good deacons of forty years ago would hardly recognize the story as a Sunday school book, for the teaching is fitted to the Sunday school graduate of to-day, the girl who has risen above that Chautauqua which once seemed a height, and takes a collegiate education as a matter of course. Between the oldest and the newest ** Pansy" book lies the popular history of the higher education for girls.

After an author "has written half a score of tales of Court intrigue one expects that the next half score will resemble them, but Mr. E. Phillips Oppenheim's " The .Master Mummer’* will be found novel, because its author has taken a hint j from the recent history of a certain royal family and has imagined what may possibly follow an elopement which for a time occupied the attention of Europe and America. Moreover, he has discovered an original beginning and has made his hero a novelist, thus giving himself an opportunity to exhibit the ways of the literary man. By these means he has produced a book which reserves a surprise for its very last chaptcr. although its most start* ling incident takes place at the outset of the tale. The book is to be published by Messrs. Little, Brown & Co.

Mr. Richard G. Badger Is reissuing some of the volumes of verse published last Winter as The Arcadian Library, a series in paper covers, to he sold at 10 cents apiece, making contemporary verse as cheap as English classics. Among his new books are Mr. W. J. Henderson’s "Pipes and Timbrels,'* a volume by Mr. Aloysius Coll, with the title “The Harem,** unaccountable except on the rule laid down by the Tatin grammar that names of poems are feminine; and ** Myr- J tie and Myrrh,” by Mr. Ameen Rihani, a young Syrian who found American life impossible, and has returned to his native land, leaving this book behind him; It has a most amazingly Oriental preface, of which the phrase ** the amyelencephalic discourses of a pundit” is a fair specimen. For Autumn production Mr. Badger has a volume by Mr. Georg Henschel, founded upon the diary kept during his long intimacy 'with the late Johannes Brahms. The book will contain letters received from the composer and never before published.
Next week Mr. Badger will issue ” The Voice of Equality,” by Mr. Edwin Arnold Brenholz, who gives equality a voice expressing itself somewhat after the manner of the late Mr. Walt Whitman In verses varying from one to fifteen lines In length. With this will come “Stray Leaves from a, Soul’s Book,** by one who calls himself “ I of the Dual Soul." Tlie ** Leaves *’ are twelve, and their inscriptions are partly rhapsodical, partly stories of the dual soul’s past, of_lhe bronze age, the viking times, and oi the French Revolution.
Messrs. L. C. Page & Co. are preparing a set of very pretty volumes appropriately called the Leicester Library, not because they suggest Mrs. Leicester's School, or Elizabeth’s Leicester, but because their association is so eccentric as jto remind one of tho town to which British oddities appear to gravitate. This is
the list of the books to appear in green limp Iambsldn with green and black title pages, photogravure portraits for frontispieces, good pictures, and the text printed on special thin paper at the same price as the current novel, " The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table,” Dickens's “ Christmas Books and Stories,'* “ Tie Decameron,'' "The 'Cloister and the Hearth," Mrs. Jameson’s "Legends of the Madonna," Leigh Hunt’s, " The Town of London,"1 Hamilton’s ” Memoirs of Be Grammont,**
Darwin On the Origin of Species,” j Mme. Campari's “ Memoirs of Marie ] Antoinette,” Sheridan’s plays, and | *' Thoughts from Montaigne,” selected by j Constance, Countess de la Warr, with a J biographical study and a foreword by , Mr. Egerton Castle. Surely something ; for all tastes may be found there!	;
In addition to Mr. Benson’s “ The Valkyries ” and Mr. Baring Gould’s " Sieg- ! fried,” mentioned last week, the ** Lohen- I grin ” of the latter authors will be re- j printed, and all will appear in the Music | Lovers' Series, in the place of the volumes of biographical or critical essays ; hitherto included in it.

In the Travel Lovers’ Series, the vol- i umes to be added in the Autumn are those upon which Mr. Mansfield and his wife, j formerly-"3Iiss Blanche McManus, have j been engaged during the last year, “Rambles in Normandy ” and ” Rambles in Brittany.” The natural beauties of both provinces, their picturesque ancient buildings, and the survivals of the past in costume, vehicles, and local customs fur-nis)i excellent subjects for pen and for pencil, and the volumes promise better than the Cathedral Series, which, good although the books were, did not appeal to all readers.	■
