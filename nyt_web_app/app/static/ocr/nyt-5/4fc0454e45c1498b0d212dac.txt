This novel, by Henry Pettit, is probably an attempt to write biography in the form of fiction. It is an introspective, retrospective, meditative, idealistic tale, the scenes laid in the Orient. The heroine, who “ loves and seeks the truth for its own sake,” is a young and charming girl. She has her own ideas of the " true ” faith, and tells them to those who argue with her. Adele Cultus, her parents, and her friend, join two genLle-men in a trip to the Orient. Paul "Warder falls in love with the heroine. Together they visit the many interesting
places, and finally come to understand each other very well.
