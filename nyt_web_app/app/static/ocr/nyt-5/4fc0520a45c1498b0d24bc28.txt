A : Ecrviceable :;Life c..' tlie American . Poet by W. A. Bradley.*	■
R BRADLEY has prepared a .serviceable life of Bryant to take ’a place in the valuable series of ** English Men . of \ Letters.” He ;;ha9 •drawn * freely on previous biographies, including the two massive volumes by Parke Godwin,
. the. poet's son-in-law, , n,nd the other lesser works that have been devoted to him. He has found suggestions in Stcdman’s, Churton Collins's, and ,Woodborry*s. critical writings. . On the biographical side there was, of course, nothing to add; on the. critical.side he has attempted to ,do fuller justice to Bryant’s poetical work than criticism, and especially
-	American criticism, had hitherto done. He has certainly gone about it without any illusions ''.pneerning .Bryant’s Jimita-. tions.
It Is not,, on-the whole, a.stimulatingor van enlivening book that has resulted; it does not present a vivid figure of, a man with a strongly marked personality, disengaged from a luminously ..wrought background. This is, no doubt, largely due to : the personal qualities of Bryant himself, .whose sombre spirit, coldness, and aloofness have eo often been noted. They are not qualities to kindle a biographer’s enthusiasm, or a reader’s. .But his career | was varied, and touched life at many | points, though there was always a certain Puritanical rigidity in its course.
Whether as a country boy, making his first attempts at verse, or struggling modestly and unobtrusively through the penurious opportunities offered by Williams College or as a young lawyer In the Massachusetts hill towns, making contrl-butions to the newly established North American Review,. or as a new recruit to the literary life of New York in the twenties, he seems a sober, dry figure, reserved, restrained, melancholy. As a journalist in the strlfd of ante-bellum: j days he labored earnestly and uprightly and'■with a wise statesmanship, keeping 1 to a middle course between compromise ; and opportunism on the one: hand and the .extreme partisanship of the abolitionists i on the other. And yet we cannot help feeling with his biographer that " if he had caught a little of that noble moral enthusiasm that animated a poet like Whittier, an orator like Wendell Phillips, or a statesman like Sumner, he would have come down to posterity as a more. Interesting and inspiring figure as well as a better poet. Bryant kept outside of movements and preserved his art Intact, yet with a certain loss In wide human sympathy."
Bryant’s achievement as a poet was principally an achievement of his early years—It was a boy of seventeen that wrote " Thanatopsis." From his thirty-fifth year, when he became editor of The Evening Post, we lope sight, save at rare intervals, of the figure of the poet. His contributions to American literature were . mostly accomplished ; before 1S29. What he added after that was chiefly repetition, thougn in volume it was about equal to what he had already written. It in-, volved no new interests and manifests no new forms of expression. “To a Waterfowl ** is still to be considered his best poem, and it was composed in 1815, when he was twenty-one years old. His first volume of poetry, published in 1S21, is: characterized by Mr. Bradley as a significant event in our;literary history, marking the birth of American poetry, just as surely as Irving’s ” Sketch Book ” marks the birui of American prose literature.
It was, indeed, unfortunate for Bryant that he was the earliest of American poets, and Mr. Bradley points out the circumstances by which lie was made so:
He appeared much more remarkable to his early contemporaries than he ever can do to us, because of the contrast which he
{>resented with what had gone before. And ater, after a period In which he suffered somewhat of an eclipse through the rise of new schools and new poets to contest with him the palm of supremacy. Ills great age, the traditions of an earlier day which
he represented, .his personality, which, so perfectly embodied the prophetic and seerlike aspect of the poetic ideal, and, finally, local pride in the possession of a poet whom New York could produce to^ onpose the claims of its rival, Boston, to literary supremacy—all these tended to create a regard for Bryant that was rather personal than literary.
Did his coming to New York act as a check to his poetic impulse and productive power? The social and literary coterie which Bryant came to join in 1S24 was agreeable. There were men of talent like Irving, Cooper, Ilalleck, Verplanck, Paulding; there was a touch of fashionableness and Bohemianism about it all Inseparable from literary society in a large city, and always peculiarly characteristic of New York. The literature that was produced was a part of that life, light and satirical; of profound personal expression there was little. Mr. Bradley says:
In Boston or Cambridge ho would have felt, the stir of intellectual life about him, and his poetry, perfect in form, might have gained in depth and feeling. His

education, though sound- classically, had been ;narrow, and his - spiritual resources were not great. Justr now much these were caDable of telm? increased by liberal Intercourse ^wlth .minds more cultivated , than his own one can, of course, only conjecture But In New York there was not even the possibility of such a benefit to be derived from; his associates. * * * In so far as he was a poet, he would be thrown back, even more than in Cumming-ton and Great Barrington, upon his own native instincts and the tradition of his early religious training, if, Indeed, in the sterile atmosphere of an unldeal community these were not actually dulled and blunted.	.
Bryant wrought not only in his poetry, but also In his criticism, to enforce the truth that for a literature to be national it must first of all be natural, the genu; Ine personal expression of an individual genius. That Bryant is not merely a -provincial English poet, expressing merely formal sentimentality, as Prof. Barrett Wendell would have it, Mrl Bradley has litttle difficulty in showing. His Americanism, his native inspiration, his imaginative and sincere expression are certain. That his "school” was not that . of contemporary English poetry merely goes to show that provincial America was lagging fifty years behind England when he began to write. There is in, him. none of Wordsworth's mystic pantheism: but, to offset this there is his own. expression of the religious and moral ideals of Puritanism. Mr. Stoddard said that Bryant ; .knew how to write exquisite episodes, like : Wordsworth, and omit Wordsworth’s in- . tervening platitudes. Mr. Bradley finds that even in Bryant’s, most exquisite epi- : sofjes there is almost always a touch of . the obvious and commonplace, as well as i the chill of an incomplete sympathy with ; his kind. Herein is the real weakness of i Bryant's poetry. He reproduces only the j charm of nature’s loveliness; yet our critic i finds also that if he. sees nature with the \
[ eye of an artist, endowed with a finer j genius for perfection and a higher gift | of imaginative description than any ! other American poet, It is also with the ! feelings of a Puritan. The beauty he sees !
; Is moral beauty. The sinlessness of nat- • ure Is a part of the aesthetic appeal to [ him. He Is habitually preoccupied with • death, and his prevailing moods are of \ sadness and brooding. But let not Bryant 1 be underestimated. It is something to j have written a poem that Matthew Arnold must call the best short poem in the :j language. And it Is something, also, to ] have been the man of whom Lincoln said jj that it was worth his journey to the East j
merely to have seen him,	■
