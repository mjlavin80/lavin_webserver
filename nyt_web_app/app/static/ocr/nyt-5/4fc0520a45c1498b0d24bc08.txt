Col. Haggard has gone back to Feni-ruore Cooper for his model in this story. But it is a hundred years too late for that sort of thing1—and the Colonel is no novelist. Yet his language is at least as stilted as that of the author of the famous Leather Stocking Tales, his characters are at least as impossibly stiff, and his adventures as hair-raising, though he has no Indian "wars to fill the pages with blood and the air with shrieks.
The Colonel’s hero is one Geoffrey Dig-by, son of a Norfolk squire, who, being jilted by a girl, betakes himself to the wilds of Canada apd dwells among the Indians. These for his deeds of prowess in the chase name him ** Ready Rifle/* and a lovely maid among them (called Silver Bell3) falls abjectly in love with him. However, on the voyage to Canada there is a shipwreck, wherein the hero saves the Lady Geraldine McGeorge, whose husband Is an elderly General. She also loves him! There are assorted adventures. Digby wrestles with a bear, he , plays lady's maid to Geraldine, he goes 1 fishing with an Admiral who catches an ' enormous salmon. And on the deeper ! wilds he has fearful encounters with a I pack of wolves, which assault the camp in which he and Silver Bells and Indians of her tribe are wintering.	,	■
It is an occasion of horrid carnage. As far as can be guessed, at least a thousand wolves assaulted the stockade, and all were slain, while the tepees within the ; defenses were set ablaze and consumed and. two Indians slain. There is a good priest, too, who dwells among the redskins for their souls* good, and a horrid orgie just as Digby (who is the soul of honor) is about to marry the lovely forest maiden. The orgie rather turns him from his purpose, and other events intervene. Incidentally, you hear many other fish stories and bear stories, and some wildwood orations in a sort of jumble of Cooperese and the language used by modern writers* of -Indian animal stories. Perhaps you think “ Ready Rifle" returns in the end to civilization and marries Geraldine—who is now a widow. . That’s as may be; at all events, it’s something of a tragedy. The story may amuse boys, perhaps, but Cooper is a deal! better.	'
