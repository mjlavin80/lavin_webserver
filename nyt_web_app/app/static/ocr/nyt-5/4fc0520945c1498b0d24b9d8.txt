Hersf.j;^ Napoleon learns of the charms of Eugfeni'e,^-: her daring, her beauty, her marvelous coj£0-tumes. her adventures and her quests. After that the story gaUb{l35 *' through their courtship, with the always playing a conspicuous part as flower of Eugenie's destiny. For, stffe," tells Napoleon, " On the day following ri*y^. birth, he [her father] came to my cradle^ with a bunch of violets, for which he ha4^
1 sent a shepherd to the heights of ttie>r-Sierra Nevada, and as he strewed them. :
iover me, my mother heard him say, with... grief in his voice, ' My daughter, you can never wear these for our great Napoleon; his colossal labors are at an end. £ut let these blossoms, your birth flowers, he an ,, emblem to you that the name still lives, and that his descendants wiLl again sit on the throne of France.”
