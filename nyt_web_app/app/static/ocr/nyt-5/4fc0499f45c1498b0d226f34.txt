'■ft’eto York Timex Boot Review:
If Mr. James Mott, whose list of obscure literary allusions was very interesting, but who seems unready to accept the offered solutions, will consult so concise a reference book as the Century Cyclopedia of Names for the name of Charlemagne’s perfidious paladin, the world’s by-word for treachery, he will find It in the three recognized forms of Ganelon, Gan, and Gano, followed by an “ &c.," Indicating still others forms less familiar. Most of the names of old romance that have come down through many legends and languages have several forms with similarity enough to make them recognizable. A writer may choose among them and keep in good company. As for another of Mr. Mott’s puzzles, can there be much doubt that Macaulay's ** lucky Valentine " was he of the name whom a fortunate chance made a royal ward and favored courtier, in contrast with his twin brother, who in a bear's den developed Into the uncouth, terror-bringing “ Wild Man of the Forest”?
