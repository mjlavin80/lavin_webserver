An Irish Lad's Romance.
SANDY* By Alice He&sm Rice. 16mo. New York :	The Centurj' Corapuny. $1*
Sandy is Mrs. Rice’s first venture into the field of real novel writing, and the book possesses much of the wholesome ( sweetness of her two earlier volumes. Sandy was Irish in everything but name.
“ He had a smile that waited for an answer and usually got It—a smile so brimming over with good-fellowship and confidence that it made a lover of a friend and a friend of an enemy.”	|
As a stowaway he boarded an American liner and might have found safe and undiscovered passage in one of its lifeboats but for a sudden excess of patriotic zeal for the land of his adoption when the big American vessel won in a friendly race with an English liner. However, all things are for the best in the story of Sand5', and had he' not been discovered and cast into the steerage in disgrace Ruth Nelson would undoubtedly never hove thrown the golden orange down from the first cabin deck and Sandy might have finished his life in an altogether different manner. As it was Sandy ate the orange and developed a deep love for the giver~so deep that when he watched her leave the vessel and saw her name " Ruth Nelson, Kentucky, U.
S. A.,” on her bag he at once renounced his intention of becoming a doctor and joined forces with Ricks Wilson, an unlikely looking young person, but who “ possessed unlimited knowledge of all things terrestrial, from the easiest way of making a fortune to the best way of spending it.” After that Sandy’s course is the usually unexpected one of young novel heroes.
There is no denying Mrs. Rice’s pleasant manner of telling a story. Here is an account of Sandy and Ruth’s wedding:

“ Kailh, and lie'll have to." said Sandy Jn gtY-at agitation. " Don't he know that nobody will bo looking at him?" * * * The bridal march had sounded many times, and the impatient guests were be; coming seriously concerned when a handkerchief fluttered from the landing and Sandy and Ruth came down the wide steps together. Mr. Meeeh cleared his i throat, and. with one hand nervously fidgeting under his coat tails, the other thrust into the bosom of tils coat, he began:	*	*	*	,
