The self-made man’s family still continues lo write letters, and the latest output is a collection of those addressed by his wife to their son on his honeymoon. The Jady prove3 herself a match for her husband in admonition and advice, and also matches his sharp wit with no mean one of her own. In her letters she indulges Ia reminiscences and conjecture, and if they are not as entertaining us those of her husband it is only perhaps because the reader has already consumed two volumes of his epistolary lore and Is perhaps a trifle satiated. In her letters the mother advises her son on the treatment of his wire, on the retention of his ideals, on the writing of books and the reading cf them, on quarreling and making up, on the fallacy and folly of aphorisms, adages, and other epigrammatic usages, on economy In households, and a number of other living topics, and aptly illustrates her points by instances taken from her own domestic experiences or observations cf the experiences cf her neighbors.
She grows pleasingly garrulous at times and tells little stories apropos of certain questions under discussion, and displays an excellent understanding of the shrewd business sense of her husband. This shrewdness she illustrates as follows:
I remember, some thirty years ago in the little Missouri town where we began our career, that your father had started a little sausage factory In a region where the people were generally set in their ways and ate their pork products salted. Naturally, the business did not flourish as it has since the American public has trrown more careless as to what^ it eats, and things began to look dismal. One afternoon your father came rushing home very early, all out of breath and with a strange look in his eye.
** Do you know what day this Is, dear. lie asked, trying to conceal his emotion. I thought very hard for a moment, and then it all dawned upon me. I flushed with
Pl"a\Vhy-why. it’s my birthday’ ** I exclaimed. *■ How lovely of you to thtnk ot it "—he hadn't for several years— and to come way home just to tell me so.
" Yes/’ he replied In a queer little tone that I took to be emotion. " and I'm go-inK to give you the house for your very own See, here is the deed already fixed and requiring only your signature. Better get pen and ink as quick as you can, for I’ve sot to hurry back to the shop.’
Full of delight. I did as he wanted, and was just kissing him for a dear, generous husband, when a violent knock sounded at the front door, and then, without ceremony. in walked Sheriff Farmer with a paper In his hand.	.
“ Sorry neighbor.” ho said, with a siek-lv grin, "but I've jest got to clap an attachment pn your house Don t like to, but duty is^duty. and the law Is supreme.
“ I’m sorry.” returned your father jovially. " but you see, Sam. the house is the property of my wife. Just gave it to her as a ‘little birthday remembrance. Guess vou'll have to take your attachment away with you and make pipe lighters of it. Come in again, Sam.’*
That day the sausage factory failed, and on the following day the Methodist minister, who was one of the creditors for pork supplied to the business, preached on the text. * Houses and riches are the inheritance of fathers, and a prudent wife Is from tlie Lord."
