Mr. W, D. .McCracken, who has made himself somewhat of an expert In matters J3wiss, has turned his attention to the Tyrol, and essays in the volume .now before us to combine the Instruction of a guide book with the amusement of a book of travels- He brings, as be says in his ** foreword ”	'* appreciation and affec-
tion ” to his task, and the result is simple &nd not wholly unpleaslng. It would seem, however, that Mr. McCracken’s volumes on Romance and Teutonic Switzerland must have qualities to commend them that we have not found in “ The Pair Land Tyrol,” for otherwise they could hardly have gained such a wide acceptance as they have,	'
Mr. McCracken’s “ foreword ” declares that it is not his purpose to attempt any profound analysis of things Tyrolean; that It is his province *’ to praise, to repay in a measure the trlendly reception which was everywhere accorded to the writer, to wish good speed and long life to all the dwellers in that greatly blessed and beautiful country, as well as to help the foreign wayfarer to a true understanding and full enjoyment of that happy land Tyrol." This certainly is a kindly purpose, so far as the Tyroleans are concerned, but it does not argue much for the exactness of the descriptions afforded in the book. Everything Is perfect in the Tyrol, so far as Mr. McCracken lets us know; the country is idyllic, its people invariably courteous. Tho foreword contains about as much description as any chapter in the book.
In tho Tyrol men, women, and children display a great fondness for greens of all shades, from yellow to grass and brown greens. While the men of Meran wear broad green suspenders, at Lienz even gieen woolen trousers may be seen. The moment you enter the country you win also notice feathers on the hats—generally the short, curly ones of the blackcock, or straight, defiant eagle’s quills, but often ordinary, every-day feathers dropped by the barnyard fowl. • * * The Tyrolese commonly harness one horse to a carriage made for two.
In '* Tartarin on the Alps," Daudet describes how the Alps are maintained- by a great company, which keeps the mountains clean, provides feather beds in the ravines for tourists and guides to land on if they should fall into the crevasses, supplies chamois to lend color to the view;
In every way commercializes the country. Despite Daudet’s humorous exaggeration, there was a basis of truth in his description.
In the same way—with a basis of truth underlying the statement—it Is fair to say that the Tyrol is made up for the Summer boarder, and Mr, McCracken hints at the fact. It pays—and the guileless Tyrolean sees that it pays—to give the tourist	»
what he wants. So he does. He puts on	I
the " costume of the district,” sticks a	1
rooster’s feather in his cap, and poses;	I
and when the season is ended he takes off	I
his costume, dons a more comfortable	I
suit of clothes, and chinks the money that	I
his theatrical Summer’s work has brought	I
to him. Mr. McCracken himself suggests	I
that this is so in his chapter on the Zil-	j
lertbal, the " Valley of Song and Dance.”	I
Out of the Zillerthal came the Tyrolean Jodeler and the “ famous Tyrolean folksongs,” as the usual programme hath it. Joseph Rainer, a cattle dealer of Fugen, saw that there was money in singing to those who liked to be sung to, so he got his brothers and sister, wrote the “ folksongs ”—and started the jodel around the world, as Mr. McCracken says. He continues: "It is alleged now that some so-called Tyrolese quartets are made up of artists who have never been in the Tyrol at all, but come from neighboring highlands.”
There is a fairly good account of An! dreas Hufer—a chapter where Mr. Me-j Cracken has let the subject get away ! with him to some extent, where he tells the dtory with some effect: he might have been reading Stephenson’s account of *' Spirit ” Seguier in his " Rambles in the Covennes ” before he sat down to tell of Hofer and his grand failure. And there are other places where Mr. McCracken has dropped temporarily the sweet simplicity of Mr. Gilbert’s Archibald Grosvcnor, and used language fitting to his subject. But as a whole his
book is disappointing, childishly enthusiastic, and not at all convincing as either guide book or account of travel in the Tyrol.
, It is full, however, and one will not go astray in following Mr. McCracken as a guide. He takes you everywhere, and tells you very simply and very pleasantly just what you will see, or should see, and how nice the people of the Tyrol are; and then he tells you this again. There is a fairly good index, and on the inside of each cover is a blur of green and red that is supposed to be a map of the country. It is not so simple as the rest of the book, for the red lettering is hard to make out.
