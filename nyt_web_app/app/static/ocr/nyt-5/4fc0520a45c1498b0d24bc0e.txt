ID his earlier sociological essays ^ entitled “Anticipations" and : *' Mankind in the Making/* * Mr. H. G. Wells has now: added a third essay on the ; future, “ A Modern Utopia,*' ; Uke his others, it is carefully _ thought out and reasoned, and holds together much better than the iCBal com- : monwealths imagined by his predecessors. It is to be noted, in passing, that the gov- : emmental ideal of the Bible is a despotism or a monarchyf Utopia-maleers, however, always plan cl republic. Mr. "Wells's mod- -em Utopia is one, "and its theory seems , much more feasible than that of Mr. Bel- : lamy’s accidental #I looking Backward," : which it may be remembered served as the “ constitutional t^stbook of the National-1st s. “ 'Feasible/’ however, 1s a patter or
' comparison, even with Ur. Bellamy and -Mr. Wells.	;
What sort of a place is Mr. Wells's Modern. Utopia? In the first place,, it is . near Switzerland; that is. the two travel- . ers from whose remarks we learn aoout ^ the country are in Switzerland, and suddenly find themselves in Utopia. It floes not seem an unfair deduction, then, that ^ Mr. Wells approves highly of the Swiss j Government. The new counter, being j idealized on modern conditions, is large— ' differing from previous Utopias, some of which have been merely parochial in size; ; covers an entire planet, a planet like our : own, with the same continents, islands, cities. Inhabitants, Only the inhabitants will speak a single language.
I fancy it will be a coalesced language, the synthesis of many. In the past, ingenious men have speculated on the inquiry:	** Which language will survive? ”
The question was badly put. 1 mink now that this wedding and survival of several in a common offspring is a far more probable thing.
The Utopias of the past objected to strangers! Mr. Wells’s being conceived on modern ideas, .does not repel them. And within its world limits its people will be free—not lawless, but "the State will have effectually chipped away just all those spendthrift liberties that waste liberty, and *?ot one liberty more, and so
-	have attained the maximum general freedom.” It follows then that individualities wiil not be suppressed; it will be not by assimilation, but by understanding, that the modern Utopia will achieve itself. A strong point in its government will be that the Utopians, having systematized
^ their sociology, ** will have given some attention to minor officials, a matter tco fnuch neglected by the social reformer on earth. They will not put into the hands of a common policeman powers direct and indirect that would be dangerous to the
-	public in the hands of a Judge, And they will have a%*oided the immeasurable error of making their control of the drink traffic a source of public revenue. The conditions of physical happiness will be better understood in Utopia; it will be Worth while to be there, and the intelligent citizen will watch himself closely."
The State will be the sole land owner, though the local government will hold under it—a sort of feudal relationship existing between them, but the underlying object of all the laws will be a universal maximum of individual freedom. A Utopian may buy and sell and keep: he may have money and use it, within certain limits. Of what he did not gain for himself or bequeath for the education of his children the Stnte will take at his death the lion’s share. In return, however, every Utopian will have a right to a living; the State will insure him a minimum wage and provide him with work. There will be nothing to prevent him from working for higher wages, if he can; if he cannot work ho has a right to support, not to local charity, grudgingly extended, but to a general and willingly given State aid. If he will not work, or is wicked, he will not be drummed out of camp, but will be sent to an island where his fellows are segregated; “there will be no masking the lesson—' Which do you value most, the wide world of humanity or this evil trend in you? ' From that discipline at last tho prisoners will return." The insane, of course, will need care, but the other delinquents or deficients will look after themselves on their own islands.
" ‘ Tour ways are not our ways/ says the State; “but here is freedom and a company of kindred spirits. Elect your rulers, do as it pleases you to do. We. will take care of the knaves, but for the rest —deal yourself with God.’ * * *
" And you see the big convict steamship standing in to the Island of Incurable Cheats. The landing place is clear of people, but beyond the gates a number of engagingly smart looking individuals loiter speculatively. One or two inhabitants in reduced circumstances would act as hotel touts, there are several hotel omnibuses and a Bureau de Change, certainly a Bureau de Change. And a small house with a large board aimed point blank seaward declares itself a Gratis Information Office, and next to it rises the graceful dome of a small casino. Beyond, great hoardings proclaim the advantages of many island specialties, a hustling com-

In Utopia a man . may be Idle if he has ; money enough, the minimum wage, that : is. to ^pay for his keep;' his * insurance „ -against ill-health or old age, .--or any debt : that paternity may have brought upon; him. But that wage he must have. If he j won't work, there is ah island of idlers wh»re he can go.	.	\
Motherhood is a service to the Utopian ; State, which pays women who under f. legitimate sanctions become mothers, pays j: them regularly enough to keep them ind&- ■ pendent -of the fathers, so long as the children reach a minimum standard of ‘ health, and more if the children surpass , that minimum. " This extent of: intervention will abolish two or three hardships ■ •of the -civilized life. It will end the hardships -of the majority of •widows who :on : earth are poor -and incumbered exactly in = proportion as_jthey have discharged the chief distinctive duty of a woman, -and -miserable just in proportion as their standard of life and education is high. In short, Utopia will hold that sound childbearing and rearing is a service done, not to a particular man, but to the whole ‘ community, and all its legal arrangements -Jor motherhood wlli be based on that conception."	«
Utopia is ruled by "voluntary noblemen" chiefly. This order is open to every physically and mentally healthy adult who is able to follow Its severe rule and is not strictly hereditary, though chil- ; dren of such nobles generally enter It. To enter the order one must graduate from school and from college, must **be something ” or have " done something," musrt be In good health and fully adult- Once in, he may not use tobacco, alcohol, or drugs; he may not speculate or sell on his own account unless some process of manufacture changes the nature of the commodity; he may not be an actor or singer; he may not be a servant or keep servants; he may not marry outside of the “ woman's rule," and each year, for at least a week, he must take provisions and blanket and go into the wilderness and “ go back- to the stark mother ’* and think, to come back physically clean, mentally clean. These voluntary nobles are callcd samurai.
The leading principle of the Utopian religion—there is but one—is the repudiation of the doctrine x*f original sin. The Utopians held that man Is good as a whole.
" Religion in its quintessence is a relation between God and man; it is perversion to make it a relation between man and man, and a man may no- more reach God through a priest than love his wife through a priest." So there is no church in Utopia, and no minister, though any man may read books of devotion or hear music that is In harmony with his feel* mgs.
Such is Mr. Wells’s vision of a modern Utopia, It is disturbed by the spectre of M race," for in Utopia all races are on an equality—and in the world they are not. And on the race question the beautiful dream is dissolved. It seems a pity—but it Is only a dream.
