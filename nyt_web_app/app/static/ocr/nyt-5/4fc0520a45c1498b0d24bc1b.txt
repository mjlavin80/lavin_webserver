AISI AMERICAN INVASION.
Our English cousins, or elder brothers, or foster-brothers—as they, or we, may choose to designate the dwellers in the United Kingdom—have suffered at divers times and in divers ways during the past decade from nervousness as to " American invasions.” At one time it was the invasion of American mechanical contrivances and American engineering enterprises that *' got on their nerves.” At another it was the American political machine which was
>	supposed in some uncanny fashion to have been adopted and adapted by Mr. Chamberlain and to have aided in producing that fiscal scheme to which he is conspicuously devoted. Again it was the invasion of American buyers of pictures and books, of which the treasures of Mr. Morgan in Kensington: Museum (awaiting the repeal of the ridicu-i lous tariff charges on their importation here) are the ever-present testimony. Still again it was the American type of newspaper, with its novel modes and methods, and* particularly its horrid tendency to use phrases supposed to be American, and words spelled in the manner current in America.
This last, it is to be noted, has probably excited more alarm and resentment among our English friends or relatives, that is, among those of them who write for the critical journals, than have been excited by any other intrusion from this side of the Atlantic. Take, for instance, the elision of the vowel *' u” from the word hono(u)r, &c. Here, if we may be pardoned the confusion of metaphor, was the visible shibboleth by which the true-born Briton, the heir of the uncounted wealth of English tradition, tested the respectability of writers and admitted them to or excluded them from the visiting list of literature. It was in vain to contend that “ honor ” was the legitimate descendant e£ the Latin word as it was used by writers of the grade of Cicero, or to point out that the " u,” which had crept in through the French, notoriously sprung- from the baser colloquial speech of the Romans. The English critics would have none uf it. It was as if each of them protested as to literature, no matter of what intrinsic excellence, in the words of Lovelace:
I could not love thee, dear, so much, Loved I not honour mure.
Lo, now, in the dawn of the twentieth century comes The London Times, conservative of the conservatives, especially in small matters, the most generally recognized leader of English journalism, with authority less questioned than that of any other, and proposes to an amazed kingdom the adoption of an American dictionary, the introduction of an American standard of spelling, of pronunciation, of usage to British households—a dictionary which shamelessly gives preference, with all that that implies, to honor over honour, and reports of the latter that it still prevails in England, thus frankly stamping it as obsolescent and doomed to disappear when the progress of enlightenment reaches that island. Nor this alone. The Times does not propose this radical innovation in an academic fashion in a mere editorial article. It proposes it as a matter of business. It wishes to sell the dictionary, and it is so confid ent that it will sell well on its
bare merits that the offer is made to send it free of cost, or trouble, or 4* any obligation to subscribe ’* for one week, promising to take it back and pay all expenses if so desired. The advertisement by The Times describes the Century Dictionary in the most flattering manner. “ We believe,” it says, ** that the book reveals, under the test not of
V
mere inspection but of actual use, merits so great that-most of the people who : have-had the volumes for a few days i will retain them.” It is “ a book altogether unlike any book made by great specialists, admired by great critics; a book which we could unhesitatingly
recommend you to buy.”
This cannot but seem to the purists something like treason. In reality it Is but an intelligent and a shrewd recognition of the inevitable change in the use of the English language. It is intelligent because the change goes on almost imperceptibly and only a student of fairly long vision can trace it. It is shrewd because it is a well-devised plan to take advantage not only of the change, but of the tendency of all English-speaking persons gradually to talk more and more nearly alike, not by sticking to old forms but by slowly adopting such of the new ones as best suit the evolution of the race.
