The humanest thing In the book- is also . of New York, and that is “ To a New : York Shop Girl Dressed for, Sunday.” ] The humanest thing, for somehow the . people within these covers a re: shadowy. . Yet that does not mean lack of reality. ‘ It is rather the unhusked souls of men and women that are dealt with, and although every-day little things may not be obscure or unimportant to her, what people' hope for and dream, and do not i-know at all how to give expression to 5 even in their own inner ear—theso are the things with which she is concerned. :
‘‘There Is a natural body and a spirit- . ual body," It .has been asserted, but today we are put In doubt about that spirit- . ual body* The poet has been put in doubt about it, too; nevertheless it is her theme.
But between the theme of this new collection and that of the first one there is a difference, not very evident, but some- . thing as one passes from the Kyrie Eleison to the Christe Eleison in Dvo- . rak’s mass. At first the cry comes from the ground, but Christe Eleison Is uttered by a man standing upright and looking at the sky.
Mediaeval forms of thought and the clear-cut modern scientific way of looking at things are strangely mingled. It Is synthetic.
Did not Emerson talk wistfully of the coming of a synthetic philosopher, something as John the Baptist spoke of Him who was to follow? No particular man : or woman can ever be or do as Emerson, out of his desire, predicted: but a new voice such as this one means that there is a new spirit abroad, that people are ; thinking in a new way, a clearer and : a better. There will be other poets of this order during the twentieth century, ■ no doubt, some two or three at intervals,
as there were In the nineteenth. We are
never quite without our prophets, though ' we do not know much about them until ' they are dry and old upon our book ■ shelves.	P-	;

Xcw York Times Book Review:
Miss Anna Hampstead Branch's first book. “ The Heart of the Road,” made no widespread commotion. What will happen to the new volume. “ The Shoes That Danced.” does not yet appear—that is. what will happen immediately, for of its ultimate future, together with *' The Heart of the Road," there can be no manner of doubt. These poems must rank in due time among the few volumes which grow venerable but never stale, are honorably placed in all libraries, and in a modest shelf of books are inevitable.
This is a new and resonant voice, not i an echo of any other. For this reason it may not be at once accepted by the many, who will very likely complain of obscurity. For example, one who runs may not read “ The Dreaming Man,” nor “ Paracelsus " either, nor Emerson’s , “ Sphinx."
Another class of objectors may be pained by roughnesses of versification, and with reason; but there is something pleasing about a poet’s refusal to be shackled by a rhyme or a question of metre. She will lead language where she likes, but it may not lead her, nor any happy or musical phrase turn her from her thought. That the effect of the whole should be so musical and finished, as well as without apparent effort. Is wonderful, considering the great freedom of the technique.
One thinks of Whitman’s prophetlike utterances or of Emerson’s rough-shod rhymes and metres, but It is not because of similarity in technique that one calls these two, great ones to mind, nor Is anything so foolish as a comparison intended; only that in theirs and in this new verse is the same strangeness that is in complex music. Many poets, some of them famous and admirable, are merely performers, not composers at all. One takes up a sonnet as if It were a violin and skillfully plays upon it with other men’s thoughts and phrases, and he has his reward, but his music dies with him. Other poets must have a full orchestra-all sorts of instruments playing at once, some of which you only half hear. There are many people of intelligence to whom Wagner is only a confused noise, and Browning's similarly orchestrated poems a jargon.	’
The more Important of these new poems, I suspect, have not been through the magazines. If they have I should like much to know in what periodical “ The Madonna of the Earth ’’ appeared, or *’ The Dreaming Man," Or “ Under the Trees.” They do not classify with what one knows as 11 magazineable.” And they are of such uniform fineness that the one or two which are weaker stand out conspicuously, as the one or two good ones do in most such volumes. One may smile a little at “ A Political Boss " and ** Shame on Thee, O Manhattan.” The poet is astonished and indignant at our
