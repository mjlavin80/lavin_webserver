Charles Scribner’s Sons have-inserted a shortx biographical preface to the new edition of the late Francis H. Nichols's " Through Hidden Shensi.’* (8vo, pp. about 350. Cloth, $2 net.), which is appearing with many illustrations taken by
and. for* the author. The writer says of
Mr. Nichols:
Mr. Nichols had not only a rare talent and temperament for the work he had set himself, but a breadth of view and humane ideals which were very noticeable. He had a sincere sympathy with the people whose life he studied, and that capacity for successful communication with Eastern races of which the value may be judged by Its rarity. He seems to have shown discretion as unvarying as his persistence, and from his letters and papers which have reached home it is evident that he made friends under the most unexpected and adverse conditions.
The author, as will be recalled, died late In December, last year, from pneumonia. He was at that time at Gyang-tse, a little more than a -hundred miles from Lhassa, which he had intended to enter when he left New York over, a year and a half previously. He became interested in the Forbidden Land when he was sent by The Christian Herald in charge of its relief for sufferers by famine In the little-visited province of Shensi. This journey resulted in the present volume.
