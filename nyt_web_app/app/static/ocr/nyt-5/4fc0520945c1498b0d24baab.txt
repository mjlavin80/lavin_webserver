A Ruriaway Princess.
THK PRINCESS BIjOPKS. By Harold Uoc-Ct rath. 16mo. Indianapolis:	The Bobbs-
Merrlll Company.
A very willful young person Is the Princess Hildegarde of Barcheit. She hud been educated in Prance and England, which may have accounted for both her willfulness and her charm. Her uncle the Grand Duke, familiarly called among his sister States (behind his back) Brummbiir, (Old Grumpy,) was, upon the whole, fairly generous to the madcap Princess, and gave her leave to choose her own husband from a collection he himself had selected. It was not his fault that Hilde-garde was hard to please, finding this man too young and that too old, this too grave and that too gay—until, exasperated. the Grand Duke rose In his authority and decreed that Hildegarde should marry the Prince of Doppelktnn, whose vineyards and wines were among the best in the world. Dopr>elkmn was no more desirable to the Princess than the other proffered suitors, for did he not have a very red nose, and was he not past sixty?
So Hildegarde vowed that she would never marry him, and to circumvent her uncle's plans she drew up a false marriage certificate, which fooled no one, since her uncle knew all about it. But it did succeed in bringing about a meeting between the American Consul and the Hon. Betty Moore, the Princess’s best friend. Let it be said Vight here, however, that the American Consul had nothing whatever to. do with the affairs of the Princess Hildegarde other than to tell her story. His concerns were entirely with the Honorable Betty.
After the failure of the mock marriage Hildegarde sought other means of escaping the unpleasant marriage. She eloped. Not with any one, hut quite alone. It was not her fault that Max Scharfenstein should have been suddenly obliged to quit the duchy and in his haste should have
boarded the same railway carriage with herself, that he should have been mis- i taken as the Princess’s eloping compan- | I ion, that things should have looked very black for him—and for the matter of that ! for the Princess, too; that as luck would liave it the wine brand used on the royal i bottles of the Doppelkinn cellars should have been found on his arm, that that, to-^gether with a miniature of the Prince’s first wife, which he had worn about his i neck as a child, should have established 1 his unmistakable identity as the heir to Doppelkinn; that the old Prince himself : should have Indignantly refused to marry the unwilling Princess—that, in short, everything should have eventually turned out to the perfect satisfaction of all con-‘ cerned.	•
In the Duchy of Barcheit " Court .etiquette resolves Itself into simple American hall-fellow-well-metlsm. The Prln- ' cess rides about alone in the early morning, she flirts with-gay young Americans,. her friends call .her Gretclaen, and even , the Duke himself seems happily careless oX anything like the formalities.-in spite of the fact that for the ’visitors and 'mia-t -dle-class ’residents -the laws of Barcheit were yery: strict indeed,	,
