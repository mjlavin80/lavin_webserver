CHARLES II.
The Story of His Wanderings in
■	Exile.^
ISS EVA SCOTT, who Has already made a study of the famous Prince Rupert of the Rhine, has just completed the first of two volumes on the exile from England of that warrior's more famous cousin. King Charles II. of Great Britain. Charles, as Prince of Wales, fled from England on June 20. 1G46, and returned there as King on May 20, lGfiO, nearly fourteen years later. Miss Scott's first volume, however, covers only the first eight years of this period of exile. No other historian has given an account of this time except in outline; but Miss Scott considers that its importance makes it worthy- of detailed treatment.
Charles left the English mainland on March 4, 164G, and finally, on June he shook English' dust from his feet and sailed for France, in obedience to his mother's command, but against the advice of his council. Not until two months later was he received by the French King. Louis XIV. Louis gave him an armchair, and on his departure, went with him to the stairs. Conversation was impossible, as Charles spoke no French and Louis no English; so the interview was rather trying, and it was noted that the cousins seemed embarrassed* The Queen Regent also gave Charles a chair—an important act, for it settled the exile's rank at the French Court.
The Prince’s stay at St. Germains was pleasant enough, except for his mother’s persistency in trying to marry him to Anne de Montpensier, heiress to four duehics and 20,000,000 francs. “ Mademoiselle," however, as the young lady was called, iiccording to French etiquette, had fixed her mind on marrying the Emperor of Germany, and treated Charles with

coolness, so that he turned from her in anger. It may be added that she finally married Lausun, an adventurer, and separated from him after a miserable life.
Queen Henrietta Maria had more than one plan for her son, and was scheming to have both England and Scotland rise for him and his father, spending her money freely to secure success. A rising did indeed take place in England, but it failed. The Scots were too canny for the royalists just then, and Charles, who had gone to join the revolt, returned, landing in Holland on Sept. 1, 1G48. This rising sealed the King's fate; on Jan. 30, 1649, he was executed, and the Prince of Wales became King in name.
Almost at tho same time began the civil war in France known as the war of the Fronde, or sling, which had evil effects on the fortunes of the new King. Louis could help him no longer, and after some months* delay, Charles departed from Holland, returning once more to Jersey, whence he could reach England or Ireland should the quarrels among the Commonwealth people suggest that it advisable to do so. The time was unpro-pitious, however, and Charles went back to Holland, where, on April 27, 1G50, he accepted the Scottish terms at Breda, and was at once invited to return to Scotland as King. Miss Scott writes:
The treaty of Breda marks the crisis in Charles’s career. He was • not at this period the cold-blooded traitor and hypocrite that he is sometimes represented, but a young man—hardly more than boy —very sorely tempted. A definite choice was laid before him; on the one side were honor, truth, and honesty, with poverty and exile; on the other, perjury, dishonor. and a kingdom. Conscience, the traditions of his childhood, the memory of his father, affection for his friends, bade him choose the first. An easy, self-indulgent nature and the sophistries poured incessantly into his ears drew him to the last. The downward path was not an easy one. and he did not sacrifice his friends or perjure himself with a light heart. Step by step he struggled desperately, yet yielded always, until at last he laid his honor in the dust and forfeited his self-respect forever.
The treaty required him to accept the Scots Parliament and its acts, including the actual and possible establishment of Presbyterian ism, to break the treaty with
Ireland, which had favored the Catholics, and to proceed against all “ Papists M if the Scots Parliament should require him to do so.	’
The most immediate result of this treaty was the execution of the “ Great Marquis ’* of Montrose. He had undertaken to raise the Highlanders in'Charles’s favor against the stubborn Covenanters, and did not stop his work when Charles notified him of his action. His rising failed; he had to flee, and, trusting himself to Macleod of Assynt, was by him sold to the Marquis of Argyle, his long-time enemy. As one taken in arms against the Parliament, Montrose had small hope of his life. But Argyle, despite a promise to Charles to spare his life, preferred that his rival should perish. Montrose, bound with cords, was carried in triumph through Edinburgh streets in a cart, driven by the hangman. “ Widows of the men slain in his wars had been hired to incite the mob, and because it was hoped that stones would be thrown, the Marquis's hands were tied, ‘ that he might not be able, by his hands, to save his face.* ”
Argyle had the cart stop in front of the balcony where he sat, that he might gloat over nis victim at leisure. But he could not stand Montrose's gaze, and retreated into the house. Three days later Montrose heard his sentence, imposed without the pretense of a trial, and on May 21, 1650, he was hanged.
The hangman wept unrestrainedly as he performed his office, and the crowd was not less moved. “ It is absolutely believed that he hath overcome more men by his death, in Scotland, than he would have done if he had lived,” wrote an English Parliamentarian, " for I never saw a sweeter carriage in a man in all my life."
On June 24, 1650, Charles landed on Scottish soil. Though received at first with joy, the Parliament had no notion of giving him a free hand. “ The King’s position," wrote Sir Edward Walker, '* is most sad and dangerous. * * * He is outwardly served and waited on with all fitting ceremony due to a King,- but in his liberty not much above a prisoner, sentinels fceing set every night about his lodgings, few daring to speak freely or
privately to him, and spies set upon his words and actions.” A denunciation of his father was required of him as the price of his coronation and of further assistance by tho Scots and perhaps on the principle that one more oath could add little to his infamy, Charles mads it. Then came Dunbar, when " the Lord delivered ” the Scottish army into Cromwell’s hands: and then the coronation at Scone on Jan. 1,- 1U"»1, after a public mourning by Charles for his father’s and grandfather’s sins. Loiter in the year came the invasion of England, and the defeat at Worcester, followed by the King’s flight.
It was in this flight that Charles had his romantic escape at Boscobel in the oak. Other more narrow escapes occurred; but the King at last reached Trent in safety, and thence got to French territory. He gained little but life from -his escape. One after another the Continental powers made peace with the Commonwealth, and at the middle of 10r>4 Charles found himself absolutely friendless. He had no money, either; contributions were taken up for him secretly from time to time, but between these gifts lie had not credit enough to borrow twenty pistoles. France, indeed, paid him to leave her territory; no European country would receive him, there was no party for him in his own land. Well, indeed, ■says Miss Scott, “ might Hyde write to Taylor: ‘ The King is now as low as to human understanding he can be.‘ "
