R. DENT, in his “ Alessandro Scarlatti," has made an exhaustive study at first hand from original documents and scores., of a composer whose importance In the history of opera has been universally recosTiifced but singularly neglected by the historical students. This neglect Mr. Dent explains by-the fact tnat the modern period of careful research such as has been made into the lives of Bach, Handel, Mozart, and Beethoven was marked by a decided reaction against the Italian music. There has been no authoritative study of Scarlatti till Mr. Dent undertook it, in the libraries of Italy, where most of the manuscripts of his works are preserved. It is an important original contribution to the history of music in the seventeenth century, when the history of m"sic is chiefly the history of opera riotously developing1 from the seed planted by the Florentine reformers in l(iOO.
It was the age of the baroque in architecture, and Mr. Dent makes a suggestive comparison between that architecture, expressive of the pomps and vanities of its own time, and the social life, literature, and music of the period. In them the true moving spirit of the baroque is to l>e found, and for us U?e opera sums up in brief all the most typical features of that spirit. Venice possessed seventeen opera houses. Bologna was insanely devoted to music, and Dukes of Modena and Doges of Venice quarreled openly over the affections of prima donnas. Music was the chief factor in the life of Italy, and the seventeenth century witnessed technical progress and jtrain in structural development, culminating in the classical school of the early eighteenth century, wherein the foundations of the sonata and the symphony, and hence of the work of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, were laid. Alessandro Scarlatti, who flourished in the latter half of that and^he first quarter of the next century, did :n,ost ix. ^arry-mg on that development. How he did it, and the nature of his contributions to it, Mr. Dent has undertaken to show.
Scarlatti's earlier works were those chamber cantatas that had an immense popularity not easy for us to understand— a form of long-winded recitative and arias with instrumental accompaniment, on all sorts of subjects; of which Scarlatti left as many as D00. They were frequently narratives or dramatic monologues put into the mouth of some classical personage. But an early success with an opera,
" Gli Equivoci nel Sembiante," brought him into popularity and turned his attention to the form of composition most popular and most influential in Italy. Mr. *Dent gives some amusing pictures of what opera meant at that period and how little it had in common with modern romantic opera, to say nothing of modern music drama:
The descendants of Scarlatti’s operas now move in somewhat humble circles, out they still keep their original title— melodrama. The persecuted heroine the splendid hero, the heavy father, the adventuress, and even the comic lovers, fa-

miliar to us, if.no longer on the boards of .the AdelphJ, at least in the pages of Mr.-Jerome, were all stock characters at the Heal Teatro di S. Bartolomeo. Tho. details of the plot may-vary, but there is ■hardly any variation in the-characters, and none whatever in their rlovemaking; which is theic one and only - occupation.
*	* * The scenery, too, was'a. most im* portant part of the entertainment, there being generally three, if not. taur». .sepa- i rate scenes in each act, each no doubt of ; a most elaborate kind, judging from the designs that remain; and many operas included some sort of a transformation scene.
Scarlatti was no reformer, and he took things as he found them. It is his merit that ho developed the form of the aria into a high degree of emotional bnd structural organization. His time was that at which instrumental music was beginning to be recognized as a possible rival to the voice; and while his sympathies were all with the singers he was quick to take advantage of any other means, that facilitated the expression of his thoughts. The chorus was disappearing from the opera, and Scarlatti helped its going by treating it In the most perfunctory way possible. The concerted finale as developed by Mozart was still a long way in the future.
Mr. Dent discusses Scarlatti’s work in great detail and with the help of very numerous musical quotations. It is not, however, a technical discussion beyond the easy apprehension of the intelligent musical student, and for such as have the taste for musical history it is an engrossing chapter in that history.

Mr. Newman, in his book on “ Wagner/’ in the series ertitied "The Music of the Masters," has not attempted a full critical study of Wagner in his little book. He has intended to " be useful,” to offer a fruide and a help to the plain man, Wagr.er as a musical dramatist is his subject, and the theorizings of Wagner ir. other lines of thought he disregards. It is Mr. Newman’s thesis that only as a musical dramatist was Wagner great. As a " thinker ” he Is receding more and more from the public eye, while as a musician our admiration for him is probably greater than ever. The metaphysical and other talk wh.i which Wagner himself and his partisans have submerged his music is to be put aside, and his art stands or fal s by the amount of art there is in it, irrespective of what social or moral lesson can be drawn from IL
Mr. Nov.-man's position is a perfectly clear one. He has developed it at length iu his larger book on Wagner, which remains one of the most acute studies of the subject that we possess. We are given the sarne idea in this little book; the idea that " no great artist was ever so enormously affected in his views’ of the cosmos by the circumstances of "his own life.” The popular view of him as ” a demigod of adamantine artistic will ” is a mere myth. Like Shakespeare, he needed the impact of another brain upon his own before his imagination could be stimulated to its best flight. It is this mental constitution that accounts for Wagner’s doing so litle really original work in his earlier days. In each successive work Mr. Newman finds that Wagner sang his own sorrows and joys, his own needs and desires of that particular moment, identifying the world’s need, the world’s ideal, wuh his own. Adding to this trait the further passion for making aesthetic generalizations from his own artistic nature, Mr. Newman finds the key to his psychology at his hand.
The most important deduction from this is perhaps to be seen in the explanation to which it leads of Wagner’s artistic theories as to" the musical drama: "He being a musician before everything else, the only true kind of drama is musical drama; he having an imperfect sense of poetry apart from music, non-musical poetry is an error; he being lacking in the peculiar feeling painters have for paintings and sculptors for sculpture, these arts are quite minor affairs." Hence his synthesis of the “ art work of the future,’ in which ail the arts are united, with mutual surrender of something of their individual importance for the benefit of the one whole, which is the music drama." He was right, thinks Mr. Newman, in aiming at the " Unitarian furm," in which music and poetry reacted equally upon each other; but he was wrong in supposing that musical drama could " unify " all the arts or that any combination of them could satisfy the distinctive aesthetic cravings to which each ministers, or that musical drama covered the whole of life so completely that poetical drama was superlluous.
Mr. Newman's analyses of the successive works of Wagner find their greatest qualities always residing In the beauty and magnificence of the music, not upon the ethical side that Wagner was so anxious to have recognized. These analyses are compact, but certain and clear in their handling, giving the most important motives in musical notation and interpreting the music sympathetically. In fact, there is no bound to Mr. Newman’s admiration of Wagner the musician. And whatever measure of agreement may be accorded to his judgment of the other elements of Wagner's work, and to his dissection of Wagner’s character and psychology; it Is stimulat-
ing and refreshing ,to. come upon so strong antKjDrJglnai and drastic a piece of criticism as he has delivered in *this little book.	‘

Mr. Markham Lee's .hook on Tscliui-kowski In the same series is a less distinguished performance; but it is a useful addition' to the somewhat extensive Tschaikowskl literature that has grown up in recent years. He is no slavish admirer of his subject. He recognizes that his work is very unequal, that there is much second-rate matter. And the weaker points of Tschaikowskl’s music—his undue pursuit of the morbid, his extravagance of idea, his noisiness of orchestration—have caused the enormous popularity of some of his music, while they have also injured the effect oC his other pieces. For while these qualities create a demand for the performance of the other pieces, it lessens the effect produced by them through disappointment at their less apparent emotional or pessimistic trend.
Mr, Markham Lee plunges at once into a detailed consideration of Tschaikowski’s music, piece by piece, with abundant thematic quotation. His criticism is j searching and candid as well as sympathetic, and his descriptions are picturesque.
IV.
Mr. Mason in his book on modern music , ’’ From Grieg to Brahms " gave evidence of his philosophical temperament in the discussion of artistic principles and their concrete embodiment in the work of masters of diverse ideals and methods. Such a spirit is valuable, for there Is much that is superficial and that treats only of exterior things in current writings about music. Mr. Mason is even more philosophical and more largely concerned with abstract principles in his latest book, " Beethoven and His Forerunners." He has tried to show, in the first half of it, tiie general course of evolution of the art, by which the foundations were laid for the work of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven; In the second half he treats of those men. of their lives, and the circumstances of their time, their place in the history of music, and analyzes the essential qualities that gave them their significance.
Mr. Mason's abstract method takes him far afield into some general considerations as to the nature and development of the aesthetic sense of humanity, and the part that music has played therein. More specifically, he traces the general characteristics of the earlier manifestation of the art as It is disclosed in the music of Palestrina ,and hfs contemporaries, especially dwelling upon the contrast between their mysticism and the modern spirit. This he finds expressed in the difference between the idealistic impulse of our contemporary life, which fills the mind with a rich and various mass of contents, and the thin, impalpable, and austere conceptions of the mystic. The way in which music in the seventeenth century tended toward a fuller, more varied, and more poignant emotional expressiveness he follows out in some concrete detail and more generalization, and in the next chapter he undertakes to discover " the means by which musicians learned after long trial and patient experiment to give shape and integral life to"ini this motley array of feelings and effects they had summoned out of the depths of the human spirit." General artistic principles, general features of artistic design, the newly discovered methods of manipulating musical material, are the subjects of his study. Through this he has led up to the more particular consideration of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. As much biography as is necessary to show forth the character and quality of the men is given, but the chief consideration is devoted to their methods and achievements in music.
It is doubtful If this book of Mr. Mason’s will prove as valuable or find as wide acceptance as his earlier one. It is a laborious task to follow him through some of his general reflections. It Is a rarefied atmosphere through which he moves for long periods together. His subjective, reflective treatment offers much that is elusive to the inquiring mind. Mr. Mason, as wo have said, gives much that is valuable in the contemporary discussion of music; but we are not sure but that in this book he has given too much of it at once.
V.
Mr. Gilman has gathered in his “ Phases of Modern Music " a series of critical articles that have appeared recently in several periodicals, and that relate to some of the most Important recent music and contemporaneous musicians. Strauss, MacDowell, Elgar, Loeffler. Mascagni, Grieg, Cornelius, Verdi and Wagner, " Parsifal," are some of the subjects he has chosen, all in reference to some of the recent developments in which they have taken a part. Mr. Gilman ranges himself uncompromisingly with the modems. The newest note is the one he most persistently seeks and sounds. Realism, the descriptive, the imitative in music. Is to him the highest good. The other kind, he suggests, is only ** tonal arabesques," pandering to the '* susciting.
of pleasure m beautiful .forms," " pretti-ncs8v'* an “ idle loveliness." Its supporters are meiely “ Afallant feuilletonists with a theoretical axe to grind/* Even Mr. MacDowell must he reproved for occasionally U3ing that " necessarily arbitrary and anomalous musical formula," the sonata form. The matter is not quite so unquestionable as Mr. Gilman assumes It to be,	.	„
Mr. Gilman not infrequently says an apt thing, gives a true characterization, delivers a pointed phrase In his discussions, but it Is not often possible to follow him in alL.his ways; for they are sometimes oversubtle and elusive. He lias not yet the weight of reason and the authority of judgment that will no doubt come to one who reflects and thinks seriously as he does. And he is sometimes apparently more engrossed with the manner than with tho matter of his discourse, going out of his way to cull the choice phrase, the " colorful " word, (to use one of his own.) Not to put too fine a point upon It, his style verges dangerously upon the pr^elcux, rather than the distinguished; and a style is not good that has to such an extent the potency of exasperating the reader as his has.
VI.	.
Mr. Hanchett intends his book. “* The Art of the Musician,*’ to stimulate Investigation of music—the real study of music itself, instead of the arts of playing and singing, which have so long been mistaken for it. He wishes, furthermore, to help mature lovers of music to understand the aims and purposes of the composer, some of the methods of his work, and to get some ground for fairly judging his attainments and results. The purpose is a useful one, and such help toward intelligent listening to music, and an understanding of what It really is, is needed. For though music Is the most popular of all the arts, In its higher manifestations it is the least understood. There are different ways of going about the task Mr. Hanchett undertakes. His method involves a more or less close contact with the actual material of music, a consideration of the different qualities and possibilities of that material, and of what composers do with it and how they use it. Technicalities, the author declares, he relegates to the background, and uses them, when he does use them, with ample explanation. He assumes, however, the ability to read music easily, and provides examples in musical notation yery copiously.
There Is suggestive ness in this treatment, though there is not the completeness and logical development that the author seems to be aiming for. There is Interest in his discussion of rhythm as the ** Life of Music," and the devices that the masters have employed In this field to gain unity in the several movements of one work; of harmony as " The Soul of Music,” and of melody as " The Beauty of Music.” Thematic development, counterpoint, and form, classical and romantic music, are the subjects of some of the other chapters. And while Mr. Hanchett may not have got to the bottom of all that he discusses, much of what he says Is useful and much will be illuminating to the intelligent student who follows him through his discourse and scrutinizes the examples he gives. There is need of insistence upon his contention:
The appeal of music is to the emotions, but it is an intelligent appeal. Perhaps its greatest virtue is its power of lifting the mind above sordid cares and worries and giving pleasure, stimulus, peace, and rest; but that power is multiplied many times by a thorough understanding of the structure and secret of the art. We have put tyo much emphasis upon technic, performance, display; too little upon expression, interpretation, education.
VII.
Mr. Fischer’s book on Beethoven is no more a " character study ’’ than any competent biography of an imposing personality must be. It is a good summary of the master's life, as it is presented in the original authorities on the subject, whose work the author has read to good purpose. There is much that is extant to be drawn upon, and there is little more in this volume than these authorities have provided. It is presented in a straightforward style, though without much distinction; and what the author has added in the way of critical estimate is unimportant. Nor has he thrown any new light upon the character and artistic nature of Beethoven. The chapter on Wagner's indebtedness to Beethoven is a collection of some of the significant references to be found abundantly in Wagner’s numerous essays and autobiographical outgivings. He draws attention to some parallelisms that go to show Beethoven’s artistic influence upon the later master. Thus, the use of the trombones ** when solemnity was required," in the Benedlctus of the mass in D and in the Ninth Symphony, is supposed to have influenced the Instrumentation in " Parsifal " and the Funeral March in " Siegfried." The use of the pedal point as well as of the variation form is also adduced, though the specific instances of Wagner’s employment of the variation form in the ways In which Beethoven developed it might be puzzling to find. Beethoven is credited with showing Wagner, how to write “ celestial music,"

The fifth volume in the Music Story Series.	" The Story of the Violin,** fa
among the better onns of that unequal collection. Mr. Stoeving is professor of his instrument at the Guildhall School, T.ondon. and a student of its history, and his work upon it is not unworthy of a place among the very numerous treatises of which the violin is the subject. There is a perennial fascination about It that no other musical instrument seems to possess. Its immemorial history, its important part in the development of musical art, the magic of the old makers that has so tantalized modem seekers for their secrets, the delicacy and subtlety of its qualities of excellence, all unite in mak-B Ing it an engrossing subject. Mr. Stoeving’s style is somewhat exuberant, but he is in command of the facts of the literature and hisLory of the subject, and his account of the origin and development of the violin is readable.
The students can trace its development back to the ninth century, but whether Its earlier history was European or Oriental has not been determined, and many nations have possessed Instruments that might be the violin's prototype. The early history of such instruments in Europe touches Interesting phases of musical history, which the writer brings pleasantly forward with some exercise of the fancy and with plentiful use of illustrations drawn from mediaeval sources. The invention of the actual violin in the form substantially as we possess it is in a curious kind of doubt. In vest iga tors have come into conflict over the claims of Gaspar Duiffoprugcar, to whom it is attributed, and there are singular dis-crepancies^as to the facts and dates of his life. There is a whole literature about the great Cremonese makers, of which, of course, Mr. Stoeving can give but a brief suggestion. What of the ” secret *' of these makers? He thinks it a secret still, but careful and instinctive selection of woods, some small, insignificant Item in the composition of the varnish, the lifetime of devotion and thought* the peculiarly favorable conditions, are, in his opinion, enough to account for the supremacy of the old makers.
The development of the art of playing and writing for the violin, the achieve' rnents of virtuosos, the growth In the importance of the instrument to the chief place it now occupies in music, are the subjects of a series of chapters that bring us down to the present day. This day Mr. Stoeving finds to be one of "doleful sterility,” denoted chiefly by the output of 44 small pieces ”—the *' Characterstiick** without character—the “ Kantasiestiick *’ without fancy. ** What is needed is perhaps not another Viotti who can write classical concertos, a Vieuxtemps, a Bruch, a Brahms, or a Tschaikowsky who squeezes the fiddle like a lemon to get the most tone out of it for the sake of his orchestra.*' The violin world is “ waiting for its Chopin, the man who possesses the master key with which to unlock as yet unexplored regions of poetry and beauty." So Mr. Stoeving concludes his survey of the literature of his Instrument There are useful appendices discussing some of the older names and descriptions of the violin and giving chronological tables showing the descent of violin players in the different schools, lists of the chief makers, and a bibliography.

Mr. Phelps, In his study of ** Parsifal. *• has made a courageous and ingenious attempt at a difficult task, such an attempt
I as has been made before, but never with complete success. He has made an English text fit to be ^urig to Wagner’s score, preserving the sense and the emphasis-of word and syllable. Some of the difficulties are insuperable, and Mr. Phelps bng not surmounted them; but there Is much that Is strikingly good in his version. The text Is printed oppoMte the German, page by page, with all the stage directions. A useful device is the indication of the orchestral passages that interrupt the declamation in order, as the translator says, to suggest the elaborate fullness of the orchestral score and to prevent an impression of the drama as being " a simple tale quickly told and easily slipped over in a casual half hour.". In the choral passages, too. the text is so arranged as to give an
8 idea of the complexity and of the cumulative effect of the. drama in the theatre. It is one of the most useful of the ** Parsifal *' translations.
X.
Mr. Kobb£ has revised and enlarged his analysis of Wagner's “ NIbelung ” trilogy, published some fifteen years ago, adding similar treatment of *' Tristan und Isolde," “Die Meislerslnger,” and “ Parsifal.'VHis method Is ta tell the story of each drama concisely, quoting the “leading motives as they appear in the score for the first *
J tlme. He does not enter deeply Into any critical consideration of the dramas, their • philosophy, or their, origins, and such .com-. j - - 1 ■
rnent as he makes upon them may not find universal acceptance from the thoughtful students of these works.
XI.
In	'* Parsifal, IjOhengrin, anti	the I^eg-
| end	of	the Holy Grail "	the	point of
view is that which takes Wagner at his own valuation as a philosopher and an ethical teacher, wielding in Art a moral power. As both “ Lohengrin ” and " Parsifal “ were drawn from the legends of the Holy Grail, there is an appropriateness	in	considering them	together, not-
withstanding the great differences Jn their musical	and poetic style.	The	introduc-
tion discusses briefly the legends. The two dramas are expounded in detail and with ample musical quotation.
XII.
Mr. Jonson's Chopin book is " a handbook. a musical ‘ Baedeker,’ a guide through the ‘ Thoughtland and Dreamland ’ of Chopin’s kingdom.” It is a compilation of what the critics and biographers have said about his works. These are listed in the order of their opus numbers. and under each heading are gathered excerpts from Niecks, Huneker, Barbedette, Kullak, Von Biilow. and the rest, as to their aesthetic quality and technical characteristics. The dedications and the dates of composition and publication are given. There is a short biographical and critical introduction, a bibliography, and tabular lists of the works. It is likely to be a useful compilation for hurried reference.
Xltl.
Modern contrapuntal teaching is constantly in the direction of greater freedom and emancipation from the severity and strictness of the historical contrapuntal writers. Mr. Spalding’s textbook promotes this freedom. It “ offers suggestions for the cultivation of such a musical instinct that whenever polyphony is desirable in composition the various parts shall be made interesting and truly melodious.” The treatment is stimulating and suggestive, with a great mass of examples by modern writers, from Bach to Tschaikowsky and Strauss, that are calculated to infuse the interest of a living reality into the study of the subject.
