Mary Moss, writing in The Atlantic Monthly, avows that she has “ lately ** read sixty English and American novels, fresh from the press, and kept memoranda of her impressions. In American fiction she finds a “ recognizable Western school," though Mr. Owen Wister, treating of “ cowboys and biscuit-shooters,*' frankly from the point of view of an impressionable outsider, *' no more belongs in the west than Mr. Thompson-Seton in a menagerie.*' But there is much contemporary fiction bearing the Western hall-mark that is written by Easterners in the East. No such vital influence is now working in English fiction as that exerted by the literary young Westerners in this country.	.
