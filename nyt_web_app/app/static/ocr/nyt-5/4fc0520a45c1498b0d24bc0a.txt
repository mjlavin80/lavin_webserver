A LABOR PROBLEM
Leroy Scott’s New Novel, “ The Walking Delegate,” Is Pull oi Power and Truth.*
T may be said with the courage of conviction that in his new novel, “ The Walking Delegate.” Mr. Leroy Scott has plcnted a literary standard in the field of American labor. Strictly speaking,
“ The Walking Delegate " is not a literary work, and, to judge by this example of his diction, Mr. Scott is not a stylist; but there is a stamp of truth upon this tale of labor union lire, and whether the' conditions are exaggerated—as to this who but the initiate may speak?—the apparent realism of the book is convincing to one who knows nothing of the inside of labor struggles. The story begins in a cheerlcss environment, a half-finished hotel structure—“ a steel framework rearing itself into the centre of the overhead grayness.’' Around this unromantic skeleton the author weaves the beginning of a story of the battle of labor and capital, a slill-•-_feusht struggle of two human hearts between the layers of social strata and an underworld grapple of uncouth cunning with unrnuth honesty.
“ Buck " Foley is the name given by the author to the powerful central figure, the walking delegate, who, though considerably developed in character, cunning, and physique, bears a haunting resemblance to a possible original whose ignominious death after imprisonment for extortion is still in the memory of the public. Foley is the tyrant of the Iron Workers* Union, the* man who grips the whole j labor situation in New York City. He is
*	;
a wonderful character, this “ Buck " Foley. His greatest weakness is the knowledge of his own strength. He is a wit, an orator, a diplomat, a hero, an arch villain; in fact, he is a great man perverted.
Tom Keating, on the other hand. Is a man of one keen, unswerving purpose, the purpose laid down by Stevenson—** to be honest; to be kind; to earn a little, and to spend a little less; to keep a few friends, and that without capitulation,
8 and, upon the same grim condition, lo keep friends with one’s self," Keating is foreman to a contractor named Driscoll, and throughout the turmoil the champion of union honesty and justice in the war with capital. The fight for the mastery between Keating and Foley brings to light the power of a “ grafting " delegate,
I the utter helplessness of capital when such a man orders a strike, and the ter**-rible domestic conditions which result from a cessation of labor at the word of this extortionist.
The moment Keating opposes Foley the former finds himself out of work and unable to procure any; not because his artisan ability is not appreciated by contractors. Even the’union friends of the foreman, while they hate the walking delegate, fear to aid Keating In his fight to have the walking delegate deposed as a I preliminary to an honest' union. There are wives and families to be considered, and the mere possibility of defeat means the mere possibility of expulsion and starvation. But Keating Is nominated for walking delegate. When election day arrives, thousands of men who dared not back the foreman openly take advantage
I of the secrecy of the ballot to drive out the incumbent. The latter's defeat seems certain, when a gang of Foley’s picked ruffians, facetiously known as “the Entertainment Committee," starts a riot, In the confusion of whlch_the ballot boxes are handled to the detriment of the honest candidate.
Still out of a job, with his trade taunting him more than ever, the honest foreman organizes a strike. " If we win the strike with Foley against it, that'll be the end of him/' says Keating to a friend. Foley opposes the strike, as was expected, his pockets already being well lined to stave off trouble. The men, led by Keating, clamor for better treatment. The walking delegate's position is in danger. The plucky foreman puts the strike motion to the union meeting. It is carried. Then " Buck " Foley gets up and coolly gathers up the enthusiasm to his own j glory In a speech on “ blood-suckln* j bosses/1 finishing his Inflammatory address with an amendment to strike for :
ilO per cent. Increase! By this sudden change of front, which Is mistaken by tho sheep of the union for diplomacy, the 1 walking delegate takes the wind out of Keating's sails and steals his thunder.
I But Keating wins when, after the strike has been in force for some time, the foreman discovers that the walking delegate has sold the strike to Baxter, PresI- j dent of the Iron Employers* Association ! for $53,000. The honest foreman plans a coup to be executed on the very night when the vote to return to work Is passed by the union. Keating has his evidence to hand, gathered by private detectives who watched the meeting of Foley and I Baxter and the subsequent lodging of the

“graft" in various banks. The climax is dramatic. The walking delegate con-eludes a heart-broken speech on the defeat df the union like this:
“ Boys, this is the hardest hour o’ my . life. I ain't very used to losln* fights.
! I think youse could count in a couple o’
, days all the fights l*ve lost for youse.
| [A cry: “Never a one. Buck.*’] An’ it comes mighty hard for me to begin to | lose now. If I was to do what I want to j do, I’d say, * Let’s never give in.' But I ! know what’s best for the union, boys, j an' so 1 lose my first fight."
! He rank back into his seat, and his head lell forward upon his breast.
.After this elever speech, Tom Keating’s cry of ** Buck Foley’s sold you out! ” comes as a thunderbolt upon a funeral service. A riot ensues, but the foreman's victory is complete. Foley is mobbed nearly to death, being rescued by detectives instructed by the District Attorney’s office to arrest the walking delegate on charges of extortion preferred by Baxter, who, learning of Keating’s discovery, Immediately took the action, in order to save himself and the side or capital trom suspicion of complicity and the well-merited shame of bribery.	*
There is the central action of the story, but the telling of the whole talc has brought to the pages of “The Walking Delegate ’’ pen pictures of men who are the bone, brain, sinew, and cunning of the great labor situation—Driscoll, the contractor, so aggressive that he grew mutton chops because somebody disliked them; Baxter, the President of the Employers' Association, with his steely principle that only snapped to gratify his wife’s ambition; Foley, who, covered with blood and rascal as he was, had still enough ot the admiration of the strong man for a stronger to hold out his hand to Keating In the moment of defeat and say: “ Luck to youse! ’’ And the women, the helpmates of those men, are portrayed with pathetic, or admirable, or repulsive realism. There is Mrs. Barry, who, seeing the anxious look on her husband's face at the word " strike,” says: “Go ahead. I’ll take in washln', John"; Mrs. Baxter, whose only concern in the strike is that she will have to cut down her Newport expenses; Anna Petersen, the ex-Salvation Army lassie, who_ suffered with her “ scab ** husband, an exprizefighter, who, driven out by the union, committed the besetting '* sin ” for the baby’s sake; Maggie Keating, the brainless, selfish wife of the plucky foreman. who crushed the traitor delegate and won the *' lost ” strike, and Ruth Arnold, the stenographer, who learned to love the man whose fight she witnessed from the vantage ground of the iron employer’s office.
The foreman, Maggie Keating, and Ruth Arnold supply a love story, the interest of which is compelling. Ruth !s a society girl who preferred to work rather than merely to live. Hers is the refining, Impelling influence upon Keating. She offers to do clerical work in tho fight; like a clever woman she lets him talk of his ambitions more than of h!s deeds; and she it is who first informs him that Foley has sold the strike. Ruth is expected to marry a junior partner of Baxter, whose niece she is. The love between the girl and Keating is mutual, but he has never told her that he is married, because, considering the social chasm between them, the disclosure has seemed to him unnecessary. The only approach to an outright love scene is where he says he is married. There is more pleasure for the aesthete in this passage than joy for the shop girl. In the moment of Keating’s triumph, when he is lylrg in the gaudy parlor of his home, battered and bruised, Ruth has occasion to enter with her employer, Driscoll. She leaves her gloves and later returns for them—.Mrs. Keating is out.

" Yes—and I hope you—’
** Good-bye.*'
“ good-bye."	'
Their eyes held steadfastly to each other for a moment; she seemed to waver, and she caught the back of a chairr-then she turned and went out.
For long he watched the door out of which she had gone;*then heedless of the pain, he rolled over and stared at one great poppy in the back of the couch.
There the story ends. But It would be interesting to know If the noble Keating passed unscathed through the vista of life behind that “ one great poppy,”
