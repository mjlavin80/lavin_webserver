A Vigorous Protest Against A'lere Cleverness in Literature—Truth and tfac Sneering Novelists and Essayists.
Acir YorkVimea Book Review:	*
an Americanized Europ^nn,
that is to say, a converted pessimist,'! view with horror every sign of healthy minded Americans acquiring a taste for European decadence.
There are several such signs In the recept number of Tub Book Review. There is a defense of Edith Wharton's "House of Mirth’*; there is an appreciation of James Huneker s latest book; there is “an inquiring, unprejudiced mind's ** keen enjoyment of Henry James. Also G. Bernard Shaw is too favorably noticed for my taste. Some of those mentioned are Americans born, but Europeans by tastes and associations.
It is very natural that an ** inquiring, unprejudiced mind ” should enjoy Henry James. I myself read him with avidity.
I did not lay down either volume of The Golden Bowl " until it was finished. His books are fine mental gymnastics, and after him other writers seem insipid. But his cleverness is an argument against him and not for him. His books are to me like absinthe.
It is only by such scintillating brilliancy that moral views are dazzled and distorted. The youth of Europe looks up to Georg Brandes as the towering authority on the world s literature. They call him “ the Taine of the North **—a questionable compliment in my opinion. But the JCorth, I am thankful to say. does not claim him, his real name being Maurice Cohen.
Glancing through his books casually, no longer enchained by the brilliancy of his style, one observes that all authors in whom is perceived a respect for the teachings of the Scriptures, Old or New Testament, he regularly denounces as weak, vapid, utterly worthless, while he defends all Immoral literature as manly— especially the shocking literature of the so-called Romantic School in France of the early half qf the nineteenth century. Still, he writes subsequent to 1870, when it was so clearly demonstrated what manliness that school had engendered in ihe French Nation: Here I happen on a quotation, in which he actually verifies my > assertion and summarizes this view of his, i referring to the period mentioned: ‘'The j charge of immorality is the invariable in- ! suit hurled by literary impotence [sic!] at everything in literature that is vigorous and virile,” It is manifest that the poor man is resolutely oblivious to the fact that there is an extremely vigorous and virile and clean American literature.
Max Nordau Is another of the prophets of misguided European youth, less dangerous than the former, perhaps, because more openly a renegade and scoffer.
It seems to me then that, as one who has gone through the fire, I have a right to cry " Halt! ” to those who seem to flutter like moths around the flame. When I see Georg Brandes referred to in
awestricken briefness as an unquestionable authority, and Max Nordau quoted in
all seriousness, when he himself never seems to half mean his audacities. I shudder for the poor public. And the persons first mentioned are but followers, pupils of the same school.
All this is meant, boldly, as an argument against the merely clever in literature. Aside from their moral worthlessness, I maintain that each of the authors mentioned is worthless as authority. Each one of them is unreliable, flighty. letting his own brilliancy run away with him, sacrificing veracity and even consistency to a pretty turn of phrase.
Those who speak of Henry James as a man with a mission, a high purpose, as a prophet and seer, I beg to refer to the last portrait published of him, and also to his own explanations of " The Golden Bowl," as quoted by M. H. In your last issue. “ It is only too deep and abysmal an artistic trap." *' It is a real feat of engineering.” A noble task, indeed, to set himself with such a subject.'
And to this everlasting cry of " Truth, Truth! ” I answer: By all means, let us have truth, but let the truth be taught In the home, in the schools and universities, from the pulpit and bench, by those who are selected for wisdom and seriousness: Never, never, by sneering novelists, who see only those truths which, by appearing In printL will cater to the evil found in all people and sell their books well. Truth? Is there, then, really nothing good and pure in this world, since all books which portray good people are decried by these truth seekers as hypocritical and untrue? If evil is to be treated by a novelist, then let it be by a man like Robert Grant, of trained and judicial mind, who scathes the wrongdoer In his books as he would scathe him from the bench. I could perhaps mention some other sincere novelists, on both sides of the Atlantic, who are capable of handling grave truths for the public good, particularly Feodor Dos-tojevski and Leo Tolstoy; but Russian truths are of no use for the American public.
