An account of the Swedish antarctic expedition in 1001 is being’ published by the Macmillan Company under the title, " Antarctica; or, Two Tears Amongst the Ice of the South Pole,” written bv Dr. N. Otto G. NordenskjSld, Dr. Job. Gunnar Andersson, and C. J. Skottsberg. They tell of the journey from Sweden to Antarctica, their first days in the south pole region, their work, their discoveries, adventures, life at the different stopping places, the animals, the scenery, &c. The book is copiously illustrated from photographs, drawings, and paintings by. different members of the expedition.
The Swedish expedition was fitted out by Dr. NordSDskjoId, apropos of the sug-; gestion at the International Geographical i Congress held in London in 1895. The ex-
1	pedition left Sweden in th'e Autumn of 1001 for the South Shetlands, and then Tvent to the east coast of that then unibiown and extensive land lying to the south of these islands, and penetrated further south. The expedition was divided into three parties, commanded respectively by Dr. Nordenstjold, Dr. Andersson, and Capt. Larsen. As the author writes in closing, it is an eventful story the book tells. Between the day of the departure of the expedition from Sweden In the Antarctic, which was destroyed, until the evening when they again trod on home earth, lay " two years of perpetual Winter spent in south polar regions.” He says:
The demand of science that no part of the globe shall remain untouched by the Nhand of investigation was the force that drew our little band to the land of the furthest south. The strife has been a severe one; more than once success has seemed to fly us, and wo have suffered losses that none of us- can ever forget. But in spite of everything we reached our goal; we have brought back the results of the first comprehensive researches within half a continent, and have made more unexpected discoveries than we could ever have dared to hope for.
