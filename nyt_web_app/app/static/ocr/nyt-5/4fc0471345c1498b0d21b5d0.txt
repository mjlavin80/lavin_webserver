When Rosa Thorpe wrote her famous verses entitled " Curfew Must Not Ring' To-night,’* Bhe had in mind the historic bells of Chertsey Parish tflxurch. An English newspaper informs us that these belle* have lately stopped r in gins, as the frame of the belfry has been pronounced unsafe and must be rebuilt. There are eight bells, of which two are at least 600 years old. One of these, called the Abbey bell, sounded the curfew in the old days when the sound of the curfew meant something. -	•
