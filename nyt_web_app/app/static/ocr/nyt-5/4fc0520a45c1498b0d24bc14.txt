** Mbst* boys;" says:- Mi*: Seton ' in- his: “ Foreword/' “ gather-in- thelvroods:pretty-and odd bits of1 moss; fUngus; and other treasures that have r;o price: TAiey bring thbm home and store them in'that Universal receptacle, the tackle box. Some’* boys; like myself, never o'jtgrow'Che-habit. One day' a! friend observed tiiat'my’ tackle box was full and' m j&ested that a' selection be given td the public. Most of
this"boTDty I gathered in the woods ooyself, * but an Indian gave me fragment:of’* The-Hecipe * and ‘ Gitch-e O-kok-o-hoo * and a Chinaman told me where to1 find ' The: Frog in the; Well.’ M There is a^llttle fable • called ** Tho Collector of Lies/' which tells how oat of all ■thb tattle and lies of the world history spHngs; there Is a terse comment on the stupidity of a land crab, which would' not deviate one hair’s: breadth' from its path; there is an allegory dealing with the trolley car and the steam engine; thsre'is :a warning against the foolishness of the antelope; there is a story of the sheep, whose master’s love was misunderstood; there Is a little poem te'fUng how the dogwood's spotless w?ilte was burned at the edges; there is a pretty Indian sons to the seasons; there are; Illustrated [imertcks: there 5s a story of the coriilngof the first . bluebird—In fact, this little volume 13 ! filled with pretty little suggestions which j children wW not only like, but which it 1	^ cmod for them thread.
It 13 a pity that Setcp. should have cB^en* to print, his book'in red Ink! The art^etio effect would scarcely- Tiave been marred and the reading would have' been undoubtedly Ampler and easier in clear black typa . ~ .
