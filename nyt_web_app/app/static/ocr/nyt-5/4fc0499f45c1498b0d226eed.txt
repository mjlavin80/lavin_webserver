Under this title Edwin S. Gorham la publishing an interpretation, by the Rev. Hamilton Schuyler of Princeton, N. J.t o* the life and labors of Churchill Satter’.ee, priest and missionary. The author writes in his opening chapter:
There are, broadly speaking, three types of men whose lives may be said to be worth recording. First, those whose superior mental endowments have won for them an unique place in the popular im-agnation; second, those who, while lacking this distinction, have played important parts upon a wide stage of humnn affairs; third, those who, -while neither eminent intellectually nor conspicuous because of their connection with crent events, have yet possessed personal!tier which have fascinated and inspired other? solely by their intrinsic beauty and worth.
. To this last class belongs the man with whom this book is concerned.	**
Satterlee was the only son of the first Bishop of Washington, Henry Tates Satterlee. He was born in New Hambu^e:, i on the east bank of the Hudson. He worked among the mountain folk of North I Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia, and, according to the present writer, his personality was felt everywhere—the illiterate folk regularly attended his services, listened to h]g advice, and did what they could to gain praise from him. Mr. Sfit-terlce died of heart disease, his deaLh having been hastened by an attack of the grip. The end came on the morning of Feb. 1C, 1003, in Augusta, Ga., where he and his family had gone for rest. The final chapter in the book contains letters
-	expressing opinions and impressions of Satterlee’s work and Influence.
