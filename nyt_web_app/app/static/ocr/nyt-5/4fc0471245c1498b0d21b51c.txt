The May magazines are pullulating with Schiller articles, including abstruse disquisitions, for the most part by Germans, concerning the purport of Schiller’s message to mankind. Tuesday, May 9, is the on&hundredth anniversary of his death. Schiller remains the favorite German poet, that one whom his countrymen love best, even though they may be prouder of the world-wide falme of Goethe. Doubtless Goethe is the German world-poet, that one whom his countrymen would choose to represent them in a competition embracing all countries and times. But doubtless also Schiller is the German German poet, all the more precious because his wovk will less well bear transportation, by which we do not mean, or do not alone mean, translation.. Carlyle, in the '* Life of Schiller," which began nis own literary career, likens the vogue of Schiller in Germany to that of Burns in Scotland. And everybody who has experienced a Bums dinner, or a Scotch public dinner of any kind, knows that Scotchmen rather resent the admiration of Bums by non-Scotchmen, assuring these latter that they cannot appreciate so Scottish a poet, and that they had better confine their admiration to Walter Scott.
It is not quite so with Schiller. With regard to language it is not at all so, for, though Schiller is said never to have got over his Swabian patois in speech, his writing is accepted as a model of unprovincial German, the more remarkable and admirable because he cannot be said to have had models in his turn. Klopstock and Lessing, who were his principal predecessors, by no means imposed the German language even on their own countrymen as a literary vehicle. The contempt which Frederick the Great, for example, had for his mother-tongue cannot be called an ignorant contempt. It would have been inexcusable, and even impossible, if Goethe and Schiller had been accessible to him as they were to the generation after him. It is hardly too much to say that these two created German as a literary language embodying a literature with which it not only behooved all Germans to be acquainted, but which also imposed itself as a " compulsory requirement ” upon all foreigners who aspired to be European scholars.
It is strange that a writer who never overcame his own provincialism should be the pioneer in the overthrow of German literary provincialism and in the creation of a literature that could be called national. This is the great achievement of the poet, dramatist, historian, and essayist, and lor this his countiymen do* well, to honor him*, as

they always delight to, do, not aloneaA home but Jn every land to which they are led or driven. Schiller's idealism was a most wholesome corrective for that quality and tendency which his great compeer described as '* what hampers us all, the vcommon," and what a later critic finds to be peculiarly a German defect. There is nothing “ common M about Schiller.
But it remains true that the great service which he rendered to his coun-' trymen was in helping to create a national literature, to foster the Bentl-ment of nationality. The Germany of petty principalities into which he was born was the Germany in which he died.' But his life and work are great factors in the evolution which has since taken place and which is still visibly in progress, the merging of all these principalities and provincialisms Into a great national entity. To the next step in that evolution, the step which has not yet been taken, to the growth of individual freedom along with national power up to the standard of the peoples politically the most advanced, he also pointed the way. But long before the political unity of Germany was definitely conceived or regarded by practical statesmen as other than a wild dream, Schiller was cultivating the sentiment which was to b«ar fruit after three-quarters of the century which has elapsed since his death. It is the greatest achievement which a popular writer can perform as the spokesman of his people. The, relation of Schiller to the unification of Germany recalls the eloquent words of Carlyle, spoken thirty years before the complete and final achievement ef a United Italy:
Yes, truly, it is a great thing for a Nation that it gets an articulate voice; that it produce a man who will speak forth melodiously what the heart of it means! Italy, for example, poor Italy, lies dismembered, scattered asunder, not appearing in any protocol or treaty as a unity at all; yet the noble Italy is actually one:	Italy produced its
Dante; Italy can speak! The Czar of all the Kussias, he is strong, with so many bayonets, Cossacks, and cannons; and docs a great feat in keeping such a. tract of earth politically together; but he cannot yet speak. Something, great in him, but it is a dumb greatness. He has had no voice of genius to be heard of all men and times. He must learn, to speak. He is a great dumb monster hitherto. His cannons and Cossacks will all have rusted into nonentity, while that Dante's voice is still audible. The nation that has a Dante is bound together as no dumb Russia can be.
