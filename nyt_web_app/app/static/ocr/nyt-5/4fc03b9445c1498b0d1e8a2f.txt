A Practical Book on Printing.
I’RINTtNCJ. A Practical Treatise on the Art of Typography as Applied More Far- ' tlcularly ' to the Printing of' Books. By Charles Thomas Jacobi. Illustrations. Cloth. 8vo. Pp. xxl!l.-409. New York: The Macmillan Company.
Mr. Charles T. Jacobi, managing Director of the Chiswick Press, and lately Examiner In Typography to the City and Guilds of Ixmdon Institute, has found time to prepare many books on the subject of printing:; and one of these, in a third revised ana enlarged edition, has recently been issued. It deals with printing, especially book printing, and is a wonderfully' compact manual, which might well be as useful here as In England.
The completeness ot the book will be apparent from a brief list of its chapters, which number thirty-five. They are in seven divisions, and deal with typefound-ingt composition, (thirteen chapters,) proofreading, handpress work, (six chap-ters.i illustrated and color work, motive power, machine printing, (six chapters,) and warehouse work (four chapters.) Two supplementary chapters give questions in typography set in the examinations at Mr, Jacobi's school, and others set to applicants for clerkships in His Majesty's Stationery Office. There is also a glossa-rlal index of terms used In printing, and a collection of samples of printing paper.
Just eighty years ago another master printer, John Johnson of London, issued “ Typographia; or, The Printer's Instructor.” It was in two volumes, dedicated to the members of the Roxburghe Club, and bound appropriately In Roxburghe style. The first volume related the history of printing—" The Origin, Rise, and Progress of the Typographic Art "—and gives full accounts of Caxton and Wynkyn de Worde, with lists of the IH books known to have been printed by the former and of the 410 printed by the latter. It gives also lists of Pynson’s publications and the names and works of the other early Eng* lish printers. Volume IX. describes the mechanical side of printing almost as fully as Mr. Jacobi does in his more recent book. In some respects “ J. Johnson, : Printer," is even fuller than his successor, for he gives King Solomon's original Hebrew alphabet, as well as that later invented by Esdras! He discusses other i alphabets, going back, as he says, “ to the antediluvian Hebrew " for the foundation cf his essay! Evidently Mr. John- , son was an antiquary. 3t is plain that ' '* Typographia ” inspired Mr. Jacobi; for lie follows Johnson's order of subjects, and, allowing for changed conditions, treats them In much the same manner.
