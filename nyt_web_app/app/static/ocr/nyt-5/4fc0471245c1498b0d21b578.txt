Funmaking of the most fantastic kind characterizes the six short stories in which Mr, Gilbert K. Chesterton details* the doings of “The Club of Queer Trades," , and, while developing some remarkably entertaining detective stories of his own, most ingeniously satirizes the methods bymeans of which such astute gentlemen us Sherlock Holmes and his kind have gained great popular esteem. In his more serfoua work- this writer has sometimes been rather sharply criticised for his tendency toward the fantastic* and one can readily understand that exactly the fancifulness of thought that make these stories such a delightful parody on the solemn hypotheses and deductions of the popular detective yarn would likely be irritating when applied to the really serious matters upon which Mr. Chesterton has bePB known to discourse. Here it serves the [ excellent purpose, in a parody, of tellingly : exaggerating all the salient points of the original.
There are two sleuths in Mr. Chester- ! ton's stories—one of the regulation Slier- I lock Holmes type, who sees tremendous mysteries in the most innocent-appearing trifles, and, with faultless logic, reasons to conclusions which invariably turn out to be—false; the other occupies most of his time in proving how unjustifiably sus-plcious .Detective No. 1 has been, and how easy it is to explain most things of man's invention, since the less is always included in the greater, and therefore truth will always be stranger than fiction.
Tn this case the source of all Mr. Chesterton’s humorous imaginings is a ** Club of Queer Trades,” which was made up exclusively of per30ns"who had invented some new and absolutely original method of earning their living and really earned their living by their trades. It was th^ difficulty of pursuing their odd vocations in a wholly unnoticeable manner that furnished such food for useless thought ori the part of Mr. Rupert Grant, .Esq.—a private detective of the conventional variety—and such apparent triumphs in sleuthing tor his very impractical and dreamy brother, who had resigned from the Judge's bench in a fit of disgust with what he termed “ the mountainous frivolity M of courts of law, and was, sub rosa, the President of " The Club ot Queer Trades.’’ Mr. Chesterton does not let the latter fact dawn on his readers, however, until the sixth page from the last in the book, thereby showing his own cleverness in the weaving of plots.
After the ffrst story, “ The Tremendous Adventures of Major Brown," one realizes the author’s satirical Intent and suspects vaguely that' none of the prospective hor-ro'rs are going to be real, but nevertheless. such is Mr. Chesterton’s ingenuity In construction that it is just as delicious a surprise when the innocent little vicar who told such a harrowing tale about being kidnapped by burglars turns out to belong to the trade of " Professional Detainers ” as it was when poor Major Brown's " tremendous adventures" proved to be entirely the work of an *' Adventure and Romance Agency," but arranged for another customer who pined for a more romantic form of existence than he could find for himself in prosaic London. And the same may be said of the breathless chase that resulted in the unmasking of the venerable criminal who " hired himself at din- ■ ner parties to lead up to other people’s repartees," and of the house agent, with so far one tenant, who made a specialty of “ Arboreal Villas," in plain terms, little houses, swung up in the tops of tall trees.	:
