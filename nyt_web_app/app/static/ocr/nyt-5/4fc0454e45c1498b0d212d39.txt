A>u> Tor/: Times Book Revieto:
In Mr. Allen’s letter on fiction of tho present day he seems to have waved aside the fact that the trend of modern reading Is necessarily Influenced by the life and needs of the present-day civilization. He seems to lose sight entirely ot the fact that the great mass of the reading- public reads to be amused, not in- 8 structed. They do not read for study, they have not the time for that, nor the inclination, and for that reason we hear of books which are merely light and amusing, without any pretense of style or fln^h, outselling everything else.
At first glance this is apt to Jar one with an appreciative taste for literature, yet, when we give thought to the subject, look at it in the broadest way pos! slble, you cannot fall to see that the public is not to be wholly blamed* They want to be amused, they want to laugh, seldom do they want to cry; they want to pass a few hours that will afterward give them a sense of self-satisfaction, an afterglow of pleasant thought.
There is no objection to this. Why should not the man, weary with the routine of office work, want to be amused in his few hours of leisure after dinner? So, for example, he picks up " Beverly of Graustark.” Why? Because he wants something pleasant, something that will hold the interest of a tired brain without any effort. He doesn’t want to think at all. He is not a student of literature, and he does not realize that when he closes the book he will have derived no lasting benefit from It whatsoever. But this he has gotten: a few minutes' relief from strenuous thinking, a faint remembrance afterward of pretty pictures and agreeable nothlngn«3s. It is an effortless impression, and eminently satisfactory. Of course you must remember that 1 am speaking of the mass of readers, the omnivorous readers. With this fact staring the novelists of our country in the face.
It is rather discouraging to those who are conscientiously trying to do good, lasting work. Yet, if they will meet this difficulty and grapple with it, they can bring something at least out of chaos.
There is one thing particularly that the good writers must soon become aware of, tho realization that the modern story | must be treated in a sufficiently light 1 way to be acceptable to the mass of read: ers. This statement proves itself in I every list of the best-selling books. Now, j if our good writers, those who know how to make their work beautiful, both in a I literary' and artistic way. will accept this evident fact, the effect will be that grad-j ually the reading public will be brought back to the paths of good literature.
! For instance, let Mr. Allen write a story about a young journalist who meets a Princess who is traveling Incognito.
Let the young man follow her to her cha.teau on the Loire-a.nd finally save her from some horrible plot and marry her in the end, of course. Cannot you at once get the effect of Mr. Allen’s beautiful descriptions of the chateau, his delicate drawing of the Princess, the poetic and varying shades of the passing scenes?
; Then any one reading these other royalty 1 stories would be able to see the difference at once, but until then their eyes are go-1 Ing to remain tightly closed. The cry of the world to-day is for color and picturesqueness. They must have It. and if it cannot be gotten in good literature, they will take in cheap stuff. People do not want to see a reflection of themselves— they want something prettier. Why not give it to them? And give it to them In such a manner that gradually they will come to the stage of opening their eyes and becoming discerning.
We cannot blame the publishers for getting up exquisite little books of tom-myrot. They are in demand. They sell. People will have them. So it Is up to the modern novelist, the sincere, serious, hard-working novelist, to do dainty, frothy, yet beneath all. literary work, and by meeting this demand stop the present tendency.
