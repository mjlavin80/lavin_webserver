Walter R. Marsh of the Pingry School. Elizabeth, N. J., has prepared an “ Elementary Algebra,” which is about to come from the press of Charles Scribner’s Sons In the Marsh and Ashton Mathematical Series. It is to be followed by a “ College Algebra," " Plane and Solid Geometry." “ Plane and Solid Analytic Geometry," &c.
As Mr. Marsh points out in his preface, the volume contains aN discussion ol the fundamental principles of algebra. The scheme of the text is to illustrate the meaning of a principle by carefully selected exercises, every principle being followed by a group oC examples. These examples have been prepared to illustrate various principles dealt with in the text. The subject-matter of the text follows the requirements of the College Entrance Examination Hoard. The subjects treated of include equations and problems, graphs, graphs of equations, progressions, permutations and combinations, quotients used in physics, &c.	.
