A. California Story.
THE VISION OF EI^UAH BERL. By Prank
Lewis Nason. 12 mo. Boston:	Little,
Brown & CTo.
This is a novel centring about the, orange groves of California. Elijah _Berl, a strange mixture of visionary and straitlaced New Englander, came to California -when the boom of its small towns was thundering over the country* He settled in an arid part of California and dreamed of the days when, through the means of irrigation and cultivation, he should have established the greatest orange groves in the world.
Mr. Nason has drawn the character of Elijah with excellent precision and clearness. A man of force and eloquence, of strong desires and unusual magnetism, he was nevertheless blinded in his judgments and weak to his own undoing. The love element of the story is brisk and holds the attention. One feels sorry for Elijah in the- mental poverty of his wife, but , even while pitying him a doubt creeps into the mind Tvhether, after
all, Amy was not to be pitied too. On Helen Lonsdale, the fine young business woman who comes under the magnetic charm of Elijah Berl, the author has lavished all the graces of mind and body, just as in Ralph Winston, Elijah’s partner, and Helen’s lover, he has put all the force and strength of manhood. Helen and Ralph seem a trifle exaggerated for real life—Elijah and Amy are truer to nature,
Elijah's innate avarice, his greed for gold and power, his weakness at the moment when he should have been strongest, his cowardice and fear of exposure and imprisonment, all these helped to crush him. Step by step we follow his mental and moral decline to the point when, goaded by jealousy, fear, and fury, he turned the full course of the pent-up water of the hills against Ralph’s newly constructed dam and then himself plunged
headlong down the cliffs.
