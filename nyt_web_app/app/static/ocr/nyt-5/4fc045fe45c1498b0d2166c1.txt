offhand:	Yet. if Mr. Mott had originally ■
looked up the plain reference contained in the passage In Lowell’s review of Carlyle’s ** History of Frederick II- of Prussia.” (which he misquoted to the extent of making- a negative an affirmative,) he would have found in' the first volume of Carlylels^work the following:
'* Antwerp, (‘ At-the-Wharf,’ On-t -' Wharf,’ so to speak,) against the French, which function soon fell obsolete.
I take It that here Mr. Mott and I, and probably Carlyle, were at fault, but not Lowell.	•
In regard to the Massachusetts gentlemen who were ** tailored impromptu from the tar pot by indignant neighbors, and sent forth to illustrate the ' feathered Mercury,’ as defined by Webster and. Worcester," I fail to understand how any one can doubt that this is a jocular comparison between the victims of the tarring and feathering process and the winged and therefore feathered messenger of the gods. The very first definition of the word “ feathered ” in Web-, ster reads:
" Clothed, covered, or fitted with (or as with) feathers or wings; as, a feathered animal; a feathered arrow.	,
*‘ ' Rise from the ground like feathered Mercury.’—Shakespeare.”
This, I submit, should amply justify Lowell to even th 2 most literal minded.
I am glad that Mr. Mott does not dispute the identity of Gano with Ganelon, the betrayer of Roland, but I must deplore his readiness to assume that Lowell used a possibly less familiar form of the name with the sinister purpose of mystifying his readers. My own judgment, too charitable it may be, Is that all three forms of the name, Ganelon, Gano, and Gon, were equally familiar to Low- 1 ell, and that with the natural preference I of a poet he employed the dissyllable that : preserved the cadence of his sentence.
As my original arguments in defense of literary allusions in general are not disputed, it would be superfluous for mtf to sav more on that subject.

Another word on the subject of Lowell's literary allusions. On one point Mr. Mott was right in his letter in The Book Review of May 6. The *' ludicrous eiv-moiogy af Antwerp '* intended by Lowell Is not that which I gave carelessly and
