THE TWENTIETH CENTURY CHILD.
By Edward IX_ Cooper. U!mo. New York:
Here is a book written In a pseudo-serious vein on the subject of children ana the rearing of them. Mr. Edward
H.	Cooper declares himself a bachelor, . but insists that as such he has every op- -portunity to observe the children of his friends and neighbors. Above all did he cultivate the acquaintance of the young people themselves.
The idea that women are infallible and * best left alone in their judgment of nursery affairs in mediaeval and oriental nonsense, and in these days when women assert (and very clearly prove) that they can do what used to be thought men’s i work men folk surely need have no hesi- • tation In making * * * a counterclaim.
' However, in spite of the Inefficiency off mothers, Mr. Cooper admits that a “ kindly disposed Providence usually arranges the rescue of the brood and gives them their chance.*'	•	^	•
One of the principal - conclusions at which he arrives is that parents, gener-; ally speaking, are unfit to rear their children. Being actively engaged with the many outside interests which occupy the modern woman's mind, the mother, Mr. Cooper considers, rinds it almost impossible to give her children the attention necessary. But he does not sit down to sadly deplore this state of things without suggesting a remedy. On the contrary he cheerfully offers a solution whereby both children and parents should profit. This is the employment of the •* deputy mothers^'—young women fitted for the position of taking full charge-of the children of a household, in whom full power of control Is vested, who exercise authority over governess, nurse, and dressmakers, who even have the power to refuse the requests of the ubiquitous aunt.
I know two such persons among the homes oC my clients, and their work is a brilliant success. The two mothers here are, in their children's eyes, clever and beautiful and favorite playmates, with whom they occasionally have tea and romp; the father provides pocket-money, takes the party to the pantomime, chooses schools for the boys, buys ponies and fishing rods for the holidays, and joins their sports whenever he has time. I cannot describe the cxact work of these ladies more simply than by saying that it is the doing of everything which I have described as being now left undone.
The book is full of humorous anecdotes along with criticisms of modern methods of education, remarks on the sports and recreation of children, the administration of punishment, Innate and cultivated characteristics, and several ■* true ” stories told by prominent young people' in English society.
