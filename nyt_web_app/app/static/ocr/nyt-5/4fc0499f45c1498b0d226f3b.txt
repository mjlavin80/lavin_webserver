Meanwhile, Mr. Bernard Shaw’s clever comic criticism of Shakespeare, (Mr. Shaw is at present the Marcelllne of. British letters,) and Mr. Arthur Walk-ley’s unfavorable comparisons of Shakespeare's plays with the conversational comedies of .the contemporary French stage, which deal exclusively with one; topic avoided in polite conversation elsewhere, serve, not to weaken the popular j fetich, but merely to arouse the Ire of a; few true Shakespeareans whose ire is' easily aroused. Mr. Sydney Lee has lately declared in public at a Shakespeare birthday dinner in England that ‘ Mr. Walkley prefers chocolate creams to venison, (forgetting for the moment that the association of venison with Shakespeare's name is bound to recall Sir Thomas Lucy's stolen deer.) and that Mr. Shaw Is best described in Bacon’s J phrase that " vainglorious men are the scorn of .wise, men, the admiration -of fools, the idols of parasites, and the ' slaves of their own vaunts.” Mr. Lee's ire will only amuse Mr. Shaw, however, and set him to jesting anew.
The plans for the proposed national memorial to the poet in London have not yet taken shape. There seems to be no room for doubt, however, that most of the influ-j ential persons Interested in the scheme L favor a worthy statue or a monument, conspicuously placed, containing a statue, k Such Is the idea of Mr. Richard Badger, the wealthy Englishman, who was the chief instigator of the movement, and who has beez* thus far the largest coo*

SHAKESPEARE'S FAME
An English critic of renown has felt it worth his while to- intimate that some of Mr. George Bernard Shaw’s recent remarks humorously condemning Shakespeare serve a good purpose. The English-speaking people, he thinks, make a fetich of Shakespeare's name. Half-educated folks have come to regard him as a divinity .who could do no wrong. This is probably true, but we doubt if the felicitous irony of Shaw will have any. effect whatever upon the minds of such persons. It would be well, of course, if the masses possessed a high order of lit- -erary judgment. A day may come, though It Is yet far off, when the multitude of men may be able to praise not only Shakespeare, but Milton and Goethe, Z)£tnte and Browning, with discrimination. Meanwhile, It seems to us that the Shakespeare fetich, as our English critic calls it, is a good thing. It is better for the multitude to think well of the greatest poet the world has ever known than to think ill of him; and every shrewd observer must know that, in the present state of artistic and literary culture, the multitude must do one or the other. In reckoning with the awakening mind of a people it is well to make allowances.
The general Ignorance of Shakespeare is a deplorable fact, as remarkable as the general reverence for his name. Only the other day a distinguished American ‘ educator was a witness In a suit at law, and the curious exigencies of the case required that he should submit to examination touching his knowledge of the tragedy of *' Romeo and Juliet.” The witness not. only failed to place lines quoted by counsel from the play, but he could not say who Tybalt was,* although he asserted that Juliet’s dangerous cousin was " not a prominent character.” He could not tell with which of the two warring houses of Verona .Benvolio was connected, and could not even remember the names of the houses. Perhaps he had even forgotten the dying Mercutio’s imprecation of a plague on both of them. As for Mercutio, the witness could not state his relationship to other personages ' in the play, nor could he tell in what part of Italy the scene of the play was laid. He had even forgotten the name of the
city.	'	-
Thus an educator, who had been advertised as a lecturer on this very tragedy, failed in an examination from which any member of a rural Shakespeare class should have , emerged triumphantly. But this does not prove that this gentleman might not utter many wise words on this
