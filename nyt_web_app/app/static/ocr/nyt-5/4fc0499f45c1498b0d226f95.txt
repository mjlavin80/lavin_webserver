Xew York Times Booh Repine:
■	I should like to know -what is the general opinion of Dr. Weir Mitchell's lato j novel, *'Constance Trescott-’' I feel curious to know whether my idea, of the .book j coincides with that of others. I have ; long1 admired Dr. Mitchell's work, and | consider his ** Hugh Wynne ” a clas-l sic. But “ Constance Trescott " appears to .me so very poor, so wooden in construction, so guiltless of even one natural, lifelike character, except possibly Susan, that it scarcely seems to. he truly a product of the same pen that wrote “ Hugh Wynne.”
It save me the same uncomfortable feeling that Walter Besant’s works used—by containing so much that was good and clever, one wondered why they were not better.	B.	M.	GARDNER.
