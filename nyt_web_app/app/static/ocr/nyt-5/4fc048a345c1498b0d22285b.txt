It Is to be regretted that the meandering, characteristic tracks of the unsifted amateur are to be traced through the pages of the latest edition to the Library of Art. Compared with its immediate predecessor—T. Sturge Moore’s “ Albrecht Diirer ”—the " Giotto ’’ of Basil de S£lin-court is distinctly Inferior* The biographical pa.rt shows, of course, more or ' less familiarity with Vasari’s L.ives,*’
, and with the monumental work of Crowe ! and Ca.valcaselle; hut the connoisseurship lacks a familiarity with the latest and most approved authorities, and the criti-! cism, where unconventional, Is impressive cnly as an expression of untried emotions.
Although Mr. de SfeUncourt is fond of citing from Giotto’s contemporaries in Italian literature, these citations are principally employed to emphasize some self-evident fact and contribute very little to a knowledge of Giotto, the man and painter, or to his position in art or to a comprehension of the vastness and importance of his school, which ushered in tho Renaissance. As a hand book to the
more familiar pictures it is n<> to be despised, and the illustrations with which the text is embellished are of the high character of half tone plates with which readers of former volumes are familiar.
