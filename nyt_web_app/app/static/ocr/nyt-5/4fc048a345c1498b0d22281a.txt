Tlita " JOm Uhl ” is a book of such rich,
beauty: in. their homely ways* a nobility I oddly shackled and blinded by two things, primitive brutality, and true German sen- j tlmentalism. . -	i
From childhood, it seems, these folk are dreamers, never reasonable persons. Indeed, they seem to remain children always. You have seen them—pretty much the same people—in Hans Andersen, who himself was a child always. They have deep thoughts, but they are not of this modern.world; they have an Jbsenisb lack of the commonsenslcal . willingness to . compromise, /and,' of course, they are ut- r *.erly unhumorous.	•
" JSrn Uhl ” was published in 1002, and the Germans seized upon it at once as an -expression of the realities of life in the back waters of the Fatherland. Now it is.... translated, and on the whole not ill trans* lated, jnto English. From it, as we have . been at pains to show, Americana may set a clue at_ least to the inwardness of North. Germans. . .
The story is of a great farm in the marsh lands and a great tarmhouse and . a, farmer's household. How the farmer was a drunken brute .and his elder sons as brutal and as drunken, how his wife ' was a patient, crushed drudge who died neglected in childbirth how tyis youngest son. (who was a thoughtful youth) grew up quite different from the others, how he played as. a child, how he toiled at the plow while the others caroused, how he plodded dully on his way to the light. As a child you watch his dealings with Httle girls and theirs with him, as a youth you see how passions took him and how women dealt with him. You follow him to barracks, whore he does military duty as all Gennans must, and you arc with him as he serves a gun against the French on the bloody field of Gravelotte. The simple truth Is laid on word by word like the details in a Dutch painting, till you have JiJm as he is—JOrn’s doings during all the time that his character was making, how he drove his plowmen hardly, how he courted his head maid servant (a pretty girl) and married her, how he struggled with debt, how when the first was dead he courted another wife, how he came at last to be a man of mark and a builder of canals and such matters. .
The women In the book are all child-women—strangely charming and pathetic even In their laughter and happiness, though both these are hearty enough. I JGrn’s girl sweetheart, the merry maid he g married, his lively love-hungry sister, (who went astray,) all of these are of the very clay of womanhood- As the story goes on its deliberate way innumerable little stories <many of them made like Hans Andersen's tales) are told by the way, and many odd and seemingly irrelevant episodes are Introduced. But in the end they all fit *nto the picture.
Indigenous growth that no man who is not a German, one may guess—^ven a Hol-steiner—can read it quite understanding^. Yet, oven an American may feel the thing In it which has so stirred the German public. These Frisians are strange folk, and .their ways are strange, but they are very human. The men are men. the women, Women; (he children, children—a strangely haunted lot, mingling sense and sentiment, sadness and gladness In a way not our way at all. And the country parson who has written about them has, It Is easy to feel, put the people and the lives they live quick Into his book. It is a fragment of Holstein tom out of the living body of the land for outlanders to see and wonder at* The outlander will probably thank God that he is not 3 Hol-steiner, but if he is human and fairly honest .he will not fail to see a sort of
