A Representative American’s Story of His Own Brilliant Career as President of a. University and Diplomatist.*

O	a person whose instinct leads him to-r ward the study of mere literature (however firm may be his conviction of its value as an Interpreter of human life) the act of perusing: such a document as Mr. White’s autobiography must bring a kind of humiliation, real, if momentary. Here, he . feels, is a man who from early youth refused to allow literary ambition to deter or defer the exercise of powers which have made themselves felt throughout the civilised world. As scholar, statesman, and man of affairs in aU the best senses of the term, Mr. White may well feel that he can afford to waive the title of literary artist.
As a boy and as an undergraduate he did, by his own confession, aspire to become a man of letters; to the paternal household had been attracted (a rare thing for the Central New York household of that day) not a few literary notabilities. “Scholars and ' , writers were held in special reverence there"; and the future diplomatist had ** some youthful successes as a writer of essays *' and as editor of an undergraduate “ magazine/' Several influences assisted—. fortunately, as we must think—in blighting this young bud of aspiration; the general tendency at Yale, as contrasted with Harvard, to make of literature “ a means to an end **; the influence of Theodore Parker, with his oft-expressed contempt for “ weak and literary people,*' and the yet stronger influence of Carlyle’s " preachments, hortatory and objurgatory, witty and querulous, that men should defer work in litera ture until they realty have some worthy message to deliver.’* Above all, there was a steadily growing sense of practical work to be done, and of his own fitness for such work. That fitness was ; quickly recognized from without, and thenceforward opportunities sought him; he has been in the thick of every great movement during the past half century. "Literature and other forms of art have continued to interest him chiefly, though by no means solely, as a means to an end, for their ethical and educational rather than aesthetic value. So also scholarship failed to interest him greatly for its own sake; he demanded that it make a man more efficient in the actual business of life; of himself, at least, he demanded this. Consequently his historical . researches, thoroughgoing as they have been, were inspired by a primary Interest in the present; and in ' teaching history his aim has been, he says, “ by means of the lessons of history to set young men at thinking upon the great political problems of our " time.”
In the autobiography of such a man we should expect to find no conscious literary, merit. Nor, it Is to be said, does it possess that intimate charm which has made a literary classic of more than one ingenuous personal narrative. The truth is, Dr. White could not imaginably ’ have been successful In practicing the art of literature, though he would have been a great journalist, His faculty is constructive, not creative; and Journalism would very likely have devel- . oped it as fully as educational work or diplomacy. Certainly he has done more in the world than can possibly be done, by a hundred such minor practitioners in art as he would have become. He has not told his story like a Franklin; perhaps because he seems to have shared none of the engaging frailties of the great Philadelphian. This fact has no doubt made it easier for him to give (primarily, as he says, for the benefit of his children and grandchildren) an entirely frank accdunt of his life. .
•	Dr. White evidently, belongs to that, as the unre-generate like to think, rarest of all types—the Indus- ' trious apprentice who really gets to amount to something. From the cradle he was one of those enviable human beings who, without any excess of horror for , delinquency In others', have themselves never found time to be delinquent. Such persons are commonly -regarded as promising only in the academic world:	:
as a rule they are observed to lead their classes and .; take .their Uttle prizes and to be heard of no more ita r the world of men. But It is clear that Dr. White was : never either prig or prize hunter. If boyish pranks did not tempt him, and he had no undergraduate wild oats to sow, it "was not because he belonged to the.'

feebly confonnliTg type of youth which . sits, agape In,.classrooms,, goes in for . ** marks,” and generally delights in
■	knuckling down. On the contrary, the young White early displayed a marked independence ot judgment. He seems to have had a snre instinct for discriminating between what was really profitable
■	and what was meretricious in the educational usage of the day. He refused to remain in the little sectarian college in Central New York to which his father had sent him, and, having turned his mind toward Yale, refused to be diverted by his father, for whom he had a rare esteem and reverence, toward a really good college of his own denomination, .-Trinity. Fairly -established in the Yale of 1850, one might imagine that this staid young provincial would have found himself in academic clover. No such thing; he was from the outset disgusted with " a system which made everything of ge-rund*grinding and nothing of literature.” Here was a system of divinity school tutors which reduced the method to absurdity. What that method was, it is
. easy enough to see now; the wonder is that its futility should have been understood better by certain undergraduates than by tbe academic authorities:
The first text book in Greek was Xenophon’s “ Memorabilia,” and one of the first men called up was my classmate Delano Goddard. He made an excellent
-	translation—clean, clear, in thoroughly good English; but he elicited no attention from the instructor, and was then
■	put through sundry grammatical puzzles, among which he floundered until stopped by the word “ sufficient.** Soon after another was called up, who rattled off glibly a translation without one particle of literary merit, and was then plied with the usual grammatical questions. Being asked to ** synopsize ” the Greek verb, he went through the various moods and tenses, in all sot^ts of ways and in all possible combinations, his tongue rattling like the clapper of a mill. When he sat down my next neighbor said to me, " That man will be our valedictorian." This disgusted me. If that was the style of classical scholarship at Yale, X knew there was nothing in it for me. It turned out as my friend said.
This acute undergraduate critic made a conventional success of his course, it is to be supposed, and went so far as to win more than one academic prize, but he evidently valued his successes rather as promise than as achievement. Physically he seems to have been one of those instances of delicate elasticity by which the world has profited so greatly. Occasionally there come men' tions of temporary collapse, but few robust men have accomplished half as much as this nominal valetudinarian. In a Eedentary age young White seems to have had the desire for a healthful out-of-doors life, though he may not have been able at all times to realize that desire.
I .cannot refrain from saying, with the pardonable pride of a college man who is able to connect himself, directly or indirectly, with some memorable incident in the annals of college athletics, ’* that our ciub [the rowing club of which hewas an active member] sent the Tirst challenge to row that ever passed between Yale and Harvard, even though I am obliged to confess that we were soundly beaten, but neither that defeat at Lake Quinsigamond nor the many absurdities which have grown out of such competitions since have prevented my remaining an apostle of college boating from that day to this The .most detestable product of college Ine is the sickly cynic, and a thorough course in boating, under a good stroke oar does as much as anything to make him impossible.
. For some time after his graduation it seemed that this brilliant and reliable young scholar was destined for that properly disdained career of acadcmic seclusion which has so effectively disposed of such a host of young men of promise. Fortunately the college appointment did not immediately follow the bachelors diploma. Three years of residence abroad Intervened—years spent at Oxford, at the Sorbonne, and as an at* tach£ of the American Legation at St. Petersburg, in Eerlin, and in Italy. H:s refusal of a snug berth at Ynle.* moreover, and acceptance of a professorship of history at the University of Michigan proved him as independent and far-sighi-ed as ever. There he learned ** the meaning of the proverb docendo disces. I found encrgetic Western men in my classes ready to discuss historical questions. and discovered that in order to keep up my part of tho discussions, as well as to fit myself for my classroom duties, I must work as I. had never worked before."	_
Meanwhile his interest in political questions of the day was steadily deepening. He returned to America at the height of the Buchanan-Fremont campaign* Buchanan he had met in London, and had greatly liked and respected. Politically, however, he represented to White ‘.'the encroachments and domination of American slavery, while Fremont represented resistance to such encroachments, and the perpetuity of freedom upon the American Continent.” Consequently," he voted for Frgmont, who was, according to his ultimate view, providentially defeated. Indeed. Dr. White goes so far as to say; " Looking back over the history of the United States, I see thus far no instant when everything we hold most dear was so much in peril as on that, election day." For the great struggle in which four years later the North with difficulty found means to engage, it was then quite unprepared. When the crisis came White was “rejected with scorn by the examln-
lng physician?.*' It is evldent,: however/ that if actual enlistment was impossible for. him, much real, service .remained for him to do in the way -of raising troops and providing equipments. Of his post-bellum career aa a State Senator and as a real though not conspicuous factor In National politics, it must be enough to say that it was always creditable; no cause of Importance arose into.which he failed to fling himself, for better or worse, with-all the seal and strength - he could command. His most distinguished service, however, was to.be performed aa an educator and as a diplomatist. ’................
The story of the founding of Cornell University is well worth telling. It is the story of a development from not over-friendly contact to most effective and sympathetic co-operation on the part of two strong and noble natures. White had almost as a boy conceived the idea of a university which should be free from the narrowness of policy and method which he had noted as prevalent in existing American institutions of higher education. They were originally thrown together by what seemed mere chance, and were for some time held together only as opponents. But as Mr. Cornell was disposed to apply part of his fortune to some public object, and Mr. White had such an object to propose, it.was not strange that they eventually came to terms. Of the founding and development of Cornell University the autobiographer naturally speaks with some fullness; he makes it evident that the end gained was quite as much due to the personal attention and service of Ezra Cornell as to his money.
But Dr. White’s diplomatic career will Interest most of us more than his educational achievement, important as that was. As attache at St. Petersburg during ' the Crimean war he assisted at one of those spectacular moments of Kuropean history of which as an American college student he could have formed a very vague imprecsion. Thereafter, as Commissioner to Santo Domingo and Paris, as Minister to Germany and to Russia, and finally as Ambassador to Germany, his-opportunities for observation of political society and for personal acquaintance with distinguished men were almost unparalleled in the annals of American diplomacy.	.	.	-
His recollections of Tolstoy, of William
II., and of Pobedonostzeff &re among the most interesting, but, indeed, there is little in these two volumes which can fail to interest the serious reader In'ojie way or another.	H.,W. BOYNTON.
