If there Is not a. sudden Increase In poultry raising:—or perhaps, rather, 'In attempts at poultry raising—it -will be remarkable in view of the publication of the ** Foultry Book.” . In. appearance it is a book “ that should be in every gentleman’s library," and for its contents, it is one that should be on every country gentleman's book shelf. Even the real farmer, who contents himself with a patent outside weekly and raises chickens by rule of thumb, might very profitably get a copy. The book committees of the country libraries are likely to find the'
“ Poultry Book " among1 the most popular sets on their shelves, if they summon up resolution and money enough to buy it.
Mr. Harrison Weir, the founder of cat clubs, the artist of animals, is " the true and onlie begetter " of the “ Poultry Book.” The American publishers acquired the rights to his book on poultry raising and have had it rewritten, therefore, by American experts to meet Ameri- H can needs, which take in both Canada and I Texas. The drawings, however, are by 1 Mr. Weir, and his material has been used I wherever it could be. The result of the | operation Is a very complete and exhaust- I Ive treatise on poultry of all kinds, which I is likely to be the standard work on the • subject for many years to come.
Very properly, the ** Poultry Book” begins at the beginning, with the egg, and thte Easter novelty It considers both from a commercial point of view and from that of the hen itself. It tells all about tho egg—and the fowl, too, for that matter— except how to cook it. Probably fhe publishers intend to issue a cook book to round out their series of manuals and desire to keep a public for that. Incubators and chicken rearing and chicken feeding naturally follow the discussion cf the egg. The chapter on feeding is very full; specimen diets are given, according to the market fowl that is wanted, and the different kinds of food are analyzed and compared at considerable length and very clearly. Besides this, directions arc given for the preparation of poultry for market; there is more than one way,
Mr. Weir has contributed various antiquarian information about poultry, and, because the volumes deal with fowl of all kinds, a chapter on gamecocks is Inserted, which it may be hoped will not be the cause of increased activity among the anti-cruelty societies.
The second and third volumes discuss the various breeds of poultry at length, Mr. Weir, who remembers the “ Cochin-China craze ” of nearly sixty years ago, contributing to the history of the various commercial breeds. After the chickens of all degrees, from the barnyard fowl to the exhibition cock, have been considered and commented upon, this •wide-reaching book studies bantams, geese, and ducks, and tells how to raise them successfully and how to market them. Pigeons and squabs receive attention, and tlie book ends with chapters descriptive of the less-known birds that can be classed as poultry—the swan, with a recipe in rhyme for roasting it; pheasants, the peacock, the guinea fowl, and the turkey.
To country people the book should prove most attractive and helpful; to the city man, who Knows more of " small birds ” than of poultry, there is a mine of quaint matter, probably contributed by Mr. Weir, that will entertain. Except for its index, which foolishly refers to pages only, and not to volumes, we can commend the “ Poultry Book ” thoroughly.
