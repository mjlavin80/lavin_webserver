The scheme of a new series of uniform bilingual dictionaries is explained by Robert Morris Pierce In a preface to the first volume of the series. This is called “ International French-Englisli and English-French Dictionary ” (New York: IJinds, Noble & Eldredge,) and is the work o£ Paul Passy, Professor of Phonetics in the University of Paris, and George Hempl, Professor of English Philology and General Linguistics in the University of Michigan. The most conspicuous feature of the work, which will doubtless be maintained throughout the series, Is the system of an international alphabet—made by inverted letters—by which the pronunciation of each word is designated. This alphabet is the result of long and careful experiments In phonetics, and when once the student has acquired the vocal values of each letter, said student will undoubtedly bd able to pronounce in the most approved fashion every word contained in the bilingual series.
Concerning the dictionary before us it may be stated that the typography is especially inviting, and the punctuation is reduced to bare necessities. The vocabularies are made up of words of the most common usage; the American spelling is preserved throughout the English vocabulary and American pronunciation, where it is found to conflict with that acceptable in Great Britain* The definitions are, in general, confined to equivalents of the title word except where it is absolutely necessary to define that word by a phrape, as in the case of idioms.
This dictionary is, in fact, a carefully compiled vocabulary of English and French words and their synonyms. It is, as the compiler points out in his preface, primarily for the use of English speaking people. " I have," he adds, " purposely avoided the attempt, so commonly made, to make a book equally well fitted to either of two or more nationalities, and trust that I have thus avoided the common result: a book imperfectly fitted to anv nationality.”
