New 1'crfc Timvi Book Review:	.
: In his eagerness to defend Georg- Bran-des your correspondent “ R.,” fcn last Saturday's Bcok Review^ seems to over-‘look the fact that he is riding instead of. refuting isy argument. K»r instance, I mentioned only two of the leading insid-tolis influences in European literature; he mentions in his two first paragraphs , about a dozen.
But far be it from me to have intended an attack on the Jewish race. I maintain th-at Morlts' Cohen (or; Mauricer by his-swn preference, I presume, from his-' slavish adoration of every thing French) is* BrandesV real name, being informed by a Jew that cnly tv.ch na-tne is recognized according to their customs or religion. ^ What I had in my mind, but tried to sup-
■	press as far as .possible in ny: enpres-jions, was my dread of the renegade in^
I, fluence, and 1 ray disapproval of’ the con-coaling of race, my oily complaint1 against the Jewish race bsing that it; furnishes such an' abundance of brains, which, chiefly by reason ; of renegadisin,’ the abandoning of their cwn religion*, without' adopting' ajay other, is led* Into-wrong1 channels, becoming- a very danger- J, ous and undermining Influence.	.	11
Taking up the second point in “R/s” defense, I confess that I may 'have made my statement too sweeping In saying" that Brandes denounces " all " moral au- . triors, &c. But, just Branded and1 Nordau attack each other, (I am well aware of Brandes’s attacks on-Nordau,;
; though I have Iongslrwe ceased to read" .Nprdaifs books,) here' ara" i' at lacking' Brail des' befng- all the time' vfefy conscious' of having7 myself h5s 'velry^fault,-of:mali£
