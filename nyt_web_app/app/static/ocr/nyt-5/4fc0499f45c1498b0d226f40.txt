Even admitting that most sea yams of the old-time variety, to which " The Black , Barque/' by T* Jenkins Hains, belongs, bear a confusing similarity to one another, the incidents in this one seem so particularly familiar that we are quite convinced that this is not their first appearance on the deck of the Gentle Hand, but only a reincarnation, as it were, under a fresh title. Many things may be forgotten, but 1 scarcely anything so attractively fantastic as Mr. Hains’s whim of naming—or luck in discovering—the slave ship whose last voyage lo Africa is here chronicled, and then making her the scene of most of the blood-curdling events that took < place on ali the pirate ships that ever sailed the five oceans.
The chief impression left by this story of *' The Black Barque *’ is that there is enough material In it to have been ex- ; panded into several books exciting enough for all practical purposes. It begins with the shanghaing of the hero at Havre, and progresses through innumerable horrors to the going down of the barque with the grimly facetious name, bow first, on the homeward voyage. The ingenuousness of the nominal narrator, who shipped as first officer at a salary of £30 a month, and awoke one day out from port to find himself a plain gunner with a good prospect of getting no salary whatever, is as funny as the name of bis ship. He constantly refers to his own gentleness and refinement as compared with his roaring mates, but one looks in vain for evidence of either in his deeds. With the exception cf a fellow with hands developed to preternatural proportions by having, according to his own boast, " strangled more men than there is on this ship/’ Mr. John Heywood, gunner, did more personal damage to neighboring flesh and bone than any one else on the Gentle Hand, and one doesn’t much blame the aged but revengeful steward, Watkins, for nearly biting his ear off one day when he was In irons and could not defend himself. Watkins got even with him in several primitive but effective ways before the day when a cannon ball ripped up the deck and drove a long pine splinter through hi1? own body with fatal results.
Of course there was on board the Gentle Hand a brave and beautiful girl, who defied bands of armed men without the quiver of an eyelid, and who was pursued by the attentions of various villainous passengers with absolutely no return emotions except scorn and raillery. When the inevitable mutiny occurred, however, and the Gentle Hand was set afire, the time seemed to have come for Mr. Heywood to win her eternal gratitude as well as her affections by deeds of daring In her behalf, but Mr. Hains did not choose to have things end In that conventional manner. Mr. Heywood didn’t save Miss Allen's lifei nor did he quit the sinking ship as such a hero should, but some months later, when he was commander of a coaster running general cargo to Havana, he received a mysterious letter from New York, which he Is recorded as having; read many times, with the result of deciding to call on the writer at the end of tho return voyage. Mr. Hains doesn’t say so, but imagination suggests that it was an encouraging word from the hitherto scornful Miss Allen.
In Spite of its exaggerations, lt ^ pr0b-
able that one does not get from this story a very erroneous idea of-slave ships, as they were in 1815. Anyway, one quite agrees with his final words concerning the men who ran just such enterprises. •‘They were good. They were bad. They were a mixture of the tw^o. But they wei^e all human. And who shall say where they have gone?*'	.	.
