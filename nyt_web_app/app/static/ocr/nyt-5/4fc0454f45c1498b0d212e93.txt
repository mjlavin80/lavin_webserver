Major J. H. V. Crowe, R. A., P. S. C-, Chief Instructor, British Royal Academy, , has translated from the German, " Problems in Manoeuvre Tactics, with Solutions for Officers of All Arms,” by Major Hoppenstedt of the "War School at Potsdam and a well-known military writer in Germany. An idea of the scope of the book is given in the original German preface:
This book is designed to assist officers in self-instruction in manoeuvre tactics and in preparing for examinations, to provide suggestions in the drawing up of j schemes for manoeuvres, field days, staff rides, and war games, and to familiarize officers with the action of the three arms when working in co-operation. The problems deal with detachments, collisions, and advance guard actions of both large and small forces, reconnoissance and the special duties of cavalry and artillery in connection therewith. A certain number of problems which have been set at staff college examinations are included. * * * The solutions are apart from the problems. as the reader is intended to work them out for himself. * * * Conciseness has been aimed at and theoretical discussions avoided.
, The book is not an Bnglish fac simile of the German; Major Crowe has adapted the problems in manoeuvre tactics to the British organization. The country in which the operations take place is in the neighborhood of Metz. Four maps have been made for the volume, three of which have been placed in a pocket at the end. The Macmillan Company publishes the book.
