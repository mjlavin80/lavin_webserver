The central Idea from which Mr. London argues the end of the capitalistic or “ bourgeois *' reign is that the time is at hand when predatory capital wandering the world over seeking where it may establish itself ” will have no more continents or provinces to conquer—save they be conquered from capital already in possession. When " the maximum of commercial development ” is attained, then one of two things must happen. Either it will be a benevolent capitalistic despotism—capital warring no more with Itself but regulating production to demand, putting the surplus which can no longer find investment in public works, art, literature. panem et circenses—or it will be Socialism. “ Either the functions of private corporations will increase till they absorb the central government, or the functions of government will increase till it absorbs the corporations.”
Mr. London admits that for practical purposes ihe two things are not so different. He inclines, of course, to the opinion that Socialism (as the nobler ideal) will be the actual solution. For the other thing seems to him to imply nothing less than a sort of comfortable slavery for the masses.
No doubt the most interesting of the papers which make up the volume is that on the “scab.” “A scab," says London, is one who gives more value for the same price than another "—and he demonstrates from that definition that nearly everybody Is at times a scab—not without reluctance, since the aim of all men (In an economic world) is to give less for more if possible. Mr. London shows how, for instance, any extra efficient workman is "scabbing" on his fellows, and how America as an industrial nation is a 14 colossal scab.'* “ The result, ’ says he, “ or the American scab's nefarious actions ' (which consist m- extraordinary efficiency)
will be to strike at the food and shelter of Europe.” Therefore, already, alarmed Europe is forming a union against him.
If a scab Is merely one who is disloyal to his class, the American workman as a body Is still scabbing on the European workman. If he gets. say. twice the wages, he does four times the value of work. His is really the " cheap " labor.
Mr. London has a chapter on the tramp almost equally interesting. In the present state of society capital needs, he says, a body of unemployed men, or only partly employed men, as an emergency force. Without this surplus of labor a sudden need of men anywhere—in a new enterprise or to break a strike—would be fatal to the system. It could only be met by taking men away from other necessary work. Naturally this emergency force (not being kept on a continuous salary) Is made up of the less efficient. As for the tramp, he is a “ by product,** one who . might be one of these emergency men, (being unfit for a permanent job,) but prefers to drop out—to die to the economic world. He is a ‘'perambulating carcass."
I He recognizes that there is no work for him save as a stop gap. He refuses to be a stop gap. If he did work, moreover,
1 (the amount of work being strictly limited.) somebody else would have to be a tramp. Wherefore, says Mr. London, do not, for heaven’s sake, bid a tramp go to work.”
