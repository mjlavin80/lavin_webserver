To read a revolutionary, tale of \ South America that Is not farcical or quixotic, is indeed"refreshing. Schuyler Staunton -is an . author to. whom the reader should feel indebted for an, earnest tale of the revolt which overthrew the monarchy of Dom Pedro in Brazil and the exciting happenings prior to the republic’s declaration of Its freedom.	:
■	It is a perfectly simple story, as. one perceives, when the last chapter is reachcd, but as the narrative is in the first person the reader, is as much mystified over the strange happenings as the hero who finds himself plunged into a whirlpool of plot, and counterplot the moment he lands at Rio. He is Robert Harcliffe, . who . has been appointed private secretary to Dom Miguel, the leader of the revolutionists. Naturally when it becomes known through the sccret service bureau of the Emperor that a secretary is coming Harcliffe's reception at Rio is something for him to remember if he survives. His journey from the coast to Miguel's residence in the country, is one wild series of adventure. He is arrested and freed by a Sergeant of police, who, secretly a revolutionist, stabs liis brother officer in order to allow Harcliffe to escape, but with the murder at his door. The conductor of a train is instructed by the Emperor’s agents to arrest the American private secretary. The conductor, like a good revolutionist and a faithful servant* of the Emperor, comes excitedly to Harcliffe and shows him the telegram and shouts: " I don't think he’s on this train. Dc^you? "
*' Of course not," says Harcliffe.
When the secretary finally reaches Miguel’s residenrr he meets among others a ward of the • ,.der, .Lesba Paola, with whom he immediately falls in love. Lesha, however, is a puzzle to him because she smothers all her womanhood in- zeal for the cause for which she -Is an indefatigable worker. Her brother, too, the Minister of Police,, seems to Harcliffe an insipid ass, and the American marvels why the other revolutionists hang on his'lightest words.	.	.
Then follows much intrigue and adventure, which culminates in the overthrow of the Government by a clever coup of the simpering Minister of Police, who has worn his insipid smile as a mask to his Intelligence and earnestness. The heart interest of the story 1b quaint, for while.it is apparent at times to Harcliffe that the beautiful Lesha is in love with him, at other moments he Is convinced that not only does she love another, but is a traitor to ^he cause through her intimacy with Valcour, of the Emperor's side. This Valcour turns out to be a woman spy, professionally the enemy of the Minister of Police, but otherwise his heart’s admirable love. It was the tic of womanhood that Lesba and Valcour shared, and at last Harcliffe is made happy.
The character drawing of the book is splendid, and when one has passed through scenes of the most unaccountable nature it is marvelous how natural the whole story becomes when the sex of Vnl-cour is revealed, the apparent treachery of every person explained to the American, and love and duty no longer fear the dividing line of politics.
