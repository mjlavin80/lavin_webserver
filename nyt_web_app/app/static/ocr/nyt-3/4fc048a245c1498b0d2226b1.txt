Half a century of service in the English I Navy is a	long	record, hut Sir E, R.	8
Premantle,	Rear	Admiral of the United	I
Kingdom,	may	justly claim that dis-	I
tinction, for he entered the Navy in -1849, and remained on active duty until June, 1901, when he was placed on the retired list. Born in 183G, in Surrey, the author came from a naval family, and also was an intimate friend of Nelson’s,
In 1849 a commission came. Sir E. R-Fromantle	tells	amusingly of the examination	he passed, which was the
merest formality. The young aspirant was given a cadetship, and was sent to the Queen, a three-decker of 116 guns.
The destination of the ship was the Mediterranean. In due time Malta, was reachecL There was cruising In the waters of Salamis Bay and the Piraeus. The question of water for the men was always an absorbing matter. There was no distillation in those times. The consumption of water being five tons per diem, and the tanks of the ships only holding 500 tons, water was often restricted, and its use for washing strictly limited. By degrees the lad learnt his various duties.
The midshipman’s next cruise was on the Spartan, a small frigate of 018 tons.
Her destination was the East Indies and China. On board of the Spartan some five and a half years were passed. The Rear Admiral writes;
One rather curious circumstance I may here point out that in the days of dependence on sails it was quite understood that sails were a danger as well as a motive power. On the Spartan when carrying a press of sail the commander used to have a hand ” with a hatchet stationed at the main sheet ready to cut at a moment's notice, and thus relieve the ship without watting for the rope to be let go. It was this instant action which seamen had at times to take in those days which did so much toward developing a quickness of decision which we , hope our modern fast destroyers will make equally necessary for the advantage of the service.
The duty of th<» Spartan was to suppress piracy, and many are the novel scenes described. The Crimean war having brolpe out. there was an expedition fitted out, which sailed to the North Pacific. The expedition proved a failure. R I In 1S58 the young officer received the . rating of Flag Lieutenant on the Renown,
| and sailed for the Cape of Good Hope. Trouble in New Zealand gave the opportunity of seeing what were the fighting qualities of the Maoris. When in 1870 | the Captain was lost, the author had ; made a particular study of carrying sail j on low freeboard ships, and he wrote an article for Fraser's Magazine, Froude be-i ing the editor. At that time the author was on half pay, and he writes that he made it a rule never to write for the presg when he was on active service.
; When the Ashanti war broke out he took an active part in the fighting and was
'
badly wounded.
| In 1SS5 arose the question of the effi-, ciency of the torpedo boat. The idea la, ken from the French was that everything depended in naval warfare on the torpedo boat, and that there was no longer any | necessity for large ironclads. It was the ; microbe which was to lay low the mastodon. One article of the Admiral’s which appeared in The Nineteenth Century at that time attracted much atten-, tion, and he writes: “ I admitted that the | new departure would necessarily modify tactics, but I deprecated the scare as to our menaced fleet, and expressed the opinion that we should continue to bufld even larger ironclads." Subsequently the Admiral visited the Russian ports of Vladivostok and Port Arthur, which he describes. He was not favorably impressed with the Russian fleet, and was struck with their lack of confidence. At the
conclusion of this singularly useful volume the Admiral fully appreciates the wonderful changes due to mechanical science and advises that officers and men	I
*• should be taught to grease and gauge	I
with the engineers,” for, as Mahan puts	(
it, The artist is greater than his mate-	|
rials, the yvarrior than his weapons.”	j
