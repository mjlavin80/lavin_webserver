Rabelais, Philippe de Comines. Philemon Holland, Montaigne. Drummond, Robert Burton, and Jacques Casanova form the subjects of the “ Literary Portraits 11 in the volume with that title, by Charles Whibley, which E. P. Dutton & Co. are shortly to publish. Mr. Whibley, in the course of his chapter on Rabelais, speaks of his relations with Erasmus and writes about the differences between the two men. He says of Rabelais:
Rabelais *	*	* preferred joyousness
before refinement. He, too, loved wine, but he held an ovemice taste in liquor for a sign of age. Again, laughter was as urgent a necessity for him as combat, and if his blows were less deft, they were always heavier than the blows of Erasmus. Yet for scholarship and grandeur of intelligence Erasmus and Rabelai^ are the twin forces of the intellectual Renaissance. * * *
The author sums up Philippe de Comines as follows:
A statesman and man of letters, he was yet so little of an egoist that he left no record of his person and disposition.
•	* * Surely his modesty is unparalleled; a man of action, who had a perfect command of his pen, he was yet artist enough to understand that the central figure of his history was not himself, but his King.
*	* * He had a perfect command of Italian, German, and Spanish, while he never betrayed his Flemish origin by a faulty pronunciation of French. * * * Above all he abhorred idleness; * * * but he was neither bookworm nor pedant.
Philemon Holland, the “ translator generate of his age," is thus portrayed:
*	* * \ye know him to have ambled through life. Always a recluse, shut up with his pens, which became fabulous, and his books, which were all of serious import, he went seldom abroad; and, though his reception of James I. was a public triumph, his attempt to govern the j Free School was * * * a dismal failure. In brief, he had no talent for affairs; his 1 were the quieter virtues of kindliness and scholarship.
Montaigne’s throne was his library, and from here he surveyed his household, Mr. Whibley writes in his " Portrait '* of the Frenchman, which is followed by descriptions of Drummond's library. Burton and his “ Anatomy of Melancholy,” and the adventurer Gasanova.
