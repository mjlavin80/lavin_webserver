" Judith Triumphant" is another arrangement of the story of Judith and
Holofernes, and this time it is not a play but a novel. The author is Thompson Buchanan, whose *‘ Castle Comedy his first book—appeared before the Christmas holidays from the Harper presses. The Herpers are publishing *' Judith Triumphant ” also, and announce the book i for some date early in April. It is said ■ that Mr. Buchanan has availed himself 1 courageously of the color and passion and action which his theme provides, especial- , ]y in the scenes which take place in--the j camp of the doomed Holofernes. There i love and patriotism, womanly tenderness j and hi&h devotion contend and tragedy j stalks over the necks of her victims.	!
