THE MEXICAiN WAR.
Cyrus Townsend Brady’s Book About Texas and the South west.
BE Conquest of	tho South-
west ’’ is the rather hiffh-sounding and	picturesque
title which Dr. Brady gives to that chapter in American history of border settlement, diplomacy, intrigue, and war which began with the first settlement of Americans in Texas and ended with the treaty of Guadelojpe-Hidalgo in 18-ts. The book is written in an easy, pleasant, and decidedly popular style, and is abundantly provided with thrilling illustrations, such as	the	"	Death Struggle In the	Alamo." the
“ Storming of Chapultepec."	&<■. U is.
indeed, h popular account of the Mexican war and events leading up to it. rather than whm (he author insults on calling il —a monograph.
The tirst part is on Texas and its hide* pendence. and in better than the second on the Mexican war because Dr. Brady's vision in viewing the Mexican war is at times astigmatic. The history of Texas prior to its annexation by the United i States in	though not generally much ;
written about, is really intensely frrfnrest-ing and full of dramatic incident ft is instructive. too. as the record of an experiment in self-government by Americans uniier conditions which are unique.
The United States save up to Spain any claims it might have had in Texas by the Adams-Ouis treaty of 1HIU, which was finally ratified in 18LM. The vast territory of Texas was at this time practically mi-inhabit d by whites. Its real history may be said to have begun when Austin h‘(l his first colonists there at the end of 1SJ1. under a charter from the Spanish Government. Allt-r Mexico revolted from the mother country in IK2l’ the Mexican Goc-ernnn'nt confirmed this charter, (’barters were granted to other Americans, and the work of colonization went on. Most of the settlers were slaveholders from the Southern States. Then* was bound n> t>e
and there whs constant friction between the Americans in Texas and the Mexican authorities. It was Santa Ana's determination to destroy the 1’ederal system in Mexico and hold the States as mere dependencies that finally caused the Texan revolt. Texas declared her independence in March, is.ii;. ;md soon adopted a Constitution. modeled after that of the Cnited States. Th*'n rame the defense of the Alamo, whu h Dr. Brady calls the most heroic exploit in American history, a ml the brutal massacre of the Texans at Goliad, whh h did as much as anything could to j<ut the Mexicans outside the pale of civilized warfare. I*'inaK> Houston's brilliant strategy with some T.'Ji men at the baUle of San Jacinto assured Texas her independence, which she maintained till 1^4-1	'1 h“ 1 niled Slates. Kngland.
and France recognized it. Texan independence being established, annexation by ihe Cnited States wus bound sooner or l.iier to t.ik«‘ 1*1 a ce. liuth countries desired it. Mexico had no right to consider annexation a sufficient cause for war with t he I 'niied States.
I>r. Bradys sub-title^ The Story (»f a Great Spoliation," is not meant to apply to ,*ur am e\ itton of Texas, although tho mami’r in vhich that step was accomplished is by no means aboce suspicion. He spenlis oi notorious breaches of inter-nalional tor.iity ard flagrant violations of international law of which the United States was guilty before annexation was finally brouyid ;<bout. He mentions Commodore Jotu^'.s unauthorized seizure of Monl'*tey, nMTward disavowed by th<-Cnited Stu'e-:, hut he does not allude to ihe itrpL lepi intrigues of 1'rfmont in California. which hi\c heen brought nut very strikingly in thf* volume on t’alifor-nia tu the American < 'ommonv. eait h series. (. ndotibtediy Mexico had grievances.
The war with Mexico Dr. Brady regards as unrighteous and wasteful unrighteous because u was made the pretext lor unjust seizure of territory:	wasteful be-
cause ihe territory ini^hl have he.-a more
cheaply acquired by i>r«;v*‘iul purchase From the ethr*i.l standpoint the motives of the Ameiican Government we",, certainly not high; nuvher the sla\e power of th. South n,<r the manifest-d**siiny "
power oi the West, both of \\iii<h were interested in the spoliation of Mexico, was overnie" as to the means cmnfoyetf. It has nev* r been the custom of American Administrations to he scrupulous in their treatment of ripa n ish - A mer ican countries, at least nut too scrupulous.
When L)r. Brady comes to the teinnical question of who brought on the war we believe he wrong. Texas came (ntn (he I nited States with the Rio Grande ;1S tier southwestern boundary, aiul this was accepted by iii 1 Crated States. Mexico, however, denied that Texas extended beyond the N’euees Uiver The Cnited Stales Cougres.- had made Corpus Christi. south of the Neijces, a port of delivery, and lllc revenue laws of the Cnited Slates were extended over the region between the two rivers It was the duty of the Tre.--
J
ident to maintain the boundary with which Texas had come into the Union, and he ordered Gen. Taylor to advance to the Rio OraTTtJe, after the Mexicans had massed troops on the other side of the river. Dr. Brady, following the extreme opponents of the Polk Administration, makes out of this a wanton invasion of Mexican soil by United States j troops. It was not, and the blame for the ! beginning of actual hostilities should not rest with the Mexicans for crossing the Rio Grjtnde and attacking Gen. Taylor. We are not prepared to say, however, that the Cnfted States would not liave fought the war had not Mexico begun hostilities.
In Chapter XIV. Dr. Brady gives some rather interesting iijjures showing how 1 much tiie war cost, and how much betU r it would have been to have avoided it and resorted to purchase. Such speculations unfortunately leave out of consideration Mexico's attitude at the time— that the annexation of Texas meant war. Had Mexico not taken this foolish stand we should possibly have acquired California and New Mexico by the means of which Dr. Brady would approve.
