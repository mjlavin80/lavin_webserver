We are sorry to learn that the long controversy carried on in the English Notes and Queries in regard to the use of the split infinitive has closed with but
a piffling result. The split infinitive, we regret to ' aay, still remains " in our mi{fst.” The sum of human judgment in regard to its employment, so far as Notes and Queries has been enabled to encompass that judgment. Is that the use of the split infinitive is a matter of taste. It has been employed by many
famous writers, *• from Wydif to W. H. Mallock."

Well. Another attack must surely be made before long on the split infinitive. '
