PENELOPE'S HUSBAND
LADY PENELOPE. By Morley Roberta, Author of ■* Rachel Marr," “ The Promotion of the Admiral." &c. Illustrated by Arthur 'WilllarD Brown. 12mo. Pp. S62, Boston:' L. C. Page & Co. $1.50.
Mr. Morley Roberts, whose last novel . ran to such serious aspects and sucb limited horizons, has executed an amazing feat of agility. The utter womanhood and simplicity of his country-bred Rachel Marr was cruelly abused by the immemorial idols and superstitions of men; the womanhood and simplicity of his Lady Penelope rides serenely over all such puny obstacles. Yet it is essentially the same quality which makes both women what they are. What in a narrow provincial atmosphere produces a tragedy makes in the great world a farce comedy of the gayest. In each case Mr. Roberts has been a bold , man of his pen, and he has said (and allowed to happen) shocking things; but the effect is widely different.
The Lady Penelope Brading, whose father was an English Earl and her mother an American lady of vast wealth, with a passion for collecting old country houses— especially such as still had moats about them—was early left an orphan and assigned to the quaint guardianship*bf my Lord Bradstock, a nobleman of a liberal and humorous turn, though not often heard in the Upper House. Lord Brad-stock let his ward grow up " naturally," Which means not that he neglected her education, but that he did not thwart her impulses. At twenty-one, therefore, tire young woman, who was ambrosially healthy and handsome and wise and dis-tractingly rich, (as her mother's residuary legatee.) was altogether beautifully serious. " She had no sense of humor whatsoever." In short, she was a pcrfcct woman. More in detail:
She believed in clergymen, in politicians, in the deceased wife's sister, in all eminent physicians, in the British Constitution, in herself, and in hygiene. She used Sandow’s t:xercises and cold water; she subscribed to a society for establishing a national theatre to play Mr. Bernard Shaw's tragedies and to the nearest hospital. She had money.and lands and houses and ioeas. She meant to reform society, to make it good and Useful and straightforward and simple and utterly delightful.
Especially she set herself to reform and improve men—creatures who ■Rere wax in her hands. Particularly, eight particular men. widely different, but all in their way Men, with a great big M. Penelope would. hav* no others about. Her picture (not at all adequate) and their eight pictures are all in the book. Austin De Vere was a poet; he abhorred bulldogs. Plar‘agenet Goby had been a Captain in the Guards; he had won the V. C. Leopold Norfolk Gordon was a Jew. a
*	* financial genius, accused of having at one time called himself Isaac Levi. Young Bramber was a courtesy lord, and would, in coursc, be a real Earl. Carteret Williams was a war correspondent, the Marquis de Rivaulx was a Frenchman, a savage anti-Semite, a lunatic balloonist, James Carew was an artist and an A. R. A.; Rufus Q. Plant was an American millionaire, alleged by Mr. Roberts to have been born In Virginia, but endowed with me idiom of rural New England.	,
Now the notion of a public wedding In a cathedral with a Bishop or two to tie the knot offended Penelope's ideals. She vowed that she for one would be married before a registrar, and no one should so much as know who the happy man was. She announced her resolve to the world at large and to the eight severally, fpon pain of disqualification for the race, then, and for their souls’ good, slie imposed improving exercises upon eaeh. The soldier must read Keats with the poet; the war correspondent must exchange spiritual gifts with the A. R, A.; the Jew (Who was timid) must go ballooning with the Marquis; tli^ Marquis (who was prejudiced) must dine with the Jew. Then hecause they all behaved beautifully under these inflictions, Penelope gravely and publicly promised to marry one of them. Later she called them all together and, gaspingly and with blushes, an* nounced that she had kept her word. But she named no names. In a year's time ther^ was the announcement in The Times of the birth of a son, still with no father mentioned. And so the mad thing moVes on, mostly in motor cars, defying speed limits and like timid conventions. Till
almost the end you don*t know who I^ady Penelope's husband is, >so devilishly cunning is Mr. Roberts.
Besides—but we'd rather not insist too much on this point—it is all in its airy way an amazingly clever satire, touching upon an astonishing number of solemn and respectable matters in a manner of cheerful and spontaneous audacity which disarms resentment.
