In this little book Mr. Norman Duncan professes to be no storyteller. His freight Is fact—fact not less true for being put Into vigorous language. And the language is vigorous. What he calls Dr. Grenfell's parish is the long, rocky coast of Labrador and. of Newfoundland, over 1 against It, where Dr. Grenfell has labored, and is laboring, sailing- th’e .icy .seas in fog and storm and tending the bodies (and minding somewhat also the souls) of the scatter^ dwellers in a vast, drear country, which is less'desolate since he came tinto it. Dr. Wilfred T, Grenfell is an Englishman, and he is commissioned by the ** Royal National Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen^ but first of all he is a man without fear and full o‘f faith. So much you gather from Mr. Duncan's account, which* however, is chiefly concerned, not with the doctor, but with his monster parish and the inhabitants of ifc
First the author describes the coast, [ naked, rugged, desolate, lying sombre in a jnist. * * * TheVe Is no inviting stretch of shore the length of it—no sandy beach, no line of shingle, no grassy bank; the sea washes a thousand miles of jagged rock.** Then lie tells of the islands strung1 along, the innumerable Iittle~harbors into which a ship may slide through a channel unbelievably narrow and be safe; then ot storms and wrecks ^and fogs so thick and so sudden the afterdeck may be “ in soggy gloom.'and bright sunshine at the bow.”
Mr. Duncan has a catalogue of ships that have„ run upon these rocks or Just mlssea ’em, ships whose names are a sort of inspiration, the schooner All's Well, (“ which was not her name,”) the schooner Bight and Tight, the Army Lass, whose skipper went upon an Iceberg to get a view of the seascape—since the fog lay low and dense.	,__
He clambered up the side of the berg. Near the summit he had to cut his foothold with an axe. This was unfortunate, for he gave this, great white mass one Wow too many. It split under his feet. He fell headlong into the widening crevIce. But he was apparently not a whit the worse for it when his boat’s crew picked him up.	^
Also the Good Fortune,	“running	through
dense fog with a	fair	high	wind	and	all
i sail set, struck an Iceberg bow on ”—yet
escaped.^ ^	Skipj^ruZac^ria^; of the;

' Further Mr. Duncan^deacribes the state of affairs before jDr. Grenfell came -to the -country, and especially.. the brutal and drunkeri career of a certain Qovern-•ment physician who was sent northward • every Summer on the mail boat and tended the sick “ when he had a* mind.’r This man ** is dead—the folk thank God for it —being drunk on a stormy-night, .he fell down the companion way and broke his neck.’* So the author tells of the " II ve-yeres" or permanent dwellers on the Labrador, fishers and trappers—and grim \ stories-he has of the lives, they lead and the deaths they die. From them he passes | to the men who go with the fishing fleet from Newfoundland every Summer and what marvelous^ seamen they are—and -many things about them good to hear. Especially of one in whom by his own admission “ the stn of jokln* put his soul in danger of bein' hove overboard into the burnin' lake.** Wherefore he sang doleful songs to keep his spirits down.
The doctor’s work, his hospitals, his steamings on his little sKlfi~ Strath con a, the doctor himself upon the ^bowsprit peering into the fog bank as she dashes along in weather when even Labradormen stay in port, his Journeylngs with sledge and dogs In Winter—all for those sick'of his—these complete a book which not only fires you .with admiration for. Dr. Grenfell's work but Induces cc sort of envy of the bold life he leads fighting the cold and the sea and taking joy therein.
