Eirl—the girl—has red hair, and Is named Sibyl. Tommy calls her ** Sib/’ and almost every time the two converse confidentially he says, 41 Sib, you are so very beautiful." To which Sib invariably replies, " You are a dear Tommy.” It has been remarked (with French fancy verses immediately in mind) that a refrain, in order to admit gracefully of much vain repetition, must be very wise or else supremely foolish. And this little fragment of duologue is a refrain* Yet no doubt Sibyl was beautiful and Tommy was a dear. The story, which has its beginning in a New York ballroom, goes far. It takes Tommy from his first lovemaking and assigns him to the nobler rdle of volunteer scapegoat for the amatory sins of a handsome and heedless father. It exiles the young man from his mansion In Washington Square to a remote and barbarous region in the back country. It exposes him to weird temptations, comes within an ace of marrying him to a darkeyed, black-haired hill beauty, threatens him with tar and feathers, puts a bullet into his bead,, and when hospitals and the doctors have set him on his feet again, haunts him. The ghost of the blackhaired hill girl—a most realistic ghost which ages and coarsens as the months pass—follows him everywhere. In the matter of this persistent shade (who is decidedly shrewish) the author has shown no little ingenuity and cleverness, though the means he takes at last to eliminate the tactless lady are distinctly awkward.
There are other clever things in the story, too. several dramatic episodes, a number of matters well expressed, and
; something like the real thing in the way of an old lady oi the world. That world, of course, ts the artificial and sentimental one In which Mr. Forman’s stories always move—one In which honor and loyalty are exalted as the only virtues and where in mere matters of bread and meat have no part. Nevertheless, ** Tommy Carteret ” Is quite readable, even entertaining, though it Is the kind of book some superior persons sneer at and consign to the limbo of nothingness.
