HE name of Hans Christian Andersen has been for many years, and In every civilized
land, veritably a household word. That well-worn phrase is not often so aptly applied. His tales and fairy stories-eonstituting the best of all his work, and that by which he is remembered —ar»l essentially lor the domestic circle,
stories to tell by the fireside W inter nights or on the ver&nda of a pleasant, well-peopled country home moonlit Summer evenings, stories to inspire and delight the children, young and old. His poems are known, out of Denmark, only by omnivorous students of literature. Mary Howitt translated his novel called ■* Improvisatore,” but few remember it in its English dress. Other novels such as " O. Z.” and “ Only a Fiddler *' are not recalled. His plays, even his laboriously constructed “ Wandering Jew ” tragedy, are forgotten. But his fairy tales and little stories of folk lore are still treasured all over the world. On the celebration of the seventieth anniversary of his birth, in 1875, one of his gifts was a book containing one of his tales translated ijito fifteen different languages.

Andersen said that the three authors who seemed to have '* mingled with his very blood ” in his youth were Walter Scott, Hofrmann, and Heine. Perhaps he took a leaf out of Scott's book in his careful study of the traditions and folk lore of his own land, but Sir Walter s influence doubtless counted for more In his poems, plays, and romances than in his shorter tales. As for Hoffmann and Heine, their influence upon him is obvious.
Tet he knew not one of these three early in his career, though books were near him from the very beginning. His father, a poor shoemaker, m^ch above his station in birth and intellect, read Holberg aloud by Hans Christian's cribside in his infancy. The plays and novels of that illustrious Dane and the marvelous stories of •* The Arabian Nights ” were the intellectual sustenance of his childhood. The shoemaker knew whole passages of them by heart and would recite them in their cabin of an evening or in the beechwoods Sunday afternoons. They dwelt at Odense, on the island of Funen, a quaint town in which at the time of Hans Christian's birth, and for some years afterward, mediaeval customs prevailed and old ceremonies were seriously performed.
Hans was a strange, shy, imaginative youth, fond of making puppet5 and dressing them in scraps of gay cloth. These were the actors in his toy theatre for which he invented wonderful plays. His paternal grandmother, who had seen better days, had pauper’s lodgings in a neighboring asylum, where her husband was confined, a harmless lunatic. She seemed to the hid a beautiful personage vested with great authority. The days he visited her at the asylum seemed gala days. His mother, a hard-working, practical. unimaginative woman, doubtless felt bhe had to do with three hopelessly unreasonable folks. But her husband whs kind, the old Uuly’s respectability was something to be proud of, and the child's fondness for his toy theatre puppets and the revivification of oM legends ;'t least kept him out of mischief.

So Hans .’hristiaii's early childhood passed, in a 1 emote corner of little Denmark, among kindly and generally ignorant folk, to whom the imaginative child was an oddity, to be praised sometimes and put on exhibition, but frequently to be heartily laughed at. Faint echoes {IT the triumphs of the wonderful Corsican, and later of his downfall, reached the child's ears. When the shoemaker di^d Hans Christian's mother soon married again, this time a less imaginative artisan. But the lad was kindly treated. Mme. Bunkeflod, widow of a clergyman who wrote poetry, was his benefactress, and others of some social prominence in the pent-up 1’tica of Odense befriended him, but he received no regular schooling, and his childish plays and poems were woefully deficient in grammar and orthography. For a short time he was an apprentice in a cloth factory, where his recitations and songs pleased the workmen, but the rude fellows flightened him, and he ran home to his mother. At the ^ge of fourteen years he was permitted to
go to Copenhagen to seek his fortune. He wore his confirmation suit, made from some old clothes of his father’s, and a pair of wonderful boots into the legs of which he stuffed his trousers. He had a small sum of money, buoyant spirits, unbounded ambition, a head full of odds and
ends of vorse and fantasy, and no learning.

He was willing to become a poet, an actor, a singer, a dancer, or alt four in one. He had seen plays performed by a
German troupe in Odense, and the company of the Danish Royal Theatre also appeared there occasionally. To Mme. Schall, leader of the ballet, he vainly applied in Copenhagen for encouragement. He went to the stage door of the theatre, but was turned away. His money was
soon gone. He was utterly unused to the ways of a sophisticated society. In Paris or London he would surely have starved to death or sunk to the lowest social level. But in Copenhagen he found poets to protect him—Weyse, Baggesen, and Guidberg He was set to learning Latin, Danish, and music at the expense of others* His childish singing voice gave out, but he found a place in the ballet at the Royal Theatre, which he held for a .short time. He was always reciting his poetry and neglected his studies to write it.
Truth to say, young, gawky, ill-dressed Hans Christian must have been a great deal of a bore in those days. But he was sincere and j>ure-mlnded, so his friends multiplied and were stanch. It was only in after years, when his childish illusions had been dispelled, when royal pensions had transformed him into a university man, a traveler who had seen brave sights abroad, and a poet whose songs were sung in other lands, that he felt the real bitterness of patronage. Then the very friends of his youth seemed to turn against him.
"What,” they cried. “Young Hans Christian called a poet in France and Germany! NonseMse! We knew him when he could not spel'., when we gave him clothes to keep him warm, and fed him? "
They criticised harshly all he did. They sneered at him to his face. " You don't study enough," said one pert lady at a Copenhagen reception. There is scarcely any mythology in your books. Study Corneille and Racine."
Andersen gave to the world his “ Story of My Life,” nn autobiography as frank and charming as Franklin’s and Trollope's, in the forties. It reveals an optimistic nature, shaded, as one may say,
by extreme sensitiveness. “ My life,” he
begins, "is a pretty story, rich and fortunate.” But all Its sore spots are revealed. These were not deep, to be sure. He suffered much harsh criticism. He was once crossed In love. But he was accounted a national poet almost from the publication of his first considerable poem, “ The Dying Child.” He was always well received in other lands. Mendelssohn as well as Thorwaldsen, Rachel as well as Councillor Collin, Alexandre Dumas as well as Heiberg, were his friends. Fredrika Bremer, Chamisso, the brother.■= Grimm, and Jenny land were jl'.ko of the list.
In the theatre one or two of Andersen's early plays prospered fairly, but the drama was not his real forte. Indeed, it was not until lKTdl, with the publication of his collected ” Tales from Jutland,” that his genius began to be fully reveakd. This book was followed in ISCO by ” The Sandhills of Jutland,” and ** Tales for Children," " The Wild Swans.” and " The Ice Maiden " came later. There is a keen sense of humor in many of his tales. There is sadness in some, but it is nevtr without hope. In most of them you recognize his undying love for Denmark, that ** poetical country, fuH of folklore and ohi songs, and with a rich history.” But he frequently loved Denmark from afar. He knew all Europe and some ul" the East. Switzerland fascinated him. " The Ice Maiden ” is a pathetic idyll of Swiss life with a basis of Scandinavian folklore.
He mourns, when he mourns at all, over the lost or misspent talents. The lesson of his own life was ever in his mind. He, too, might have been a silent, poor shoemaker of Funen, But "The Ugly Ducky ling ” triumphed naturally.
Andersen, died August, 1875, in his seventy-first year. The centenary of his "birth is to be celebrated April ‘J of this year.
