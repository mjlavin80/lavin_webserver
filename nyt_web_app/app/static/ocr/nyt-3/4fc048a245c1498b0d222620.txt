The popular tragedian, who imagines himself a potential clown of the first force, the side-splitting low comedian - j ' who feels within him a vocation for high tragedy, have been the.frequent themes of satire, more frequent than of the sympathy which they doubtless deserve. But the author who would like to do what his public does not want and hates the thing it does want is equally deserving of commiseration.
This reflection is suggested by the appearance In an attractive 12mo of 381 pages, with the imprint of Messrs. McClure, Phillips & Co., of the thirteen adventures comprising “ The Return of Sherlock Holmes.” Really, the case of Sir Conan Doyle is hard enough to deserve the tributary tear. Here is a man of an excellent literary equipment and quite justifiable literary ambitions, who likes to experiment and open new fields, and yet is held down to cultivating this garden. He is conscious that he can do other things than detective stories. He may even prefer some of the other things to the detective stories. Here and there there may be a reader who agrees with him. The present commentator, for one, thinks that the distinctly literary quality of Dr. Doyle’s first book, if it was the first, " Micah Clarke,” Is finer than anything he has done since. As a matter of literary mimicry it made the effect of not being | too markedly inferior even to 41 Es- ! mond.” And then there was the good old romance of chivalry, “The White i Company," done capitally after Its j kind, but done so manifestly as a liter- J ary exercise that it might almost have 1 disarmed Mr. Howells. And then, or | thenabout, in what he must have been tempted since to call an evil hour, he !
! hit upon Sherlock Holmes, and found that for the first time he had hit the big public. He wrote all the Sherlock he had set out to write and would have | turned elsewhither. But the public clamored through the publishers for more Sherlock. It got more and more and I

| more, and still showed itself insatiate. Finally in desperation the author, di- j vided between his duty to his family j and this boredom with his own creation, highly resolved to burn his bridges by sending Sherlock irrevocably away, and pitched him off an Alp, betaking himself to vindications of Britain In

and such. But the public would none of | these things in comparison. So there was nothing for it but to resuscitate the hero for a positively last farewell, which has been running, and like wildfire, through the periodicals, and now enters in this volume upon another conquering career.
After all, the public is not wrong. Perhaps Sir Conan feared that his detective stories would, rank ’ him with those fceguilers 0f journeys celebrated by Andrew Lang, “ Miss Braddon and Gaboriau.” He need not have been afraid. Sherlock’s personality alone would save him from that fate. And he is much beholden also to “ Watson,” though Watson has been called, and riot without plausibility, “ the greatest fool

skeptic Lestrade, and now the lngenu-^ Lous disciple Stanteyllopkihg, which are 'thrown in, over and above the Ingenuity of the particular puzzle. Detective stories which are readable are not so uncommon. But detective stories which can be read are another matter. Sir Conan is about the only producer * of these. t On the whole, the stories in the *' Return ” are os good as those in the previous adventures. To he sure, we have i had too nearly " The Adventure of the ' Second Stain ” in the long previous story of " The Naval Treaty/* and we have had too nearly the “ Adventure of ' the Dancing Men” in the still older story of “ The Gold Bug/* which is not even Sir Conan’s, but Edgar Poe’s. J There are now and again drafts upon the reader’s credulity which have to be
dishonored. The most remarkable of them (in the “ Adventure of the Three Students *’) is that a candidate for a prize scholarship, finding three galley slips containing “half a chapter of Thucydides ” Under his eyes, instead of taking down the first sentence and the last, and proceeding to read the rest at leisure in his own Thucydides, sets himself to copy out the whole, at a cost of three-quarters of an hour, all the time-at the imminent risk of detection. It is related that he subsequently went to South Africa. He must have taken command of a British brigade there. But the average is as high as ever, and such tales as “ The Empty House ” and M The Six' Napoleons" and 11 Black Peter " and “The Golden Pince-Nez ” are up to high water mark. It is a fairly safe bet that, before a year is gone, popular clamor will compel the weary Sindbad to pick up the Old Man of the *.Sea whom he has now dropped for the n’th time. And small blame to popular clamor.
