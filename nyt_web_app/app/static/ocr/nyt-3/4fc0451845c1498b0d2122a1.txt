" Prisoniers Marocains ” Prisoners in Morocco ’*) is the title of a romance by Hugues Le Roux, published by Calmann-L£vy, in Paris. The story is baaed upon an actual historic episode, which, however, has been transplanted by the author from Egypt to Barbary. When the Mahdi was in j possession of Khartoum his proceedings were in a high degree barbarous and Oriental; he made the Greek and Jewish merchants accept Islam as a substitute for their previous faiths, and to put a cap on his fantastic cruelty set before a community of pious nuns the choice between breaking their vows and taking husbands or seeing all the foreigners, men, women, and children, then in Khartoum put to the sword. The nuns, it seems, chose to risk rather their own souls than the lives of the others. This is the story M. L*e Roux has used against a background of the Morocco mountains— a picturesque region with which he is familiar.
