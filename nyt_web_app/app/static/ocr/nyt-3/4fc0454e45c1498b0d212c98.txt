“ The Clansman " Is not thi® first novel
In which Mr. Thomas Dixon, Jr., has attempted to set forth the errors of tho negro reconstruction. Ho makes use of them to a considerable extent In ** The Lieopard’s Spots,” where, all unwittingly, he shows that, the people of the South are suffering for the unspeakable sins of the white race committed during the time of slavery.
When Mr. Dixon calls attention to the taint in the mulatto, the-* question is brought home to the thinking Christian: Before God is not the dark t>loo<l of the mulatto cleaner from the taint of sin
than the white?	■	COMMENT.
