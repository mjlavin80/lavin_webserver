FROM REAOERS
cessful at, an earlier day. There were many instances in the civil war .where officers refused to ohey orders to .sacrifice the lives of their raen uselessly. H Marshal Grouchy had marched to tho sound of the cannon Napoleon would no doubt have been victor at Waterloo. At Port Hudson, La., on that terrible 14tli of June Gen. Banks ordered the assaulting column to charge the breastworks again The officer in command at the front was not a West Pointer, but a plain lumberman from the wilds of the Androscpgglp, and he promptly refused to obey the order from the rear, which saved the useless sacrifice of many soldiers' lives—including that of my own. If Gen, Custer had been as prudent and careful a soldier as Dr. Brady would liKe to have had him he never would have written his name so high up on the scroll of fame.
Why cannot Dr. Brady turn his flowing pen into describing the paths of peace, where he Is most at home?

There are many instances in history in which acting without order.- or in direct diobedience of orders have either won battles or prevented disaster. At Chickamauga, when Thomas w;ts in the greatest danger of being overwhelmed by the enemy, Gordon Granger rode up with his reserve corps just m time to fill up the gap in the line.
When Granger ordered his troop to Tti:i rch “ to the sound of the cannon " his Adjutant said: ■* Your orders, General, your orders." "To hell with the orders? ”
answered the General—and Granger was a West Pointer.
It is a well-known fact that Grant was not acting according to orders when he attacked Fort Donelson, and that if he ha.d not been hampered with orders from ! Hal leek he would have been more sue- !
