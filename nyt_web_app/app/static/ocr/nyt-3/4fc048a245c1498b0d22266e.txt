T HE F'ER.F’ET'UAL, FROBLEM
Mt>st of our readers are aware that in M. Jusserand the French Republic has sent to represent it with its elder sister republic not only an accom* plisbed diplomatist, but a scholar of high qualities, a writer of estatjjished and deserved reputation. The latest | literary work of the French Ambassador is a “ Literary History of the English People,” the second volume of which has just appeared in Paris from the press of Firmin-Didot. The first volume covered the period from the origin of English literature to the Renaissance; the second takes up the subject at the Renaissance and carries it as far as the civil war, thus embracing the *' spacious times of great Elizabeth '* and, above ail, the career of the greatest of English poets, along with that of Spenser, Jonson, and Bacon, certainly the most fecund and glorious period of our language. This volume is reviewed somewhat elaborately in La Revue des Deux Mondes by M* Ren£ Doumic, one of the keenest and most Interesting of contemporary French critics. He devotes his attention chief-)y to the treatment by M- Jusserand of the life and genius of Shakespeare.
According to M. Doumic, M. Jusse-rand inclines to present Shakespeare in substantially the light in which he was regarded by the Romanticists, led by Hugo, as one of the class of geniuses who " proceed at hazard, ignorant of the w7ays they traverse, attaining sublimity involuntarily, pouring forth masterpieces without intending them— In short, unconscious geniuses to whom alone, perhaps, the title can fairly be applied.” To the question how Shake-
I
speare was able to produce his dramas 1 and why he made them what they are, I M. Jusserand, according to M. Doumic, replies: " Shakespeare wrote his plays without a deliberately determined point j of view, without any system thought ■ out in advance, without personal references, confining himself to following the tastes of his public." When the 1 dramatist stopped to reflect, he found the public taste in error, so he reflected 1 as little as might be, and *' thus his I work, was marked more distinctly than any other by the impress of the vace, and he endowed his country with a drama purely Anglo-Saxon, in which Engiand recognizes the strongest Mke-ness of its own genius."
M. Doumic finds this notion of the great dramatist unacceptable, He argues that Shakespeare wrote for his public, *• the sole master, whose faithful servant he was," but he contends that in this he was not singular, but pursued the same plan, under different conditions, as Corneille and Moli£re, as, in fact, all successful dramatists. Nor were the tastes he conformed to peculiar to England. T’ney were those tliat had given rise in earlier times to the “ Mysteries,’’ with their abrupt contrasts of violence and sentiment, tragedy and comedy, acute observation of humanity and lofty passion; and these tastes still demand the melodrama of modern times. They are peculiar to no land and to no period, “ The system of the English drama of the sixteenth century is made not after the image of the Anglo-Saxon crowd, but after the__ image of all crowds.” Shakespeare chose to contribute to this drama rath- 1
er than that of the man of letters—represented, for example, by the erudite Jonson—“ because he felt, more or less confusedly, that It was in accord with the tendencies of hts own nature. He gave to it the consecration of his genius. Thanks to him the dramatic system of the Middle Ages which was about to perish without, either in England or France, attaining literary form, finally enters into literature and unfolds in art of splendid radiance. * * * A fortunate combination, doubtless, but one we have no reason to regard as fortuitous or involuntary.”
It would obviously be unfair to M. Jusserand to accept his view of Shakespeare at second hand, and his second volume has not yet reached us. But in the meantime we have thought it interesting to call attention to the suggestions of M. Doumic as being novel in France. They are certainly an aid to the intelligent appreciation of the greatest of English dramatists by a people with whom the drama has its favorite home.
