"Sew yorh Timex Booh Review:
Do those of your readers who arc fond of " Alice in Wonderland " know the date of her doseent into the rabbit hole? Internal evidence shows, as a friend has told me, that Alice’s adventures happened on tho 4th of May—the day is given in the tea party scene; the month just before, in the conversation with the Cheshire Cat. Any who love Alice and nonsense would do well to hold a mad tea party to cclebrate the anniversary.	D. W.
