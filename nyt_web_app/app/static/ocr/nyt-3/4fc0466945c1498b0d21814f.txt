T IS never very wise to try to make Just estimates of our contemporaries. At best can only give opinions limited l»y our angle of outlook and colored by I he atmosphere of our own time. TJiia must be parUi*ul;irly so In the case of poetry, for the reason that jtotttry makes such a strong appeal to our sympathies and is never a matter to be judged by tlie reason alone.
To speak of Mr. Swinburne with propi*r a.ppn»ela*-tion one must go hack lo the early clghLies, when his wonderful poetry \vn- f t ken less as a matter of coursc lhan it is now. /l'hom* were years when our college tasks wore interrupted every little while by the appearance of come now volume of precious poetry by Browning or Tennyson, by Morris or Rossetti, and Ions hours would be spent in eager, delight--ful reading:. Arnold, it is true, had ceased to write, except as a critic, but his name and personality were none the less touched with glamour, his work none the less cherished. The sixth of the immortals of that far-off golden a ge was the author of “ Ata-lanta in Calydon,” and In some ways he was the most compelling of them all, astonishing and unrivaled in his accomplishment. Ho was not so much a mentor as a sorcercr, and it was with a sort of divine intoxication that we used to chant “ The Triumph of Time,” " The Garden of Proserpine," the close of “ Anactoria," or the choruses of ” Atalanta.’1 In volume and magic of sound no English poet had ever matched these things. U seemed. They carried i us away by their unexpected splendor of diction, their novel and Incomparable harmonies, their noble | fervor. They came upon the impressionable ear like enchanted strains from some mysterious land, fabulous, lonely, and-jnournful, yet lovely with all the loveliness of unforgotton joy. Their sorrowful cadences, their sad refrains, their pitiful sontiment,
appealed to the wilful melancholy of youth, while their lofty and uncalculating radicalism quickened , its generosity. It did not occur to us in those days that restraint was any part of perfection, or that ; these miracles of poetic artistry would have been | more beautiful had they been less recklessly diffuse, i At least, if any such suspicion ever crossed our i minds, we loyally put it aside.	!
But those bright days of romance could not last. One by»one *he great singers brought their work tO | a close, leaving none to take their places; while ; their youthful admirers heard the call of the world, and were forced, however reluctantly, to go about | the world's business. Then, too, there had to come I a time of riper judgment, more discriminating ap~ i preciation, more exacting taste. As .years went by . they brought a change of spiritual and mental needs; the sensuous music of *' Poems and Ballads ” grew a little monotonous and unsatisfying in our ears, and failed to charm us as it had at first. What the^ reason for this may have been who shall say V In the cold disillusionment of an age of prose I find myself wondering whether it was due to a failure of enthusiasm in ourselves, or whether thero is really an inherent deficiency somewhere in Mr. Swinburne's poetry which makes it incapable of holding one for long. Poetry at its best, lika all art at its best, must surely be a thing of such power as to sway men and women of all conditions and requirements with more than a passing influence. Its hold must be permanent, its zest perennial, while its subtle power to move us must prevail against the slowly benumbing frost of time. Poetry which falls short of these demands, which charm3 us for a time and then can charm us no more, Which brings our senses under the spell of its enchantment 1 but in the end fails to answer our rational <jues-> -i tions, can hardly be called poetry of the first order.
Erought to the testvpf judicial questioning, much ^ of Mr, Swinburne’s poetry is found to fail in thts^ respect At least so it must seem to many of his Ji; admirers, I fancy. And while they must forever be gratified for the delight which he gave them, thej'V; must somewhat sorrowfully admit that he can'glve-v^ the same delight no longer—that while the beautiful!^ masterpieces of other great Ylctorianavar<r^fswteii^

$:	What	makes this difference? I have
van idea that his poetry never was quite •as greai as it seemed to us. Youth is full of Ideals. it is true, but it is also much taken uj> with the senses. It does not often demand a convincing reason or _ look for truth beneath appearancts. The sensuous beauties of the world, the ob-- vious sensuous beauties of art, appeal to It. And if there is one quality which Mr. Swinburne's poetry always exhibits It is sensuous beauty—beauty of form. You may repeat the stanzas beginning—
-'■■-O fair green-girdled mother of mine.
Sea, that art clothed with the sun and the tain,
or that incomparable chorus,
Before the beginning of years
There came to the making of man,
until the whole world seems made out of poetry, so splendid and compelling is the fabric Of the verse, so free and sincere and impassioned its headlong flow. Yet how easily it becomes redundant!
There, I believe, is the essential flaw in this masterly poet’s work. He is, if we may judge* a man of unbounded exuberance, of unbridled enthusiasm; he knows no moderation nor restraint; he is all superlative, always excessive; he will never use an adjective where he can possibly use two; he is never satisfied with a perfect line without wanting to duplicate it. From a single poetic thought he will brew a barrel of verbiage. He seems never to have comprehended the value of economy in art. It never has occurred to him that reiteration is almost always a mark of weakness. He has never perceived what power there is in being concise. He Is, as was said of Gladstone,
“ intoxicated with the exuberance of his own verbosity,” and can never be quenched as long as there is an adjective left in the dictionary. He roust exhaust the very resources of language before he will desist.
The blunder is fatal. It is a juvenile error which a little judgment ought surely to have corrected, but one which Mr. Swinburne has never outgrown. All of bis later work* like his earlier, suffers from this redundancy of expression, this lax and indiscriminate exaggeration. So indulgent has he been of his native talent that there are scarcely half a dozen of his poems that would not gain by pruning and condensation. With the great mass of his work, of course, no such amending could be possible. Its blemishes are too inherent. His genius itself is too diffuse and ungovernable ever to submit to those nice limitations which perfection in any art requires of the artist. You may open him almost at random and find examples of his besetting sin. For instance, you may turn to *’ March: An Ode,” and read the first line:
“ Ere frost flower and snow- blossom faded and fell."
** And the splendor of Winter had passed out of sight.*'
and feel yourself still in the presence cf the same sonorous voice that first sounded in the *’ Poems and Ballads," though with just a suspicion of weakness. Before you reach the.foot of the page, however, you come upon the line:
That the sea was not lovelier than here was the land.
Nor the night than the day, nor the day than the night,
and at once feel that all force had evaporated from the poem. " Nor the night than the day; nor the day than the night " j —what pitiful bathos, what tawdry in- | cptituile! And yet, to speak severely, he . has hardly wrfften a p?.ge that is entirely free from any such mea.nlng'less superfluity of words. His very facility has been his undoing.
This great copiousness of language, while at first indicative of abundance of power, produces in the end a sense of in- 1 competence and vapidity. Incontinence is a mark of feebleness, not of force, and implies inefficiency or decrepitude. In art, as in life, too much ts as bad as too little. Only within the range of the golden mean is perfection possible. In all of Mr. Swinburne’s work, in his prose as well as his poetry, we cannot help feeling his lack of balance, his lack of restraint, raid consequently his lack of real and enduring power. He seems to be led away by every new combination of words that >tig-■! gests itself to his ear; he can never light h-upon.:a happy phrase without-wanting to / repeat it in. a slightly different form. He' has a passion for proficiency rather than perfection, andisalways betrayed into., overstatement.' ■ It; cannot- be; •said .-of' his
poetry that he writes Without inspiration,' nor of his prose that he writes without insight; but it must often be said that 3>e writes without judgment. He has pas? sion; indeed, a noble passion, for human liberty, but a passion so intemperate that it is more like the hysteria of the invalid than the divine frenzy of the oracle.
It is a thousand pities that a man of such genius should never have learned ■ the value of moderation!"that prime requisite of beauty. For perfection lies on- the magic boundary between deficiency and excess, and can no more reside in the one than in the other. Successful art, like successful life, must be modulated, modeled. limited, bounded, directed. T.he flawless line of the statue appears only when the superfluous marble has been cut away. Without modulation all crude native force must lose half its effectiveness and be dissipated in irrelevancy, whether it is manifesting itself in nature, in society, or in art. It is not enough that poetic inspiration should be spontaneous and plentiful in any given instance, it must be regulated, controlled, and tempered by logic before it can wholly serve the best purposes of poetry. J
Again, all art, and particularly the art of poetry, must not only be restrained and free from excess; it must be balanced in all its essentials; it must devote itself to satisfying our curiosity as well as playing upon our emotions and charming our senses. It must help to satiate our love of truth, our desire for knowledge, our longing for a reasonable explanation of the universe, at the same time and in the same measure that it helps to satisfy our love of sensuous beauty and all the generous aspirations of the spirit. Poetry has "obligations, in other words, not only to the fastidious taste and the inflammable heart of the reader, but to his clear reason as well. These latter requirements the poetry of Mr. Swinburne fails to meet. Poetry, indeed, must not smack of philosophy, yet every poet must have a philosophy of his own, and that philosophy must be inherent and discoverable in bis work. In poetry of the first order the philosophic pith is significant and valuable. In less important poetry it is insignificant and of little worth, either because it is trite, or because it is false, or because it is vague or fantastic.	_
Some such reason as this, if I am not mistaken, lies at the root of Mr. Swinburne’s comparative failure as a poet—his failure to reach that influential place in current literature which his great gifts would have otherwise entitled him to hold. For while we all gladly acknowledge his eminence, we must also regretfully admit the slightness of his hold on the regard of his age. He has been belauded and revered as a master by all lovers of technique; he has failed to make himself felt as a power in his generation. For all his splendid achievement he pipes to us in vain. He does not touch the heart of the multitude as Tennyson and Longfellow touched it; he does not stimulate thought and satisfy our mental unrest as Browning did; he has none of Arnold’s clarity and repose. He fills, the ear without feeding the mind, and we turn away in disappointment from his resonant but empty dithyrambs.
All these ungracious things must only be said, of course, in the interest of the severest criticism, in- an attempt, which is perhaps futile after all, to judge the poetry of our own day in comparison with the greatest poetry of all time. And they may be said, I hope, without any detriment to Mr. Swinburne's fame. For in spite of all detractions he remains one of the chief ornaments of the Victorian age of poetry, that is to say, one of the illustrious poets of the world. As a wizard of versification, a startling and magnificent artist, he remains without a rival,
