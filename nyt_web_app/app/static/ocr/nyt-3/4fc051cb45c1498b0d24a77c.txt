The Independent.
Thomas Dixon, in his efforts to give respectability to the Ku Klux Clan, implicates a Northern clergyman in a letter to The New York Times:
One of the^best preach* -rs in Boston, a man of the sweetest Christian character, a leader of Kvangclical Christianity, whose sermons The Transcript prints on Mondays, was a Ku Klux clansman, and at this writing is still unhanged and very popular in Boston.
His older brother, the Rev. A. C. Dixon, is one of the best preachers in Boston.
