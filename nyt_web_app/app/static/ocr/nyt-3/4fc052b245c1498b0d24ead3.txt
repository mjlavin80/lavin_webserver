Gissiny's “ Veranilda.”
jYcut York Times Book Review:
The reviewers seem to have some difficulty in accounting for Gisslng’s " Ver-; anilda." But to those who have observed the frequent autobiographical touches throughout his former hooks,
“ Veranilda " was fairly announced, and was a natural phase in his development. It has nothing to do with the present craze for historical novels.
A dreamer, of weakly frame, Gissing 1 had the same intense longing for the South, for Italy, as the Germans of old. With only an insecure knowledge of Lat-1 In, Greek, and Italian, he had only the more ardent admiration for their lltera-ture and history. Having once visited ; the sunny shores, he was forever after ' spoiled for his previous line of work, forever after disgusted with his London slums and London society, one as squalid as the other.
This is read in pages of “ Private Papers of Henry Ryecroft," which I take to be extracts from the author's own diary. It is found again in “ New Grub Street,” which, particularly in tfte character of Edwin Reardon, I consider the more true autobiography, because less avowedly so.
For instance, at Page C8 of the latter book, “ Veranilda ” is explained, but hardly justified. The writer, for one at least, has no intention of reading ** Veranilda,” since obviously In this new line Gissing could never he more than a dilettante, writing about what he did not thoroughly know.
