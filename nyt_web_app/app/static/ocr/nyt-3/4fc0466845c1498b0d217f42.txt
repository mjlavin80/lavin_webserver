R. GOLD WIN SMITH’S defense, in the March Atlantic, of the fame of Scott’8 poetry against the aspersions of Mr. Arthur Symons has the ring of true metal. In the afternoon of his life Gold win Smith retains a wholesome liking for the writings of Walter Scott, both prose and verse* and a keen remembrance of the good influence they exerted upon his youth. We speak advisedly of the fame of Scott's poetry as the object of Mr. Symons’s critical assault. For the multitude of the present hour that poetry Uves only in its fame. Where is tho man or woman under middle age who could sum up the merits of “ Marmion/’ for instance, as Gold-win Smith does? Those of us who are well along in middle life used to read that poem and 41 The Lady of the Lake" when w© read Macaulay’s " Lays ” and Pope, in our youth. Few of us, we fancy, pick up any of these poems now for an hour's reading be» fore bedtime, as we pick up the Essays of Elia or ; Walpole or Shakespeare, according to the mood. Scott's poetry, like his long introductions to his novels and romances, baa gone out of fashion, but the elo- i quence and spirit, the aptness of phrase and the 1 abounding sincerity of Goldwln Smith’s tribute may perchance set some of us to reading It again.
