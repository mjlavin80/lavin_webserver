FLORENCE
OW happens it that one never feels like bidding Florence ’•good-bye"? Rome is grand and stately, Venice enchanting1, Naples a delirium* but Florence is. somehow, homelike. It mieht be that hygienic conditions have somethin? to do with contentedness " Florence Some Tuscan Cities,” by Clarissa ooff. is a handsome volume, with its many excellent copies of water-color pictures by Col. R. C. Goff. The author's ambition is to describe the best of tho Tuscan monuments, with th#*lr decorations, and to weave “in a few legends and stories, not always within reach of the hurried traveler or the non-traveler, who sees foreign countries through the eyes of books of travel”
The story of Florence is one of factions fighting for the mastery. Popes, Emperors, Guelfs, and Ghibelin.es tore the city to pieces, " *md dyed her in blood for many a long century, while she cried aloud for peace, and yet there was nc peace, as she bowed her fair neck to the yoke of the tyrant.” The wonder is how she became one of the great centres of art. The two centuries after the twelfth
■	are held to be the greatest period in the a history of Florence, A new world descants with admiration on the works of Cambio, Talenti, Orcagena, of Dante. Ghiberti, Donatello, Verrochio, Botticelli, Castagno, Uppa Lippi, Boccaccio, Petrarca, and Michelangelo. These men have left the impress of their genius on the literature and art of the present moment
With the grandeur of Florence there are inextricably ” woven the actions of the Medici family. The first of the name. Salvestro dei Medici, was a rich merchant, who in 1378 was Gonfaloniere of the Republic of Florence. His grandson, Cosimo, became the ruler of the city. It was Cosimo who "did much to beautify the city and was a munificent patron and benefactor of the Church and art ” It was under Lorenzo, called the Magnificent, that Florence reached the zenith of her glory. Describing Lorenzo, the author writes:
As a ruier Lorenzo wps hard and tyrannical; nevertheless, Florence flourished under him exceedingly, and attained to a great height of prosperity. But, though rich, cultivated, and gifted, understanding Ihcroughly the art of Jivfng magnificently and knowing the weakness of men. lie and his Court were corrupt, and the people of Florence were influenced by his example, and degenerated until the morals of the community were at a very low ebb.
Then came the warning words of Savon-aiola, and for a time “ the pendulum swung back." After the burning of the Friur of San Marc there was a return to the immoralities of the past. Tho after fortunes of Florence wo nrAj not follow. To-day she belongs to the Kingdom of Italy. " Out of the death struggle of the older order rose the iww kingdom, and the Florence we know to-day is the same, yet changed.” Florence always hos hf.en cosmopolitan, attracting the most distinguished of Americans and Englishmen. Hawthorne lived in Florence, as did Walter Savage Landor, and there wcrp two, " whose name:; arc linked with Florence. Robert and Klizabeth Frowning," whose house was the ” Casa Guidi."
OI all the churches in Florence, the Santa Maria Novella is the most beautiful. Michelangelo bestowed on it the namr of " La Sposa,” or the Bride. Here are the frescoes of Ghirlandajo, ana stained	glass	windows of marvelous
beauty.	The	Sant;i CYocc will next at-
tract attention. With the Santa Maria Novella the two represent the fir^at religious orders of the Franciscans and Dominicans. In Sanu Croce are the mortal remains of Galileo, an ancestor of tho ferrous astronomer, and of " the greatest of immortals. Dante/1 Ruskin in his “ Mornings in Florence ’’ tells of the impressions this church made on him. Street life In	Florence the author describes:	Here	is the Via dei Neri. with its
tall :md ancient houses, “ the lower floors occupied by dark little shops," There are the grocers, the coppersmiths. Loud and various «re the cries of the street sellers. Just tiS ir. the sixteenth century, city life flowed past the Piazza della Hignoria, so it moves to-diiy. Here on the steps of the Loggia dei I^anzi, you nuiy see Donatello's “ Judith ’* and Cellini s “ Perseus.” Here on every Saturday the winning numbers of the Government lottery are exposed. It is curious to learn that the Government has not established savings barks, though it has legaliz'd lotteries. Step by step the author loads the reader through the many plavcs of interest, and ill Florence th^y are many. Th< n there follow excursion:- 10 the towns in the n* ighborhood. A delightful triii ip the one to Fiesolc. In the neighborhood is the Salviati Villa, and about it is tolO a dreadful story, colored with the dramatic ac-
tion of the Middle Ages. Prato, Plstola, Pisa, Viareggio, Lucca are visited. Writing concerning Pisa, the author, struck with the many wonders she sees, as the cathedral, the Leaning Tower, the Baptistery, writes:
We learn that these three buildings are the work of men who lived as It were in the very beginning of the great period of Italian architecture, and, as we admire the marvels they created, we ask ourselves, wonderingly. what could have been the secret of their success? A secret it certainly was; one, alas! that haa not been learned by future generations. Perhaps it lay in the simple lives these old artists lived—lives which were in close touch with nature, full of earnest, hum* bte-minded endeavor, and illuminated Ly a strong personal faith, which touched the hearts of men more deeply than we realise to-day.
