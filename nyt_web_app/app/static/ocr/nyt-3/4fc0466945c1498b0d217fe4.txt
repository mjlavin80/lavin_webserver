“ Buster Browne ” sounds like a name essentially, not to &iy hopelessly, American, of the present hour, and of comic significance. Yet Gen. Macleod Innes in his new book on " The Life and Times of Gen. Sir James Browne,” says that his hero, a British .East Indian commander of great renown, was called “ Buster ” for many years, having derived the name from an elder brother who was killed in the mutiny. Gen, Browne was a good soldier and an able administrator. He died in 1890.	'
