Henry' James.
Neio^York Times Hook Iicvtcio:
Now some one declares that all who find ; fault with Henry James’s later methods are his enemies. Bless you, man. We. have known our Henry so well and delighted so- in his keen analysis of 'human motives and follies that we grieve over the change in him. We protest against being led through a labyrinth of words instead of. the direct road he knows so welL Of fete years he has taken to doing stunts. *' See/' he cries, " I can write a story by beginning in the middle, work toward the end, and back to the beginning just as if the reader knew what I
was talking: about. Only a. few of us can do that—I and Kipling." To Illustrate, we will use a romance which the reader must assume he is not familiar with, and is now for the first time reading Henry James’s story of u Mary Had a Little Lamb." Thus: "It would, perhaps, be duperfluous to assume that she, upon long reflection and much Introspection, concluded that the impatient pedagogue was perhaps a trifle too precipitate in dealing jtrith the devoted Southdown. However, be that as it may, the pampered minion . was incontinently, or so it seemed to Mary, excluded from the privileges of the Institution. There seemed upon a closer analysis of the case to be a proneness, an Inclination to unseemly mirth and boisterousness on the part of the pupils to whom the novelty of a t-amb at the seat of learning was something unheard of, or„ to be more explicit, had never In their experience been seen before. The tendency,
I might say the predilection, of the timid liUIe creature was to pursue its—or have you had enough?” That is our Henry up to date.	(	DAISY MILLER,
