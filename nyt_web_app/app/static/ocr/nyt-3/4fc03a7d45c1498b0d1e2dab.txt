A N E V LIFE O F BAJ-2 AC
Clearly Miss Mary F. Sandars, the . writer of “ Honor£ de Balzac, His Life
-	and Writings/’ just published by Dodd,
. Mead & Co., enters a field curiously
neglected, considering the great importance of Balzac's work and the in: tense interest attaching to the little ; that is known of his strange personality. Relatively unoccupied as is the . field, the cultivation of it has, as she very frankjy pleads, been accompanied by constant-and perplexing difficulties* The letters of the mighty Frenchman —Miss Sandars has had access to some not yet given to the public—are singularly barren of significant revelations as to anything but his projects, his debts, his money troubles, contracts,
; law suits, quarrels, and all the complex, tangled web of his absorbing “ business.” What others^ave written about him has been pretty well gleaned and presenteS^by no one with more skill and judgment than by Henry James in his admirable essays of twenty years ago. Arid it must be said that Miss
>	Sandars does not essay to give her : readers new light on the “ Writings," except as to what may be called their physical history, under what conditions they were written and published and in what a cloud of promises, delays,
: disputes they were nearly always
-	launched. * Her modest excursions into ~ the domain ,of criticism betray no special interest in that direction. And in
: telling the story, of. 3alza,c’a life she is
•	very simple, straightforward, matter
-	of fact, with few indications of insight : or sympathy in her presentation of the
'	<	-	■	*	.	1	s
-	facts she has gathered or in. -her eom-
■	mente on them.
But her book, notwithstanding .these qualities—in a degree, in consequence of them—is interesting and valuable. It gives the reader a good deal of matter for study and reflection, and leaves : him to deal with it as he may prefer. If he happen to have been a reader at all assiduous of Balzac's works, he will deal with such matter eagerly and gratefully, for it will throw new light upon the author’s vast and singularly uneven product. He will be aided in realizing to what a remarkable, to what a really unprecedented extent, Balzac lived in ahd for his work, was absorbed and literally consumed by it, of what tremendous energy it drained him, and yet—this is ihe real revelation of the book—how largely the work i was a means to an end. The impres- , sion remains that he wrote in order to
•	% , ' become rich and famous, with little of
the joy of the artist in production, with j still less of the inspiration we, for lack of a better term, call moral —the inspiration felt, if not avowed, by the great
■
writers of his own people, by Hugo, by Molt^rei even by the giant of fiction, whom, at a long distance, he imitated in " Les Contes Drolatkjues," Rabelais.
One phase, and an important one, of
Balzac's life is treated by Miss San-
¥
dars with greater detail than previously had been possible—his relations with the Polish lady who ultimately became his wife, Mme. Hanska. As to these the biographer betray? more than in any other part of her book a touch of personal partisanship.

her marriage with Balzac in 1850. She makes it pretty clear that the often-avowed hunger for wealth and social position was not absent from the undoubted devotion of Balzac, and that for-Mme. Hanska marriage with him involved serious sacrifices, was in fact a very different thing from the maintenance of the passionate and romantic
friendship begun seven ' years before.

Hanska was but twenty-five when she wrote her first epistle to the famous author, who was then but thirty-two; the unfolding of the story of their intercourse until their marriage and his swift-following death eighteen years later, though a very imperfect one—Iver letters were stolen, recovered, and burned a year before—is, perhaps, the most interesting feature of Miss Sandars's volume.
