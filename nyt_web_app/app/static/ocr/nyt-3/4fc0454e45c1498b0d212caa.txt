Frederic Harrison’s biography of Chatham, the great English statesman, which was announced as in the Twelve English Statesmen Series, is published this week in a separate volume by the Macmillan Company. Mr. Harrison indicates in his introduction the spirit with which he has written the biography;
In eight centuries our country has known but four great creative statesmen, men who, to use the words of a well-known historian, have been “ founders or creators of a new order of things. William the Conqueror made all England an organic nation. Edward the First conceived and founded Great Britain, Cromwell made the United Kingdom and founded our sea power, Chatham made the colonial system, and was the founder of the empire.
