of which Tom Taylor made a play, doesn't matter. A scheming father had married away his daughter at tho tender age of eleven years to an Irish Earl, then rich and in favor. Meantime King James Stuart had fled to St. Germain and Dutch William had come over to England to reign in his stead. So the Irish Earl who was a Jacobite ami hud been engaged at the Battle of tho Boyne was in exile and a proscribed traitor. He-had not seen the child wife since she had begun to be a , woman. The scheming father being now ! a good Whig had therefore a notion to \ find a new son-in-law unJ ignore the merely formal marriage. But the Ijady Elizabeth was wiltTn! and loyal. Then to I Newmarket to the races, where the King ] was and all the Whig nobility, came a. j dashing young rrishmnn who railed him- ■
j self Mr. Trevor, but was obviously some! body else. He said pretty things to Lady J Elizabeth, and danced with her and j fought duels for her. was near wounded I to death in hpr service, i The I«idy Elizabeth was fantastic and ! coquettish and all that, and the two - played pretty tricks with shamrocks and ! rosts. There were waiting maids, too, i one faithful, one faithless, and the Irish servant uf his lordship in disguise. Also i gallants, old ladies gambling fiercely, like i Beatrix Esmond in her old age, and a sea; green hypocrite of a brother belonging to tLady Eli;yib«-th. Besides, if your Jacobite ! husbnnd is found again in disguise on J Iir'tish soil and ht happens to be expressly «'xnluded by name from all acts [ of amnesty he is in danger of the tower ! and the block. So there are dangers
S	to add spiee fvnd cause alarms and tears of the tender-hearted.
