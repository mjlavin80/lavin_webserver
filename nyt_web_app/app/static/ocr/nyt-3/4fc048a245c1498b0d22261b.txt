limited edition of the Riverside. Press, •' Boccaccio’s Life of Dante," having been quickly exhausted, is to be followed by two similar pub-llcations, the first of which, I the “Sion’s Sonets”, of Francis Quarles, will, be unfamiliar; to many who knew the author's Emblems *’ and “ Divine Poems,” and even his ** Job Militant** The *' Sonets ” paraphrase Solomon’s Song”, and will make a book of about 130 pa^e§, to be printed in Brimmer Roman type, set within rules, and bound in paper boards with gilt-lettered label. Quarles, according to tus i widow and biographer, studied law, not so much to benefit himself thereby as his friends and neighbors. He was secretary to Archbishop Usher, and a courtier and diplomatist, but he. found his chief admirers among "the simpler readers, those of the clasS tnow composing Bunyan’s English publie. His scorn of the world and things worldly pleased those who could not hope to know either.

The second book is the version mado by Philemon Holland, “translator gen-erall in his age ” of Plutarch’s “ Consola-torie Letter unto His Owne Wife as touching the Death of her and his Daughter.'* The title is a fair sample of the style, but in appearance the edition does not attempt to imitate the folio, the text of which it follows. The binding is of dark paper boards with cloth back, and
■	the edition for sale is limited to 350 copies, fifty less than in the case of the Quarles volumes.

I The Harvard professor’s almost„inevt-table call to write a religious book, has. come to Prof. Munsterberg, whose “ EterI nal Life ” will soon appear from the press i of Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. He has given It the form of a dialogue between two friends just returned from the burial of a comrade. He believes that immortality depends upon conduct, upon the realization in life of absolute values-due to truth, beauty, morality, and re-: ligion. His book does not trespass on the domain of Dr. Osier’s “ Science and Immortality.”	-
