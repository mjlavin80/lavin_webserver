BOSTON NOTES,
Andy Adams's New Book and Other Novels—Prof. Norton’s Honor From Abroad.
OLLOWING “The Log of a Cowboy ” and “ A Texas Matchmaker ” conies "The Outlet,” Andy Adams’s third book, to be published tomorrow. The author saw the beginning of the custom of
wintering Texan cattle in the Northwest, the measure which brought about the extermination of the bison and the confinement of the Indians to their reservations. Also he had some experience with railway companies and their methods of caring for cattle, and their prices; with contractors, and with the Congressional lobbyist. AU these things are in his story.

14 Ireland's Story,” by Charles Johnston and Miss Carita Spencer, published this week, will somewhat amaze that large body of American readers who are ignorant of the utter magnificence of the claims made by some of tne Irish. The authors gravely quote the statement of Luke Gardiner, afterward Lord Mountjoy, that the major part of the American army in the war of the Revolution was composed of Irish, and that the Irish language wa^-cig commonly spoken in the American ranks as English.. They also attribute such motives to the Irish volunteers in the Union army as would have amazed their comrades descended from English, German, and French stock. However, these are details, and the book does show through what suffering and struggle the Irish race has become wbat it is in Writics «nd otherwise.

Miss Edith M. Nicholl’s 'i Touch," to be published next week by the Lothrop Company, counts among its incidents the familiar episode of the selfish and disagreeable wife who dies conveniently, only to return at the precise moment when she is least wanted: but it is chiefly a stoi^ of the New Mex Sea rtf cattle country and of the devices by which an honest man holds his own. This' book and " The Outlet ” should help one another, and Mr. Adams’s delight in his real horses and herds is-almost equaled by Miss Nicholl’s enthusiasm over those which she imagines,
Messrs, L.. C. Page & CO, will publish
next WecK “ Stories Of Little Fishes,” by Miss Lcnore 'EUsnheth luuiets, the volume of " Phyllis’s Field Friends ** delayed last Winter. Stt few fishes are familiar to children that the author has included the tortoise, crayfish, terrapin, turtle, snail, frog, toad, and lizard among her subjects, but she describes salmon, whitelisli, catfish, minnows, trout, and perch, and the preface warns the small readers that if they go a-fishing with Phyllis they must CXpCCt to catch any sort of creature which happens to come their way. All the animals are pictured in the cover. Among the stories are Hans Andersen’s " The Snail and the Rosebush," the delightful old tale of the fisherman's wife and her wishes; and a group of Aesop’s fables. Miss Sophie Schneider’s pictures portray the salmon, the catfish, and minnows, but Phyllis is the most prominent figure In four of them.

Elliott Flower’s “ Slaves U ti^coess," which will appear with the Phyllis book, includes six chapters originally published in periodicals, and one, “ The Cupidity of Carroll,” of which only a fragment has1 been in print. The connecting link is the plain countryman who enters politics with j^erfect confidence in a political manager, but learns the ways, of the machine and breaks it. The stories so exactly reflect petty politics in any Northern or Middle Western State that if Chicago W^re not definitely named as their scone no large city could hope to escape the accusation of being their theatre. Jay Hambldge's pictures might be taken vf or portraits in almost any ward.
