FIRE AND S IVl O KE,
Sheridan's Cavalry.
j Frequent requests made to the author for copies of his account of the last days of Sheridan’s cavalry during tho eleven days’ campaign before Petersburg and Richmond that preceded the surrender at Appomattox have led Gen. Henry E. Tremain to have it reprinted in book form. This has been neatly done by Bonnell, Silver & Bowers, New York, in a volume of 5*kJ pages, It has as a frontispiece a stcot engraving of Gen. Sheridan, and is accompanied by a map of the Appomattox campaign* As a title the author has chosen " Lfist Hours of Sheridan’s Cavalry,” and the cover is illuminated with a reproduction in colors of the standard carried on the field to indicate the whereabouts of the idol of the cavalrymen of the Army of the Fotomar, Gen. Tremain was an aide de camp on the staff of Gen. Crook, was in the thick of the fighting that led to Gen. Robert
E.	Lee's surrender, and he had the forethought to make these memoranda that are now put in savable form, just after the campaign was ended and when he was in camp awaiting the grand review at Washington which marked the close of the hostilities between the States. They have been printed in pamphlet form for private circulation heretofore, but now appear for the first time arranged conneetcdly and with such criticism and correction as official rccoids have made necessary to make them a competent lec-I ord of that most dashing of campaigns in i the history of the country perhaps, Val-i uable as a historical record, the volume ! has also the merit of a personal story charmingly and unaffectedly toJd that will make it of interest not only to the participants in tho campaign, but to those thousands of others who like to read the stories ot battles fought aim victories won._
The volume is dedicated to rj«'n, J, Watts de Peyster, who edited and published what the author mod*'Stly refers to as " these not^s.’’ It would he a gr^at thing for historians and the rundinK public generally if other men who make “ notes ” would make them so complete, so personal. a.nd so interesting.
