Snmoiliirif; in the nature of an experiment is being1 attempted in the issue of the present volume. The sermons included herein are not literature, they are extempore speeeh; they an* face to I'ae^ teaching and exhortation addressed , to an audiei’ee which, at the time, and to the preacher. consisted as it were of but one individual. They arc human dooumctils culled forth by living human experiences. Kvcry oil'* of these sermons came into existence because some on*- asked for it vir .-.oin-* life story suggested it.
Thus writes Reginald J. Campbell, a minister of the City Temple, London, in his n< w volume of sermons " addressed to individuals.*' (Crown Svo. Pp. XJS. New York:	A. C. Armstrong &
Son. St.-”* net. Twelve cents postage ) The eighteen sermons are entitled:
