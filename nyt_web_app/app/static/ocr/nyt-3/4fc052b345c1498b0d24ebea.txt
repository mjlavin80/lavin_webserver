Mr. Jacobs, who reviewed for us so cleverly a fortnight ago the biography of the Rev. Sydney Smith by G. W, E. Russell, replies vigorously and finally this week to his critics who objected to his small estimate of the famous clerical wit as a man of letters. There seems to be no stable ground for further discussion of this subject. Smith surely was not a " man of letters ” in the sense in which the reviewer ased the phrase, or in which it has been hitherto applied in the selection of subjects for the books in the series Mr. Morley edits. Mr. Jacobs’s point of view is perfectly understandable, and his reasoning is thoroughly sound.
