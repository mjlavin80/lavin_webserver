The novelists of this hour, like the workers In i every other field, must reckon with the hosts of an *' unripe democracy/' to use an expression of Dr. j Felix Adler's. It is well for them to sruard against all possible misconceptions which am JikeJy to be formed in the growing but still immature miDd of that democracy. Better, therefore. lake the chances of weakening somewhat the illusion of a carefully planned, well-told story than needlessly run the risk of incurring charges of plagiarism founded on widespread misconceptions. This unripeness of democracy, which is affecting both literature and art in these days, temporarily as we all hope, and to the infinite betterment of both in the time to come, is also having its effect in religious matters, according ' fJr. Adler, Modern conditions of life, he declares, i* mi *• to cheapen the individual and to magnify the masses,” and as “ the belief in immortality rises and ebbs, according as we prize the individual man or hold him cheap," there Is an ebb just now in the belief in immortality. This suggestive passage occurs in one of the recent addresses of Dr. Adler, which is,- in effect, a searching and able review of Dr. Metchnikoff*s remarkable book, ’* The Nature of Alan," which has been aptly described as an experiment in " yellow science." Dr. Adler's address is published for free distribution by the Ethical Culture Society, at 33 Central Park West.
