may seem harsh td say at the outset that the late Mr.
F.	G. KUton’s book on " Tho Dickens Country ” is less charming, and, therefore, jess welcome,. .than Mr. Lewis ' Melville’s on ’* The Thackeray Country," Mr. Charles G. Harper’s on “The Ingoldsby Country” and “The 1 Hardy Country," and. other volumes in i * 1 1 * * 1 ' The Pilgrimage Series, which' Messrs. A. J and C. Black publish in Londoiv and the Macmillan Company import. The Dickens book is as handsome as any of the others. It contains fifty fuli-page pictures, including some comparatively rare portraits of the novelist, views of nearly all the houses in which he dwelt, and of places associated with his life and writings.	.
The introduction is a sympathetic obituary notice by Arthur Waugh of Mr. Kitton, who was a good deal of a man in a plodding way, and died at the age of forty-eight years beloved, as it seems, by all who knew him. But Kitton was hardly of the Dickens stature, and this little essay on his work, able and tasteful as it
is, occupies a place in this new booh on “ Dickensland ’"which might well have been given up to a brief account of the many earlier books on the same subject, like Mr, Melville's preface to his Thackeray book.
Mr. Kitton was the author and editor of many books relating to Dickens, such as “ Charles Dickens by Pen and Pencil,”
“ Dickens and His Illustrators,'' " Charles Dickens: His Life, Writings, and Personality,” “ Dickeneiana,” and a collection of '
D,j£kens’s verses. A fond student of the great novelist, a careful reviewer, and a painstaking curator and librarian in the Hertfordshire town of St. Albans, (asso-' ciated with memories of Lord Bacon and John Jarndyce,) Mr. Kitton was obsessed by the idea that he was born to correct the errors of John Forster. Now, there are many errors of judgment, undoubtedly, and some trifling errors of fact as well in Forster’s authorized biography of his friend. But <he errors of both kinds which Mr. Kitton has pointed out are inconsiderable, after all. Forster's biography will do as It is yet awhile, and When the time comes for a new, annotated edition " upon the scale,” as Mr. Waugh says, “of Birkbeck Hill’s moriumental - Boswell ” we have no doubt the right man will easily be found to do it. Of course, he will not fail to avail himself-of “all
,	•	-	-t'	O.
the fruits of Mr. Kitton’s profitable research.” We are afraid he will find most of these fruits small and dry.

Mr. Kitton was, in truth, a man of facts and figures, a very Gradgrind among literary critics. It seems that poor John Dickens and his poor family dwelt in Hawke Street, Portsea, after removing from CommerciaV Hoad, Portsmouth, and before departing for London. This is not a very important fact, but it was overlooked by Forster, and is made much of by Kitton. This book on " The Dickens Land " is a chronicle of a hundred such facts. It recounts all of Dickens's known' movements from his birth to his death, all his little journeys and bis long ones, and the personages of his imagination are treated of only incidentally. There is a great deal of evidence sifted, to be sure, as to whether this or that inn, this or that villa or cottage, is the original of one mentioned in a certain passage of a certain book, but the argument frequently bores ihe reader.
It is a good book to have by you, if you aFe fond of Dickens ^nd want to keep ctoi-ely in touch with the facts of his life. The reader feels sure he may rely on the facts. If the author had lived to correct the proofs Smike’s name would not have been transformed lo Snipe in one place, and one or two other slight errors would have been missing. Tnere is a useful index.	^
Jt seems to us that the charm of such a book, slight an*J unimportant enough as literature, should lie in a sympathetic and picturesque association of the famous characters of fiction with real places and real men and women. The author of '• The Dickens Country ” felt the burden of fact strongly every step of his journey. Theresa re sunlit passages and there are no laby- ! rinths. The book is coherent and aceu-rate. But it does not reawaken one's-! dormant admiration fbr" the author of .

-us a little too muclb of the less agreeable ’ side of the man, and no one is likely to read it very eaeerly or to talk about it . much. Still, ats we have said, it has its eood points.
