It i? written by Gerald S. Davies of Charterhouse. Mr. Davies's wm k is 1 tine example of what a sympathetic, imaginative, and withal a learned man may produce from very slender accepted data. Scarcely anything is actually known concerning the life of Hals except that it was a very gay one. Still, in the twent y-eight pages which precede the critical and historical examination of Hals's canvases there m nothing to show that our author has misplaced his sympathy or misused his imagination and knowledge. In other words, the reader has no difficulty in separating what is hi;,tory from what is theory and supposition; and it is all very interesting. Such phrases as ** in all probability.” “ it is reasonable to suppose,” ” lacking trustworthy information, it may be suggested.” and the like introduce observations which, through Mr. Davies's pen, may be qnythiiser but dull reading.
Our author touehes the keynote In Frans Hals'y artistic career when ho points out that he was the first of the Dutch school to introduce Tree, bold treatment with a facility of execution which Was very wonderful. He was the first, too, to depict character rather than features of the moment, and the humors at that—until at length his need of ready money and his ready execution caused him to substitute the ebaoche for the finished picture. As sketches, however, his later efforts are masterpieces.
There are thirty-five half-tone reproductions of some of Hals’s best-known paintings, and the frontispiece is a photogravure of hie “ Laughing Cavalier/* Among the pictures are portraits of men and women, Pieter Tiarck, Cornelia and Maria.
