Samuel Merwin's story of " The Private Car Abuses,'* recently so much talked about, is the news feature of the April number of Success. Mr. Merwin explains what the practical effect of these abuses is upon tho consumer, and has otherwise some exceedingly startling, not to say gruesome. things to coffitnunicfltc. “ Across Europe in a Balloon " is an interesting contribution of a more cheerful sort by Comte Henry de la Vaulx (translated by Ernest R. Holmes,) and “ A Mouse for a Monarch " is a *‘ veracious chronicle of a struggle with a woman's suffrage movement tit its flood tide." Cleveland Moffett pursues his campaign ag'fiin^t “ The Shameful Misuse of Wealth " in a paper on “ What We Waste Oil Clothes and F'gtes.” James I-luneker has an article on George Bernard Shaw, " the most talked of literary man of his day." Another'article concerns “The Kingly Fisherman.’* (otherwise the kingfisher.) and another, by Marguerite Hroukiii, deals with “ Mrs. Fiske's Strug-with the Theatrical Trust.”
