I A wife of eight years, adored by her | husband since they were boy and girl together, suddenly discovers that he Is the father of a mulatto baby a few months younger than her own second child. Her loathing of the man, her forgiveness Just before his opportune death a few months later, his reinstatement in her heart, are disposed of in a few pages. How she tried to do her duty to the alien child, and with what success, Is the real motif of the book* There is an Interesting account of the development of the phosphate region of Tennessee, and a little romance, after the usual order, bpt tho reader’s interest is centred upon tl*e character and fate of “ Viry,'* born to the saddest heritage possible to a -sensitive spirit. Her mother being " three parts white,’* the girl was a negro but in name; her affiliation was with the superior race; her doom was to be relegated to the inferior, which, with all the energy of her being, she hated and despised. Her excellent education, given at negro schools, was a torture to her; her one possible career as a teacher of that race seemed to her a degradationthe courtship of young negro men an insult unspeakable, Mrs. Hammond has well conceived and portrayed what is, perhaps, the moat difficult situation on earth. Mr. Howells, Mr. Harris, Mrs. Atherton, Archdeacon Brady, have all essayed a somewhat similar situation, treating it with an interesting divergence of result—Mr. Howells and Mr. Harris in their own kindly fashfons; Mrs. Atherton with a race scorn too strong to permit justice; Archdeacon Brady with a sense of the tragedy only. Mrs. Hammond translates into drama the bitterness of Prof. Du Bois*s "Souls of Black Folk,” save that '* Viry " has no sense of kinship with the negro—the race that is calling her is the white, and the white alone.
There are several grave faults in this strongly written story, chief of which is that the author has made the sin recorded in the Initial chapter almost Impossibly repulsive* It is an axiom that there is no surer moral antiseptic than a young man's pure love; if a man have a spark of decency, nothing that so absolutely drives out the beast within him as a true marriage. In every day, common sense life the inference from the discovery of such a sin as Philip Law ton’s would be, that this was not his only offense, but that his whole manhood had been gross and degraded. It was not a question of forgiveness on the part of his wife, but of the natural revolt of the spiritual against the beastly. One can far better comprehend the feeling of the wife in Mr. Phillpotts’e M Secret Woman ” than Margaret Lawton’s ultimate attitude toward an even more debased husband. The. path which Margaret points out to i " Viry,” the arguments she uses to convince her that "whatever is is right” i in her most piteous case, seem wholly in-| adequate to meet the need of such a i tortured soul. Mrs. Hammond shows ! acute perception when ** Viry ” declares that she would be willing to live with negroes and for negroes as a white teacher would do, 4* out to do it as if I were
one of them, to have no one suspect the difference, to have no sense of oneness with my own people to fall back upon It is nut a voluntary sacrifice; it is a tame submission to an enforced injustice.’' The trouble is that Margaret's kindly preachments do not, in any wise, meet tne case, and bring us no nearer the solution of the problem of " the mulatto factor '’—unless, indeed, to empha-tizt, it oe a groping step in the right direction.
The writer has a large heart and wide sympathies; she has told her story freely and well, treading both firmly and delicately upon difficult ground; but it is not easy to determine whether just such a tale is not better left untold. Its most repulsive features might have been softened without detriment to the interest of the plot, and with much advantage to the probabilities. As It stands, it would be decidedly unsafe to generalize from it in regard to the morals of Southern gentlemen or the sensibilities of the mixed race. Its author may be able to show a 1 fact for every incident, but. when facts arc exceptional and not typical, they are likely to lead to wrong conclusions. We are glad to note, however, that the sense of responsibility toward the child Of ihame, a sense so conspicuously lacking in 11 The Mettle of the Pasture,’ Is not wanting here. The author has written with sincerity and with a high purpose; and, although there are things regrettable in her book, and she has fallen short of her aim; she has done some, admirable work, and has achieved a* striking story* tjulte but of* the ordinary.	■
