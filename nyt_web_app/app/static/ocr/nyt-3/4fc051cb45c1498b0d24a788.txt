The Origin off Longfellow’s ** Evangeline M and Hawthorne's Rela-.	- tion to It.

Xnp York Times Book Review:
HE letter from " M, E. S.“ in The New York Times book Review adds an interesting sidelight on the history of the story of Longfellow's “ Evangeline," but does not in any way disprove the now well accepted fact that the poet obtained the theme from Nathaniel Hawthorne. In ■Hawthorne's journal, extracts from which were published by his wife some years alter his cVeath, there occurs, under
date or 1839, this entry: “ H. U C----------
heard from a French Canadian a story of a young couple in Acadie. On their marriage day all the men of the province were summoned to assemble in the church to hear a proclamation. When assembled
they were all seized and shipped off to be distributed through New England— among them the new bridegroom. His bride set off in search of him—wandered about New England all her lifetime, and at last, when she was old, she found her bridegroom on his deathbed. The shock was so great that It killed her likewise." —American Note Books, Vol. I., Page 203.
Eight or nine years later Longfellow wrote to Hawthorne as follows: *‘ My dear Hawthorne: I have been waiting and waiting in the hope of seeing you in Cambridge. *	*	* j have been meditating
upon your letter and pondering with friendly admiration your review of * Evangeline ' iii connection with the subject of which, that is to say, the Acadians, a literary project arises in my mind for you to execute. Perhaps I can pay you back in part your own generous gift by giving you a theme for story in return for a them*4 for song. It is neither more nor less than the history of the Acadians,
after their expulsion as well as before. Felton has been making some researches in the State archives, and offers to resign the documents into your hands.
“ Pray come and see me about it without delay. Come so as to pass a night with us. if possible, this week; if not a day and night. Ever sincerely yours,
■■ HENRY W. LONGFELLOW.'1
CJeorge Parsons Lathrop, Hawthorne's son-in-law, in his *’ Study of Hawthorne.” published in 1S7G (during Long-fello w's lifetime) states, Page 178. “ that ‘ Evangeline ' was written upon a theme suggested to Hawthorne (by a friend who had heard it from a French Canadian) and by him made over to the poet, has already been made public/'
Further than this, Thomas Wentworth Hig^inson, in his life of Longfellow in Ue American Men of Letters Series, states, Page 104,	■' The subject I Evan-
geline J was first suggested to Longfellow by Hawthorne, who had heard it from
his friend, the Rev*4 H. L. Conolly, and Hie outline of it will* be found in ‘The American Note Books ' of Hawthorne, who disappointed Father Tonally by not
using it himself. It was finished on
Longfellow's fortieth birthday."
Lastly, there is the long account published in this paper July 9, 1904—and which I thank the editor for bringing to my attention. I remembered perfectly having read the story, but could not place it, and made a fruitless search, as it did not occur to me to look in The Times Look Review.
Now it does not seem to me that the st.^ry advance by " M, H. S." it- incapable of bein^ reconciled, at least In part, with the accepted version of tlie source whence Longfellow obtained his theme.
Judge Simon, accepting the story of M. E. S." as true, merely recounted the story of the expulsion of the Acadians from Nova Scotia and the settlement of a portion of them in his native State. The real motif of the poem, however, lies in beautiful devotion of Evangeline to Gabriel, the story Hawthorne note 1 in his jourpal. The forcible expatriation of the Acadians made a fitting setting for this metii. hut of itself could never have furnished forth such a poem.
Not** also how in the letter already quoted. Longfellow offers Hawthorne as a theme, not Evangeline, but the Acadi-ans. I nd eed, -fr-ho distinction cannot be too sharply drawn between the history, well authenticated and generally known, of the Acadians, and the story of Evangeline. an unwritten legend.
U will be recalled that in his journal Hawthorne wrote that Evangeline " wandered about >f^w England all her lifetime." Longfellow, however, to make the popm more correct historically as well as to secure the advantage of a larger scene of action, takes his heroine over a large portion of tho Cnited States in her search for Gabriel. Louisiana is merely one of the many places where she so narrowly missed overtaking him. What more natural. therefore, than that Longfellow, when he began work on the por-m, should |
have remembered young Simon's story of the Acadian settlement in Louisiana and have written him in order to obtain a description of the country and the proper local coloring for that portion of the poem.	j
But, after all, the most convincing tcs- ^ tLnony in favor of Hawthorne’s having furnished the theme for the poem lies, to
my mind, in the fact that the claim was made long before Long-fellow died and was never denied by him.
