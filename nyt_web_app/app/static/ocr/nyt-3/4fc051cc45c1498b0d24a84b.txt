' Time of Kins Alex&tider the Great. By Robfert H. Fuller. One volume. Pp. viii.-4tMl. 'Svo. cloth. New York: The Macmillan Company. 51*00.
It is like renewing old acquaintances to read “ The Golden Hope." In the very first chapter three friends meet; and there we are with Aramis, Porthos, and Athos, not to speak of Mulvaney, Ortheris, and Learoyd, or of Stalky and Company. D’Artagnan *may be recognized in Alexander the Great, who comes along in. good time. A little later, say, a hundred pages or so, we find Nathan the Jew, Captain of the Guard of Darius, King of Persia; and our memory of the late Gen. L^w Wallace is sharpened by meeting i Daniel and even Prince Hur! Unfortunately this Frince is the son of King Azemilcus of Tyre, and dies In a chapter &r two, so probably he was not an ancestor of Ben-Hur.
Then we find traces of Bulwer and of William Ware and Dr. Ingraham—at least, we seem to, and the last chapter brings to mind that charming poem by Southey, that lay somewhere in the Fourth Reader and began:
It was a Summer evening, old Caspar’s wopk was done.
And he before his cottage door was sitting in the sun;	'
for the story ends with Clearchus and Artemisia, the chi*f hero and the chief hero- I ine, with their children around them, lis- | tening to ** Uncle Leonidas ** telling about the ‘i.famous victory " of Alexander at Gaugamela* There is a-plenty and more than a-plenty of slaughter, the companions of Alexander hew their enemies in two with the ease that belongs only tq the heroes of historical novels. And everybody is wholly proper—-even Thais, who at last discovers that she is the sister of the chief heroine, Artemisia. She and the, latter have h:id adventures enough to turn the hair of any one but a heroine quite white; but everything dries straight ” as it should in the end.
Altogether a famous story for those who like such stories. It is as good as many other historical novels of the day; but what would Harriet Martineau say, who wrote the first novel of the sort?	1
