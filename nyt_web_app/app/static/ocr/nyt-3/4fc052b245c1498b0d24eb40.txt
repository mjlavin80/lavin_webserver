If all Lne preily audacities of a uozcn very clever and beautiful and dislracimgly feminine and up-to-date young won.ta were boiled down and distilled you'd pet no doubt one of Mrs. Glyn's autobiographic* heroines. This Evangeline, though not without the serene egotism of lovely youth, is mighty good company. She has red hair anil her whole appearance suggests to gentlemen of vast experience (and ditto ladies) exciting and unconventional in>ssibilit ies. The Duke of Torquilsioue (who is a cripple and a cynic) declares plainly. “ I can only see red hair, green eyes, and a general look of the devil.’ He regards the young woman—whom his younger brother and heir, a man with an Othu Cushing figure, adores—with aversion and distrust. Evangeline tells her own story with many engaging airs of frankness and simplicity. Her mother, she explains. was " a person of no family at all," j for the reason that her grandparents tone ! of whom was an Karl) 11 forgot to marry.*’ ■ She was brought up bv a very worldly j and wealthy and high-placed old la J;., wiity and seliish, who designed the git J to be ht*r h^ir Only, at the last momi-nt, she said nothing about it in her will, pi c-ferring to request the lawful heir, a r.ia’i somewhat advanced in the diplomatic service of his country and not sentimental to marry the girl. Thus (as she explain. ) KvangeJinc linds herself an adventuress, a condition she defines. " after reading in a book all about it." as '* being nice-looking and having nothing to live on, and getting a pleasant time out of life." Previously to tin* old dames demise she is not "greatly acquainted with the wa>s v ■ t men.'' As she says in feminine fashion;
\\V nave pot had any (hat you could call that here, mm h—only a lot of old wicked rort of things in the Autumn to shoot the pliea sanls and play bridge. Some poli t iehi ns and Ambassadors and creatures of that sort; and mostly as wic ked as could he. They used to com11 trotting du\Mi tin- passage to the schoolroom and have tea with mademoiselle and m*- on the slightest provocation, and say such things’ I am sure lots of what they said meant something else, mademoiselle used to giggle so. She was rather a good-looking one | hod ttie last four years, but I hated her.
So the new heir, who is most distinguished looking, comes down to look at his inheritance—house, lands, and redhaired girl- and the vicissitudes of Kvan-giline begin. These are perhaps less exciting than alliterative, but they furnish all sorts of good material for Mrs. GlynVs peculiar talent for'making a picture of things, as they look (or you feel they , might look) to a clever girl whose natu-! ral goodness had never been warped by | the dull moialities of stupid middle class j or other Philistine persons. Dull props of virtue, such as ehurchgoing, curates, sew in p- for charities. looking solemn on t serious occasions, frowning on gayeties, did not appeal to Kvangoline. But she vv:is not less virtuous on that account. Men made	love to her,	of	course.	She
! liked it. of course, and looked up at them , under her	eyelashes in	a	manner	she
ohscrved maddened them; teased them i variously. The heir wanted to marry ; her. so did a handsome guardsman, and a puny little Stot. \ ery rich and ridiculous.
It appears	that Mrs. Glyn	doesn't	love
the Scots. She lias a very large and ob-jectiunable tamily of them, and sets J-’vungetitie down in the midst lo do pcn-a nee fnr a fortnight, and make innocent hut biting	observations	on	their weak-
nesses. Then \ here's a lovely married lady who !ike::	more than her share.
K\;t ngvlinc tries to behave like a gentleman to this siren about the possession of a man. Only tie man has his own \ iews and refuses to be disposed of in any such noble-minded fa-diion. The men are not half bad, and the book is full of cleverness. of course, like the rest of Mr?. Glyn's books. If it's not respectful to all conventions the very disrespeet has %
tonic quality. unci — all's well tliat ends well.	.
