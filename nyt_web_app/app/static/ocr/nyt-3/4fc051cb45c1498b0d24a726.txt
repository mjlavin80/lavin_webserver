How much more of attention is paid to I instruction in modern languages and literatures than was done in even the Immediate past is well exemplified in the Yale University Catalogue for 19W-5, a volume of 767 pages, just at hand from the press of Tuttle, Moorehouse & Taylor of New Haven, Conn. It requires seventeen closely printed pages to merely give the titles of the elective courses offered the undergraduates, while eleven more pages are required to catalogue the special courses provided for the graduate classes in these two lines alone. As showing so markedly the tendency in modern educational methods in even so conservative an Institution as Tale, where the elective system is a comparatively recent innovation, it is a matter worthy of note in a. publication of the character of The Saturday Review. Referring to the large increase in the number of courses !n English, the catalogue states that *' they have in view the development of insight and power no i lesa tKon the imparting of information.11 : To that *nd there are exhaustive courses ! *!TTI?eraTy criticism, in the theory of ! poetry, the theory of the drama, and the chief periods of English literature. Much ; the same policy is pursued in the lines i marked out for studies in the Romance ; and Germanic languages.
:	A	registration of 3,138 persons receiv-
; ing instruction in the various schools of the university from 391 professors and their assistants is shown. Subjects for the John A. Porter, the Townsend, the Ten Eyck, and other literary prizes are announced to be awarded at the commencement In June next, together with a mass of information relative to the libraries, museums, .and other means of assistance to scholarship within the control of the institution.
