LITERARY "W EEKLIES
We have already spoken of the change of owners which has put The Academy of London again formidably
V	6
in the field of competition with the
other high-class London weeklies. The house of George Newnes, Limited, which now controls The Academy, deals in a large-handed and broad-minded way with literature of various grades. It is responsible for that pioneer of " snippets" called Tidbits, as well as for The Strand Magazine and the new cheap monthly without pictures, The Grand Magazine. These appeal directly and strongly to the prevailing taste of the lower middle-class Britons, estimable folks who, according to a recent English immorist, habitually dine in the lower middle of the day, On the other hand this enterprising corporation publisher The Westminster Gazette, the best of the London evening newspapers, and many books for the ' most cultivated readers, including the ] admirable Caxton series of reprints, and it has now taken steps to put its recent acquisition, The Academy, on the same literary and intellectual level as The London Saturday Review and j The Spectator.
i The number of The Academy dated ; March 11 is of the same size and shape as those older weeklies, and also re-
i sembles them typographically. The blue covers have gone, and with them the weekly's recent sub-title, Literature. Mr. Morgan Richards, the former owner of The Academy, bought Literature from the owners of The London Times, and united it with his own review, so that the memory, at least, of the late Mr. Traill’s aspiring but ill-starred venture was kept alive until a fortnight ago.
But these purely mechanical changes are, after all, of slight importance. The Academy has not dropped the name of Literature as a first step toward disconnecting itself with the subject. Its aim now, we infer, is to get away from vivid and pictorial ” writing to more “ stately and formal language." The editor recalls that a great change came over British public taste in “ the early eighties, when the influence, of American journalism began to make itself
felt.” Then writers revolted, "new
journalists" upset traditions, stately and formal language gave place to slang and colloquialisms, and the “ better class journalism ” decayed. Signed
articles and the personal “I" Sand '* impressionism ” invaded the field. We infer that the editor of The Academy believes the day of these lamentable things is now passing, that there is to be a reawakening of culture. He sees around him, in London, signs of “ the revival of the first-class weekly paper,”
This is all very interesting. But, setting aside the favorite British theory of the debasing transatlantic influence of American journalism, we fancy that London weekly journalism began to fall away when the competition of London daily journalism in its own field became too strong for it. The remark- | able development of the daily newspaper is one of the striking facts of the |
last quarter century In England as well as in this country. If the “ first-class weekly newspaper ” is to be revived successfully it must fill a place which the dailies do not already fill. In its I vigorous effort to do so The London Academy, under its new management,
has our best wishes.
As for " formal and stately language ” (we trust we are not taking the Academy too seriously in dwelling on these words,) a little of it will^go a great way, while essays likely to suit all or many moods in the same moment are hard to find. Even Elia only appeals strongly to one who is just in the mood for Elia, and would never immediately satisfy, a “ large circulation.” A book review is, after all, a review of a book, and one written 1 Lord Avebury, William Archer, Prof. Gilbert Murray, Sidney Low, cr Henry Nevinson for a weekly paper is not likely to differ in form or Quality from one written by any one of these gentlemen for a daily paper. We are speaking In accord with the best English opinion when we say that *the very best purely “ literary weekly ” in England at the present moment is the Friday supplement of The London Times, a daily newspaper. Modesty compels us to refrain from naming the best “ literary weekly ’* in this country. But it, too, is a supplement to a daily newspaper, and an achievement of daily journalism.	,
