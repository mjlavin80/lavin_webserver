Many have been the guidebooks since the time of veracious Sir John Mande-ville. “ Tho Mediterranean Traveler," by
the Rev. I>. E. Lorenz, has a just claim for favor, for the excellence of its method and treatment of the many countries bordering on the great interior sea of Europe are unquestionable. It is as its subtitle designates, “ a handbook of practical information.” In the usual " Guide Book ” much space is given to places about which nobody cares. The volume under notice is specially prepared for persons “ who visit only the important sea-
coast cities, (except the inland places of such countries as the Holy Land, Egypt, Italy, and Southern Spain, which are described,) the many places in the interior to which the ordinary guidebooks devote much the greater part of their space."
