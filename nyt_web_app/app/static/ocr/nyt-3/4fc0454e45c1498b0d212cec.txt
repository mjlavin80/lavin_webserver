HS new volume of “ The Jew-l\ ish Encyclopaedia,” t h </ ninth of the twelve, opens with /ii record of the Mar--awczyk family of Polish scholars that flourished during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and closes with tfie . 'Philippson family of German authors and ^ scientists, who rose to fame in the eight-ecnth and nineteenth centuries. Of the
■	<500 .editors and collaborators engaged on
'	this work, 153 have written articles for
this volume. It contains 215 illustrations /of the 2,0*)D, and" treats of 1.308 topics in its 700 pages. Some of the most important articles are from the pen of Rabbi Kaufmann Kohler, President of the Hebrew Union College at Cincinnati, nnd > Rabbi Emeritus of Temple Beth-El of this dity. As the member of the editorial :	.board in charge of the departments' of
:	theology^and	philosophy, vhis views as ex-
pressed in the articles on the New Tcsta-ment, Nomism, and the Pharisees, represent the opinions of the most advanced students of Jewish history and theology. His son, Max J. Kohler, has written on I	New York with Cyrus L. Sulzberger. He
I.	also shared the labor of the article on
Newport. Joseph Jacobs, the revising editor, formerly President of the Jewish Historical Society of England, has con; densed a whole book on/the Pentateuch into the few pages allotted to this topic. Another of the board who has contributed to Volume IX. is Rabbi Emil G. Hirsch» who is in charge of the department of the Bible, and his principal article in this volume is the Passover. Frank H. Vize-telly is the author of the life sketches Of .	Adolph S. Ochs, publisher of The New
York Times, and his brother, George, publisher of The Public Ledger, Philadelphia. Two other members of the board have joined in writing the article on periodicals, nearly eighty columns long, full of reproductions of newspapers and magazines; over fifty columns of this article give a condensed list showing iiv& single line each the title, language, country, and periods of issue, the place of publication, date, and editors, characteristics, &c.. of many hundred Jewish periodicals. The authors are Jaoth professors of Semitic languages at Columbia—Dr. Richard Gott-heil, editor of the department of history, and William Popper, associate revising . editor and chief of the bureau of translations.
History, music, and biography are the three departments most fully represented in this volume. Between its covers are ncludod such topics as New Orleans, New. port, New York, and Philadelphia; Paris, Padua, and Palestine; Nagasaki, Morocco, the Netherlands, and Navarre. When reading the articles on towns in Russia, as Moscow, Novgorod, and Odessa, with their records of the great and varied activitv of the Jews as exporters, physi-■ * *
clans, financiers, the bitter persecutions to which they are eternally subjected seem economic crimes oven from the standpoint of a Plehve or a' Sergius. The many topics that bear on the ceremonial music of the synagogues and the article, Music, were penned by Rabbi F. L. Cohen, Chief Minister, Sydney, New South Wales. Besides a critical study of the growth of . the temple music in the hands of the cantors, there are pages of words and notes of psalms, hymns, and prayers, sung or
intoned at the service. A beautiful ex- 1 I ample is the Neilah, or fifth and last service on the Day of Atonement.	.
The article dealing with Moses occupies twenty-eight columns, is written by three different editors, who treat respectively of the Biblical data, the stories in the rabbinical literature and in that of the Greeks, and the critical view, which last concludes to believe not only in the reality of Moses as a historical character, but in the reality of his magnificent work. There are two illustrations, one showing the traditional tomb, the other a picture of Moses on Mount Sinai from the Sarajevo Haggadah (Prayer Booki of the fourteenth century.
The sketch of Moses ben Maimon, known as Maimonidos, occupies twenty-sbrcolumns; in this are included two full-■, page reproductions of leaves from his works, and a portrait in Arabic costume. Maimonides was a Talmudist, philosopher, astronomer, and physician, born at Cordova in ll.T*, died at Cairo in 1204. He was medical adviser to Saladin, declined Richard Coeur-de-Lion's offer to *fill the saipe post for him, became the official head of the community at Cairo, and wrote many very noteworthy books. His philosophical work " Moreh Nebukim ” became of extraordinary importance, not only for the rational development of Juda-' iam, but for the history of philosophy in the Middle Ages. His immediate suc-

cessor was the Spanish Talmudist and exegete, Moses NahmaiiMes, who died Jji , Palestine-about 12T0 at the age of seventy-six, whose last and most important work -was a commentary of the Pentateuch, of -which- a page from the first Lisbon edition (US9) is reproduced.
" Morbidity and Mortality*" .by Ur. Maurice Fisliberg, surgeon to Beth Israel Hospital/ gives many long tables which j condense into a few pages the prodigious 1 labor of sifting the world’s vital statistics to see why the ghettos - do not kill off the Jews. “ Names and Pseudopyms " is a long and very interesting study ’by ‘ JO* seph Jacobs. ** The Names of God,” a* fruitful source of controversy among the Jews, as well as an Index of their wanderings, is treated at length by 'J. F. Me-Laughlin of Toronto. Dr. Kaufmann Kohler’s articles on the New Testament take upveach of the Gospels in turn, the Acts and, the Pauline Epistles. ^ , -
Nineveh, the city of Sennacherib’ and Assurbanipal, is described by J. F. McCurdy, professor of Oriental languages at the University College, Toronto, one of the American Board of Consulting Editors, and author of “History, Prophecy, and the Monuments.’' Nippur, one of the oldest cities in the world at present to be identified by name and situation, is described by the same scholar. There is also a large photograph of the excavations of the Temple of Bel made by Prof. Hilprecht. “ Numismatics," written by Th. Reinach, ex-President Soci6t£ des Etudes Juivcs, Is valuable because of the thorough manner in which all Jewish , coins have been catalogued and pictured; j the great number of counterfeits arc exposed here, too. Prof, DentsclTof the Hebrew Union College describes the Oath 1 More Judalco, with a picture of a man of Breslau standing barefooted, partially disrobed, on the skin of a pig; this curious and degrading custom, once nek'rly universal, persisted in Germany until iSfiO, while there aro traces of it in Roumanla to-dajv Palestine, the ancient home of the Jews, the goal of the Orthodox and tho Zionists, is a very long article by Dr. Benzinger o< the University of Beylin; it is very fully illustrated by pictures, plans, and maps. The frontispiece of the volume is a large map showing the physical features of the- country, joined to another of ancient Palestine that gives both anc!ent and modern names. The article itself contains ten more, including one in Hebrew characters dated 10!>5.
Of the names familiar to modern readers this volume has men of letters like Max NoraaUt composers like Jacques Offenbach, ex-Minister of War for Italy Gen. Giuseppe Ottolenghi. who died last November, and Henri Ollendorf, the inventor of a system of teaching languages. 1 A convert from Judaism was Johann 1 Pfefferkorn In the reign of Maximilian, who led the fight for the Dominicars against Reuchlin for the Humanists. More steadfast In his faith, in fact he was horribly executed In 17ftS because he would not abjure it, was Suss Oppenheim, the Gouverneur Morris of the Duke of Wurtemberg; several contemporary prints show how he came to his end. The article on New York is of striking importance; this town contains a larger Jewish population than any other city in the worlds Max J. Kohler as one of the authors, has filled the sixty-five columns with maps, plans, photographs of schools, synagogues, and eleemosynary institutions, besides inserting a very large colored folding mat> of Greater New York with a classified list of places of Jewish interest marked upon' it. There are five daily papers, five theatres, thirty synagogues,
1 seven clubp, three (closed) cemeteries,
nine home3 and hospitals, and many edu-
catidnal and charitable institutions, nearly all privately supported. Newport, now famous for its fashions, was once a busy hive of industry: until the Revolutionary War it surpassed New York as a commercial centre; Mr. Kohler describes the part played by the Jews in the development of the Rhode Island capital. In 165S fifteen families landed there from Holland, bringing with them the first three degrees of Masonry: in 174.> Rodrigues Rivera introduced the manufacture of sjierm oil, of which Newport had tl*e monopoly until the British came and seized the whaling fleet and burned the refineries. Aaron Lopez, later the merchant prince of New England, came to the town In 17r»0; Ezra Stiles, the famous President of Yale, said of him that “ for honor and extent of commerce, he was probably surpassed' by no merchant in America/' Fourteen years after his arrival the town had 150 vessels engaged in the West Indian trade alone. Touro Stroct and Touro Park are named after the first rabbi of the old synagogue, which still 1 stands, a fund for Its maintenance having been bequeathed by ihe sons of the rabbi.
' A holograph of a letter from President George Washington to the congregation is inserted in the volume. Paris, with its | (3,001) Jews and its bloody record, has ! many handsome temples, half a dozen of
which are pictured here. Philadelphia, about half as large as Paris, lias 75,000 Jews; the illustrations show great hospitals here as well as beautiful synagogues. The Quaker .City has always had distinguished Jews, and is to-day the headquarters of the Jewish Publication Society (jf America. .
