Vol. XII. of ” Early Western Travels.’’ | contains the continuation of " Faux's [ Memorable Days in America,'' with I “ Welby’s Visit lo North America.” In j a former notice the first portion of j Faux's book was discussed. He started I cn his second trip Jan. 1, 1K20, leaving Princeton. Louisville was reached Jan.
At Zanesville Faux began his return j trip and before the close of the month t was at Pittsburg, which he calls " the Birmingham of America.-1 He mentions I the purchase of a buffalo robe which j cost him five dollars, and writes: “ When Kentucky was first settled buffalos were shot by the settlers m?rely for their tongues, the carcass and the shin being thought worth nothing were left where the animal fell.” In Washington he attended Congress and was much pleased with a speech of Mr. Randolph. Henry Clay he describes as follows:
He is tall, thin, and not a very nuscu-lar man: his gait is stately, but swinging, and his countenance, while it Indicates genius, denotes dissipation, * * * Though there is want of rapidity and fluency in his (locution, yet he has a great deal of fire and vigor in his expression. When he speaks ho Is full of animation and earnestness; bin face brightens, his eye ben ms with additional lustre, and his whole figure indicates that he is entirely occupied with the subject on which his eloquence is employed.
Returning to New York he tells of : ” passing over to Brooklyn, a beautiful, pay looking village of great extent in j Long Island.” Fiver on his travels, Faux ! was at Washington again, and goes to Mount Vernon. He notes that the approach to the house “ is marked by negro huts, and negroes of all ages, male and female. In the General's time all was well managed, particularly the farm and gardens. Me, the Cincnmatus of his time, was up early and always vigilant, Now all is ruin, and ruin personified mourns for him.” Faux took ship at A lexandria and returned to England.
Adlard Welby was from Lincolnshire and visited the I'nited Slates in	and
1.S20. lie left- Margate and arriv ed at New York after a long voyage. He visited the settlements of iriirkbeck and Flower. The looks of the New Yorkers of 1819 he did not admiie. ** Almost every face,” he writes, “ expresses the game of desperate speculation.” The reason he gives is that " the people here, like those in England, w i ■ i * * beyond measure extravagant under the deceitful prosperity and they now doubly feel the dreadful reaction.” Wcl-by visited tin two English settlements in Illinois an 1 was not satisfied with appearances there. There were no comforts. Some of the settlers declared they had to work ” like horses.” and there were no returns. Welby intimates that deception had been used to lure the English. With the German settlement of Harmony he was delighted. He writes: “ Nothing short , of a pun religious principle (certainly not j worldly inter* st) could keep such a com- i tnunity in harmonv. TM*1 colony is (‘(imposed chi< fly of poor Cicrmans, who have ; fled from it despotic C.ovi rnm«>nt to enjoy 1 quietly in tnis n'inoie scene their re- ! ligion and ^tjje fnnt« of their labor.-.” Coming bark, by v*ay of Washington, he visited 11 ’* Pr*'si.lent,
Wr fo.md Mr. Munroe sealed at his i bureau with various papers before him. ' He arose at our entrance, and himself : placed chairs for us. which his independent servant had left tlie room without so dnin^. Mr. Munroe appeared a plain, quiet man in dress and manners, the lOnglish country gentleman with a physiognomy which bore marks of deep reilec-tiun. A conversation of ten minules on different subjects terminated our visit, wln n instead of formal etiquette he gave me a friendly shake of the hand wilh a “find bless you.” spoken in a pleasing : tone, which left upon me a very favonr- 1 able impression.
As to the American women, those '.:v-inji in New York and Philadelphia, Mr. : Wrlby w.is far from f>-ini? eornplimen-tai y_ Tht-ir #Ood looks; he does not ijLleS-tion, but " they nre brought up eniin ly j ignorant of every domestic duty, they .ire sent to some cook or confectioner a** : pupils to ]-arn ecomnny and mak«* pastry. and after a iiraetice in tarts. che*se-! cakes, bonbons for a few weeks, are de- J ciiired fit to jndertake the important 1 , concerns of a wife wild mother-is il then surprising that with minds so pre- ! pared for frivolity they should be bent alone-upon extravagant and childish decoration of their persons, which, to-1 gethei* with this total ignorance of domes-tie economy, is forever bringing their ! husbands to bankruptcy?
