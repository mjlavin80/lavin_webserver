In his later years Mr. Gosse knew Patmore well and was often at his bouse In Hastings. It was then that tl.e man was
most interesting, (though m°stof^ work bad been done.) and it is this Fat more whom Sargent painted and whom the world is likely to	”***,
than the earlier Patmore of the AngM In the House,*' the laureate of Marriea Love," the man of whom Walter Savage Landor wrote; •• I rejoice to find that poetry has come out again safe, and that l“7has dipt his wings and cooled his tender feet in our own pure streams-
Espousals '• (published in I806) called forth this praise, while Carlyle caBed •• a beautiful little piece; pure, in°eni®’ • fine." Those were the days of the l and beautiful Mrs. Patmore-Emily Augusta; she that was painted by Sir John Millais, modeled by Thomas Woolner. and described in verse by Robert and with whom the poet lived In a fas ion well-nigh ambrosial for fifteen year* never ceasing to delight (as he said^ en in the very shadow of her death) In » all her patient, persistent goodness, her absolutely flawless hfe, ^nd aU h amiable and innocent graces. Af there were two other Mrs. Patmores. The first of these ladies, bom By lea. vears older than himself,) he met m Rom. knd married just at the time when he em braced the Catholic faith That was m 1864 Emily Patmore had died in Miss Bylcs, who was wealthy, ( ^ was “ exceedingly annoyed and abashed at this circumstance,) said at first tha she had vowed not to marry, but afterward obtained a dispensation from hei vow It is related of her that " her husband’s loud protestations and emphasis of Statement kept her in a P«P«"£ tremor, but she was entirely devoted to love and admiration of him."
The youthful Patmore (he was born m 1823) g^ts rather sarcastic treatment from Mr Gusse. The boy was scandalously spoiled by a doting grandmother and a father whose reputation was so ill that Thackeray at first declined to "touch the hand of the son of tiiat murderer.^
\s to the poet's own accounts of his boyhood, rather flattering to himself, they must be “translated out of Pat-morese," for while ne had a "genuine passion for truth," he iiad also a " constitutional tendency to emphasis. 1 It is recorded that '* he was an agnostic until iits eleventh year," when, he says,
“ it struck me what an exceedingly fine thing it would be if there really was ® God." He read widely, confining himself largely to choice passages marked for him by his father, but making a complete «?tudy*of Shakespeare. His first "Poems by Coventry Patmore." were published in 18W. and his disreputable father thought them magnificent. At that time also or thereabout he met Browning and Tennyson. Of the latter, of whom lie saw much between 1S45 and 1852:
He said (afterward) that he had wasted vear« in following Tennyson about like I dog " and that he had gained nothing from the sacrifice. He used to declare that Tennyson had never really cared about him. but had merely accepted his companionship to escape from his own thoughts; that Tennyson’s conversation hml alwsvs b*en egotistical and useless, ?nd that Patmore in devoting himself to flip company had been worshipping an
empty idol.
Patmore married Emily Augusta Andrews in 1847. We have spoken already oi her and of the poem they lived. It
was with her for InspIraUon.that ho wrote “ The Angel In the House.” -
“The siren woman he said had often been sung. *v* * hut thalt jo\
which, as he affirmed, all the loves ce
tre, with that woman who is the rgnt ful sustairier of them all. the inspira
tion of youth, the consolation of age-tnat
love and that woman, he assertea, n seldom been sung-sincerely and. effectual ly.M	*	'
, The poem, as Mr: Gosse admits, is writ 1 ten in a “ measure of the most humdrum I simplicity," even " garrulous " and “ prat-thng,’* but selected by the poet deliberate-I ly and in part at least justified by its resuits. The story of it is singularly hi-i nocuous,’* dull, insipid, like the fashion! able novel of the time, but in it, in spite of the form, the " commonest metre or i humble hymns and ballads that has ever been invented ” are the lyrical passages and delicate and noble fancies which m^cle Carlyle speak of the part called “The
Espousals” as hfe did. Most critics jeered. By 1858, nevertheless, “The Angel in the House ” had been ** reprinted and admired in America, and transatlantic praise reverberated advantageously in the London bookshops.’* Its marvelous popular success (it sold something like a quarter of a million copies) is a part of literary history though it is apt to be forgotten in this ’generation of a different taste.
Mr Gosse gives a curious account of Patmore’s brief first widowerhood and how he tried to apply his ideal standards to the conduct of his motherless children, whose 41 little wayward errors took on monstrous proportions to this austere idealist.” The not unfamiliar ode called “ The Toys,” wonderfully sincere, beautiful, and human, he quotes in full to give
a last touch to this picture.
Again Mr. Gosse quotes from the later Catholic poems the fragments of the great work in which this poet had in mind daringly to link human love and divine - The Unknown Eros,” to be dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, and tl.e boldly conceived and, in parts at least, entirely beautiful “ Amelia,” published in 1877-8. In form this is very different poetry from “The Angel in the House,” hut the lyrical qualities which give it its strange charm are the same.
, However, in Patmore, the poet of love, you miss the grim,, violent, and fantastic humors of Patmore the man. He was fond of writing epigrams and lampoons like this;
Science, the agile ape, may wen .
Up in his tree thus grin and grind lUrf
teeth : At us beneath.
The wearers of Hie bay and asphodel,
I Laughing to be his butts, j And gathering up for use his ill-aimed
j cocoanuts.
Mr. Gosse says (and by plentiful conversational instances establishes it) this of Patmore:"
He was mischievously contradictory, paradoxical, and arbitrary, and he had a violent hatred for " sentimental faddists, humanitarians, anti-tobacconists, and teetotalers.” Yet he could be extremely sentimental himself; he was gentle and indulgent to animals; and few men of his generation indulged more sparingly in the legitimate stimulus of wine. In nil these movements he saw an interference with personal freedom of action. He was like the late Archbishop Magee; he would rather see England free than England sober.
A devout Catholic, (in his later years,) he was yet singularly outspoken about ecclesiastical persons. He expressed frequent scorn of priests, and particularly hated Cardinal Manning, whom he called
th’at^worst 4yp^in';hi3tdry of th6 priest-ridden' atheist/1* “ All poets and. prophets have hated priests as a class,” he wrote. Moreover:
He did not scruple to invent Catholic legends, some of which are now, we are told, in steady circulation among the devout. In particular, I remember a story about the dormouse who was created with a naked tail like a rat, ;^ut who, seeing Adam and Eve eating the apple, and being conscious of a sinful longing, pressed what tail he had to eyes
and shut out temptatton. He wa^ instantly rewarded'by a *ot	‘iJX
brush which has been the pride or nis descendants. This Patmore invented, ch-
so*a at*’ least, he Jffhmed-of Ss it
adopted into’works of Catholic tradition. Mr. Gosse adds:
It is entertaining to those who knew -Coventry Patmore well to hear him conjectured of by those who never saw him as “ mild ” or “ namby-pamby. In of fact, he was the most masterful or
men. .	-
Patmore designed at one time, by tnc way, to make Gosse his literary executor, and not the least interesting thing in the present volume is the account of the destruction of the manuscript of the poet’s Sponsa Dei, a deed for which his priestly advisers were responsible. Mr. Gosse admits that the subject and treatment were “ audacious,” but he thinks the scruple which destroyed it simply deplorable; the burning involved a distinct loss to literature.” He concludes that " there is no reason why Patmore s fame
should be less durable than that of Ten nyson and Arnold, although it mus. always be smaller and of a radiance less extended.” The unscliolarly will object in the first place to the linking of Tennyson and Arnold and Patmore (dead only since 18SHJ) is already forgotten by the multitude who adored him in the middle of the century but Mr. Gosse's biography is sufficient proof that both the man and much cf the poetry deserve to be remembered.
