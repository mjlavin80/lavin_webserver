As a novel Mr. Wise’s book. While it contains some excellent material, will not hold the average reader’s attention. But it is only ostensibly a novel. It is rather a personal explanation, and as such will interest persons who know who Mr. Wise is. Such persons are somewhat numerous, for the expatriated Virginia politician has been something of a public character —a Congressman—even a candidate for Governor—and has made talk. This is mentioned merely as a warning to people who may not know Virginia or Mr. Wise, and may not therefore care for a book which contains with a little mild romance a great deal of strong local Virginia poll* tics—and this politics of a generation ago.
On the surface " The Lion’s Skin ” is the life history of Powhatan Carrington of Virginia. Carrington was only nineteen years old when the Confederacy went to pieces, but he had already, like many of his age, borne arras and won a commission. After the war he studied law at the University of Virginia, married a pretty and very serious girl from the North, and settled down in Richmond to practice his profession and pursue politics. Gradually he drifted (and Mr. Wise attributes to him in this matter the highest motives) into being a Republican instead of a Democrat, selecting for the moment of adopting his new faith a time when, justly or unjustly, the mere name Republican was as a stcnch in the nostrils of hfs fellow-townsmen. After that these fellow-townsmen were so ungracious that he found it pleasanter to leave Richmond and remove with his family to ever-tolerant New York. There the story leaves him, prosperous exceedingly, with a most cosmopolitan exterior, clubs, carriages; surrounded by a family of sons who have gained glory in the Spanish-American war. Even'his South- 1 ern accent is gone, though he persists fn ® having negro servants. That's all there is to the story.
For people who know Virginia, whatever view they take of Carrington's career,""{it is strangely like Mr. Wise’s own except in the matter of the lost accent,) the book is full of matter which will stir the memories of the older and interest the younger. For these last are certain to have heard much of the events with which it deals.
The scenes in Richmond just after the war are described as an eye-witness saw them, and so. too, the conditions at the University of Virginia in 1805 and IStiG— almost comic operalike in spite of the tragic earnestness of it. Most of the students had been soldiers; many of them officers, for there had been nobody to teach or be taught in tne Winters before, from sixteen years and upward every mother’s son was in the army. The Professor of Mathematics (who had himself been an officer on Gen. Lee’s staff) was very punctilious, they relate, in addressing tlie students by their titles. “ Col. So-and-So,” lie would say. *' will you explain this proposition to the class? ” And the Colonel, who might have led a brigade into battle a year before would recite ” like any schoolboy. There is, too, the reconstruction period, the famous ** biack-and-tan '* convention, which made a new Constitution for old Virginia; the troublous times when the question of the State debt made men mad, the tragedy of the fall of the old Capitol floor, when so many
were killed. Carrington is placed in the thick of all these events. Mr. Wise ;»*t-uullv was in the thick of most of them Carrington is placed on the unpopular side, and the side is one which hasn’t (of lat<?) got much into print. It is all here.
As for the title “The Lion’s Skin,” Mr. Wise hints that it conveys a fling at another writer who has dressed his fiction in the skin of a kindred but gorgeous and spotted beast. Moreover, Mr. Wise insinuates that certain persons whom he calls “ Bourbons *’ (though they do not live in France) are not the lions they seem, it is these “ Bourbons ” who can't understand his Powhatan Carrington, and were even so misguided fn the heat engendered by his first defection as to apply to him unpleasant names, like renegade" and '" traitor.” By calling their roar a bray Mr. Wise gets even—perhaps.
