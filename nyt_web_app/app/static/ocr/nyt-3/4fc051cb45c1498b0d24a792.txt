LET TT E R WRITING.

It has done so again in tlie case of Miss Gavit’s ■■ h'tiquette of ('orrcspond*, -nee," which is the best of its kind, and yet is hut a shadow. It is as different from
the Complete lyetl<*r Writer as Mrs. SherWood’s "Manner^ and Social I'saijes " is
different from the ordinary handhook of heha vior. and yet it is nut what ii should ho.
Miss Gavit dedicates hor book to the principal:- of perhaps the best known "finishing school " for girls in the t-ity; is this dedication evidence that there is a course in social correspondence at that schoolV We hope pp; then? should be such a course in every school. Then a college graduate would not accept an invitation from the chief benefactor and (rovernor of the institution in these words, as a " theolog ” did: “Mr, Smith accepts your invitation with pleasure, and I will hr glad to be at Mr. Jones's house nn the day you say and the hour he has fixed. Respectfully Paul Smith, B, D. ’
To get back to Miss Gavit’s “ Etiquette ^•f-t *orrespondonco." The most interesting parts of the book are those that deal only incidentally with the subject matter, for example:	(’hapter	II.. giving letters
elating from 14.V) to 1708. and including samples of the correspondence or the PilRtonR. various Queens. Horace Walpole, find ( harles L^imb—an interesting chapter, certainly; < hapter XV., which gives the postal regulations at considerable length, and in much larger type than the almanacs use; a long list of abbreviations, most of which would not be used in correspondence. and seem at home only in a
dictionary; another list of foreign words ;uul phrases, which, with all due deference to Miss Gavit, are not often used in correspondence, and an abridged dictionary of synonyms. This is interesting, and H • is padding.
But leaving out the very evident padding. there is much good sense in the book, for seldom is there any school instruction in correspondence. There are chapters devoted to the proper form in addresses, formal and informal letters and notes, correspondence in social clubs, notes of ceremony and compliment, card etiquette, letters in the third person, business letters letters of request, miscellaneous letters, and punctuation and capitalisation. All these subjects are pertinent. and aimost aJI of them are treated wit}-, tbe fullness required, and with only that.
There is. however, a chapter on heraldic devices, crests, coats of arms, which needs to be recast. In the first place, it is unnecessary. in the second place it is restricted to British-not even Scots—heraldry most of which is incorrect, anti in the third place it is not always right The reference to the British College of Heraldry (the College of Arms or Heralds' College* as mii institution of authority, is humorous. If Miss Gavit had said lhat the college would concoct a pedigree or a coat of arms for anybody who * had the dough.” she would be much nearer the truth than in her respectful mention of an absurd and antiquated collection of incompetents.
Miss Gavit lays down some rules that need other authority than her own. She says:	A business letter, and a business
letter only, should have the word ‘ City ’ without the na me [of the place] before ill” A business lelier should always have the name of tho city in full, or in its accepted abbreviation, and there would be fewer heartburnings if even social letters were subject to the same rule. Again the author sa>s:	“It is good form in all
social correspondence between equals tn use the title of ‘ Esq.’ in the address ' This may be the rule now, but not so long ago it was considered proper to use only ihe title •* Mr.1’ in such correspondence It W4.’ suggested by angry members of a club that a man be turned down because his innocent proposer had described him on the list as “ Hon. John Jones.” A very curious statement is to the effect that “ non-commissioned officers in the volunteer ajrmy keep their titles, even when no longer under military discipline.’* The correctness of this remark may be appreciated when it is recalled that non-commissioned officers have no titles really,

The fact is that the law permits volunteer officers to retain	their	titles,	but	that
gives	them no	social	privileges not	en-
joyed by regular offic* rs.
It seems cjoeer to find the English rules of pr-.'eederve given at length, and rule:-for the addresses of letters to all ra':ks of British titled person^, but with rriOd<**n
intern itional ni irri;i|.i'«. no nit** call b0
oerliiin tVial lie may m*1 liave to address

is not up to date; she	gives	only	four
T^ord Mayors, while there are now ten. beside,-; six Lord Provosts of Scots cities.

and a second	edition	WO hope* Will	fill
that place more perfectly than the first.
