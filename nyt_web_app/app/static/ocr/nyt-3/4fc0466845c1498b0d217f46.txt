INTERNATIONAL BOOK MARKET
The discussion to 'which we have several times referred, in The Lotion Standard, as to the American copyright law has drawn out a careful statement from Mr. George Haven Putnam, who is an officer of the American Publishers' Copyright League. He goes at some length into the history of our copyright legislation and a consideration of the differing conditions on the two sides of the Atlantic.
One fact he brings out of especial interest Noting that the requirement of American manufacture and simultaneous publication in the two countries ^ was a concession to the printers’ trade unions and to the protectionist sentiment of the United States—which neither he nor we can regard *as fair or wise in itself—he points out that a law without that provision might readily have excited overwhelming opposition because of the methods of British pub-
-	lishers. These gentlemen, ror reasons quite satisfactory to themselves, usually bring out a book in a costly edition—at $9, $6, or $4—and do not print a cheap edition until the demand for the dear one is exhausted. American publishers, on the other hand, usually issue their books at a relatively low price, seeking their profit in larger sales. If the law had permitted British publishers to copyright their books here and sell them for a year or more at high prices, making the American buyers who could not or would not pay those prices wait for cheaper editions, the pressure for its repeal would, Mr. Putnam thinks, be very strong. He is undoubtedly correct.
Another point Mr. Putnam makes which is of interest. Some of The Standard’s author-correspondents have complained that their market in England is 4‘ swamped’* by American books, while their American market is not enough better to offset this disadvantage. But, says Mr. Putnam, there is a process going on, especially in fiction, which explains whatever of truth there is in this statement, without reference to the copyright law at all. It is the marked growth of works of what may be called second-rate value— speaking mainly from the publishers’ point of view. These are works worthy of attention, but not having a “ commanding interest." We suppose they may fairly be described as books which compete for a publisher as compared With books for which publishers compete. Of their recent rapid and wide extension there is no possible doubt.
It is due to the inevitable increase in the number of	who	demand
only second-clas>,	and of writers
who produce that sort. This increase goes with the spread of general education of a not very high level, the great increase in newspapers and their readers, the ease and variety of advertising, and the apparently steady decline in the average cost of bookmaking, or, at least, in the cost of books actually made. It is easier to denounce this change than to check it or even to justify the denunciation. Possibly the proportion of readers who read the best things is smaller than formerly; but also it is possible that their actual number is larger and that they form a larger part of the total- population. However this may be, Mr* Putnam
may be accepted as

' There isj in 'fact* - more :than enough of such material produced, on both aides of the Atlantic.-arid,, to put itfrankly, there is no present need, as far,* as the literary .wants of American readers, are .concerned, for any large additions, to /the mass.	...
Meanwhile it is interesting to learn from Mr. Putnam that the Copyright Leagues, both Authors* and Publish-ers\ “ have now in train a plan for a revision of the American copyright..; statute by xneans of a commission,11 to consist of members of each house cf Congress and representatives of publishers, authors, book manufacturers, and other interests. Our system could greatly be improved in some important respects, and agitation to that end should be continued until the. end is attained.
