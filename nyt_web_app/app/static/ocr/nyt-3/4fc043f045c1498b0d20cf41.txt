Mrs. Sara Andrew She. new book, "Beyond Chance of Change,’ which the Macmillan Company is bringing out this week, is an idyl of childhood somewhat like “Our Village/* “Cranford,'* find " The Golden Age." It tells of the doings of some children, the eldest of whom is thirteen. They read such books as “ The Arabian Nights," " Mr. Wind and Madame Rain/’ &c. They listen to Shakespeare and other ** good ** books, which the doctor reads to them. There are two girls and two boys. They are like other youngsters, iuid when opportunity affords trade things for others they like better. One of the boys gets a book relating the adventures of Idaho Ike. The children read it secretly and .in installments. When the story is completed the eldest proposes that they imitate Idaho Ike and look for a cave filled with gold and precious gems. They collect a lot of things —cooking utensils* nails, tools, books, beads, &e.—to trade off for Indian stuffs. They are about ready for their journsy when one of them, aged eleven, draws back and breaks her oath—the children crossed their hearts and hoped to die if they told any secret. She writes the following anonymous letter to the doctor,
her father:
I take my pen in hand to tell you of an awful deed that will happen if sompthing is not done at once. There is a deep con-sovracy that will rob you of youre loving children all tout Daffy and bring down votir gray hares with sorrow to the grave. Only your hares are hot gray but bbuaii It is called Ho for Idaho and the Secret Band of Seekers for the Golden Cavern is to leave for the place where you dig up cold like sand and come home with your forchune and make every one rich and are a great hero. The clothes and things are at Sophy Jones, one of the conspyrators houses and that is where the caTving knives and other things are. We, no I mean some body borrowed them. I have crossed my heart, and hoped to die if I told, and I do supose this wrlteing will be the cause of my death, but its better to die than to bring a persons fathers and mothers gray hares wi^jwrrowtothe grave or even black. I hope I wont hafto Ho for Idaho but I will if this plan is not stopped. So no more at present from the Princess of Bengal. - .
All the 41 things" that the children had borrowed '* .were returned, and . So before it began the quest for the Golden Fleece was ended, and nobody was hurt. No one was any poorer than he had been before the visions of gold had danced before the excited eyes of the children. Nobody died from the broken vow or crossed heart. Ufe Is one long illusion, and the good things which we have never erasned are, perhaps, after all those which alone we have really possessed.
Eh? Jfetarjjork Eimce
