Xnr York Times Book Review:
I was Interested in reading the communication of " M. IS. S." to The New York Times book Review on the subject of Longfellow's “ Evangeline.” Might I ask if the other "literary man of note” that was present at the dinner with Judge Simon and Longfellow was not Nathaniel Hawthorne? Was it not proposed at this meeting that Hawthorne write a novel, the subject of which would be the story of "Evangeline"; that after Hawthorne had considered the matter and gave up writing the novel Longfellow took the matter up and produced " Evangeline " ? I think this will complete the story that “ M. E. S." tells.	L. S. R.
