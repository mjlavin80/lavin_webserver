Mr. James'and New England.
By no means the least interesting feature Of Tho North American Review for April, and a feature especially promising as a provoker of discussion, will be the first of a series of three papers toy Henry James; tho trilog-y to bear the title "New England: An Autumn Impression. ’ Somehow the combination seems delightfully adjusted to a certain fantastic fitness of things—N**w England, Autumn and Mr. James. Ail three stand fTccused of decadence, to be sure, and how unjustly doesn't much matter in the faeo of th«i
hopes which the linking of them must raise. The second and third papers or the series are announced Cor May and June, respectively.
