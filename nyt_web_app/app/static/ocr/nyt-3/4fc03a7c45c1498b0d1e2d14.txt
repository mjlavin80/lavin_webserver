|TTT3 present work by an honored member of the New York bar will appeal, we believe, most strongly to students of American constitutional law." The part played by Webster in our constitutional evolution is so stupendous that it never loses its Interest for us, and consequently a book about him is always timely. Mr. Wheeler says he believes that the ** Webster lesson was never more needed than it is now/* and on the title page ne nuotes from Senator Hoar's eulogy. Webster seems to have made upon Mr. Wheeler something of the impression he made on so many of his contemporaries. The statements that “ no American lias done more to make our Government what it is 'than Daniel Webster/’ and “with unrivaled power for making hard places easy and dark things clear, he succeeded in Impressing. his own convictions upon the courts before which, he practiced, .sufficiently indicate Mr. Wheeler's point of view. He has the lawyer’s natural instinct to lay a great deal of stress upon the importance of legal decisions In the making of a nations still they are not everything. As Jackson said, John Mar- , shall has made his decision,^ now let him
enforce it/*
The effect of Webster’s earlier arguments on the decisions of the Supreme Court justifies Mr. Wheeler’s assertion that In the development of our Constitution his arguments were as important as the decisions of Marshall. After Webster’s construction of the Constitution, in the cases of Dartmouth College and McCulloch vs. Maryland, had been adopted and perpetuated by the Supreme Court, his • pre-eminent position at the American bar was universally admitted. The principles established were, In tne Dartmouth College case, that the grant of a corporate franchise was contractual, and hence, by the Constitution, could not be impaired by the State granting it, and in the case of McCulloch vs. Maryland that a State could not tax an Instrument of the Federal Government.
M When the matter is carefully considered/* says Mr. Wheeler, " it will appear that tho whole character of the general government would have been altered, if the decision in McCulloch against State of Maryland had been the reverse of what it was.” In this case the narrower question of the power of a State Legislature to tax the bank was of more Importance than the broader one, which was also argued In this case, Can Congress charter a bank? and on the narrower question Webster’s argument seems to have completely convinced the Chief Justlcc. It does not appear In the decision of the broader question that Marshall was not quite as much Influenced by the argument of William Pinkney.
The importance of Webster’s reasoning and Marshall’s decision in the case of the American Insurance Company vs. Canter Is dwelt on in Chapter VIII. Mr. Wheeler shows that Webster’s position on the power of Congress over acquired territory, and the court's decision, embody the principle
on which the Insular cases have been dei
elded.
In the case of the Bank of Augusta vs.
| Earle, Webster maintained the right of a corporation chartered under the laws j of one State to do business In another, i and was sustained by the Supreme Court,
| Chief Justice Taney presiding. It was well, as Mr. Wheeler observes, that *' the commanding genius of Webster remained, to maintain the principles of construction which he and Marshall had -united to establish/’ for the bench, in the period preceding the Civil War, was coming more and more to a position of strict construction. The strict construction and State-rights principles of Taney are to be seen In his dissenting opinion in the so-called Passenger .Tax cases, which Webster had argued. Webster’s contention was that a State could not tax Immigrants entering it, as such an act would be a ” regulation of commerce,” and the court sustained him. The dis-senUng Justices argued that such regulations could be employed by States as Incidents of the police power and the taxing power. The chaotic conditions that might have prevailed had the court decided differently can be readily imagined.
Of Webster’s reply to Hayne, Mr. Wheeler says: “It is really a statement In eloquent and popular form of propositions Mr. Webster had frequently argued In the Supreme Court of the United States.” The brief of Webster’s reply to Calhoun is printed in Chapter X.
Chapter XIX. is concerned with the 7th of March speech, which Webster considered the most'important effort of his life. Mr. Wheeler thinks it is difficult now to realize the offense this speech gave' to many
persons: in the Ni^^But the speech wab -in the nature of a compromise, and to many persons, compromises are always
distasteful. ;It ,Is .perfe'Qtlr easy to see how the moral sense, of many Northerners .was shocked when-Webster told them
-without a word of regret that it was their duty to do that which their humanity told them was wrong. He was not able to-see that a law cannot be enforced when the moral sense of a community Is determined to nullify it. Webster’s speech is s. subject on which doctors may properly disagree. Mr. Wheeler, apparently, does not take kindly to the notion that Presidential aspirations had something to ao with the 7th of March speech—at least he does not allude to it in any way-but such is the custom of eulogists.
