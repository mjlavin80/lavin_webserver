FIRE AND SMOKE*
Two Books of the Past Season Which Scetn to Point the Way to the Twentieth Cenutry NoveL*
NCE the modern short story ' were magnified, broadened,
: deepened, g1vt*n background, and due perspective to the scale of the novel—and all this without blurring of lines —the resulting thing, it t^aa been said, ’would be neIt£*Ar less nor more than the twentieth century masterpiece. To be sure, the order is large, but the idea (propounded by a very able professional reader of manuscripts) has in It the root of the matter. As to the matter Itself, among the past season’s novels— those not fathered by authors already niched in the temple and proclaimed in . the market place—there are two whose names were linked together on the first page of the book Review some wee its ago. Enthusiasts have ventured to lay an index finger upon them as manifest samples of the new thing. That they are beyond the others in mere literary Quality is a fact, quite secondary to another. For they grasp some contemporary men and women, body, bfood, and spirit, and set them before us exactly—make these men and women drop their sacred disguises and do, say, think, nay, dream, the things we know in our souls they do and say and think and dream. In both there is an insight at once microscopic and broadly and' humanly comprehensive in spite of the fact that each author has a hobby and rides it—in both a singular truthfulness and clear-eyed sincerity in some vital things; in both a rare mastery of mere words; in both also a humor of that qual- ’ ity (once called Shakespearean) which is not afraid to laugh at funerals and weep J at festivals—not much afraid of anything—the humor which is, in fact, an I abiding sanity and sense of proportion— no less. Both novels come from England and deal with English folk, both have women's names on their title pages, both exhibit middle-class life in the white light which the presence of a stray child of the gods casts upon its blind ugliness. There perhaps the parallel ends, for one of the strays is quite without worldly dimensions, and -where Miss Evelyn Underhill in her “ Gray World ” has dipped a little pailful out of the dullest backwater of Ixtndon, Miss May Sinclair has cut a wide swath through several vital and quivering strata of English life—life as human as it is English—and taken in the backwater as well. However, both women do precisely what women were in mid-Victorian moralities sedulously taught not to do—they present facts naked and unashamed, and with no pretense of shame on their part at the shamelessness of the facts. Neither is less outpokcn than Mr. Bernard Shaw himself when it comes (as it must) to the question of sex, neither is less remote than he (or the unspoiled ancients) from any suspicion or suggestion of the nasty kind of unwholesomeness usually associated in the minds of young persons with the French novel, but found in much highly recommended English and American fiction, tricked -ut in the green and gold garments of the high ideal or half covered with a cloak of religious passion. These men and women of Miss Sinclair and Miss Underhill, may be guilty of saying and doing supremely shocking things; they don’t do them to be shocking, but for excellent honest human reasons.
The expedient adopted by Miss Underhill in her " Gray World ” to get an acutely sensitive spirit into the utterly despiritualized, earthy, and unspontane-ous Hopkinson family, has been called artificial and absurd, yet by it she makes' the reader feel as a personal vital thing that mysterious side of life which the modern world ignores. You are not less sure of the presence of those Hitting gray shapes than was the sallow youth who had died and been one of their dreary company. Nor is Bloomsbury lest* solid or less commonplace because it is haunted. Those women—the uncanny youth's sister, Pauline; Mildred, the girl in Che bookbindery; the older woman, airs. Levi, who plays with fires warranted not to burn her fingers—have we not seen them? Those scenes—the end of the bindery romance, where Willie and Mildred sit on the work bench and dingle their feet; Willie's tete-i-tete with Mrs, Levi, when he sees excellent Eve transformed to wicked Lillith; the Hopkmson house, when Mrs. Hopkinson lies dead and cold upstairs-all these equally are of the substance of life itself. To be sure, after the Eve and Lillith scene—and indeed before it—genius deserts the author and sentimental vapors catch hor up from the solid London earth a}ie has seemed to understand so well, even to the knowledge of the thinness of the veil between that solidity and the eternities. . You should spare yourself the silly ending. The “ Gray World " turns anotner color.

To a certain extent Misa SlnclaSr, whoso book is every way bigger and, more • full-blooded and better balanced, whose genius is broader, has failed at the end. ol her story, loo. But her failure is not ignominious. Her poet'&nd her ineffable Lucia aro creatures who. in their relations to each other at least, are too fine for the coarse uses of a ** happy ” ending—for cooing -lovers’ pretty commonplaces. No poet can endure such a situation and be a poet still. And Lucia's Rickman was the poet. No Luoia can behave like a schoolgirl in love and not lose her radiance, and Rickman's Lucia was radiance only—^ure moonbeams. However, as a radiance, her work was done. She had inspired the poet, transmuted his poetry, raised the little eockncy above the dreams of his own class and the performances of her own. As a woman, it was her baslpess to hold him to that high level. She had to come out of her halo and down tr >m her pedestal to do it.
We have been asked if there ever was a Lucia. Yes and no. Every poet—every young man with the seventh part of the soul of a poet—has | had his Lucia. Lucia is a beautifully serious, beautifully thoroughbred English gentlewoman—also a beautiful girl in a frail way—as she seemed to Savage Keith Rickman, who was not ortly a poet, but an aitchless cockney, who had never in all his life before met a gentlewoman. She borrowed by contrast a serene perfection she didn't possess— say, in the eyes of Jew~dwine. The real Lucia was, however, a very nice girl, and perfectly human—as human as Miss Flossie Walker. Each by instinct used the methods of her class. Each after her kind (we've been told) was a cat. You must not forget that the author has chosen to look at her Lucia always with Rickman’s eyes—an honor reserved for Lucia alone, and one which gets her out of focus. There was Miss Kitty Palliser, Lucia's friend, who to a man of her own kind, except for the article of statuesque beauty, was worth two of Lucia. Kitty, who would never have done for a redeemed cockney poet, is proof that the , author can use her own eyes, and not Rickman s, even upon a British thoroughbred girl of manifest attractions. For the other kind of girl, Poppy Grace and Flossie, are eloquent. Here the author's eyes (and Rickman’s after he has ripened) see alike—and see the truth, uncannily clear. Perhaps the finest compliment ever paid by man divinely drunk to mere woman (with not a touch of angel) was that which Rickman conferred upon the little actress when he had taken so many glasses of Dicky Pil-kington’s champagne. " Poppy,” said he, with no notion of blasphemy, " you are fit to dance before God on the floor of heaven after they have swept it." "After they have swept it "—that’s the last touch of vinous inspiration. Rickman drunk, by the way, (as Rickman at almost every point,) is a thing so utterly manlike (granting that your man is the least fraction of a poet—many men are that—most, when they are drunk,) that it is a wonder how Miss Sinclair grew so wise. Here is one woman at least (if she is a woman) who knows what a man is like, not what ne is like to a woman, but What he is like to himself—which should be a very different matter.
As for Jewdwinc, the intellectually unchaste, there’s been no such picture of what a highly cultivated selfishness and the deadly spirit of the university can do to a willing man since the Don Mrs. Ward introduced into her half-forgotten " Robert Elsmere.” The slough of despond into which a kind Providence has permitted old-fashioned free-thinking novels to sink has engulfed that Don (who deserved to live) along with the dreary Robert, who certainly deserved to die. Jewdwine, whose donnishness in somewhat like fashion eclipscs his manhood, is apt, like 1 the other, to haunt a man conscious of certain mental propensities. And those junior journalists—Maddox and the successful novelist Rankin—and Dicky Pil-ktngton, the financier, and Spinks of Mrs. Downey’s boarding house in Tavistock Place—alt these are men; in earnest or jest, in work or talk they behave as men.
Yet after all the two figures which make the book what it is as a piece of realism arc Rickman himself and the woman creature Flossie, so ingeniously likened to a beaver and so frankly and fearsomely taken to bits and revealed in her processes (hardly ever mental) to the dazed and admiring reader. On the othei Rickman, and on Lucia—since she declines to exhibit Lucia’s processes—the author may erect her claims as an idealist. On both Rickmans, Lucia’s and Flossie s, she may demand (and must get) recognition as a genius.
No doubt, each of the two stories has in it something of the stuff of which the tatterday great novel must be made. As it is, the ’* Divine Fire ” just misses that classification; the “Gray World” loses itself in its own smoke. H. I. BROCK.
