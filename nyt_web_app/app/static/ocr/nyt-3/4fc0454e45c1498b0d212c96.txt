pi," paying especial attention to the trapper and trading elements, which more " than any others dispelled the mysteries of that vast region. To a castaway, Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca, is due the first discovery of the Par WesL That wonderful man’s experiences began in 1530. His start was mads from an island in the Gulf of Mexico, named by him Mulhado, which modern research seems to show was Galveston, or near it. Indifferent to dangers, this Spaniard pushed on, and finally, after ten months, reached the Pacific Coast. Then he made the return trip, reaching Mexico in 1536. Other expeditions followed, for there were marvelous stories of huge emeralds to be picked up from the ground. The most notable of these expeditions were those in which the friar Marcos of Niza and Francis Vas-quez de Coronado figure. In 1530 Hernando de Soto landed at Tampa Bay, and in 1540 crossed the Mississippi, some distance above the mouth of the Arkansas.
Students of modern history must not overlook the importance of some purely commercial factors. As an acquaintance with the presence of fisb in the Northeastern Atlantic led to the working out of the North American coast lines, so the demand in Europe for tl*e fur of the beaver led to the opening of unknown portions of the remote West. In the author’s words:
It so happened that this particular quality of fur was in great commercial demand in Europe for the making of hats. For some time it had constituted an article of profitable export from the eastern part of the continent, as the similar animal in Europe had been exterminated. Finally, the supply from America also diminished as the trappers pursued their merciless task. Then followed th£ discovery that the great wild region west of the Mississippi contained beaver in immense numbers, and beaver trapping became the principal querc* of many bold natures eager to stake their lives with Fortune, just as others later played a different game with the golden gravels of California. * * * StimulatecPby the prospect of riches and the excitement of new scenes, the trappers sought the innermost recesses of the mountain wilderness, slaying what opposed their way, taking beaver by thousands and tens of thousands, and sending pack upon pack by way of St. L.ouls to the waiting markets of the Old World. The early returns may be estimated from the success of one enterprising man who, having employed a band of expert trappers, caaie out of the far regions on one occasion with nearly 200
I packs, each worth in St. Louis about $100,<XX). Thus it was that the beaver became responsible for the first opening of the great Western Unknown.
Tho buffalo (Bison America nus) had also his influence. In 153G Cabeza do Vaca called this animal the “ hunchback cow." Mr. Dellenbaugh writes:
In Coronado's day the northern limit of the buffalo was doubtless considerably below Great Slave Lake. *	*	* The
Saskatchewan country was full of them all Winter, though they were forced to paw away the snow to reach the moss.
*	* * While seemingly not so numerous in the eastern range, yet there were large numbers, and the hunters of the early days of European settlement often killed them. Albert Gallatin states that while m Western Virginia in 1784 he subsisted chiefly on buffalo meat.
The city of Buffalo takes its name from the animal, which formerly fed on it3 site. Tho story of the indiscriminate slaughter of the buffalo need not bo repeated. About 1835 the fur companies began to market the robes. Eventually they were worth only $1 apiece. Again with the extermination of the buffalo came the change in the life of the Indian. Over wide expanses of country his main source of food was gone. The author writes Instructively about the red men. He adopts, by the way, the new name given to our aborigines, calling them “ Amerind," a sort of dock-tailed composite of American and Indian. The ethnologist is doing his best, and yet there are many things still undiscovered about these people, by whatever new or old name they are called. According to the author:
The Amerind was not savage. He was
a barbarian, with a rather well ordered,
society. He possessed a high quality ot intellect, and he differed from his white antagonist more in external complexion than in any other particular, except his social organization, which was one the white man had passed through and left behind in centuries far past. Of course he had abundant vices like the rest of humanity. He was often horriblj' cruel to his enemies. But on the whole he was not worse than the Europeans who wrought him degradation, who frequently soaked him with cheap rum and alcohol in order to exchange nothing for valuable furs; who engrafted upon him more and wor.se vices, who shot him needlessly, and who reviled him as he sunk under the heavy iide of imposition- Love of homo and defense of country are ever extolled as of
the highest merit in the white race; in the American native they were crimes;

From the beginning of the contact the Amerind_begari to change for the worse..
In 1830 Albert Gallatin began an arrangement by language wlilch he believed would show the Ungual differences among the AmerlndSt but this careful study yet awaits further developments. It becomes exceedingly difficult to make the proper distinctions when there appear to be sixty stock languages. How old or how young are the Pueblos? How far did the North-Amerioan native take advantage of the. culture certainly found in the remoter South? The solution of many such questions is still remote.
With Lewis and Clark on the one side and tho .settlement at-the mouth of the Columbia River on the other, the wonders of the West were In a fashion bounded— corralled. Certainly, after the Revolution the Louisiana Purchase was the most im- • portant of all American events. It gave us the command of the mouth of the Mississippi, and the exploration of all north and west of the river went on rapidly after that. Finally, " the trail of the iron horse” annihilated the distances across the wilderness. The great West was i utterly won when, in May, 1859, the final | spike was driven into the rail which united the East and the West bf the continent. Mr. Dellenbaugh's book is naturally one of great interest and value.
