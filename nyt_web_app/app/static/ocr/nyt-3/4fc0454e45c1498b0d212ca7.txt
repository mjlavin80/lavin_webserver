FROM REAOERS*
Rome and Proff. Atidillet on.
| Xeit> York Times Hook Review:
In The Book Review, under the title of “ Ancient Rome.” you lately spoke of a work by Prof. J. H. Middleton entitled " The Remains of Ancient Rome." " Prof. Middleton in his work,” your article says, “ deplores the disappearance of many beautiful places of ancient Rome, and writes: • No words can adequately express the dis&ust which must be experienced both by the antiquary and by the lover of biTvUty in any form who now visits this unhappy city. The injury done in former periods of destruction was but superficial compared to the ruin which is being wrought by the present scheme of the “ piano regolatore ” which aims and is partly succeeding in leveling the seven hills and filling up the intermediate valleys, changing the very face of nature and utterly destroying the character of
the former capital of the world/ ” Further, he adds; "It must, however, be remembered that a great proportion of the injury which has been done to the remains of ancient Rome has been the unavoidable result of the fact that Rome has again become the capital of Italy.**
May 1. with a>l due respect for Prof. Middleton’s opinion, say that I have never read sentences so full of contradiction as the above taken from the extract of " The ; Remains Of Ancient Rome"? For while ! on one hand he denounces the “ piano reg-i olatore " as vandalous and iconoclastic, Prof. Middleton on the other hand says | it is also ati “ unavoidable result of the fact that Rome is the capital of Italy." If it is unavoidable, why talk about it? It seems childish! He calls Rome '* unhappy city Indeed. I should ve.ry much like to know why- It seems to me that any one attempting to talk or write on j any subject, whether it be of history, science. or art, should know what he is | talking or writing about—and certainly he who in writing or talking about Rome I gives it the qualification nf unhappy city " shows he knows nothing whatever | ot its history past and present! Rome an “ unhappy city ”? Why? For Its past? For its present? Certainly no one can pity Rome for its past—because no city in the world has 30 glorious a past as Rome* Then it is because of its present that Prof. Middleton’s pen gives vent to
its cries of sorrow a_nd pity! It is, then,
the fact that Koine is now the capital of Italy that makes Prof. Middleton call it unhappy! No answef is necessary to prove the absurdity of such a statement; so I pass on to tho next, " the piano rego-latore which aims and is partly succeeding in leveling the seven hills and filling up the intermediate valleys, changing the very fac^ of nature and utterly destroying thv- character of ih^ former capital of
the world.”
First of all. the phrase “ changing the very face of nature ” is an idle one, and a bad one from the viewpoint of correct style in writing—in this case; for what hits “ the very face of nature *’ to do with the aspect of a city? Then, the statement about the “ piano regolatore ”
Iiu.s no consistency whatever, because the
aim of tlie ** piano regolatore ” is to modify the city according to the needs of a modern people, and not to level the seven hffls, which would be an impossible undertaking. Prof. Middleton, aside from many other considerations, has evidently forgotten tnat the Tiber separates one of them, the Gianicolo. from the six others—and that the Palatino and Celio are separated from the Capitolino and Ksquilino and Quirinale by the Forum* Arnl again is Prof. Middleton’s deep knowledge and comprehension of the history ot '■ Ancknt and Mediaeval Rome " evidenced in his statement that *’ the injury done in former periods of destruction was but superficial compared to the ruin which is being- wrought by the present scheme of the " piano regolatore."
Most interesting, then, is the beginning of Prof. Middleton’s eulogy on Rome: “ No words can adequately express the disgust which must be experienced both by the antiquary and by the lover of bcdUty in any form who now visits this unhappy city." Kvidently, this “ unhappy city ” should be kept In a condition to please antiquarians:	I grasp the pro-
fessor’s idea. Rome should be kept just as it was at the time of the Caesars—its old. narrow streets should have been preserved: its old houses, even if not specially beautiful, but just because they were old. should not have been torn down; the poor Romans, just because they are Romans, should go without, any of the comforts of modern life, should keep on living in old places, uncomfortable, urul spend their money to keep them from failin'; to pieces over their heads. They should. I suppose, walk nn the rugged old stones with which tho streets of old Rome were paved because those stones were old, even though they constituted the greatest discomfort to modern Romans,
just for the sake or the “antiquary and the lover of beauty in any form ”! Why not, then, shut up the " unhappy city ” and make of it a museum for the antiquary? Or else, why not compel modern Romans to walk aboui the streets of the ** unhappy city " clad In the old ** tughe," for the sake of the ** lover of beauty in any form ”? Xt is. amusing indeed!
Is it really possible .that there exist, men who write about Rome and yet show no comprehension whatever of, its true life, of its true history, of its true character? Is it possible that the very men who write about Rome should ignore that it is owing to the very fact that its inhabitants have known, for twenty-five centuries, how to discriminate what should bo preserved and what should be destroyed of their city that Rome, the unhappy city/’ has lived such a long life, and that the modem Rome still preserves In its modernity most of what was great and beautiful in the four other Romes, the Rome of the Kings, the Rome of the Consuls, the Rome of the Caesars, the Rome of the Popes? I do not claim that the “ piano regolatore " has always been wise in the alterations it has caused to be made in Rome and that edifices and streets which have been destroyed plight not have been preserved, for to err is human," but between this and wholly condemning the work of the “ piano regolatore " there is a wide difference.
It is really to be deplored that a work expressing such erroneous ideas on Rome should come within reach of the many millions of Americans and English-speaking people, giving them a wrong idea of what Rome really is—and as a Roman I feel it my duty to try and correct such misleading statements about modern Rome.
