A writer for The Grand Magazine has made an interesting study of Joseph Chamberlain’s taste in poetry. In the old days Parliamentary speakers were wont to adorn their remarks with apt quotations from the classics. It was Lord Melbourne (of | whom Mrs. Ward’s William Ashe is a 11 reincaroa-I rion ’’) who said he had less trouble in making his ! speech than in fitting a Latin tag to the matter. In a later era of less Parliamentary dignity scraps of music-hall songs suffice the speakers for poetical quotations. But in the thirty years of his Parliamentary career the ex-Colonial Secretary has never descended so low. For a Ions while Lowell was hi3 favorite poet and “ The Biglow Papers" his favor* ite poetry. He has quoted Shakespeare five times, but one quotation served for three speeches. Burns and Butler, (“ Hudibras/') Canning and Pope, Cow-per and Tennyson are in the poetical repertory of the leader of “ fiscal reform.”
