FIRE AND S IVl O KE,
In Bible Lands.
Dr. George Aaron Barton of Bryn Mawr has collected in one volume the letters he wrote to bis family during his journey to the Holy Land, under the title ** A Year's Wandering in Bible I>ands," (12mo. Gilt top, pp. 270, 145 Mustra* tions. Cover illuminated in four colors. Map. Philadelphia: Ferris & Leach. Cloth, $2.00 net; half morocco, $3.00 net.) The purpose of the epistles was to convey to the family at home some conception of the scenes through which Dr. Barton and his party were passing, and the impressions which those scenes were producing1. Therefore, they contain no dry details of archaeological investigations. Among the localities visiteJ and pictured (there are 145 illustrations in half tone, from views taken by the author on the spot,) are Athens, Corinth, the Churches of Asia, Smyrna, Damascus, Baalbec, Jaffa, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Tekoah, Hebron, the Jordan, the Dead Sea, Mizpeh, Bethel, Samaria, Galilee, Beersheba, Luxor, Alexandria, Naples. Pompeii, Rome, Beirut, Cairo, Venice, Milan, Florence, and others. Among tho descriptions is the following, written in one of the last letters. The party were among the Alps;
It if) wonderfully beautiful. The charming lake (Lake Thun) is surrounded by rugged mountains, Jofty, and steep as Alps have a way of being. Just across the lake from us the Niessen rises like a great pyramid, deep valleys on either side separating it from the neighboring hills. As one looks up these valleys the eye is delighted with a vista of hills and mountains of various shades of blue. The more easterly of the two valleys ends in mountain peaks, which are capped with eternal snow. To the extreme west a most jagged mountain is seen across the Jake, one peak of which is so steep on the side toward us that it seems to lean over backward. But it is in the extreme east that the climax of beauty and grandeur appears, for beyond the lofty mountains which rise abruptly from the lake three grand white peaks, Eiger, Monch, and Jungfrau, stand in perpetual majesty.
