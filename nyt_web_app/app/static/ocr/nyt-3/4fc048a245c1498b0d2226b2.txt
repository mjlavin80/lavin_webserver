BOSTON NOXES
A Modem Young Philanthropist; New Books by Oric Bates, Charles S. Sargent, John Camden, Prof* James H. Hyslop, and Others.
hr good young woman of Hannah More’s time distrib- j uted " dripping" and tracts
to more or less grateful cottagers; the good young woman of to-day leaves a trail of sanitation, repairing, mending. soap, and jokes behind her, and in the case Of " Miss Billy," the pleasant story to be published by the Lothrop Company the first week in April, the jokes are as salutary as the reforms. The joint authors. Miss Edith K. Stokeley and Miss Marion K. Hurd, tv^ve hit upon the happy Idea of making the young philanthropist anything but perfect, and she corrects her own faults briskiv even while she reproves the shortcomings of her neighbors, and steers safely between the priggishness of some, heroines of her class and the dullness Of those created to listen to the twisted English and logic of their beneficiaries.
>	As she takes a New York prize offered for the greatest improvement made in any neighborhood, it is to be supposed that she was successful indeed, for she Ii\ed in Boston, and this season seems to bo marked for snubbing the poor little city.
Even Mr. Oric Bates, although a native of the place, must needs satirize its foibles Hghtly in his " A Madcap Cruise," Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. will bring out Saturday of next week, but his hero's assistant, a necessary person in the modern novel, says, “ You may talk about Italy and aV- the rest of it until the crack of doom, but they can t hold a candle to good old Boston." Also by way of further compensation, be makes his one abnormal personage a recreant Bostonian, content to live self-exiled, a mere appendage of the British Museum.

Prof. C harles Sprague Sargent's “ Manual of the Trees of North America " also appears March 25. with its 630 descriptions. each one illustrated by Mr. Charles
E.	Faxon. The arrangement is such that reference is easy, and no one with any visual memory whatsoever can avoid learning the marks by which a tree may
be recognized at any season, but must j group them correctly In his mind, so in-1 geniously are leaf-bud, leaf, flower, and-fruit grouped in a small (§pace with no repetition of arrangement between the covers. Both author and artist have devoted their lives to the task of which this work represents the concentrated essence,	^	#
“The American Girl in Munich,** Miss Mabel W. Daniels’s novel to be published by Messrs. Little, Brown & Co, next week, should be free from the “rising cadences,” “harmonious notes," and other strange musical figures found in certain late musical stories, for its author was a medal scholar at the Munich Conservatory and studied privately with Ludwig Thiulle. Her America^ teacher of composition was	George W. Chadwick. While
at Radcliffe, from which she was graduated in 1900, she wrote the music of “A Copper Complication” and “The Court of Hearts" for production by her fellow-students. but her most serious work has
been done since that time. She belongs, to a. family devoted to music, and her father is President of the Handel and Haydn Society. ' •.

Mr. George Alfred Page, of Messrs. L.
C.	Page & Co., has sailed for London on his annual auest	for new authors	and
good stories, and will extend his journey ( to the Continent. .
Messrs. Herbert	B. Turner &	Co.	are
:	preparing for early issue a novel	by John
' Camden entitled “The Hundredth Acre."
It describes a long struggle for an acre i	of New England	soil claimed	by	two
persons whose estates march with one another. The person In possession is mysteriously poisoned while in Paris, and the other claimant receives the desired land as payment for disclosing his slayer after several persons have been suspected.

Scottish Catholics and Methodists are ! the rather discordant characters who meet in Mr. George H. -Picard’s “The Bishop's Niece," already announced, but as marriage between baptized persons is valid, even if one be Catholic and the other ! prot^stant, the lovers’ troubles are not too serious to be borne.
“Science and the Future Life," an addition to an evergrowing group of thoughtful attempts to bring unrelated matters to bear upon one another, is from the pen oi.
Prof. James H. Hyslop, an energetic member of tlrtf Society for Psychical Research, He -~quot.es the investigations of Prof.' James/^Br: "Ribliard Hodgson, Sir Oliver Lodge, and Prof. Henry Sidgwlek in support of his contentions, and, indeed, his entire book is based on data collected by the^pfociety,
Mr. Albert R. Carman's “ The Ethics of Imperialism," a defense of both the British and the American varieties. Seems likely to make some little stir both sides of the border, chiefly because its author, in the effort to champion two movements differing almost diametrically in origin, has found a new point of view whence he regards both.
Last on the firm's list as it stands at present comes Mr. Alexander Jessup’s "The Charm of Youth," a little volume of verse; but four or five others will probably be added before the season ends.
The second edition of “ Broke of Co veil-den " is selling even better than the first, and the book bids fair to rival “The Divine Fire," the other story in which love transforms the untaught, unraahnered bookworm into a man to content a lady's i heart, if not to please her eye.	,

Miss Amy Brooks's name appears thrice | on the Lee & Shepard list this year, but in one case it is appended to a new form of an-old book, “ A Jolly Cat Tale," pub: lished in 1908. This story of the cat who , made frocks for her kittens has become so
! great a favorite with very little readers
that it has been decided to print an edl-tion in very large type, so that they may 1 learn to read from its pages. The sixth . of the “ Randy " books, “ Randy’s Luck," and "Dorothy Dainty at the Shore," are her other two books. Miss Brooks will illustrate Mrs. Grace Le Baron Upham's “ The Children of Bedford Court," a story of which the hero is the brother of the heroines in “ Queer Janet ’’ and " Jessica's Triumph." He is a patriotic newsboy, who serves his country in the Span-ish-American war.
