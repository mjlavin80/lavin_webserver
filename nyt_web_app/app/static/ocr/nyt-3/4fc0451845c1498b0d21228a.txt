The first volume of Prof. Edwin Charles Dargan s “History of Preaching " (crown 8vo. Pp. 577. Index. New York: A. C. Armstrong & Son. $1.75) deals with the period from the Apostolic Fathers to the great Reformers, A. D. 7<M57:i. The work is the result of studies pursued and judgments formed during eleven years as Professor of Homiletics in the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary at Louisville, Ky. There have been many delays in writing the book, and necessary changes of plan. It was finally completed during a six months’ visit to Europe, where Dr. Dargan read in a number of the great libraries, including those at Berlin, Leipsic, Rome, Zurich, Geneva, and Paris. The author says of his work:
t Much of the work done and critical judgments reached is based on personal ana independent study of the original sources; much more, however, is of that mingled sort which rests partly and often chiefly on the work of others, and yet has been confirmed, enlarged, or modified by contact with the sources; in a few cases where circumstances warranted or seemed to require it. I have simply adopted information obtained or views expressed by others.
In footnotes throughout the text he has indicated authorities consulted or explained passages. In the introduction. Dr. Dargan speaks of the need of a history of preaching, the historic origins of preaching, the place of preaching in his- 1 tory, and closes with an outline of the history of preaching. He writes of the ' historical place of preaching:
Preaching has protoundly and for the most part wholesomely influenced the I morals and customs of mankind. * * * 1 Progress in the arts and sciences has con- ! tributed in many ways to preaching.
•	* * The connection of preaching with the progress of human .culture is real and extensive. * • • As to art it is beyond doubt that music, painting, sculpture, architecture, and even the industrial arts, have owed something to preaching, and preaching something to them. * * * In philosophy, however, the mutual influ- I ence has been profound and profoundly important. • * * In regard to science i there has often been full and cordial mut- ! ual recognition. * * • In the sphere of 1 literature there has been great and hearty I reciprocal service. * * * As to educa- , tion no open-minded observer can fail to recognize the intimate relations between it and preaching.
