It is Dr. Bernhard Weiss's object in his new book, " The Religion of the New Testament,” (8vo. Pp. 440. Black cloth, i New York and London:	Funk & Wag- j
nails Company. net,) which is a com- j plement to his “ Manual of Introduction to the Now Testament,” and has been translated by Prof, George H. Sehodde, to £ive a “brief but clear" answer to the question, what is the religion of the New Testament?
During his academic work of nearly half a century the author has kept in mind the fact that the purely historical account of the different types of doctrine furnished by a theology of the New Testament must be supplemented by a wrork giving the underlying unity of this diversity. This he has done in the present volume. He points out that “ The Religion of the New Testament " is intended not for the learned alone, but for all " thinking Christians. His purpose has not been, he writes, to construe a theological system and then try to prove it from the Scriptures, but to allow the Scriptures to speak for themselves; also, he has not endea\-ored to furnish an apology for what he regards as the religion of the New Testament. They alone can furnish the evidences as to what they are and what they
want.	/	l
The book is divided into three parts. In I Part I. Dr. Weiss describes the suppositions or conditions of the redemption described in the New Testament. In Part II. he discusses the redemption in Christ proper. Here the subjects discussed are the redemptive acts of God. In the third
part he treats of the realization of redemption in the individual and in the congregation, in the present and in the world to come.
