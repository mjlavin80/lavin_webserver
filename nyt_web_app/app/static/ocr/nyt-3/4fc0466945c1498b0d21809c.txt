Prof. Charles Sears Baldwin of Yale University, in his little volume, " How to , 'Write," tells how to prepare a speech and an essay, how to tell a story, and how to ; describe, through passages quoted from the Bible and analyses of these passages. He writes in his introduction:
Th is book shows how to gain a practical skill. Skill in writing gives two things: First, better command over one's fellows; second, better command over one’s-self; that is, first, influence, and, second, edu- | cation. * •	* But this handbook	is	not
for professional writers. It is for plain people. • *	* Though the Bible	is	no	j
longer alone	on the shelf, it is still	every-	I
body's most	convenient example.
It is Prof. Baldwin’s purpose to solve these four problems from the Bible: “How to Fix the Attentfon on One Point,’’ “How to Take Hold,*’ “ How to Go On,” and “ How to Bring Home.” The Macmillan Company is bringing out the book.
