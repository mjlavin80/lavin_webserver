Dr, Henry A. Stimson’s volume. '* The :
Right IJfe and How to Live It," Volume
I.	in The Right Life Scries, edited l>y
him, has been published by A. S. Barnes
& Co. An introduction for the hook
has been written by Dr. Maxwell,
Superintendent of Schools, New York
City. The volume is intended for growing boys and girls, as well as to help teachers and parents. It docs not, the author says in his preface, propose any new theory of life or advocate any new teaching which might bo set aside. ** It furnishes a harmonious and satisfactory interpretation of life.”
A book for young people on right living will necessarily differ in form from an ordinary textbook. It deals not with things to 'be learned so much as with things to be recognized. It appeals to the intelligence and the reason. It must honestly answer serious questions and treat of the actual problems that arise In the life of the young people of to-day, and it must treat of them from the standpoint of life as a whole. It must be sufficiently broad and thorough adequately to meet the situation, and, while it may begin with the discussion of principles, ft must quickly advance to practical matters. It inust toe thorough, but it must
also be readable. It must rest upon truths which every one will acccpt, and Show their meaning and importance in such a way as shall bear fruit in right conduct. It will fail if it is not found interesting and seen to be immediately helpful.
Such a book, tue aumor says, he has tried to write in " The Right Life." Other volumes to appear in the series will include " Religion in the Home," by the Rev. Dr. Charles Cuthbert Hall; "What I Believe: The Faith of Thinking Men," by the Rev, Dr. William Douglas Mackenzie; "The Church and Modern Life," bv the Rev. Dr. Washington Gladden; "‘The Bible To-Day: A Summary or the Latest Knowledge," by the Rev. Dr. William C. Bitting, and others.
