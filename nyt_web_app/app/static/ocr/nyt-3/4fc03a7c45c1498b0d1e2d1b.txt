Miss Sllberrad's new book consists of half a dozen stories, told in her own original and vigorous style, each a unique little drama of wooing and wedding; with the sturdy, unromcntlc fanatic, and most lovable Tobiah the Dissenter as the deus ex machina in every case. " I haven't ruuch opinion of love,*’ quoth he, it dri\ es out the little godliness there miglit be in man, and the sense, too." Nevertheless, sometimes unconsciously, sometimes grumbling! y, but always effectively, he lends a helping hand to the little blind god in strait and difficult places, lifting up his mighty voicc the while in old-fash--ioned psalmody or round denunciation, for he has a “ commission to fools " and villains which it likes him well to deliver. Hear him in colloquy with a heroic and saintly Roman Catholic priest, with v^hom he has stood shoulder to shoulder in the perilous protection of a hunted woman: ** You may be an idolater—you are. and so will undoubtedly be damned in the the life to come—but in this life you are a man, brother, a man, and I want to meet no better.’*
And he clapped his hand upon the priest's.
A wrong-headed, narrow-minded Tobiah, but a man himself, a fine fellow, a big, breezy nature that it heartens one up to know.
j There is a peculiar quaintness in this j hr.ndful of tales, as though the narrator i were one of Tobiah’s neighbors, and shared the opinions and superstitions of his time. She does not give sc much as a wink to her twentieth century audience as if to say, You and I know better.*' Therefore it is that the reader does not pause to doubt or to question, but is carried along with the author and her crea-* tions—and a pretty dance they lead him; always, 'however, over ground well worth the treading, with large outlooks, and invigorating winds, a cherry goal at the 1 end, and a readiness to do it all over
again.	j
There are no problems nor subtleties in there little dramas of honest love. One can fancy Miss Silberadd sharing old Sam Johnson’s detestation of ** scruples.” She goes straight to the main issue, as does lusty Tobiah, who, we must confess, was “ for a godly man, a very handy liar." A lie, however, was his weapon of last resort, used only when he was driven, for the sako of the sore beset, to “ fight the devil with fire."
A thoroughly enjoyable book is “ The Wedding of the Lady of Lovell.” Stories
more interesting or move wholesomo It would be hard to find; still harder to find ai y of equal originality and excellence of workmanship.
