Having disposed successfully of Peg I "Woffington, Miss Mathews looks about her for more worlds to conquer, and in ** Billy Duane ” undertakes to combine a story of New York politics with one of New TorK society. Naturally, the story : is strenuous; so, too, are its character.'-'.
Mrs. Billy Duane having Laken her little boy abroad to have his spine straightened, meets and likes Mr. Isadoro De Barreaux, who had changed his name from Isidor Baer. He was the greatest pianist in the world, and was a Jew who discoursed eloquently with Bishop Gordon King of New York. He hated Billy Duane, who had just been elected Mayor of New York, because when they were students at Heidelberg together Billy had got Fatima from him. The story tells of the trouble Billy got into at home because of Fatima and De Barreaux, and relates how Madame O'Leary's dressmaking establishment is raided by the police one evening while Mrs. Billy was playing roulette there. Jt was a terrible affair! Billy as Mayor came around to save his wife and almost gets himself murdered. His wife saves him, and the would-be murderer kills himself at once. He had already killed one of the Mayor's attendants.
Lots of other things happened, all of which would have been avoided if Mrs. Duane had been willing to listen to her husband for two minutes in Chapter Five. But various things put her out of temper. First of>allt her husband had used the Madison :A.venue house as his headquarters, and was out when his wife came on a slower steamer than she had said, so she found the house " a blaze of light, the sidewalk was extremely dirty, and littered with ballots, cigar stumps, i burned matches, and so forth. At least a score of men. mostly with hats on the back of their heads or over one eye, hud* died about the area. walk, and, indeed, sat peacefully smoking on the stoop! " This was bad enough, but worse re- ! mained.
Mrs, Billy went upstairs, to her own j rooms. "A spectacle of open chiffonniere drawers, open closet doors, bodices, skirts flung about, masses of carnations and roses everywhere, a bed full of lace kimonos, and other sorts of lingerie, all nc-w from the shops; a tub It* full of silk.
stockings and bonbons, the scent of her orris over it all; her desk open and Billy's , old photo looking at her." How could she help hoping the worst ? Of course we know that Billy had got them for her; and if she had asked she would have found out. But if she had. the book could not have been written.	_
The story is full of swells, there is the Karl of Seaborough, in love with Dully Propper, only sixteen, and already *■ out,” and lots and lots of metropolitan club men, and Mrs. Propper, who is getting a divorce from Mr. Propper. who ran away with Mrs. Townsend-we might make a pun here, but we won't—after which she will marry Jack Stowe. She and her husband and Jack and the Townsends are i all great friends. The atmosphere of New York society is perfectly reproduced, as any one can see. But it would not do for the Mayor to be in trouble, so Billy apologizes to his wife, and she re-lents—we had an idea that she ought to apologize, but we must have been wrong, and in the very last page everything is settled nicely.
