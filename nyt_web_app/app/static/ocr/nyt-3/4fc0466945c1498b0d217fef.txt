ace. The Jefferson Davis book is now in print again, and doubtless its association in the public mind with Mr. Dixon’s novel will benefit its circulation greatly.
T seem3 that the republieaUon, after thirty-nine years, of the late Dr. John J. Craven's book about “ The Prison Life of Jefferson Davis ” is to serve more than one purpose. The book was originally published in this city in 1815H. t>r. Craven was Post Surgeon at Fortress Monroe during Jefferson Davis’s imprisonment there, and acted as medical attendant to Mr. Davis. In Chapter HI. of his book he describes how Davis was put in irons on the morning of May	186C*. Mr.
George B. H. Swayze, one of our readers in Philadelphia. has taken the-trouble to copy out certain passages in Dr. Craven’s dramatic description of this incident, the entrance into the cell of an officer with a blacksmith carrying shackles, Davis’s indignation, his struggle with the blacksmith, his grief and shame, and contrasts them with passages in Chapter IV., Book III., of “ The Clansman,11 by Thomas Dixon, in which Dr.'Cameron is shackled in exactly the same way. Mr. Dixon has clearly paraphrased for his use in fiction Dr. Craven's graphic account of a historical incident. He has not used Dr. Craven’s account, however, word for word, though in spirit and purport the passages are identical, and there Is scarcely a phrase in one that has not its equivalent in the other, Similarly, in Dr. Craven's book there is an account of an assault on a white man who had abused Davis tjy the Confederate leader’s faithful slave. Robert. The negro first inquired if he was considered the white man’s equal, and receiving an affirmative answer, knocked the white man down, exclaiming. “ Take that from your equal." Mr. Dixon has adapted this passage also in “ The Clansman." This all goes to prove
Mr. Dixon’s claim that his fiction is founded on
