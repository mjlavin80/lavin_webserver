MRS. WARD'S NEW BOOK.
" The Marriage of William Ashe ” is Another “ Novel of Reincarnation.”*
HE appearance of a new novel by Mrs, Humphry Ward is always a literary event of the first magnitude. It is safe to assume of her books inherent qualities conspicuously absent from the casual ..story of the day. She gives her best to her public, and that best means a wealth of material fused into a coherent whole, and fashioned into symmetry by " handwork,” patient, skilled, sincere; it means that ultimate culture which has passed from a visible presence into a pervading atmosphere; it means a gracious distinction which gives her readers a sense of belonging to the elect without requiring them to join the - cult of the Elusively Subtle. She does not wrap Tier meanings in a shimmering mist of word or phrase: they shine through a style of crystalline clearness with that simple directness never disdained by the masters of letters.
; But it is also safe to assume the limi-| tatJons of Mrs, Ward's art. Her characters are too much confined to those circles of which we respectfully road in the English chronicles of society. We move among “ the richest and rankiest of them all,’* and although, with the aristocratic instincts of democracy, we mightily enjoy hobnobbing with Dukes, Duchesses, Premiers, and their kind, wc recognize that the humanity of Mrs, Ward’s novels is the poorer for their exclusions. They would gain much should she admit persons among her personages, some plain, elemental * natures among " the tangled and complicated organisms ” of a highly complex and aloof order. Her greatest defect, however, Is her lack of humor. Even Shakespeare In his tragedies, George Eliot, for all her sombre and austere philosophy, used plenteously that saving salt; but Mrs. Ward’s work discovers scarce a trace of it We recall no other writer at all approaching her in eminence who is so hopelessly committed to the serious. " Leave smiles behind all ye who enter here ” is written upon each of her novels.
A graver fault than these was foolishly charged against “ Lady Rose's Daughter.” (the suggestive parallelisms of “ Eleanor" having evidently escaped those critics with so keen a " flair " for literary thPft.) That a writer ceases to be original because her characters have originals is a strange theory. Stranger still it was to imagine a writer of Mrs. Ward’s wide information unaware of the fact that the story of Julie de Lespinasse had lonp been public property. Yet it was not until Mrs. Ward herself, in the course of her tale, suggested comparison with that of the gifted and ill-fated Frenchwoman that thes* sapient critics bccame conscious of having raised a iiue and cry upon a false scent.
It is needless to comment upon Klee biographical resemblances in " The Marriage of William Ashe.” These were early discerned by its readers, and nave been more than once brought forward by the author in the course of her narrative. In truth, we begin to perceive that Mrs. Ward h is done more than create characters. Following the lead of " Diana of the Crossways." she has taken a bold flight into a new realm of fiction. Her ! thr^e latest stories, more markedly her two latest, may be called Novels of Reincarnation. a species of romance as difficult ns it is fascinating—impossible, in~ deed, save to an imagination of the highest order. Even Mrs. Ward’s art failed to Anglicize the essentially Gallic career of Mile, de Lespinasse; and “Lady Rose’s Daughter,” for all its brilliancy, breaks down and crumbles to aji Impotent conclusion as soon as its author abruptly leaves the Frenchwoman’s tragic path with inevitable apples of Sodom at its goal, for one leading to the fruit of Hes-peridep and the coveted British prize of the strawberry leaves.
As ’* The M irriage of William Ashe ” , has unfolded Usell month by month we j have tremhlpd lest Mrs. Ward should again sacrifice the logic of events and ! the logic of temperament to thu popular demand for a happy ending. This time, i however. she hits had the courage of her ! art. Our hearts contract with the pain of it all; but, like Luther, she '• could do no otherwise,’’ and we accept the conclusion a law <.f n.iture, grateful for tin* poignant sweetness with which it is infused.
There was ncrer n truer saying than that “ truth is stranger than fiction."
It is well illustrated by the fact that Mrs, Ward has been compelled to soften ail thp lineaments of Lady Caroline Lamb, in order to make her reincarnation, Lady Kitty, at all credible. Even as Kitty is presented, with all the elimination of T>ady Caroline's vagaries, we should cry " Impossible! " at every turn, did not Lady Caroline herself lay a ghostly finger upon our lips. A wonderful por-tiayal is this of Kitty, bewitching, maddening,	tragic—a	slender, vibrating

flame, at oncc destructive and self-consuming. Again and again does Mrs. Ward, with surpassing skill, hold her back, just as she Is about to slip over the edge of our sympathies. The ** mot d'€nfgme " of her character is that touch of madness she recognized in herself, awakening a fury in her breast the instant she perceived herself hardly judged. She is the victim of heredity, the victim of her very^ charm, the victim of the indulgence of too pliant circumstance. The reluctant lips of “ the little Dean ” assure us that we are not mistaken in our opinion that tho worst thing possible for such a nature was the husband, too long a mere " mush of concession,” and hardening, as such men will, at just the wrong time. Even Mrs. Ward never had keener Insight than when she "saw how, through the very gate of sin and shame, the popr, willful, luxurious child, stripped of her trappings, and brought face to face with* life in its sternest phases, passed to a height she could never have attained while tripping gayly along " the primrose path of dalliance ” with sentiment and sensation.
Kitty so dominates the book that it is with a wrench one turns from her to consider the other characters. Of these William Ashe, for all his admirable traits, is least convincing. He is too thorougnly a woman's hero—which means he is something of a prig. We are told of his shining qualities, but they do not shine of themselves. He leaves us cold. Had Kitty married a man, not merely righteous, but with the enthusiasm of goodness; not merely kind, but of a controlling firmness, her story wculd have had another ending. Geoffrey Cliffe is a more virile creation, widely divergent from his prototype in many ways, but Byron himself in his selfishly brutal “ dealings with women,” as in his thirst for heroism. His temptation of Kitty is peculiarly adroit and alluring, calling her to share hardness, to “ open another door in the House of Life/' to do and to give, instead of to enjoy and receive. Again we do homage to Mrs. Ward's power, in that she extorts admiration ror the heroic in the man, even while she commands loathing for the brute.
Mary Lystcr* cold, narrow, hard, is consistent with herself to a certain point; but her crime against her rival, " a crime as hideous as any murder,” oversteps the ethical boundaris of such a nature. Could the Mary Lysters of real life do that? We think not. It is one of the few events of the story that do not ring true.
Another, perhaps the omy other, is Kitty’s defiantly tempestuous midnight performance upon the terrace. The little Dean himself, elsewhere altogether adorable, waxes stilted and artificial here, and the entire episode seems a labored intrusion.
The Dean, an ethereal compound of worldliness and other-worldliness, is one of Mrs. Ward’s happiest creations. Reticent of religious speech, his whole personality breathes the spirit of Christ, and, upon the supreme occasion of tis appeal for the erring wife, his passionate pica is uttered from the highest spiritual plane. Thfo frank courage which pressed home past failure, present opportunity, a large interpretation of “ the higher law,” is mated with an exquisite tenderness and a beautiful attitude of shy humility toward his own great message. The scene is nobfy conceived, perfectly wrought, worlhy to tafce ita place with the best that fiction has given us; worthy to be woven into the web of one s own life and ideals.
And of the close what can be said? With the impression fresh upon us, it can only be folded in silence, as too intimate, too sacred, too tragic to touch. It had to be—the tragedy of it—by ail inexorable laws. The fate of the fragile, undisciplined creature, with her taint of corrupt heredity, with the touch of madness in her blood, both accentuated by her hot-house environment and her unbridled impulses, was a foregone conclusion. As much as may be, Mrs. Ward has softened, has even glorified the inevitable. The sin and shame and frenzy all past; " tho poison all drained out;” the arms she had pitied for about her; her soul sustained by faith and hope surelv death was more kind than life, and who can refuse to say, ‘‘It is best so"Y

new depth and beauty with each reading; one appreciates how superbly the author has triumphed over unusual difficulties Of situation and of character; ami with what noble conclusions she has charged a story which might easily have sunk into a moral morass. Its place is with the books lhat do not die. Its author stands among the few living writers of fiction to whom the Immortals have passed the torch. M. CORDON PRYOR RICE,
