R. H. F. TOZER has just published through the Clarendon Press (New York, Henry a Frowde,) a translation of tho M Divina Commedia ” in English prose. At the threshold of his translation Mr. Tozer, an enthusiastic, but not always judicious, English student'^of Dante, quite disarms
the query as to the fitness and appro-prlateness of his undertaking by modestly saying that 41 every one may without presumption hope to contribute something toward the more perfect translation of the future.” This is a praiseworthy sentiment. And It is further intimated by the translator that his work is not intended to be this ideal of the future, since he has | '* abstained from consulting other English translations."
The obvious rendering of Mr. Tozer’s English is for the benefit of the English reader unlearned In Italian, for the reader
who would like to stumble through the original by means of it and a slight knowledge of Italian, and for the hitherto undiscovered writer of that " more perfect translation of the future." It may be that Mr. Tozer's English and the convenient form in which his translation is published will appeal to some who have hitherto withstood the invitations of other interpreters, but really the text before us adds nothing to the study of the " Commedia,and very often weakens the strongest and most subtle expressions by rendering them through an unsuggestive and unresponsive style.

Mr. Tozer falls into the error of his predecessors in rendering Francesca’s apostrophe to love. (Inferno, v. 100:)
11	Love, that in gentle heart is quickly kindled, seized this one for the fair person, that was taken from me in a manner which distresses me still,” instead of:
" Love * * * seized him (this one, I e., Paolo) of fair person," &c. *' The manner which distresses me still ” refers not to the supposed fact which Mr. Tozer states
in a footnote—" The suddenness of her death left rfb time for repentance ’’—but to the trickery that was practiced at the time of her marriage, when Francesca found herself bound to the cripple Giovanni instead of to his handsome brother, Paolo.
Places where' the translator either consciously or unconsciously has weakened the original meaning are altogether too numerous. The simple and unadorned diction of the translator—an excellent thing In itself-does not excuse them. As one, fresh from the original Tuscan, reads here and there the weakness, tameness, and blunting of Dante’s meaning are painfully obvious. For example, La Pia is made to say, (Purgatorio. v. 134,) of her husband, Nello: "He is privy to my death,*’ which is in strange contrast to this biting original: " He knoweth it (my murder at Maremma) full well.” In the same canto the episode of the murder of Jacopo del Cassero of Fano by the hired assassins of Asso VIII, of Este has this verbal attachment, “The instigator was the Lord of Este," where Dante simply has the murdered man exclaim with sudden force: “ That Este had it done." And in the same story, two lines further down, where Jacopo is describing his flight from the assassins, we have this tame, colorless passage: “But if, when I reached Oriago, I had fled toward La Mira, I should still be in the land of living men/’ where Dante wrote these spirited words; ** But when I was overtaken at La Mira, if I had only fled toward Oriago, I should still be yonder where men breathe.”

The bookmaking features of Mr. Tozer’s translation are excellent. The type used is an excellent eighteenth century modification, and the volume is not so large that it cannot be conveniently carried In the pocket.	"W,	L,
