Let us not forget to celebrate In soma suitable if small way the one hundredth anniversary, April of the birth of Hans Christian Andersen. Perhaps Lord Rosebery would say that nobody who cannot read Danish can possibly know Andersen's works well enough to comprehend their relative value and to talk about them intelligently. But that is not to the point. If the fairy tales and folic tales of the gentle, imaginative Dane had not delighted two generations of readers, young and old* -\eho never knew
the Danish language, no one out of Denmark would think of celebrating his centenary and. probably it would be neglected there. Andersen was a good Dane, and his mind was richly stored with Scandinavian lore. But his writings belong to the whole world. _His vivified toys, his magic Sloshes, his fairies, his marsh Icings and sea maidens are familiar in the nurseries of every civilized land. His “ Story That the Star Told ** is an idyl in many tongues. His fragmentary autobiography ranks with Franklin’s, though it reveals a very different sort of nature from that of the great diplomatist. By all means, therefore, let us celebrate the Hans Christian Andersen. centenary joyously- For he left the world better than he found it.
