man.” Mrs. Ward’s example clearly proves the possibility of such a course, all Mr. Dixon's argument to the contrary notwithstanding.
TOPICS OF THE WEEK
HE reviewer of The London Times puts his finger on the weak spot in Mrs. Humphry Ward’s new novel, “ The Mar. riage of William Ashe." This is the preface, in which the novelist avows that her story is " an adaptation to our own times of the lives of certain famous men and women well known to an earlier England.” The reviewer thinks this notice “ not only totally needless but a fatal thrust at the very heart of the book.” The objection seems to be well taken. The same criticism might be made, however, of many passages in Sir Walter Scott's voluminous Introductions to his novels and romances. But Mrs. Humphry Ward, in giving her new novel to the world in book form,, was obviously confronted by the horns of a dilemma. To begin with, her earlier book, “ Lady Rose's Daughter,’* had been subjected to a great deal of piffling and ill-judged criticism because of the lack of just such a preface, explaining its relation to a certain story of real life, and its character as a novel of reincarnation," to quote the happy phrase used by our own reviewer, Mrs. Rice, in her admirable article published a fortnight since. Early in the appearance of The Marriage of William Ashe ” as a serial Its likeness to the historic story of the relations of ‘William Lamb, Lady Caroline, and Lord Byron was inevitably pointed out. Mrs. Ward's decision to point to this obvious resemblance in a preface was surely wise, in the circumstances. It may somewhat detract from the illusion of the earlier chapters of tho story. But the spell of the illusion in Mrs. Ward's stories is always strong, and in none is it stronger than in this. Meanwhile, Mr, Thomas Dixon, Jr., informs us, in an entertaining letter we publish this week, that it would have been an impossibility for him to^ note his indebt-: ; edness^tocertain ;tthaptera ;‘ In: Dr. ^ Craven's: book ~
