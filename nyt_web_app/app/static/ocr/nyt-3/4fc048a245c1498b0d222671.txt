This little volume gives in heroic couplets the r^tovy of the struggle between the North and the South as it seems to a man who was once a soldier in the Confederate Army. The author is a native of Georgia, and was born in	so he is
now somewhat advanced in years. Not the less on that account does he feel the thrill of the great days of which he sings \ and the heroes of which he celr-br-^pp, weaving in with the more illustrious names many humbler soldiers whose deeds (T-er-haps> came under the poet s own eye—hi* companions, fellow-Georgians. The poem begins with an expression of affection tor the I’nion of Slates which the war was ; meant to destroy, an affection which ! yielded only to a deeper affection for Ihe Smith and tlK- author's native Georgia; it tells of the niming cloud of the conflict, of Northern resolve to hold reluctant ; partners to a contract those partners j believed abrogated; it telis of Sumter, of , Bull Run. of McClellan's campaign, of I Antietani. Fredericksburg, Chancellors- I ville, Gettysburg; of the iron-clad ships , and their fights in Hampton Ronds and Oil the Mississippi; of the battles in the j West; of all the stormy events of which the histories of the eivil war are full. \ The poet sings not only of battle but of camp life, of weary marches, uf the girl he left behind him, and went back to marry, of i h<- fortitude of women as well as of the deeds of men. He sings, too, of course, of _ Sherman s " devastating blight ’—what Georgian would omit that: Through ravaged fields and devastated lands
Whose helphss people robbed by bummer bands.
In footnotes Mr. Derry has furnishrd details, dates, and figures of sm*h f«.cts t as h** thinks not entirety self-explana.ory j in ihe vaguer poetic guise. A good Geor- ; gian uiuoted in the prospectus) has spoken of the book as “ a compendious work of reference."
