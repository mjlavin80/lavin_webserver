he has set down as cases of direct borrowing, others he has chosen to " H+ustrate the extent of our classical heritage." He also shows that many of the passages said by critics to have been copied from the Greek or Roman authors were already commonplaces in classical times. Passages are cited from Tennyson's shorter and ; longer poems, his " Idyls of the King," 1 sonnets, " The Princess,” *■ Morte d'Ai
thiir, and other writings. Throughout the book are explanatory and reference notes, including Greek and English +.exts of passages quoted.

Those literary delvcrs who devote much time to seeking out the origins of literary species have recently been working more concisely and rationally than ever before. They have Improved both in charity and in genuine scholarship; have lost much of their petty faultfinding and petty
pedantry. As the study of comparative literature Is broadened their usefulness will become more marked. Unconsciously, perhaps, they have divided themselves into two schools—one which takes a literary personage and searches out his I sources of theme, phrase, and atmosphere in those who have preceded him, and the other which notes his effect and influence upon the writers who have followed him. The latter school is perhaps the more interesting and instructive* for, as Prof. Kuhns remarks in his “ Dante and the English Poets," “it would be of extreme value for the proper understanding of English literature if the influence upon it of all the great foreign writers could be investigated and summarized by specialists—not merely from a philological or scientific point of view, but with a sympathetic feeling for the aesthetic and psychological processes involved in the making of literature. • * * If some fuch plan were carried out in the case of Homer, Virgil, Cervantes, Tasso, Petrarch, Ariosto, Moliere, Boethe, and others the student of comparative literature would have to hand the material which now lies scattered over a wide field."
Of less general interest and value, but not without entertainment for the admirers of the literary personage whose sources and inspiration have been unearthed, is the other school which has recently found expression in a little volume I on Tennyson by Prof. Mustard, issued under the auspices of the department of English of Columbia University. The danger of going too far In such a work ia, of course, obvious. The author is often prone to seek for origins in specific things which for centuries have been generalities in thought and language. His researches, too, may result in the accusation of plagiarism in regard to what was merely a literary coincidence. It may be said at once, however, that Prof. Mustard writes without prejudice and with a wholesome perception of the idiosyncrasies of the poet's mindr of his knowledge, and his imagination. . Tennyson owed much to Homer, not only in themes and. feeling, but even in the choice of words—, all of which is .admirably set down in a most excellent chapter. - Excellent, too, are those chapters-showing where the late laureate gained inspiration from Lucretius, Catullus, Virgil, and Horace; where, also, he was Indebted for a phrase or figure from the Greek dramatists, prof. i Mustard is cautious in asserting Tenny* son’s direct Indebtedness to the origins he has discovered for us. Much of tho classical Influence in Tennyson evidently came to him Indirectly, and it is even possible, that he himself might be aston-iahed at certain sources noted by our author. But It is none, the less convenient to possess these origins, and, aside from its intrinsic worth, the little book is a marvelous tribute to .the poet’s power of poetical absorption, to his taste and discrimination in utilizing what had gone before* ■..■,	„	-..
