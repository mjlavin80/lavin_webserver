a Catholic was marked his father opposed particularly the inclination of his son to embrace holy orders. Mr. Lyne desig-^ nated this as ' monkish fiddlesticks.’ " It was about the time of the Tractarian movement In England.

in the monastery where he was the Superior there was a fire. Right into I the middle of tho flames walked the ! Monk, and the blaze went out of its own 1 accord.	" The tongues	of fire,”	writes
the lady, " were subservient to his will.”
! The Baroness is of the opinion that the fire was due to demoniacal influences. On one occasion when he was in an ail-| ins condition he was given, instead of brandy, a strong dose of laudanum, more than enough to kill an ordinary man.
I The opiate did not harm the Monk in the least; his health improved at once. During	the	building	of the	Abbey
Chuolh one of tho workmen was crushed by the fulling of a crateful of stones on him. “ The man was bruised to death, and when unearthed from his self-piled monument his poor body resembled a
distorted ‘mass of pulp' more than anything else.” The Monk was near, and secured a bottle oi Lourdes water and poured it over the “ impalpable man.” According to the Baroness, he became at once a	“ healthy	Britisher," and
walked homo to his cottage, ijvUiob was a mile away. With this same Lourdes water the Monk brought to life a child
who was dying of a terrible disease. There are many distressing1 accounts given of the troubles brought about by the presence of the Monk In a civilized country, such as England is supposed to be. such indignities an* almost Russian in	their	character.	The good	father
often figured in police courts, but never was tin* aggressor. The most serious charge ever made against him was of having kidnapped a minor, with the purpose of bringing him up so as to take holy orders. One bitter attack oil him was made by his own father, who taxed . him with being a “ thief and a dis- , honest person—one who had killed his i mother. * • * in 1800 the Monk of Llanthony paid America a visit.

His parents were well to do, and he rereived a Kood education. The mother of the man who was to give a great deal of trouble was of uncertain religious belief; the father belonged to the Church of England. The boy was high strung, for the author records that having once been whipped by a stupid master a “ long an<T dangerous illness ” followed, ” and for
days his life was almost despaired of, * • • The whole nervous system was, so to speak, annihilated by the shock-” The Baroness gives this further view of the Monk’s mental condition: “ All who are acquainted with the reverend father know that even now he is subject to the recurrence of distressing nervous symp-i toms.
