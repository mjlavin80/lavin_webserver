Charles Sumner once said. " The road and the schoolmaster are the two most important agents In advancing civilization." Mr. Archer Butter Hulbert's new volume on roadmaking in America is worthy of particular attention. It is depressing to be informed that " we have to-day probably the poorest roads of any civilized nation.'* But then it must be borne in mind that our roads cover not less than a million and a half of miles. The bad roads of the United States may be accounted for in this way. While we were making them there came the era of railways, and the dirt road was eclipsed by the iron one. We move freight more cheaply on our railroads than the rest of the world, but that does not suffice. There 1 never will be locomotives in the immedi- i ate neighborhood of many farms. The | calculation has been made lhat the aver- j age farm is a dozen miles from the rail- | road. Mr. Hulbert's estimate is that “ 75 per cent, of the commerce of the world starts for its destination on wagon roads, and we pay annually in the United States $(j00t000,000 freightage to get our produce-over our highways from the farms to the railways.’’ That is the material side of the study of transportation as far as the dirt road is concerncd, but there are other &nd not less important matters to be
' thought about.
; The question of poor roads or good ones has much to do with the social and moral life of our rural communities. Bad roads conflict with good public schools. To-day we have a rural postal delivery system which is sorely hampered by impracticable roads. Even in the immediate proximity of New York Cily the work of the reral Post Office man becomes the most laborious of duties.
Mr. Hulbert’s :>ymposimn includes "Government Co-operation in Object-Lrsson Koaa Work,” by Martin Dodge; Maurice
O.	Eidridge’s ” tiooil Roads for Farmers,” Prof. Logan Waller Fago's “ The Selection or Materials tor Macadam Hoads,” and E. G. Harrison’s “ Stone Roads in New Jersey.” The principles laid down by Macadam and Telford for roadbuilding arc 11 explained. In tho United States machine-broken stone is deemed preferable to stone broken by band. 14 is true that hand-broken Ftonc in more uniform in shape, but th»’ mechanical method pives much cheaper kloih , ‘inti then it ran hr-assorted or screened.
