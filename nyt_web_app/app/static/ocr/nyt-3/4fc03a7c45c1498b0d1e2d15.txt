UK name of Hawthorne inevitably suggests mystery of mood and a classic phraseology. In this little group of unpretentious poems by the granddaughter of Nathaniel Hawthorn*’ neither is conspicuous. hut over them all a graceful fancy presides with more or less distinction. The linos entitled “A Statue ” contain something of the spirit of the “ Twice-Told Tales," though they lack the crystalline quality of those perfect fragments of English prose.
Yea, I have lived! Pass on And trouble me with questions nevermore.
I suffered. I have won A solemn peace—my pea^e forevermorc. Leave me in silence here!
I have no hope, no care, f know no fear.
For I ha,vo borne—but now no longtr bear.
Deep-hid sorrow calls me kin, tlut my calm she cannot break.
1 know "not good—I know not sin—
Nor love nor hate can me awake.
Though I have sought I care not now to find.
If I have asked, I wait for no reply.
M v eyes from too much seeing are grown
*	blind.
I am not dead, yet do not need to die.
Pass on; ye cannot reash me any more;
Pas^ on—for all is past!
Hush! silence settles ever more and more; Silence and night at last.
In Miss Hawthorne's work a certain respect for the purity of the poetic impulse is invariably felt. She neither trifles nor bungles with her art, but approaches it sincerely and with intelligence. Her verse, therefore, even when it is of the slightest, has a delicate, veracious properly that charms.
In " Love Sonnets to TSrmingarde '* a more sophisticated note is heard. These, nevertheless, are decidedly not negligible in the mass of mediocre production sent forth by the poets of the day. They are refined in form, rich in feeling, and swarm with suggestions that appeal to the bookish mind. The ninety-first sonnet is, however. a robust protest against the bookish mind:
Who dulls his eye In reading Wisdom’s
page,	^	,	.
To learn of life in musty leaves of
books?	,	,	_
What more renowned than knowledge of the sage
Who but abroad In Nature s college looks ?
More truly taught is he who but observes	.
The lessons of the earth, the sea, the sky,
Thao he who in his memory preserves The dead cold seeing of another’s eye.
So from the source of Nature’s Academc I draw my inspiration for thy love.
And all the dearer do those lessons deem For coming from our reason’s last remove:	,	.	.
Who for an essay on love s sweetness
C3XOS	,
When golden butterfl^s drift by in
pairs?
This certainly is the right attitude for a poet or writer of any kind who wishes his work to have a lusty flavor of the good brown earth, an open-air freshness of sentiment, a fragrance *bf wood life and field life. But it must be said that when one's glass holds but a moderate amount of the potent poetic essence the mere names of bookish joys add a pleasant color to the unstimulating draught. In the slender collection of tasteful verses by the late John Paul Bocock, the author's literary tendencies and zest as a bibliophile lend character to his accomplishment. The title poem has. the true ring of the passionate collector:
Golden gospels of King Henry,
Writ in uncials of gold	.
On the vellum’s royal purple,
By the cloistered scribes of old;
In these, pages kings and sages For a thousand' years have pondered On the book that still is deathless When the gold of tiarth Is squandered.
How a splendid, patient cunning Decked 41 the Romance of the Rose! n In clear gold and gorgeous colors Every page immortal glows;
Charles the‘Ninth has 'pored upon them, Byt ncr trace of cruel fingers .
Mars the fair leaves where the fragrance Of the rose ot love still Ungers.
Shade of Gutenberg, bear witness To the Bible twice immortal:
First and fairest book imprinted,
Lamp that guides to heaven’s portal; Fust and. Schoeffer, fit companion To the. Bible is your Psalter;
“ Grandest, treasure ever offered Upon learning's holy altar.*'
Hero the 1470 Virgil Shows liis face illuminated;
Here tho Doge’s vellum Livy Tintoretto-decorated,
And St. Augustine, on vellum—
Mfen would die for one such treasure— Stand with rows of priceless Caxtons Waiting on Maecenas' pleasure.

the strong religious feeling, simple and fervent in its expression, that inspires the greater number of poems. An air of devotion, suggesting Fra Angelico, or even Cimubuc. gives the archaic forms of sueh songs as those entitled “ The Sinner and the Violets,” “ Orate pro Me," and Mother Love in AfLer Years ” a grace of spirit altogether lovely. ’* April Days," by Luella CmrK, has also much religions sentiment between its covers, but lacks tho touch of ecstasy inseparable from the higher forms of religious feeling. The purely mundane poems are devoted to the more obvious sights and sounds of nature, and are typical of the general enthusiasm over robins and violets to be expected in February and March.
