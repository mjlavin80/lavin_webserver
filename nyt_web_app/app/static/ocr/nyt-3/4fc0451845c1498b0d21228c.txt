Philip English off Salem^
New York Times Book Review:
In your review of a book on the old shipmasters and merchants of Salem, it is stated that. Philip English was a na-tivovot England* Is not that a mistake? Was he not a native of the Isle of Jersey, in the English Channel, and is not the name, Philip English, a translation of Philipe l’Anglois? That was the tradition in Salem, if I am not incorrectly informed- He brought over from his native islands a considerable number of young Frenchmen, or “ Jerseymen," as they were called. These he employed in his fishing business, and their descendants can be found even at this late date along the coast of Massachusetts, bearing the old French names.
Tho zealous Puritans of his time were angered at his refusal to contribute to the support of ; the dissenting Church. He thought it enough to support the Episcopal Church, to which he attached himself in common with many of the Huguenots who came to this country. The form of worship in the two Churches was very similar.
His kindly neighbors fastened upon him a charge of witchcraft, and imprisoned him and his wife until his ample fortune wag dissipated and his house was plundered. He was so far from being of English birth that he kept his accounts in French.	HORACE	GRAVES.
