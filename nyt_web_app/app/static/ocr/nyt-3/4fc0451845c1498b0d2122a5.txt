Branches of that quickly growing English society called the Dickens Fellowship were established some time ago in Marshall, Mich., and Chester, Penn. The organization of a New York branch is now under way. This Fellowship is merely a league of admirers of Dickens and believers in the beneficence of his influence. Since its inception, in the Autumn
■
of H>02, branches have been established all over the world. The claims of the Fellowship are modest.
| The English society has monthly dinners which are also feasts of reason. The cost of membership in the New York branch will be trifling, and each person who is permitted to pay it will receive a certificate of membership, a copy of the annual report, and a monthly copy of The Dickensian, a magazine devoted to the memory of Dickens and^he Fellowship. We could wish that this periodical had been named the Dickens Magazine. We could also wish that the Fellowship had been called the Dickens League or Guild or Society. But those are trifles. The Fellowship thrives, and we do not doubt that the New York branch will presently flourish like a green bay tree, as it deserves to. By and large the influence of Dickens is beneficent and deserves to be extended over the whole earth.
