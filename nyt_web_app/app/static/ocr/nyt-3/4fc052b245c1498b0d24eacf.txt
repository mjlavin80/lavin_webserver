Some Further Arguments fn Behalf off Folks Wha Mark Books. ''
tfctc York Times Book Review:
AY I assure “-S. B." that aft your readers do not look askance at book markers? I om a firm believer ‘in the ' practice* and do not take very kindly to the idea of Any restrictions in the intercourse between author and reader. On the whole I should prefer more familiarity , than there is at present to less. I cannot denounce even the marker of public library books with any snow or heartiness.
Of course, there Is an Impropriety about marking in a book belonging to the pub-lie; still, after all. there is such a splendid heedlessness about it, such a divine forgetfulness of low material consldera-tions, such a high-minded indifference to
the commonplace xneuxn and teura, that I am almost inclined to regard the mark-era a3 at least a poor relation of genius. Marking of this sort Is like the uncon-sclous grin or the sympathetic tear of the absorbed reader. It is a bit of spoutane-ous applause, and not always from the galleries either. It is an unbending .of dignity in congenial company, a putting of one's intellectual elbows on the table, so to speak. The author is really more to blame than the marker. He seems often fairly to invite one's intimacy, and impulsive, demonstrative natures, unduly puffed up by the favor* are likely to respond too readily. They may even begin to consider their own ordinary opinions of equal value to those of the author. But what can be done about it?.Jf the markers cannot be suffered gladly, at least tbey might £»e suffered without such
needlessly ferocious denunciation as they have been receiving, i tt may be said that those to whom ob-|	Jection has been made are not of this
!	class.	Perhaps not. It is, however, dif.	ficult	to judge. So much depends on
!	what	the reader brings to the text, and
j	great	atlowance must be made for differ-
ence in tastes. There may even be dishonest. pretentious, hypocritical markers.
I have never met any, and L fail to see what inducement a library boofc at least would offer them.
I make no reflections on the reading ability of those to whom the marker is an offense. It is not given to us all to be even as those readers of Leigh Hunt's who could read untroubled in the streets. There are many extraneous things in books that annoy me. But if I stop to consider the marking it is with pleasure that ottier people have read and read with satisfaction. Those two virtues of the book marker at least have, I believe, not been called in question.
I admit again sorrowfully that readers should not mark in library books. It does seem, however, as if some provision should be made for this most natural instinct. I noted with hearty approval the suggestion in Gerald Stanley Lee's " Lost Art of Reading *' regarding the reservation of a certain tract of library space where readers afflicted with country minds might browse unconHned. Could not, I wonder, something similar be done for the book markers? A room set apart for them would be a great convenience.
It should be large and commodious, well stocked with anthologies, books of quotations, criticisms, and the like. The books should be of hai-dy size, well bound, and printeu on rough p?.per with blank pages at frequent intervals and with pencil attached. It ought to be an instructive and inspiring sight for outsiders to behold— from a distance, of course—the opportunities given to *‘ read, mark, learn, and inwardly digestTt—to look oh, as it were, at culture in the making. They might even begin to realize that the second part of the process was quite as necessary as the others.	K.	G. W.
