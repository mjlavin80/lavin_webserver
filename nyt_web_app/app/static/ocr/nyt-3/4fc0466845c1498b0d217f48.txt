OLD ITLOKENCE AND MODERN TC3‘ CANY. By Janet Rpss- With Illuatra- : cions. Square 12rn6. Pp. 230. New York: | £. I*. Dutton & Co.	;
The collection of papers issued with the title “ Old Florence and Modern Tuscany ** forms a delightful series of contrasts, which is sure to appeal to persons who have come under the spell of things Italian. Written with a distinct and common inspiration and with undoubted joy in transcription, these papers deal with a variety of subjects, evidently representing those things in which the author found her greatest pleasure—whether entailing research or observation. They are impressions over which she has fondly lingered and ultimately put in print with the idea that there is a public sufficiently worthy to share her joys of possession. And most of the impressions which she has nurtured and set forth with data concern unusual although not sensational things.
Most visitors to Florence have been surprised at some time in their sojourn to see an array of black-robed figures silently bearing a curious covered litter through *the street, and have noticed that all heads were uncovered as the cortege passed by. They have been told that it was the Brotherhood of Pity bent on an errand of mercy. This brotherhood is an interesting organization, the beginning of which dates from the fourteenth century. In the opening chapter of the book we have it described, not in the listless, perfunctory fashion of guide books, but with enthusiasm and a knowledge gained from obscure sources. The same style characterizes the chapters on old Florentine customs, '* A Domestic Chaplain of the Medici ” and " Two Florentine Hospitals,” and then come those papers from whicn the second title of the book is derived— ** Popular Songs of Tuscany,” *' Vintaging In Tuscany," " Oil-Makfng in Tuscany,” *' A Stroll in Boccaccio’s Country," &c. The variety and independent treatment of the subjects are sure to arouse more than one answering chord In the hearts of those who love Italy.
Of the fifteen chapters in the book only four are printed for the first time. They are: " The Jubilee of a Crucifix,” *' Mez-zeria: or, Land Tenure in Tuscany," “ San Gimignano delle Belle Torre,” and " Two Florentine Hospitals." Tho other eleven chapters, dealing with the Brotherhood of Pity in Florence, Old Florence, a domestic chaplain of the Medici, vlntaging and oil-making in Tuscany, Volterra, the Valley of the Arno, and popular songs of Tuscany have appeared in The English Illustrated Magazine, Macmillan’s Magazine, The British National Review, The British Monthly Review, Longman’s Magazine, and Fraser’s Magazine.
With the exception of the frontispiece, wliich Is a photogravure reproduction of a photograph of the Brotherhood of Pity of Florence, the illustrations are reproductions in half-tone of pen-and-ink sketches by the Misses Nelly Erichsen and Adelaide March i.
