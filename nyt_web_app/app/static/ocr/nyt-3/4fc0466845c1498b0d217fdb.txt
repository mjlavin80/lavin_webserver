The winged hel met which gives this slory its name. at once suggestive Ot' w;ir and magic. is really only a. Invar's tnk^n embroidered upon a handkerchief. lint Up* pl.K'o is Fra 11 re in tin1 reign nf Francis I . and th1 mimic events revolve about tho figures of :i very jealous nobleman and his lady, most unjustly suspected and ill-used by hor li>rd--even made to surT>r blows of his nob’.n right hand. However. th^ unfortunate lady has a lady's inaid, a girl of beavty and high courage. Shi* it is who tells the great lord what she thinks of him, she it is wim hy a sturdy lover's help escapes the lord s vengeance and flies away to keep a prosperous brother’s inn while her iiiisiri.sK is haled to a convent and locked up there fur safe keeping. In due rime <as wars rage and treasons multiplv> this lady's maid has a chance to place a very larg>* carving knife revi ;l»e )iand <d a mar unarmed and innocently supping with t reach Till'S foe.-, themselves walking arsenals. Later :-lie beguiles the wickedest possible villain to a 'piieksand, and wh"n the ooze has got him fast sits and j< its ;tl him ;is 1* sinks out of sicrlit. True, he had plott*d to sell a lovely dame- her mistress, no less—to Saracen piratis. and thoroughly deserved his fate. But in the end for such dt*-ds as liiese the jealtus nobleman (repentant of his injustice and reconciled to his wife and she to himt makes the maid a belted knight under the name of the l^idy of K:i vcl le.
T+ri-s and tin* clnnmslani'o of the carving knife are certainly incidents a little out of the ordinary in modern light romances «»f knights and ladies, donjons, the ba tl lefield. the bower, the rack, and the greenwood. Nevertheless Mr. Harold SteHe Mackaye's book is just sucn a light romance - rather under average weight in fnei. Nor in spite of the wings nn the
helmet and the out-of-the-common incidents mentioned, does it make up in spirit what it lacks in baser qualities. It cannot carry even its own feathery self as
a gallant should. Rather it seems to drug and move its feet as you see automatic figures do. or those patient artists who unman themselves and stiffly personate automata upon the stage.
