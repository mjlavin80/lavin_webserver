THROUGH INDIA.
A Visit to the Old Temples and the Ruins^.Described in a New Book.*
HTtOUGp Town and Jungle,’’ ■with its 200 illustrations, is a handsome book describing a journey of 14,c00 milci on £1 cycle among- *' tho temples an,d people of India.'* large portion of the textr is devoted to the study’of Indian „architecture, there is ample space given to the life of the people. As far as the past is concerned, India is a land of decadence. The builders have passed away centuries ago and the ruins stand “ in the midst Of lonely and inaccessible jungles." This is the description of a# jungle:
The jungle of this region (Mysore) conforms to one’s preconceived ideas of tropica) jungrlcs dprived from tales of the East; of areas covered with rank vegetation, where vast masses of bamboo form au impenetrable barrier; where giant trees rise thick, smothered with snaky creepers which hang in interlacing festoons *’ith their lofty tops; where here and there i openings occur through which the sunlight falls aslant prostrate decaying trunks, and tall grass borders a pool of sluggish water into which a moss-covered bough falls with a splash that makes one shiver, even at a temperature of ti-* degrees: where the air is. heavy and s.ient and the breeze never blows and the biras never sing; a fitting place for the lairs of fierce wifd beasts, while with nerves ajar one is ever expecting that something uncanny may appear to break the spell cast upon a jungle world.
The impressions the European derives from seeing the monuments of India are various. They represent religious thought and tradition. They take a specific form, just as ha%fe done Christian religious structures. It may be that the origin Of these particular forms wfll never be discovered. What do we know concerning the origin of Gothic architecture? The old iLasters. so it is said, wanted to show the effects of shadow. That seems so vague, but endless have been the pages devoted to that single topic, " shade." The main idea of the early Indian architect &as mass. He piled one story upon another, with sometimes little discrimination as to the demarcations of the various lofts. Sometimes the impression derived is like one may notice when there is a great quantity or barrels heaped one layer above m ol her. Certainly' when there is magnitude the effects are imposing. . There are, however, notable peculiarities whifch must not be overlooked, where very great art becomes manifest. It is when the minor details are studied. For instance, tl-.ere the Somnapur Temple, an edifice of moderate height, but there is not a square inch without decoration. The authors write:
To construct a building of less than thirty-five feet in height, load it trom top to bottom with carving, and produce the effect not only of beauty and perfect symmetry. but also of impressiveness, shows supreme talent on the part of the architects. * * * First come the elephants, typical of Indian temple life, and after th^m horsemen, above them a fine scroll interspersed with shardala .heads, gro-te-ami-* lions, the emblem of the Belinda k5ng«. in whose dynasty this temple was built: fourth, a complicated scene from th« Mahabharata. which epic s-	~
illustrated m its entirety fn fifth, with strange celestial above all, the sacred geese.
There are six styles of architecture in India—the Buddhist, Indian-Aryan, Jain, Dravidian, Chalnkyan, and Mohammedan. There is relationship between the first five, but the last stands out alone, save when the followers of Islam converted tiie worshippers of Buddha’s temple to their own creed. Generally when the Faithful got hold of an Indian temple the figures and statues were destroyed. The mosques of India are for the larger part fine specimens of architecture, the lines following those of the middle Orient. It is somewhat of a surprise to read that the aii/hors did not look with admiration on the Taj Mahal, which heretofore has been held as the most beautiful of all modern
Mohammedan work.
It was only the other day that an announcement was made that India was about to renew the manufacture of iron. In the volume there is a print of a great wheel, one of the outside ornaments of tlie ruined Black Pasoda at Koronak, and above it there protrudes an iron beam, which once supported an upper stone ceiling. This shows^Ihat the Indians knew all nhout forging iron, some time between the ninth and thirteenth centuries. The shrine of Jagannath is stiil the sacred place for pilgrims coming from all parts of India. Our travelers write:
Furi has been called ihe most holy city in the world. With its strange god, who for centuries lias exercised such a supreme fasc’-nation over the minds of myriads of Hindus, and its curious car, which *n tho past enjoyed such prestige, it has indeed merited the reputation from a theatrical point of view. The car no longer promenades upon the flesh and bones of overwrought fanaticism, hut tho legnnd has penetiated all lands and liter* a lure. * * * In reality ihe wheels are the reverse of mighty, .and tlK-y did 1101 in the palmiest days grind down so many victims as has been asserted.

Vegetation is one of the causes of-the de* si ruction of the old temples. >	.
Seeds are deposited upon a. building. They sprout, develop into bushes; and j later into trees. Slender xootlets are sent ; out, which insert . themselves. into thOf! crevices between the stones. Here, In spite of pressure and narrow space, they grow and flourish/ and, as they increase in size, force the^blocks gradually apart, until tlicjse become loosened from their, places and fall to the ground. Often large masses of masonry are thus separated from the building. When a fringe of tropical .vegetation has established itself on a building," be the latter ever so solid, if the growth be allowed to continue the days of that building are numbered.
A strange conclusion arrived at by some English archaeologists is that building in stone by the Buddhists must have been taken from the Greeks, after the invasion of India by Alexander, for before then wood was the only material used. What is indeed surprising is the adornment of certain temples with frescos; the drawing is perfect and the coloring excellent.
Some of the incidents along the road are well told. ,
At a village about ten miles from Calcutta, on the banks of the Hoogly, we saw for the first time a native cremation. A man of apparently sixty years was performing the last rites to the body of his father. The funeral pyre was erected close to the edge of the water, a ^ew feet from the road. The legs of the corpse were bent backward and fastened under* the thighs, and the arms under the back. Thus arranged, the corpse was laid on the pyre about two feet from the ground and covered with several layers of billets of wood, the closely-shaven head protruding from one end. The fire was burning briskly as we rode up, and the man was walking around the fire, throwing incense into the flames and calling upon. Kali to lend her favor to the ceremony. The man was alone; his neighbors were busy with their usual occupations in the immediate vicinity, and no one seemed to take any interest in his proceedings.
