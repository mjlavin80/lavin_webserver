From photographs and printed text we are supposed to know some little about tho aspect of the greater cities of Italy, but our acquaintance with the smaller towns is scanty. When you fol- j low Katharine Hooker’s “ Wayfarers in Italy " yon leave the beaten track and take a most enchanting journey. Now : you got a better insight into the period of the Renaissance and wonder ai Its magnificences and its crimes. The author has good taste and w<$nts particularly lo see things of which the general tourist has not the faintest conception. Her delight is to discover pictures which have
escaped general observation. She* hun^O for lost Madonnas, and generally finds them. She has, too, a taste for old books, and lights on them in the most out-of-the-way places. The ordinary habits and customs of the Italian peasant she tolls about. You are amazed nt the strange mixture of Christianity and pagannrn. For instance in the Marches, the village mother lays in the coffin of her dead child '■ the toys he has played wii.li in life, and presses into the child's cold palm a silver coin for the ferry of Charon. Incidentally we hear something about the payment of duties in Italy. “A gentleman who goes out for a day s fishing in the country must pay a duty upon his basket when he returns. If you wished to carry some provisions with you on a trip that led through several town.-, you would be obliged to pay at every gale, and if chance led you at last to carry them home again unconsumed, another duty would be demanded at the very threshold you first carried them over."
Which of the cities would you make
your residence in Italy? There is a saying full of truth which runs. “See Naples, visit Home, live in Florence.”
It was in the " Heart of I mbriu, that the lady met certain honest peasants, , and as they were curious to know some- | thing about the I'nited States, they were
given information. They were astonished ; and said: " We cannot even read; we are j poor and ignorant. Tell us. you who can i understand these things, why is it that there is this great difference in the lots of human creatures':	They	tell	us	that	God
is good, then why are you rich and at ease while we live the life of a dog—una j vita di cane V "	“ Wayfarers in Italy" is
well deserving of the many editions it has 1 passed through.	|
