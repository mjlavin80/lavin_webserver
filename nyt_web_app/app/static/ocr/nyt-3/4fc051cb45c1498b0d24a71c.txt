In a fdrmer volume of v Early Western Travels ” the settlements founded in' Illinois by the two Englishmen, Birkbcck and Slower, were described. After the war bf 1S12 there was a sudden revival at emigration, jiir. Reuben Gold Thwaites writes that in articles, pamphlets, and books published In England intending* emigrants were alternately cajoled aid terrified, "and life in America was paint-«d as a paradise or aptrrgatory, according to the whim of the author or hia personal predilections.'’ In 1S14 The Lon* don Quarterly, edited by Gifford, began a series of articles, in the guise of open caricatures, aimed at all things American. For ten years, at varying intervals, both in London and Edinburgh, magazines indulged in acrimonious articles of this character, which were answered with recriminations hy The North American Review and a number of reputable American authors.
William Faux, the author of " Memorable Days in America," was the subject of sharp attack. In the volume under notice, the eleventh of the series, there is a copy of his work, supplemented with interesting notes supplied by the editor. Faux, who styles himself an English farmer, landed at Boston in 1819. Thence he took a sailing vessel for Charleston, and returned to Philadelphia. Starting from Philadelphia, he proceeded to Wheeling, and from there went to Vincennes, Ind., by way of Zanesville, MaysvIHe, Lexington, and Louisville. He spent two months at the Birkbeck-Flower settlements, and in 1820 went eastward, visiting Pittsburg and Washington. He spent six months in Washington, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, returning to England in 1820. Faux had a large circle of friends in England, and many of them having come to the United States, he was always looking them up and learning what were their experiences. In South Carolina Faux became horrified with some of the aspects of slavery. He found that a negro had been whipped to death near Columbia. He wrote a spirited letter to The Charleston Courier concerning this outrage, and his article caused much excitement in the city. While in Philadelphia he met an English friend who tried^o describe the conditions of the English emigrant.
The Englishman thinks nothing good or right but what is English in theorv and practice. He thinks his system and mode of farming must be the best hue he would do well to try it only on a small scale, and not rashly lay aside what is American and well tried, for those who have long lived on the soil must certainly know what is the best.
Leaving1 Philadelphia he swiftly glided down the Delaware in a superb steamboat. 60 yards long, 14 broad, and moving from 10 to 12 miles an hour. Arriving at Baltimore, he went from there to ^Washington, and thence to Harper’s Fef-ry. Finally he reached Louisville. The number of steamboats astounded him. There were not fewer than twelve. The finest was the United States, and he compares it to a floating hotel, ** a little less than the London Tavern.” The cost of passage to New Orleans was $75. At the conclusion he writes to those who may want to come to the United States:
If you conie, come one and nil of you, male and female, in your working jackets with axes, ploughshares, and pruning hooks m your hands, prepared Jong lo suffer many privations, expecting to be your own servants—no man’s roasters; to find liberty and independence, anything but self-indulgence, and America a land only of everlasting, well-reWarded labor.
