E.	P. Powell writes in his Introduction to " The Orchard and Pruit Garden ” concerning the object of the book:
The object of this volume is to furnish ! a thoroughly reliable book for those who are establishing their homes on the Improved basis of agriculture, and especially to assist those who are escaping from the confinement of city life to the freedom and luxuries of a country home. It has not been the purpose to furnish an exhaustive treatise on orchard fruits ancL-fruit gardens.
The book is down for publication March
2	j by McClure* Phillips & Co., and will be the second volume in the Country Home library, of which' the author's " Country Honi,e " was the first. It gives advice as to what are the best kinds of fruit to plant, what are the best species for different localities, what are the best meth- j ods of cultivation, and the best way to • avoid and combat the diseases and pests 1 likely to attack each fruit.
