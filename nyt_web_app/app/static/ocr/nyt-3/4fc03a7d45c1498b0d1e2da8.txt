JN OAK library table stands before a long line of book shelves. It is empty save for two books lying on opposite corners. One is a substantial octavo in plain dark binding1, the other a twelvemo, in dainty green and white covers. In the corner of the room by a window is the working desk littered with paper?.
" Twelvemo, (“ Another Hardy Garden Book,addressing Octavo—We seem to oe the first arrivals. What are you doing here?
Octavo <" A Gardener’s Year ")—Did you speak? Twelvemo—Yes, I asked what you are doing here. Perhaps you may not know that this is the table where Nature books wait until they are “ reviewed " by the critic yonder, who just now seems more interested in that half-frozen yellow crocus under the window than in me. Then presently the good ones, those that either have a single new idea or tell old ones in a way that makes them new, graduate to the book shelves; while the poor ones vanish, some" In " missionary barrels " to .he West, while some go to the burning ghat in the brush lot.	'
Octavo—I also belong on this table. I am a Nature book, or at least a book on gardening, though perhaps the two are not the same, according to some recent ratings I have read of unnatural nature writings.	’
Twelvemo (excitedly)—How delightful, so am I; now we have something in common to talk about. You look so solemn in that dark blue robe that I mistook you for a volume of Lenten sermons gone astray!	#
Octavo—Surely you should not objoot to them, as they lead up to the Easter lilies that you wear. But. pray pardon me, it's rather awkward, I don't know your name—we[ve not b^en introduced. _ Twelvemo—Yes, I seriously object to anything gloomy or to talk, of dust or ashes, except considered as garden soil and fertilizer. My lilies are always in bloom, my garden has more flowers than leaves, only fools fail, and I am leading many others In the path of rural optimism. But the introduction? It might be managed by mutual friends. Do you by chance see any garden acquaintances upon
those shelves?
Octavo—Yes, there is Elizabeth, who is'really a countrywoman of mine, though she ignores it. I'was' made in England.
Twelvemo—Barbara can stand for The. Xo be sure ' she isn’t quite in my class; they are commuters, while we are more leisurely, more of week-enders. We buy seeds, bulbs, plants con amore and use more manure for one single bed than they for their .whole garden. You do not sense the difference 7 Perhaps j being English-born you may find our little gradations a trifle subtle.
El izabeth steps dow n. Dressed in gracef ully draped, rippling muslin, three little girls in white bonnets following her. Wearing an amused smile, composed of three-fourths good humor and- on^- ' fourth satire, she comes forward to mfeet Barbara, who enters clad in a brown linen apron, her hands' full of hepat^cas, while old Bluff follows at her taeetsi
Elizabeth—Ofoly twfo garden hooks, and it is well into March. I haven't seen such a slim attendance -here since I set the fashion of the outdoor confes^ slonal.	,	"
Barbara—For which we shall always thanV you,; because if you had not been inspired to take the lead we might never have dared to think people would care to know about our gardens, as they , really do. But as to the small supply of books here, , you know. Cousin Elizabeth, that it has been a very cold Spring so far.	*	?
Elizabeth—By the way, when is it Spring In ' America?	’
Barbara—When? I must admit it is rather a ^ doubtful matter. Evan says It is Spring when he

ttie night is a -thing that may be l . _t—it Is so deep. No leaf stirs upon-the trees, nobird' sings. The bats flitter and wheel, the moths fade past the belated’ humble bee or it . may be a beetle, drones it3 way homeward. Out yon'Ser over the lawn appears and disappears a whita and ghostly shape, that of a hawking owl. This is all; the rest is sleep and silence; while above in the blue the planets spring out singly. Now darkness comes and ihe tall many-colored rods of the foxgloves gather one hue ot gray; the golden iris flowers gleam like falling stars about the borders, and the gloom is heavy with the odor of ver=. bena, of roses and of flowering laurel. It is well to enjoy such nights-while one can, for they are few in England*
Barbara—Peace go with you, Rider Haggard, and to the brotherhood with which you wouitf colonize and make bloom the African waste places. (Mood changes as she reads over Elizabeth’s shoulder again.) I’ve found something that he doesn't know, and that is bugs! He guesses, American fashion, that wire worms are the young of daddy-longlegs. Of course, our daddys and the English ones are different, but even English daddys could hardly produce wire worms for they are the larvae of the clink beetle! Oh, how I sympathize with this—** the great curse "of gardening is names; they are as the

. intended! ”
:	Elizabeth—How glum those two books
look! Let us set them talking, and see what tt.ey have to say for themselves. I'll glance through this, do you take the ; other, HJmmel! " A Gardener’s Year M 400 pages tong by—Rider Haggard!
So after living over a score of ro-mantle lives he’s come to Earth at last; though I seem to remember she was his first mistress, whom he lias never thrown aside.
Barbara—Who knows but She-Who-
-	Must-Be-Obeyed was suggested by Nature herself, for surely nobody else can be so fascinating and so awful. How does the book read? Is it fantastic?
Elizabeth—No, on the contrary (turning the leaves slowly) it seems an admirable book- Serious, well balanced, pays attention to all the economies, and yet is poetic in parts. He follows the year through sanely, month by month, with the work, play, disappointments, and pleasures of each duly treated. I shall borrow this to read to the Man of Wrath whenever he hints that gardening is a frivoious amusement. In fact, I like the method so well that if ever I write another book I shall call it “ Pleasures and Pitfalls of a Garden." Hear how he bows meekly before his subject: "Many a book have I sat down to commence, all of them with humble heart, but none that I can remember in quite such earnest fear and trembling as this Gardener’s Diary for the Year 1003. For more seasons than I care to count I have been a gardener in sundry lands, following that most ancient craft with a single mind, and not, I hope, without learning some of its mysteries. And yet how much remains to learn more than ever can be learned by me.”
Barbara—Then surely he must write well on gardening, for if neither a garden nor a gardener can be made in one generation, as it takes a fine sort of heredity of air and soil and environment for either, the same must apply to the writer on gardening. They say that Haggard has now come over here to study ways for getting the poor into the fields to work out their physical salvation and win homes, so that his goal must be one of the highest possible. The only drawback to the reading of English garden books is that, outside of the literary pleasure they often give, they tantalize by telling of so much that we cannot do.
To be sure, we can climb oar peach trees and fill our mouths and aprons at will, while they either house theirs under glass or hang them against walls to be gazed at like the expensive pictures they are. I think perhaps it is because we are so new at it that the moment our garden books bid to be popular they lack exactness, and instead of being served in courses, like a proper meal, are like the queer hybrid salads with which some hostesses confuse the stomach.
Elizabeth—Come, come, pray don’t begin to take this gardening so seriously.
If we do this before it has become more than a fad people will stow shy of It. What is that book by you, all decked in May Day green, a sort of “Sesame and Lilies ' ’ combination ?
Barbara—“ Another Hardy Garden Book,’’ by Mrs. Ely. It looks very attractive, and not too long, a scant 250 pages. Eight chapters in all—an introduction, " The Vegetable Garden,"
" Fruits,” " A Little About Trees," (a very little,) " Perennials,’* " A Garden of Lilies and Iris,’’ " Autumn Work," and “ The Flower Garden in Spring."
Elizabeth—H I remember, it is by the same author as " A Woman’s Hardy Garden," a really infectious book, though I should owe it a grudge, for, if I remember aright, she said in it that she only got one new idea from my beloved German garden, and that was to sow pansies under the rose bushes, to cover their long, unsightly legs. Shall we get the mate-to the idea in her book, think you? (Reading over Barbara's shoulder.) She poses for the spiritual, too, but perhaps she also has trouble with her Man of Wrath over taking too much land lor her flowers.
Barbara—She says that a woman's heart in gardening is with her flowers and shrubs, while the man turns to what he can eat—that Elijah grew bored at living I on bird (nod by a murmuring brook and rraved th** widow s cakes! Listen, Cousin j EUzal‘*th: "is there not a saying about the v. v ;n a man's heart? Cut are not j many wnmm indifferent to what tin y j eat? * *	* f	them	food is rat In y a	:

Elizabeth -S11■ ■ is clever; she saves her veracity by qualifying that statement with " I imagine." For a moment I thought she must either have dyspepsia or be on a dkt.
Barbara—Personally speaking, I have j too good an appetite to agree with her. But then I have always suspected that I ■
" ' ■ * . -x J * ■ ■ ; am a pagan. In iact. I have a material streak in me that finds an'intense satisfaction in pot herbs and soup -vegetables, as well as in roses and honeysuckles. Father says that ." hungry sentiment develops melancholy and. well-fed sentl- ! men enthusiasm and I am an enthusiast.
Elizabeth—She half apologizes for her interest in vegetables. Perhaps that is the reason that her acquaintance is not as intimate with them as with her flowers.
Barbara (still reading}—I wish that we had such wonderful soil in our garden as she has, (this book is all written from her own experience,) for she has grown in a plot "20 by 30 feet " (smaller than a city yard) enough tomatoes, cauliflowers, eggplants, peppers, lettuce, and parsley for a family of eight persons, using four dozen cauliflowers, four dozen eggplants, two dozen peppers, three dozen tomatoes, three crops of lettuce, and sufficient parsley. I think Rtder Haggard would do well to note this for the home gardens of his poor. Also she says that ** four quarts of pea seeds will raise an ample quantity for a medium-sized American family." What say you to that, Elizabeth?
Elizabeth—Wtmderschon! I think the statements are truly American; though, from what I’ve read, a moderate-sized family in America consists of two.
Barbara—No; it Is her wonderful soil.
It must be, for we plant peas twelve times from March until August, one quart each time, in two long double rows, and we eat them all, of course letting the orioles have a few, but we are seven. Yes; it is her soil, for she scorns the tall, deep-rooted marrowfat peas for the middle season and plants only Little Gem and American Wonder, both early dwarfs, for the main crop. With us these would wither up at Midsummer, and such low-growing things are a back-breaking job to pick.
Elizabeth—Most likely her gardener has short legs, and she accommodates her crop to him. I once had to have a table put on stilts to placate a tail kitchen maid. But read on, Barbara—hero is courage and conviction for you: "Any one can raise mushrooms "—(here follow directions)—" few people are patent enough to do this * *	* and in corise-
quence raise no mushrooms. They even say, ' It is a matter of luck,’ or ' Raising mushrooms is very difficult,’ although it is simply a matter of absolutely following the rules which experience has proved to be essential."
Barbara—I know nothing about mush* rooms except those we pick in the fields, but if they are so easily grown, why are they always so expensive in the market?
(Meanwhile " A Gardener's Year " has^ been growing very restless and finally breaks into the conversation.)
Octavo—Pardon me, ladies, but mush* rooms, like many other things in gardening, must be taken seriously. I much dislike to contradict a woman, but 1 must venture to disagree with my charming friend of A Woman’s Hardy Garden.
Twelvemo—I’m not “ A Woman's Hardy Garden," that is my elder sister. I'm only " Another Hardy Garden," and, between ourselves, not half so clever as she.
Elizabeth (peeping at the pictures in Barbara’s lJ?zno)—By the way, if I were an American woman, wnolly free from Old World tradition. I’d copy nothing from anywhere in my garden, and only take my hints from grand old She herself. Why will people with beautiful rugged surroundings make Italian gardens and Dutch gardens and formal pergolas and copy all the rest of Old World things, including glaring white stone seats and garden statues in a granite country? | These things have no raison d’etre in such j a climate, not even for the eye to rest , upon, they glare so, and for the other | parts of the anatomy they are far too i chilly.
Barbara fwho has been dipping into octavo)—Please read some more of this Evan would quite agree with it.	j
Elizabeth—Here are two good bits, one for the Man of Wrath, one for myself. This “Gardener’s Year” in some respects is deliciously inconsistent and feminine and lovable. He gllOOlS bui 1: int ntiS that destroy his apple-5 and then pit>s tut blackbirds that are caught under the strawberry nets. He also complains that the native nurserymen chaige him twice too much for young apple trees. Fifty pur cent, he is willing to pay for patriotism, but not the other lifty. Sec how tlmuy he is, even his orclu-ls do not turn his brain. He writes: “ One piece of luck [ did have. I bought a root of Vanda 1 eoerulea for a shilling or two, which, when it flowered, pioved to have tho peculiarity of producing two white blooms at the top of the .-r>ray. This plant 1 sold j for ‘JO guineas, find I believe it died the ! i next year! My advice to all orchid grow-crs, unless they happen to be very rich, is ; to turn any sport of the kind into money I at once." (Perhaps the Man of Wrath can apply that to his cabbages.) This next is for you nnd me, Barbara. Think June, or rather English July, and close your eyes!
It is so warm now that one can actually ! sit out after dinner. At no time does the ! garden look more beautiful than at this hour of the. dying day. Now the hush of
sands of the seashore for number, and seem to add to their multitude year by year." That is why I dislike botany, calling so many tender darling things by j such rough, hard names seems cruel. -! Elizabeth—Hush, the man is coming to : take the books over to his desk. Let's watch him.
The Critic turns from the window with l a sigh. and. coming toward the table, picks up Octavo and Twelvemo and re-i turns, letting them fall heavily on the I desk. In the silence a flock of fox sparrows may be heard singing softly outside the window. After listening for a moment Elizabeth and Barbara join ' hands and disappear through the door, i babies and old dog following in wild ecstasy.	**
I Critic, (looking after the group regret-i fully and then at the books.) The old proverb Is true. " Nature draws more than ten oxen," if only there were more of reat nature In nature books, or that I might be let alone to enjoy nature herself, i Statuette of	Shakespeare—(from	the
bookcase top.)
And this our	life	exempt	from	publlck
haunt,	.
Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
Sermons in stones, and good in everything.
Mark that, Sir Critic, good In everything f	M.	O.	W.
