In his introduction to Henry Wellington 1 Wack’s book, “ The Romance of Victor Hugo and Juliette Drouet,” Francois Coppfee, gives some recollections of the great French poet. He speaks of his first meeting with Hugo and of his subsequent friendship with him, of Hugo's relations toward certain people, his meet, ing with Dom Pedro, the Emperor of Brazil, and other interesting topics, clos-; ing with a few words on the effect of Hugo’s exile on his work:
To begin with, it was that exile which inspired “ L«es Chatiments," a very exaggerated and unjust book, without doubt, but which, however, gave to France an inimitable masterpiece in the satirical style. Moreover, I am convinced that Victor Hugo's genius during those years of solitude, of meditation, and i inward existence in the isles of the Nor; man archipelago, took a new and wider flight. In what country, in what language, has a poet ever sung of the sea i with such power, truth, and picturesqueness as the poems of Victor Hugo portray? Not a detail escapes him; he depicts its every aspect, paints its every color, murmurs its every song. The very rhythm of the sea has passed into his verse, for he lived in such close communication with the ocean at Guernsey, he so absorbed its grandeur, that his works became as another ocean.
Preceding the letters of Juliette Drouet, which are now published for the first time, is the story of the relations of the poet and Mme. Drouet for fifty years, with anecdotes, &c., by Mr. Wack. He says of *them toward the end of his remarks;
What Beatrice was to Dante, that and more was Juliette Drouet to Victor Hugo. Did not some one make the cryptic asser-| tion that the wrong which harms nobody is not a wrong? Mme. Hugo was wronged without doubt, but she was either oblivious of it or magnanimously feigned to be so. The annals of real life record few such cases of irregular domestic relations as Hugo’s, and none, so far as I am aware, quite parallel with it.
G. P. Putnam's Sons will publish the book April 6.
