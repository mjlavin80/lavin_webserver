George Santayana, officially a Harvard teacherphilosophy and unofficially :tn
enthusiastic investigator and expounder In belles lettres, languages, and culture1, has at length sought philosophic expression for his varied knowledge and experi- j ences. This expression is to be found in ! a serifs of four little volumes on " The Life of Reason.'' two of which have recently come from the press.
Mr. Santayana, a Spaniard by birth, is blessed with an appreciation of humanity which enables him to find recreation and study in almost every phase of pleasure and work, mental and physical activity, and mental absorption and contemplation. He is familiar with the masterpieces of the arts of expression and with the artist;; who are trying to set new examples of superiority. He finds pleasure in conversing with the beggars of Madrid as well as he does in chatting with members of the British nobility. He has hitherto written some verse of a very high order and certain essays in which aesthetics are combined "with ethics in a curiously sensible manner. His teaching of philosophy has been of the practical sort, but by no means unadorned with appeals to tho imagination.
What life, whether subjective or objee* tive, means to such a man must have a , certain value for others. And when such a man has been able to codify his knowledge and experience and arrange the items in logical order with constant comparison with the natural order, such a codification can hardly fail to throw a bright, clear light upon human progress and upon many of the enigmas which obstruct the human gaze in its search for the secret of existence.
Jt is not advisable to discuss at length here " The L-ife of Reason,” but some data may be extracted from “ Reason in Common Sense,’' wrhich, while revealing tho nature of Mr. Santayana's philosophy, may indicate what the reader is to ex-t,ect in the three succeeding volumes;
“ Reason in Society," “ Reason in Religion,” and " Reason in Art." We are told only those forces which betray themselves in human experiences are recognized by man; that the examination of those forces
rcuuircs two mental functions, contemplation anfl Impulse, anQ timi the proper adjustment of these functions produces an ideal existence. Where these functions work harmoniously, where inharmonioua-ly, and why, and how a more perfect harmony may be produced, form the burden of “ Reason in Common Sense,” which closes with these words:	*4*
To give a general picture of human nature and its rational functions will be the task of the following- books. The truth of a tfeseription which must ba largely .historical may not he indifferent to the reader, and I shall study to avoid bias in the presentation, Jn so far as Ls compatible with frankness and brevity; yet even if some bias should manifest i*-self and if the pictures were historically false, the rational principles-we shall be trying to illustrate will not thereby be invalidated. Illustrations might have‘be*;n sought in some fictitious world. If imagination had not seemed so much less interesting than reality, which, besides enforces with unapproachable eloquence, the main principle in view, namely, that nature carries its ideal with it, and that, the prf'gi'essive organization of irrational im-i pulses makes a rational life.
