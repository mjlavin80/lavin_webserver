A good melodramatic novel is this of Mr. Paul Gwynne. One knows after reading a chapter or two just what will happen, and precisely what he expects does hap- | pen. The story deals with the revenge of j El Carracho, a bandit, upon the Marquez j de Bazan, who had tried to win his wife and had succeeded in causing her murder. This revenge is the abduction of the Mar* quez s child, who is not killed, but under the iiame of Bias is brought up as a country lad. He falls in love with Petra, the bandit's child, but when they are threatened with death if they marry. Bias leaves home to become a torero in the bull
ring.
At a great bullfight the Marquez, who is President of the feast, is prevailed on by Concha, whom Bias has disdained, to call upon Bias to kill the last bull as soon u.3
it enters the ring, instead of waiting until the picadors have tired it, as is usual. The torero tries, and is wounded, and the Marquez learns what he has done. Everything comes out properly, of course, but
there Is a final turn to the melodramatic screw before the green curtain falls, and the bandsmen put away their Instruments, AH this is convention. But the farm scenes on Zeno Pio’s farm, the doing’s at
the escarda or time of weeding and hoeing, and during the vintage, are new. The glimpses of the bandits show them in a
novel light; there are stories of them that must- have been learned on the spot,
and the descriptions of the country and the farm life cannot have been faked from guidebooks. There is good character drawing, too. Bias, Petra, especially the Zeno Pio and his wife, “ his rib,” the Zena Maria, are well done. They seem to haVe been clrawn from living models. The author must know his Spain far better than most men.
