HE English Constitution, if it had existed, in written or unwritten form, in Uie days of Agur, the soil of Jaken, would have been included by that too modest sage in his V'■	1	* brief but immortal list of
5 things, that were too wonderful for him \ to.’understand. It is, indeed, conceivable £ that it Is not fully understood even by ^ thOse whose chief business it is to tn-f teipret it, or at least to conduct the pub-I lie affairs of Great Britain in’strict c$n-fortuity with it Although it has re- '
■	celved perhaps a larger -degree of study : than has any other political instrument
or organism, it certain that it Is, of all such organisms, the least understood.
■	This is due not to the fact to which such . ignorance is generally ascribed—that the-
Constitution is not written—but principal, ly ta the fact that the English Constitu-. tion is the most marvelous of all poht-i leal organisms, going further and wider and deeper in its rootage than any similar institution in humaa history. Its roots are grounded deep in those vague German, Danish, and Norman lands from which came the early peoples who settled or conquered and governed Britain. They now inwrap—perhaps enmesh—everything English and many things American. The Constitution, in these circumstances, could
•	hardly fail to be what the English Coh-stitution is—the life and soul of England, rather than its charter of rights.
-	It is also evident that tlVire must necessarily be, with respect to so vast anlT so unorganized a growth, the densest ignorance. This ignorance varies only In degree from that of the unlllumlned condition of the ordinary man, who knows absolutely nothing about the English Constitution, through that of writers about the subject, like Mr. Burgess, who declare that it did not exist prior to 1832, to that of other writers, like the exceedingly frank De Tocqueville. who asserted that it does not exist at all.
. It is precisely to interpret the English Constitution so that even tho average intelligence may understand at least its spirit and its general principles and tend-eneies that Mr. Sidney Djw has written this vef'y admirable book. At first thought it would seem that enough has been written about the Constitution, and by great minds, to frighten away any one who cherishes the ambition to add another commentary to the stupendous list. But Mr. Low does not hesitate to include hia name in the swelling bead-roll that already registers such names as Fortes-cue, Hallam, Blackstone, Bagehot, Dicey, Maine. Anson, and Stubbs. The very multitude of commentators reveals the fact that the Constitution is a growth that must need new interpretation, as Mr. Low says, almost hourly. This Is the chief purpose of the book, and Mr. Low clearly shows that it is necessary for any one who wishes to understand current English history lo study this constant growth and evolution and lo orient himself anew,
. almost every day, with the changes and developments of English political principles.
' The plan of the work is so excellently conceived smd executed that only one or . two objections are suggested by a first reading. One fs to the title, which, despite the fact that it exactly reproduces that of Sir John Forteseue's famous work, has such an urehnie flavor as to hint of di-leUanteism. The word “governance” is , a trifle antiquated, no matter how well it stood some four and five centuries ago.
. The other objection is to an occasional drop into triviality and the college grad-oate habit of quoting mere hackneyed phrases and tags from other languages, as primus inter pares, ellc n'existe point, and novus homo. And why should Bismarck's commonplace, *• fur oder gegen Bismarck " be deemed worthy of quotation in the original Another objection ma> be mentioned, and that Is that there are occasional slips in th? printing and in the statements. Mr. Low falls into the error op Page r.rt of saying that the President of the rnited States is " appointed.’* Of course this is a mere oversight, but it should not have escaped the reading of the proofs.
The particular excellence of this work has already been indicated as being an interpretation of the English Constitution as it operates to-day. Mr. Low points out the difficulty in making such an interpretation, and says that the writer on the English Constitution can never write with the degree of precision readily attained by the student of the Constitution of France or of the I nited States, as the latter are

SELECT STATUTES, CASES, AND BOCU-MJENTS TO ILLUSTRATE ENGLISH CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY, 1660-1*32.
With a Supplement from 1832-94. Edited by C. Grant Robertson, M. A., Fellow of All Souls* College* Oxford; Examiner in the Honour School of Modem History in the University of Oxford, 3S01*4. Cloth, 8vo. Pp. xvili-452, with Appendix. New Tori: G, P, Putnam's Sobs.
'Written; documents, -.He '-expresses Uha. problem^of the English constitutionalist exactly when he says that with him it IS a question as to what may be-called “ the equities of the case/’ The phrase is discriminating and just.1 In showing just what these equities are, and bow the British Government is .carried on to-day* the author takes up in succession the Cabinet, the Parliamentary Type of Gov? ernment, Ministerial Responsibility, the Prime ^Sinister and the Inner Cabinet) the Limitations of Democracy Sn England, the House of'Lords, the Monarchy, and Aspects of Change. He thus interprets the present administrative system and indicates what seemhim the lines which -the ever-changing political system of England may be expected to follow.
'^The English Constitution is shown to be .not so much-a development as a ru-enf piling up O'f statutes and principles, each added because Of some necessity pressing upon the State. Tennyson’s view—which is.*almost Invariably that of a superficial observer of events—was that JBritish 11b-i erty had "broadened down from precedent to precedent,1* each generation of statesmen bequeathing to humanity an ! i ampler charter of freedom. There has always been, to be sure, the usual attempt , by Englishmen to make new conditions ! and necessities square with ancient precedent, In an effort to spare national pride ! or prejudice; but exigency, and not a , luminous spirit of evolution, has made the Constitution of England.
Because the Constitution is not written, perhaps, a great many very impor-, taht things are omitted from it. These form a curious list, and to any one but an Englishman it is incomprehensible that the most essential machinery of the administration has no authority of law, and none save that of establlsh«d custom—a custom that is. moreover, not even recognized officially. For instance, there is no statutory recognition of the Cabinet. The most essential and characteristic feature of British government, the representative system, also has no positive law to support it. The great political parties arc not officially known, even to the House of Commons. Legally there is no such official as the Prime Minister. And, perhaps strangest of all, there is no legal guarantee of the freedom of speech, freedom of the press, or freedom of public meeting Dicey has pointed out that " freedom of discussion is in England little else than the right lu write or say anything which a jury, consisting of twelve shopkeepers, think it expedient should be said or written.*'
In this connection it is interesting to jjote that Disraeli, then Lord Beacons-field, was the first Prime Minister to re- i ceive formal mention by that title. He is described in the opening clause of the j treaty of Berlin as 11 First Lord of Her ; Majesty's Treasury, Prime Minister of England.” This was a palpable conees- ; sion to Continental ignorance. Twenty-two years later the Court Circular referred to the Marquis of Salisbury as *' Prime Minister.”
The most interesting and instructive portions of this book are those that deal with the Cabinet and Commons, the re sponsibility of Ministers, the House of Lords, and the somewhat shadow > duties and responsibilities of the monarchy. The power and influence of the Commons is shown to be decreasing, while that of the Cabinet is growing. Even within the Cabinet—jiow become unwieldy by reason of numbers, it having grown from seven members to more than twenty—there has developed an inner conclave composed ot the Prime Minister and two or three political friends which is the real ruler of England. The House of Lords, far from decaying, may become increasingly important. Jts power lias quite recently been exercised, as, notably, against Mr. Oladstone’s Home Pule bill and Employers’ Liability bill, where it blocked the action of the Commons.
In no work dealing with the Constitution is the distinction between the sovereign and the Crown made sn dear.
" The transfer of powers from ihe sovereign, in his personal capacity, to the Crown, in the abstract, has been going on through the centuries nr English history,-* The Crownfis not. therefore, the sovereign, but the Ministers—the real administration. The chief function of the King and of the royal family is now that of being ihe head Of English society	u	sort	of	arbiter
of public morals.
The value of this bouk is very greatly increases for American readers by the frequent comparisons instituted between the English and American political systems. Mr. Lon-, indeed. seems to have his eye constantly upon possible American readers, although the opinion of republican institutions, as developed or borrowed here, does not strike one as being either very profound or just. In no other work could the American reader, however, learn so much, or in so pleasant a way, about the actual government of England.
The volume of Sel<*et Statutes, (’ases. and Documents, which is edited by c. Grant Robertson, is indispensable to the reader and student of modern English history. it affords an excellent companion to the book of Mr. Low on “ The Governance of England.” The book is the outgrowth of the author's own needs in teaching-modern history at Oxford, where
. he found that while for previous-periods! of 32ngllsh history there were the Select j Charters of Stubbs and similar works-by i Gardiner and Prothero, there was- i hiatus fhat needed to be filled by a collection of documents for the epoelr “that opens with the Restoration of Charles II. He has endeavored, he says, to cover a period of one hundred and seventy-two years 41 crowded with illustrative and important material.”
| The author has succeeded In doing this in the most admirable way. Among the statutes and documents included may be-mentioned the Act of Uniformity, the Test act* the Coronation Oath, the Bill of -Rights,-the Act of Settlement, the Act for t\j$ Union with Scotland, the Act for the Union with Ireland, the Abolition of the Slave Trade. All off the most famous cases in ^English legal history, within the period treated, are included. The more than-adcquate excuse for this fs given a»
** the part played by the law courts in de -ffnfng, extending, limiting, even creating, constitutional law, machinery, and rights." In an appendix are lo be found a* group of famous articles of impeachment, resolutions, &c., dealing with taxation, franchises, the Exclusion bill, the poor law, and numerous other statutes and laws that do not fall into.the arrangement of the preceding portions of the book. T|*e volume forms altogether one of the very best collections of documents illustrative of English histbry.
