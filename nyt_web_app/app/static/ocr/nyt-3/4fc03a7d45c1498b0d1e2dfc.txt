I think) on his return home finds j that his wife has been very friendly toward a young relative. The youn£ man is banished from his house, but remains in the neighborhood. The wife becomes very devout and goes often to a remote part of the castle to pray over the bones of pome paint. One day the Duke enters the room at the head of bi^ retinue and has a statue of the Duchess ! placed over the place where these bones were I buried. That niqilt he forces the Duchess to drink poison. The next day the face of the statue is found to have taken on an expression of utmost horror.”
