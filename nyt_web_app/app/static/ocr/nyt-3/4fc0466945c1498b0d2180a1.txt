5 THE anniversary of Shakespeare’s birth draws nearer the discussion of the proposed new memorial in England, the plans for which are expected to take shape on that day, grows in interest. The one point settled about the memorial is that it is to be in London. The improvement of things at Stratford-on-Avon is not comprehended in the present movement, in which Americans are 1 participating together with men and women of the port's own nationality. If the spirit of the new j movement waxes stronger with the lapse of time, i however, we may hope eventually to see Shakespeare's birthplace free from the symbol of the ex-| tended, grasping palm. As for the London memorial,
I It may be such a monument as that which really honors the memory of good Sir Walter in Princes Street, Edinburgh. The English-speaking world has few other carved monuments so good. But Shake-j speare’s fame seems to require a grander memorial* and there lies the trouble. Statues are talked of, but remembrance of existing statuary supposed to glorify the poet and his works does not reconcile one to the i Idea that more of them would serve to Increase the | poet’s glory or the credit of English art. There ia | talk, too, of a ‘‘Shakespeare House/* which should contain lecture rooms, a museum, a library, and a sort of national Pantheon. “A glorified Mechanics’ ! i Institute/' The Loudon Academy calls this Idea. To devise a fitting memorial for so great a man Is, j indeed, a difficult undertaking.	I
