The object of the author as set forth ill his preface is to offer a concise and practical presentation of the processes involved in designing a modern yacht. There is at present an almost utter lack of material of this chaictcter which is inf accord with American practice, and it is thought that the' hook may £ind a useful-place among works on yacht architecture. It is intended to be thoroughly practical irk character, all mathematics and theoretical presentations having been eliminated as far as possible, so that the operations may be readily grarped by men without technical education/'	‘
. It may be conceded that Mr. Skene has i\ accomplished fairly well all he undertook j I in the above outlined plan except the last | specification. The operations described 'cannot be grasped oy readers -without technical education. But that is not his fault; It is a difficulty inherent In the subject. The book will undoubtedly be serviceable to every one interested in the subject and possessed of enough technical knowledge to understand it. The chief objects sought in yacht designing are four In number—seaworthiness, roomy cabin
accommodations, beauty, speed, All of these cannot be combined in one model, and it is seldom that more than two are associated. After outlining the various problems to be encountered, the author proceeds to explain the methods of calculation and how to ascertain displacement, the centre of gravity{ skin-frlction, total
resistance, &c. There are chapters on displacement, the lateral plane, design, stability, ballast, the sail plan, and construction. A thirty-foot cruiser is made the basis of the calculations, and a number of tables is appended to abridge the figuring of important details. Thfc book Is "illustrated with numerous outline drawings and plates.	.
