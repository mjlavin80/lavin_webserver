" Faults he had. it is true, but they were not the faults of a bad heart or an evil mind. He erred, like David, and, like tlje Htbrcw Klng, his glory shall outlive his error." Mr. Finerty’s conclusion reads:
The cause of Irish self-government Is still, as from the first, the chief question at issue between Great Britain and Ireland, and can never be settled satisfactorily, until " the predominant partner11 yields the point to the smaller country and an Irish Parliament, truly representative of all interests in the island, resumes irsjong interrupted sessions in the Capitol of Ireland on College Green. Nor would even this settlement bind future generations of Irishmen wHo might aspire to separate political existence. In the words of Parnell, " No man, or set of men, can place a boundary to the prog-grcss of a nation."

Mr. John F. Finerty, who Is the President of the United Irish League of America, writes that there is no need to apologize for seeking to throw *' more light in a simple and comprehensive manner on the history of that beautiful island, the blood of whose exiled children flows in the veins of not less than 20,000,000 of the American people.’* Perhaps the qualifying “ exiled " Is used In too general a sense.

Who were the Milesians? ’’ Celtic characteristics, both mental and physical, are still deeply stamped on th^ Irish people, notwithstanding the lar^e admixture of the blood of other races, resulting from the numerous after invasions. both patran and Christian. The j conversion of the Irish-to Christianity Is attributed to St. Patrick, who, it is believed. preached the Gospel in Ulster in A D. 432. Tnfortunate Ireland! Ever since the earliest times there has been bloodshed and confusion there, brought about by causes as often from within as from wilhout. With the Reformation came more trouble, and the interferences of Spain and France invariably brought about new misiortunes to the Irish.

The strongest advocates of the House of the Stuarts have never forgiven James for his cowardice at Che battle~of the Bovno.

According to Muihall, the reign of Queen Victoria was "the most destructive in Ireland since Elizabeth.” It was then that Daniel O'Connell came to the front.
