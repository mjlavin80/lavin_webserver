A unique book is to appear Immediately through the Macmillan Company, •which consists in advice and -counsels to persons . who have lost their sight or who are In danger of losing it. It js an English translation by Carroll E. Edson, A. M.„ M. D., from the French of Dr. Emile Javal, a member of the French Academy of Medicine, entitled " On Becoming Blind: Advice for the Use of Persons Losing Their Sight.” The book was suggested by the fact that there are very few books on the subject of advice to those who have suddenly become hlind. Dr, Javal lost his sight when he was six-1 ty-two years of age. He writes not for the blind one, but rather for his or her i family. He points out in his introduction 1 that the oculist would do a more humane thing if he told his patient whether there ; was any hope of sight or not, and, if there ' was not, to teach that person, while there is still a little power left in the eyes, the ! first elements of Braille writing.
1 The first piece of advice Dr. Javal gives is never to lie to a blind man, be the cost what it may. The next thing to do is to maintain *' acsoiuto order ’* around the unfortunate, so that he can find what he wants and to allow him to do as much as possible for himself. There is a chapter on “Replacing Sight by Other Senses.” He suggests occupations for the one who does not see—amusements, traveling, homes, &c. He writes about music, games, smoking, memorv and mnemonics, marriage, the psychology of the blind, the sixth sense, and other topics of interest and value.
