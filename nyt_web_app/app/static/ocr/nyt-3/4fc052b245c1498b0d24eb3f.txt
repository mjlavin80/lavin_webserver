John Hancock
Mew York Times Book ftevietc:
The discussion of the character of John Hancock in the entertaining letter pages of The New york Times book Review during the past two months has been most interesting, especially so to the author of “ My l^ady laughter," the novel which inspired the controversy. May the author now be permitted a few wonts, as a matter, so to say. of personal privilege? The discussion has been so alert, and the disputants have urged their respective claims with such earnestness, that the facts which prompted the original discussion of the subject may have been forgotten. Several of the corespondents have suggested that such might be the casp, by the choice of adjectives with which to characterize the il defamers of Hancock's memory.’*
I have no "wish to enter the dispute, either for or against the Boston patriot, nor was it the intention, in	Js	said	of
John Hancock in “ My Lady Laughter,” to “ take sides." Novels and controversial works should be far apart. The man was presented, as accurately as lay in the author’s power, simply as he appealed to people of his day. The historical authorities utilized In the work of preparation were, to a considerable extent, the d.'a-ries and tetters of HancocK's contemporaries. The authors of these letters and diaries may have been prejudiced, but what they wrote must certainly be considered to have been what they thought; and the author of “My Lady Laughter”
has used these expressions simply ant]
solely as ihe opinions of individuals, substituting, in all instances save that of George Robert Twelves Hewes, fictional for the real characters. The desire was to reflect tho sentiment of his own times with regard to the man, and tho casual and unprejudiced reader will admit that both sides are given.
It is irue that the author of the novel ventures to present direct pictures of Hancock’s personality, of his dr^ss, and of his ornate mansion. He does nut un- i derstand, however, that there is any dls- I pute as to the facts hero; it seems goner- i ally admitted that he was a lover of ele- 1 gance, both or person and of his surroundings.
There was no wish nor attempt to belittle tlie vulue of his services to thft patriot cause; had such been the case
abundant authority was at hand on which to base a portrait much less flattering than lhat presented. Your correspondents have already cited so fully the authorities to support this more extreme view tha' it is not nccess-iry to retrace the ground they have covered.
Ft will suffice to say that John Hancock in “ My Lady Laughter ’ is as his feJlow-to>vnsmeh in “ the days of the Gre^t Siege" regarded him, as proved in their own words handed down to us
