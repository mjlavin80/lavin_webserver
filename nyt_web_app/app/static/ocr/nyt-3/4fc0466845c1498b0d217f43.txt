OT all professional gossips* arev‘; so amusing as the author of “ Society irTtheNew Reign,” just published in London and Imported by the A. Weasels Company. The identity oi this author Is veiled in commercially serviceable mystery, but he signs himself (his sex is avowed) “ A Foreign Resident'* and he-wrote for publication in 188$ a book on “ Society in London " which was much talked of. This new book contains “ later conclusions ”
| on the same subject, which, the writer j fancies, are “ untinged by any color of I personal preferences or prejudice” and comprehend " an absolutely impartial sur-j vey of the contemporary situation.*’ The ; “ conclusions," however, are inevitably tinged with the color of the writer’s mind, and the mind of the writer of a whole i book, and a big one, of personal gossip, "siring up*' persons the smallest of whom, probably, Is comparatively larger than himself, Is apt to have some of tho i color of malice and some of the color of snobbery.
Nevertheless, the vivacity of this book , carries It off welj^ The air of seeming to know all there Is to know of Court and
club and private drawing room, in Paris as well as London, is well sustained. There are facts worth preserving, and a good index will make them easy to get at again if one wants to keep the book -by him.

The loquacious, but occasionally epi-I ETrammatic “ Foreign Resident *• (his con-| tempt for “Yankees’* suggests that he I may be an expatriated American) regrets j that his subject is difficult to keep abreast with, and that M Time's revenges" are frequently too quick for the writer and ^ printer. While he was writing, he says, old figures passed away and new favorites | arrived. As a matter of fact most of the book seems to have been written nearly a year and a half ago. But it is suffl-clently up to date, and a few footnotes compensate amply for “ Time's revenges."

In England the Court leads society and the Government Is very much a part of It, Wherefore such a book must deal at the beginning with the Court and some j members, at least, of the Government.
In these passages the author Is at his best. The twentieth century Begins, he declares, with an advance into the land of Lilliput. Prelates are conspiring against the Tudor settlement ana statesmen are risking* a fiscal refum to a mediaeval system, The foreigners of King Edward's following have been assimilated to the British type, and London is far from cosmopolitan.	J
The Londoner, inside or outside the Court circle, is not, therefore, more a cosmopolite than a German waiter who knows all tongues equally ill is a philologist.
The man of tho world, to divest the phrase of all international associations la to be found on the British side of the Dover Straits, in quality as good as anywhere else, but with an incapacity all his own to judge matters, social or political by another standard than that of St James's or Whitehall.	*
But at least, I am told, England, in the new reign possesses a really cosmopolitan Court and capital. Certainly it does, if that means it has become a showy centre of international gossip, an emporium of
those attenuated personalities which form the conversational small change current throughout the second class drawing rooms of Europe. The topics may often have been brought from a greater distance during* the Ifresent reign than was the case with the last. The tone is always that of the decayed dowager who writes sub rosa, for the society press. Here, therefore, is another reason why, on revisiting society in London after a long absence, I speak of its universal preoccupation with the infinitely little and consider a pervading provincialism the leading characteristic of the new reign.
Some consideration of the remarkable growth of the. power of Mr. Chamberlain is introduced by the quotation of Lord Salisbury's exclamation: “Save me from the Birmingham button maker! ” There is a preposterous hint that Hr. Balfour’s weariness is all assumed; that he Is a man of craft, pursuing a carefully planned course. It Is hinted that he may be trying to replace party and parliamentary government by a Court bureaucracy.
" The novels oi Dickens,” says this irre* sponsible chronicler, “ would be found to contain- the originals of many notable politicians during the twentieth century’s !first decade.” Lord Ribblesdale is Mis. Gummidge, Mr. Chamberlain (devoted to Africa) is Mrs. Jellyby, Mr. Balfour is Harold Skimpole, with a touch of Manta-lini; Mr. Ritchie Is Mr. Toots and Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman is Mark

Tajriev. TliSs is pretty poor stuff. But the pen sketches of prominent men of the hour are generally graphic, though not a bit superior in quality to the work of the ordinary gallery men of the provincial press in the House of Commons.
Lady Curzon, (whose maiden name is given as Leitner.) Is said to have “ made a man of her husband.” There arc some droll words about the Cecils and Churchills and Lord Carrington, 44 who is so little literary as seldom to answer a letter.” Our Mr. Choate is described as
" morally and physically a big man " and “ a really good fellow," who becomingly divides with M. Paul Carabon the real presidency of the diplomatic body. As for the Americans and others of Carlton House Terrace they are “ peltry or pork kings.” Mr. William Waldorf As tor's ancestor was a pelt hunter on a lr-r^e
scale, to be sure, but there are no pork
kings in the neighborhood- And it Is hard to call so good a subject of King Edward as Mr. Astor " a transatlantic Midas."

Still, the Foreign Resident’s book Is amusing. He gossips about women of fashion and their pedigrees like one of his own ** frock-coated old maids.” He avoids mere scandal. He has generally La ken pains 10 inform himself out of the Peerage. And he manages to say something about a vast multitude of men and women, peers, statesmen, journalists, novelists, bankers and poets, peeresses by right of lineage and by force of wealth, smart women without titles. It is, take it altogether, the“'&ort of stuff that he says is talked about in English drawing rooms, but infused with a little peal wit and saved from dullness by smartness and audacity.
