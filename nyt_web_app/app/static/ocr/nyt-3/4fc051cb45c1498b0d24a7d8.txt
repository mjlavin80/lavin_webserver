There are two books, in English prose written in the early part of the sixteenth . century, which' the student of the language and literature can no more ignore . than he can the so-called King Jaurcs’s Bible. Both are by a man named Roger Ascham, who, after being practically forgotten for three centuries, has been revived toy writers on pedagogics. His '* Toxophilus," a treatise on shooting wkh the bow, was the first book written fet what may be called modem English, -while his Seholemaster,” a work concerning the teaching of Latin to children, has never "been surpassed' as a practical contribution to the science of language teaching.
The appearance of these works., together With AsCham’s ** A Heport on the Affairs and State of Germany *' in a single volume, is a literary event worthy of record, but particularly so as the best original texts are exactly reproduced with titl6 pages and typographical forms cleverly copied, not in fac simile, but in clear-cut modern type, which is a pleasure to the eye. The task of editing might have been reduced to a mere perfuncLory effort if Mr. "Wright had been satisfied to reproduce the first printed editions of the works without comment or interpolation. But there is no agreement between the editions published during the author's life, while those which have since appeared reveal a too eager desire to modernize Ascham's orthography and frequently his rhetoric. Air. Wright, bringing to his work not only the knowledge but the training of a scholar of English, has simply corrected Ascham’s printers or where . his orthography in English or in the Latin, Greek, and Italian passages that appear could not be confirmed by any contemporary example. Of course, it was easy enough for a scholar of the classics to polish up the Greek or Latin in accordance with the best authors of those languages, but It was thoughtful and in-' genious to correct the curious Italian Fas-quinade in the " Report M to correspond to the best Tuscan of 1550.
