In the course of his book on " The Viennese Period,” being Volume V. in the Oxford History of Music, W. H-Hadow treats of some musical instruments that have not been in use for some years past- He writes;
Three instruments which have now become obsolete deserve mention on
grounds of historic interest The " the-
ordo ” was a large, many-stringed bass
lute of deeper compass than our modern contrabass! and employed, like them, to strengthen and enrich the lower registers of the orchestra- It was still to be found in the band of the Austrian Hofka-pelie when, in 1740, Haydn entered St, Stenhen's as a chorister, and it lasted at Berlin as late as 1755. But, like all lutes, it was incumbered with mechanical difficulties; it had a variable temper, and needed constant attention; at last musicians grew impatient with it and threw it aside. The *' lira da braccio " was a member of the viol family, much beloved by amateurs and in special favor with Ferdinand IV. of Naples, for whom Haydn wrote five concerti and seven nocturnes. One of the concerti (composed for two “ lire ” in G major) still survives in manuscript at Eisenstadt, and is remarkable for the high range of the solo parts, which never descend below middle E, ana through most of the music are soaring above the treble stave. A still Clearer indication of the compass in current use may be found in the manuscript of the third nocturne, where, for the opening
movement, Haydn has canceled the names
of '* Lira 1 and 2” and has substituted those of flute and oboe. Last comes the " baryton.” celebrated by the praises of Leopold Mozart, a round-shouldered, flatbodied viol with seven gut ‘strings and from nine to twenty-four sympathetic strings of metal. Its most famous player was Prince Nicholas Esterhazy, in whose service Haydn wrote for it no less than 175 pieces; but we can form little or no idea of its character or usage, since this vast mass of music has wholly disappeared, except three dlvertimenti and a few inconsiderable fragments. .
