!	‘‘ The Karty, Christian Conception of
Christ: Its -Significance and Value in the I History of Religion,” by Prof. Otto Fflelderer of the University of Berlin, which (5. P. Putnam's Sons are publishing this -week, is an expansion. of a lecture delivered by the author before the International .Theological. Congress at Amsterdam, in September; 1903. He has attempted, he writes in his introduction, by separating away later accretions and by falling back upon the oldest historic sources, to approach as nearly as possible to the historic truth concerning Christ, " and to present his form, in its simple human grandeur and stripped of all mythical accessories, as the ideal of a lofty and noble religious hero, worthy of the veneration of the mind and heart of the modern world/*—	-
The book has been divided into five chapters—** Christ as Son of God,‘1 "Christ as Conqueror of Satan/’ "Christ as a Wonder-Worker/1 " Christ as the Conqueror of Death and the Life-Giver/’ ** Christ as the .King of Kings and Lord of Lords/’ The author writes in his con-^ eluding chapter:
As we survey the numerous points of likeness between the faith of the early Christians and the religious ideas current
6	in the world around them, we can scarcely fall to-be-‘convinced that Christianity could not have fallen from heaven as something quite new and unique, but that' it sprang up in the world or those days as the ripe- fruit of ages of development and in a soil .that was already prepared. Now it is, of course, easily comprehensible that this new evolutionist method of inquiry should have such a disturbing influence'upon many persons, conservatives as well as critics; that they at once draw the most radical eonclusibns and imagine that Christianity Is-robbed of its unique character and its abiding worth because it appears to be nothing more than a combination of ideas that had existed for ages, and are nowadays altogether antiquated. Hut such conclusions are most hasty and rash.
