Louis-Armand, Baron de Lahontan, Hiid-author of " New Voyages to^ North'America," was born -in e Province pf Basse-"Pyrenees in-1CGG. His father was tvar"' engineer, who at his death was involved ill many lawsuits. At an early age the young man entered the army, and was sent to Canada. In the Autumn of 1685, when he landed in Quebec, La* Salle lett " Quebec tor France. In the Spring of the next year the Baron was in Montreal. Prom there he made various trips into the surrounding country. He was fond of hunting, and tells of the fine sport he enjoyed. W^ile fn the forest camps he wrote of lifs studying the classics, “ the honest Homer, the amiable Anacreon, my dear Lucian/* * *. * The letters give . an Insight into the character of the French and the Indians. He made a cruise along Lake Erie, when the party fed “abundantly on fish and wild turkey." He went as far as, Mackinac.	-
After that the B£ro» gives'in detail the story of a long exploration to the south, which narrative it is believed is entirely fictitious. Supposably it was the Mississippi he tried to describe. Lahontan seemed to be always desirous of returning to France, in order to get redress for his wrongs due to the lawsuits. He did in fact get home on two occasions, but without accomplishing anything in the litigation. He probably left the service without leave, and was a wanderer in Europe for many years, for he writes let! ters from Portugal and Denmark. Many pages are devoted to a dialogue between himselE and an Indian, in which are discussed the customs and humors of the I savages. This dialogue gives the Baron i the chance of ventilating some o£ the i philosophical and scientific beliefs of tho [ seventeenth century. Lahontan certainly shows a liberality not common to the | French of his time; for instance, he writes concerning the Protestants:	.	'
I*m convinc'd that if they had received p.opitive assurances of enjoying liberty of Conscience, a great many of them would have made no scruple to go together.
*	* * In fine, we have more reason to believe that if the Huguenots had been transported to Canada they had never departed from the fealty they ow'd to their natural sovereign. * * * I do affirm that if the Council of State had follow’d my Scheme, in J.he space of forty years New Prance^rould have become a finer and more flourishing kingdom than several/others in Europe.
The volume is reprinted from the English edition of 1703, with fac similies of' the illustrations and maps. The Lahontan bibliography is very much extended, for there were translations in many languages. It must have been a most popular book in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The pictures of the Indians are the strangest conceptions of European artists, Mr, Reuben Gold Thwaites’s notes add much to the value of the text.
