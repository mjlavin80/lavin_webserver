The j book opens with an original poem entitled "At Perugia,” which reads:
The young moon mounts; day fades from off the plain;	_
No color of man’s naming hath this sky. Thrilled with the Beatific Vision high,
So passes a pure spirit without pain.
Like billows of a never-breaking main,
The Umbrian Apennines hang poised on
high, . . Snow-crested; yonder doth Assisi lie, Lov’d shrine, whereof the whole world’s heart is fain.
So there from hill to hill was wont to wgnd
And heaL and teach, and touch with living fire,
Francis, God’s saint six hundred years ago!
And thou and I have six poor dayr to spend,
TreacJ back the past, and to yon heights asfiire—
Mov$ slow, dear earth, about the sun, move slow!
