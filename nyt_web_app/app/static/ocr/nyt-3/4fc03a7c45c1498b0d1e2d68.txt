From the trilling beginning of the establishment of free **e bools for the education of children of sla\t*s and negroes, in 1*87, j by the Manumission ooeiety — in estab- { lishing whieh both Alexander Hamilton j and John Jay	active— the system
has grown, until to-day it includes one that not only begins with the kindergarten and ends with 11m* college, but, as President Idiot of Harvard pointed out in a recent address .it Cooper Union.
*' continues the education of adults by evening «ehools and free public lectures, and is making its school buildings constant day and night educational cent res.”
It is through this wonderful growth that Mr. Palmer has traced the educational movement that has given to Kew York a large measure of free educational advantages which are probably as nearly j perfect as they caji be in any community ■ not Vtopian. but governed by politicians who have mad' themselves felt in the public schools, and frequently to their detriment, ever since publie schools were i established.
To be historically correct the free school system of New York might as v,-ell go back to 17*7 for a beginning, that being the year when ihe first free school was opened with twelve pupils, though ouly children of negro parentage were admitted, the white children being cared for n the schools uomu cted with the churches of the incipient city. Hut 180Ti, the date of the beginning of the existence of the Free School Society, is arbitrarily chosen instead. The schools opened by this soci- j ety were free, but they wpre not support- j id by the Government, aiid received no ( public moneys for some years after their establishment, though such moneys were appropriated for the free instruction of negroes, separate schools for whom were maintained continuously at public expense until l*too, when ihe last of them,
existing then nnl\ in Quet ns County, were abolished qndi r ihr administration cf ■ Governor, n iw Pre-Roosevelt, the | las' of these «eparate schools for negroes ■ in this city hawtr; bet n closed in 1><84.	!
Virtuallv ihe pr-^ent r\hool system of i Ne w York < 'it y began in lST^t, when the i schools ot the Public S: hool Society— j which had succeeded the Free School Society in lsJti- and whi* n r ;j.iire-2 « “ moderate compensation " >t.n each pupil, were turned over to ;he Hoard of iidu-cation as a free giit from the society to the city.

•THE NEW YORK Pl'BIJf' SCHOOU Being . a History uf Free Education in the City j of New York By A. Emerson Palmer. M. A-. Secretary of tho Board of Education.

established, their democratic character being bettered after this was done.
Both the Public School Society and its predecessor, the Free School Society, were involved in religious controversies over the distribution of the State appro- ! prUtion for education. Others particl- j paling in the appropriation besides the ! two societies named were the Mechanics | Society, the African schools, and the Orphan Asylum Society. This engendered jealousies. !n 1H.M the Baptists started the attempt to get rome of the money for their denominational schools, in which attempt they weie followed by the Meth- j odists, Homnn Catholics, Hebrews, and Scotch Presbyterians at varying Intervals, so that th?.e was an almost constant squabble over those funds which the society and its fiiends were determined should not go to the support of any but public and undenominational schools. The Legislature was repeatedly appealed lo. But the public'Spirited men back of the public schools Kept up such determined opposition that though one after another j of these denominations managed to get at the public crib for a time, the Public [ School Society in the end drove them all away from it. and had the State and city appropriations lo itself. It was these bitter controversies that made the Trustees the more willing to turn their school prop- [ erties over lo the Board of Education in j lfC>;i and gef. rid of the worries and debts at the same time. B’lt it was to their vigorous oppcsltion that the entering | tvsdge of anproprialions for denominational schools was never able to get a sufficient bight inlo the State Treasury i to enable it lo maintain a permanent hold, j and for that the people have to thank them.
Dutchmen .'-ar'ed the schools in th« . present boroughs of .Manhattan and Brooklyn and the settlements abuut the latter borough that became part of that city before the whole was incorporated into the present City of New York; British originated tl.ese in Westchester and East Chester of the Bronx; Waldenses and Huguenots Ficse in the Horough of Richmond, and both British and Dutch seem to have had a hand in establishing almost simultaneously th? schools in that part | of Queens County that is now *r portion { of New York City. Their early struggles I W'ere much alike; their evolution into the 1 present common school system, save in ■ the old City of New' ’j oi k, was very like | those all over the rest of the country —a j giadual development devoid of the inter- 1 vention of any private corporation schools, as here.
A11 have i.een ultimately merged into | the existing system, and of that system | the gentleman who writes the introduction, Seth I^ow, late President of Columbia I'niversity, :;ays:
'i'here was, inevitably, danger t’ua; the uniformity certain to come from consoli- 1 nation [into the Greater New York system J would involve a gradual dragging down of the better parts of the system to the level of the lower. It is more than gratifying to be able to say that this unification has been successfully brought about, in fact, by lifting the poorer part to the ! level of the better. Indeed, it may be said, generally, that the best features of each separate system have been kept for j the benefit of all. Fndoubtedly in an educational system comprising so many schools there is. and there always will I be, great variations in quality as between individual schools, but every borough of the great cuy ha's a better school s> sLem lo-tlay than it ever had before. There is a higher standard of qualification demanded of teachers and all school officers; the pi y and conditions of service are better; the dm racier of school buildings constantly improves, and the curriculum compares favorably with that u’Tered anywhere in the L’nited States.
'■'he author takes the <s;tme position and traces in detail the causes that have led to this result. These lead through political quagmires, local opposition to wiping out fa\oritism. no* .blv from Brooklyn, and ’■istlv through the wearing fevers of fighting new legislation that could oaiy b»- curr.tt.d :i(rer the people

These W‘*re established to give to the children in the elementary grades a taste for good reading and to enable them to make intelligent use 0/ the public libraries. That it has succeeded wonderfully any of the city librarians will testify. In these school libraries there were at the end of the hast school year :i59,at)0 volumes, about one-third of which are books of reference for teachers’ libraries. and during that year there were circulated for home use from these class libraries 2,308.601 volumes. The Bureau of Libraries has Issued a graded and an-
notated catalogue of books approved for use in the public schools to guide teachers In making selections for their class libraries and keeps it up to date.
