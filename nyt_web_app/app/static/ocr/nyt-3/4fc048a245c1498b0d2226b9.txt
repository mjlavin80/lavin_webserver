What with historical novelists playing fast and loose *wlth famous charact-cr^s. It would surprise no one to find Prince John Van Buren seized upon as the hero of a novel, and when one picks up a novel bearing' the name " John Van Buren, PoK itician," it seems evident that he has heen so seized. But he has not; he is still free. For the hero of the novel is not Prince John; he bears the Prince’s name, that’s*
all.	-
Inevitably, a comparison is made between
the anonymous novel, *' John Van Buren, Politician/’ and the late Paul Ford’s “ Hon. Peter Stirling.” Both purport to deal with New York City and State politics. But Peter Stirling did things; John Van Buren—the John Van Buren of the booh, that is—merely lfstens to political comment, and does nothing.
Probably internal evidence will show
when the adventures described in the
book are supposed to have taken place;
at all events, the time is past, for in the
book Mr. Richard Croker appears as
Richard Coulter, still head of Tammany,
and there are Wagner cars on the Central. Along with Mr. Croker-Coulter move various other politicians of the past. “ L-ittle Judge ” Duffy and Patrick Div-ver we think we recognized in a curious combination:	the	late	Senator	Gibbs,
** Andy ” Freedman, and probably dozens of other equally eminent persons pop up from time to time. David B. Hill is used to form part of one of the leading characters—not the whole character, for the hook’s personage is married, while Mr. Hill is not; and it is his daughter, Mary Marlow, with purply red hair and violet eyes. and possibly an undue fondness for reddish gowns, who supplies the feminine interest in the book.
On Page K7. Police Commissioner Mahoney, one of the four heads of the department, describes conditions in an uptown district thus: “ It is a peculiar district. About a third of the voters are Tammany, and about as many are machine Republicans. The rest would like to beat us both. Their idea is that every man who knows the number of the election district in which he lives is a practical politician, and should be disfranchised for the first offense and sent to Sing Sing for the second.’*
