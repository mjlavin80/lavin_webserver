" With (hr Pilgrims m Mecca." is said to bo a lVv-si;in ant! a follower of the 1’rophei. It may be that his European education has in snmc mt-usurt' modified hi" nMigion. for. thmigh he follows tin- spirit of lsl.imism. Uf does nr>L invariably give it blind credence. Prof. Vambery. in an introduction to the book, fully explains tho sacred character of (he pilgrimage Merest and the honor it convoys on the Hadjees. The MohamniPdan will suffer all privations so that he may save pnoiigh monev to make the journey to the Holy City, Once the perils were endless, fur the life of the pilgrim was in constant danger. To-Uuy the ri^k is very much l^ss. Modern methods of trawl have shortened the route and made li safe. Mcci a never was a sealed-up eitv as was l.hasa, for Burekhardt described it some ejghty-four years ago, and tho impetuous ! Richard Burtun visited it in lHaii. <’er- i tainly more can be learned from Hadji ;

Something t•» bo noted is the large increase	of	pilgrims	during the	last few
years.	In	Burtons	time the pilgrimage
estimated at r>o,Ot)<\ In	a^-	count-

Worshipping: at <5eriain shrines is of-the most ancient dale and coeval with religion renditions relative to the pilgrim, limit in many ways th*; number
of th^ devotees. The Mohammedan must be of	age.	having ,'ompKted his	fifteenth

Arriving at Marseilles, the author tooK a steamer to Suez,' (ind thence to Jiddnh. a port on the Red Sea. some 040 miles distant. From Jiddah to Mecca is forty-six miles.	Mecca w*as	reached	without
much trouble, and at once the guide	proposed that	the pilgrim	should	visit	the
harem, where is that holy of holies, the Ka’bali. The Ka'bah is described as a black stone, having a length of fourteen yards, a width of eleven yards, and sixteen yards high. It is of dark-eolored granite. Innumerable are the stories concerning its origin. The orthodox Mussulman believes that It fell from hea\en and was originally whiter than milk. All the ceremonies	attending	worship	at	the
harem are fully described. The reward of the penitent is great. At every step the pilgrim takes, 70,000 sins are forgiven him. Somehow the Persian is skeptical, for he inveighs against the priest-ridden fanatics and the Mullas of Mecca.
Not far from the miraculous black stone is the well, called Zem-Zem. Here the faithful wash their winding sheets. An act of that kind insures an entrance to heaven. After the visit paid to the harem, a pilgrimage to Arafat was in order. The Muslims call Arafat the “ Mountain of Mercy.” Hadji Khan joined a party of Malays, and among the pilgrims was one who, having run amuck in Penang, had done to death his wife and family. The penitents were afflicted with cholera, and many succumbed to the fatal disease. The procession to Arafat took on the aspect of a tumult. In hurrying to the front tlie pious risked their lives, such was the crush. Notwithstanding the disorder, religious enthusiasm was at its height. Returning to Mecca, ,the author went book hunting, and was fortunate enough to find some precious works. In Mecca he visited the bazaars, and found a row of booths whose sole business was the selling of winding sheets. Having a headache, he called on a native doctor, who carries on various mummeries. There were many shops where talismans could
be purchased.
For an insight into the mind of the Oriental, and more particularly of the followers of the Prophet, with the ceremonies of his faith, we know of nothing

At the conclusion Mr. Wilfrid Spiirroy writes ;> chapter on the slave market in Mecca Mr. Sparroy. of course, denounces slavery, but be explains why the Muslim never can understand the Furo-pean s aversion to human bondage. The Mussulman is taught that he is the slave of (iod. ’How." lie asks, ' can morality and law nourish in a continent in which thought is free, in which women are free, in which (Jod's will Is superseded by the will of man'.’ Freedom! I say we are all slaves of other men." Mr. Sparroy writes that I lie Muslim priests inculcate this particular doctrine, and thus enslave their followers. If the trade in slaves may have diminished on the seaboard, nevertheless the land route is always open.
