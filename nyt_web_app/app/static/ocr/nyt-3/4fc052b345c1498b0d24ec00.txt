Century Company. $1.50.
“ The Fugitive Blacksmith," by Mr. Charles Stewart, is another of those “ first books ” that make the reader fall to wondering by what possible apprenticeship its author arrived, unseen and unheard by the world at large, at such full-grown mastery of the art of story telling —perhaps not mastery of the technical difficulties of style and construction, but surely of the more intangible and unusual qualities of insight, originality, hu mor, philosophy, and all that is wont to distinguish the veteran novelist from the amateur. Any veteran might well be glad and proud to round off even tho achievement of a lifetime with a study of human nature such as this story of Mr. Stewart’s "Blacksmith,”? so interesting in fresh, and unexpected ways, so rich in the fruits of keen and kindly observation, and the true artist’s appreciation of much that escapes the untrained eye.
From the first chapters one would get. the idea that it was going to be a story of the Finertys, who are certainly worth a. book to themselves. But Finerty, who is nightkeeper of the sandhouse and coal-ehutes in the Memphis railroad yards, has the habit of playing the willing host to any one who happens in to relieve his lonely hours of night duty, and with the appearance at the sandhouse of the tramp. Stumpy, the Finertys practically become mere hungry listeners to Stumpy’s tale of the wonderful adventures of his one-time partner. Bill, the Fugitive Bkicltsmith, continued night after night in intervals of Finerty’s work. Finerty did manare to spare time to gtfe fiuT&hgines sand and coal, but the interruption always causu^ him to grumble audibly and to caution Stumpy not to ** forget the place.” Poor _Mrs. Finerty, who was abnormally afraid of tramps, and therefore only visited the sandhouse in the necessary process of carrying to her Michael his shining dinner pail, had to content herself with hearing
the story at second hand next day, when, by dint of much ingenious pumping, she drew from her sleepy husband the last thrilling' installment.
A sandhouse keeper, numberless tramps, 1 and a jack at all trades, blacksmithing j included, of whom the police were in | pursuit for the supposed murder of a boatswain on a Boston bark, might si-cm to be unpromising material for any kind of a story, let alone a remarkably sood one, but that persoi) would indeed ba a misanthrope past all cure who could live with the Finertys, Stumpy, and Bill,
through this book and not feel his sympathies broadened, his understanding of the waifs and strays of this world deepened, and his own cares and troubles lightened by contrast. Mr, Stewart's fund ot* humor is both rich and rare, and of a quality that is found only in those whose natures have been sweetened and ripened by a thorough experience of life’s poiUh-ing processes. One can see plainly enough that Bill is a man after his own heart, and when it is learned that in his thirty-seven years he himself has tramped, worked at the forge, been a riverman on the Mississippi, and a sheep herder on the plains of Texas, an engraver, and. latest of all, a labor leader and an author—one understands very well why this story reads true and takes an irresistible hold upon one’s feelings and imagination. If it does not prove a worthily popular la-vorite it will be the fault of the popuiar taste and appreciation.
Finerty’s ~*phi!osophy, Mrs. Finerty’s penetration and logic, and the blacksmith's splendid and never-fail ing1 faculty of being able to " make annything out av annything," as Stumpy expressed it, are things unique and delightful, and the comparatively small, and therefore unsatisfying, disclosure of them that Mr. Stewart makes in his first book succeeds principally in implanting the fervent hope that he will not stop with “The Fugitive Blacksmith.” There is, fortunately, a generous fullness about the atmosphere of this story that convinces the most casual observer that the man who conceived and executed the-character of Bill has not written himself out in one book, but has deeps in his experience from which he can long draw satisfying draughts for those weary of the problem novel, the letter novel, and the claptrap historical novel, but is pining for more of just such actualities and good fun as Mr. Stewart knows about.
