THE SOIL.
A. D. Hall's Book in Which the Bac« teriologicat Factors of Agriculture Are Treated.
I' COURSE, it is on the soil that agriculture rests. We j all know that much, but there are many other considerations which have to do with tho abundance or the quality of the crop. TndeeJ, the entire subject is a complicated one, with .1 infinite number of factors. Mr. A. D. Hail, in his volume entitled “ The Soil.” presents a scientific study of the growth of crops, many of his deductions derived from the experimental agricult- , unil station at Rothamsted. Engird. Until within the tast few years sM«Jy of vegetable growth was mainly of a chemical and physical character, but to-day has been added a third element wnich is biological. To Liebig and Boussingault the world is indebted for chemical research. The German experts H*-ltriegel and Wilfarth during the last twenty years have shown clearly the character of the bacteria concerned in th^ grrowth of plants. The problems involved are far more complex than they appear. Sample analysis can be carried out wifi the same exact results as when the Assiy Department determines the absolute quantity of gold in an amalgam. EtMt in order to gauge the quality of a soil fitted for the growth of plants many oA.her matters must be studied. The density is one of these considerations. How it will receive moisture; how it will retain the water; how deip it is—all these things count. Mr. Hall writes:
If on the one hand the soil can be considered as a great reservoir of plant food, which can be recovered in the crops, on the other hand it is equally coirect to regard the soil as a manufactory for transforming raw material in the shape of manure into the finished article—the crop.
It is well In a study of 1111.? character lo remember that in nature nothing is destroyed. There are only changes of conditions, or transmutations, if you please to call them so. Nothing is dissl-pated from the face of the earth. You may take away millions of bushels of wheat from the ground and send it away, but it goes somewhere else. There are parts of England where the fertility is on the increase: that is because fyoni virgin soil in countries remote from Great Britain are brought great quantities of linseed, maize, and cottonseed, which are fed to stock, “ and so there travels to the soil some of the wealth of the lands upon which these crops were grown."
After study in the laboratory of the various substances found in the soil, the j main question is, What Is the just pro- ' portion of these ingredients to give the best results for the growth of desirable plants? It belongs to geology to determine how the soil originated. We always go back to the rocks and their disintegration. There falls no drop of rain or flake of snow which does not act on the rocks. Then there arc the differences of temperature. The very first growth of the smallest lichen on a bare rock is the beginning of a change. Among the forces not to be overlooked is the action of the winds. They do not create soil, but they transport it from one section and sift it to another. The soil, it is true, is a storehouse for the alimentation of the plant, but recent research has dissipated the idea that it is a dead mass.
It is rather a busy, complex laboratory, where a multitude of minute organisms, vegetable residues, and manures are reduced—we might almost say digested—*io a condi tioiv in which they will serve as food for plants, and aid directly in their , nutrition; others, again, arc noxious to the food stores in the soil.
Water alone has but limited solvent power, but, as all chemists are aware, by combination with carbonic acid it gains great solvent power. Carbonic acid exists naturally in the ground, so that at some depths the percolating water actually becomes a weak solution of the carbonic acid. It was Darwin who showed what was the mechanical and chemical action of the worms in the soil, and how they produced a fine upper surface, rich with vegetable matter. Mr. Hall's text is of exceeding interest when he presents the results of recent researches on the living organisms found in the soil. He says:
The soil is the seat of a number of slow chemical changes affecting the organic material it receives; residues of an animal or vegetable nature, when applied to the soil, and converted into the dark-colored complex known as " humus," which becomes eventually oxidized to carbonic acid and other simple substances serving as food for plants. These changes, at one time regarded as purely chemical, are now recognized as dependent upon the vital processes of certain minute organisms, universally distributed throughout cultivated soil, and subject to the same laws of nutrition, multiplication, life, and death as hold for the higher organisms with which we are more generally familiar. * * • Attempts have been made to estimate the number of bacteria contained In the soil;

the upper soil, show little beyond the fart that the soil is tenanted much as any other decaying organic material i would be.	i
The study of these soil bacteria is yet ! at its beginning. It may be lhat when ; understood they will be made to serve us j in the better cultivation of our fields. | They seem to possess the power of break- ■ ing up fixed gases or even solid sub- j stances and so making them more assim- | liable by the plants. These processes, however, called " symbiotic," are not well ! defined as yet, and while it may be that j the extent of the work attributed to organisms has been somewhat exaggerated, their utility cannot be questioned, Mr. Hail mentions that in a number of tentative experiments increase in the productivity of the soil by the artificial in- j troduction of the bacteria was not evident. The bacteria of a beneficent charac- ,
i
ter seem to cling to the clover growths, j and these, when they remain in the J soil, give their help to the crops which follow. What was wanted was , the fixation of nitrogen, to be change<T at tho pleasure of the organisms. Nobbe Cor this purpose made a jelly culture which he called " nitragin. r In it were placed the bacteria, and the seeds lo be planted were watered with a solution of nitragin. Certain experiments made in England did not show any remarkable results. In Germany there have
been fair results when a poor soil has been inoculated with soil containing these bacteria. All these organisms are not invariably of the beneficent kind, for some of them propagate a disease known as “ finger-and-toe." or "club," or “anbury." They destroy cabbages and other cruciferous crops, and are difficult to exterminate.
Mr. Hall's study of irrigation deserves careful attention, especially as far as it relates to alkali lands. Lord Milner, in his " England in Egypt," writes:	!
It was the want of drainage which completed the ruin of the Birriya, that broad I belt of land which occupies the northern j and lowest portion of the delta adjoining the great lakes. There are upward of 1,00<),(xto acres of this region, now swamp, or salt marsh, or otherwise uncultivated, w'hich in ancient times were i the garden of Egypt.	:
Questions having to do with the liming j of the soil and various other topics are all treated in the work. Considering the soils which are reputed to-day to be of wonderful fertility, the author says that, ; as a rule, they contain an appreciable amount of organic matter at all depths. The soil from Winnipeg showed as much as 0.4S*J to 0.107 per cent, from the top of tho soil to 4 feet below the surface. At j the conclusion of the volume Is to be ; found a complete bibliography of the nu- j mCrous subjects treated.	,
