In your reference oi the 25th inst. to the Son. Ail drew o. White's career, while you speak of his being- an attache of the American Legation at St. Petersburg just after leaving college, and as serving as New York State Senator and as first President of Cornell University and Minister to Germany, &c., you omit to state that prior to entering on a political career, for some eight years, on his return from Russia, he was Professor of Modem History in Michigan University, where his rare’ gifts as teacher and lecturer first made him known to the educational
world* and served in a high degree to prepare him for a more extended career in both literary and National affairs. Recalling his work In life, Mr. White has often remarked to his'friends that no experience of his, in memory, is more pleasant than his professorship of years in Ann Arbor, where hG gained the discipline and strength such as served to fit him for the work that lay before him In after years. GEORGE NEWELL LOVEJOY.
