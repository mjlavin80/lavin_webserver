F^OJMC RE ADERS.
yew York Tims# Book Review:
In all the discussion that has be**n going on in The Satup.day Review as to the John Hancock of Dwight Tilton's Colonial novel, “ My Lady Laughter,” I have failed to see any special stress laid upon the fact that Hancock was in his very early years undecided with which cuusf' to pitch his ter.t. His triples, inclinations, and a gTeat ma.ny of his affiliations were with the Tories. One would have expected him to gravitate to that side of the struggle by the sJit'cr force of circumstances. But that ho instead joined the patriots, and often put his own safety in danger in iloing so, is, in my opinion, sufficient testimony *us to his great qualities.
I know it Hus been said that Hancock was won over to the cause of liberty by j the flattery ruitl cajolery of won like Otis I and Adams. lint there is more assertion than evidence as to that. And his vanity j and love of display wen* not enough to I j blind hi? countrymen to his conspicuous :
;	merits in other directions. If one will
!	read “ My Lady Laughter ” he will see
j	that Dwight Tilton has himself uncon-
[	sciouslv t"iven tribute- to Ilancuck's better i
