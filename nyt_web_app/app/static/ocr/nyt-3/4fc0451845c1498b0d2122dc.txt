WORLD HISTORY.
The First Five Volumes o? Twe»ty= four Founded on the German AHgemeine Weltgeschichte.”*
HE editorial responsibility for this compilation, the material of which Is mainly derived from that excellent German work, " Die Allgemeine Welt-geschichte," seems to rest (in so far, at least, as the translations are concerned.) with John Henry Wright, LL.D., Professor of Greek in Harvard University and Dean of the Graduates' School, as well as editor in chief of the second series or the “ American Journal of Archaeology.” A general preface at the beginning of the first volume sets fortlx-in what fashion the German original has been supplemented, and admits that this material has been in places abridged. Nineteen volumes out of the twenty-four are confessedly based upon the German tent. Of the others, three, covering the history of the New World, arc the work of the late John Fiske, as completed by Prof. Henry Morse Stephens of the University of California, while one which brings down to date the history of the Oid World (to which the first nineteen yolu ies are devoted) has been contributed by Prof. Charles if- Andrews of Bryn Mawr College, and William
E.	Lingelbach, Assistant Professor of Modern European History in the University of Pennsylvania. The twenty-fourth and final volume is devoted to a general and comprehensive index of the series.
Of the total of four and twenty volumes (the only ones now before us are the five devoted to the section of history commonly called ancient; the five which concern the Middle Ages, the ten which are assigned to the modern history of the Old World, the three on the New World, and the index volume are yet to come.
The body of the first two volumes is a translation of the work of Ferdinand Justi, Professor in the University of Marburg, and covers the history of Egypt and the ancient Asiatic empires. However, in the first volume, in order to avail himself of ther results of the latest dis--'coveries, the editor has had the section on the earliest history of Egypt rewritten by Sara Yorke Stevenson, Sc. D-, curator of the Egyptian Section of the Museum of Science and Art of the University of Pennsylvania., and in the second volume, where Prof. Justi's treatment of the Jews seemed tcj him inadequate, he has inserted two chapters on Jewish history and one on Jewish literature, written by the Rev. Dr. P. H. Steenstra, Professor in the Episcopal Theological School, Cambridge., Further additional matter affecting tfce^ relations of the Jews and the more powerful Oriental empires of remote antiquity has been * supplied by Morris Jas4 trow. Professor of Semitic Languages at the University of Pennsylvania, while the portions of the second volume which deal with Oie Persian and Indian empires have^been revised by A. V. Williams Jackson, L- H. D., Ph. D., LL. D.» Professor of'lnCo-Iranian Languages in Columbia University. In this same second volume, after the countries in touch with ancient Europe are disposed of, some thirty pages are set apart for a brief surrey of the empires of China and ~ Japan-down to the lSCO's or thereabout.
F.	Wells Williams# Professor of Modern Oriental History Jik Yale University, is the author of these pages. The first volume surveys at large the successive Egyptian empires and the earliest beginning of power in the Tigris and Euphrates Valley. The second volume contains the history of Western Asia through the
-	pires of the Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, the conquests of Alexander th£ Great, the kingdoms of Alexander’s successors, the Parthian Empire, and so passes on to the history of India. Every period Is copiously Illustrated with maps, diagrams, and cuts of antique remains— many of them in colors and very elaborate. Text and pictures will'supply as much as most people care to know about these ancient peoples, and much more than anybody can remember. However, it Is a book of reference.
The third volume fs devoted to " Ancient Greece,” and is chiefly a translation of the German of Gustav Friederich HerU-berg of the University of Halle, written for the M Allgemelne Geschlchte." How-evef, the German professor's work is supplemented by some additions and revisions for which William Nickerson Bates, Ph, 0., Assistant Professor of Greek in the University of Pennsylvania, is responsible, These changes have been made advisable by recent archaeological investigation in Crete and elsewhere. The xrffe,t-ter of the volume Is divided Into three books—the first covering Greek history from the Pelasgic age to the Persian v?ars, the second dealing with the Persian and Peloponnesian conflicts, and extending to the waning of the brief empire

of Thebes, the third devoted to the Macedonian. period and the decadence. Volumes IV. and V, are both concerned 'Wlth''Kome, and rest chiefly, like Volume
III., upon the authority of Prof. Hertz-berg. Volume IV. is entitled “ Republican Home.’* It covers the period from T5G through the Punic wars and the years of civil struggle and conquest—the days of Marius, Sylla, Pompey, Caesar, to the battle of Actlum and the death of Marc Antony. Volume V. traces ttie bloody and tragic course of the empire from Augustus to Constantine, and from Constantine to the final division of the East and West. This volume contains also, as a sort of appendix, a chapter on late Roman literature and education by George W. Robinson, A. B., ot Cambridge, Mass. All the volumes are Illustrated In the ample fashion already noted in describing the first two, and each volume is provided with a convenient summary at the end called an “ analytical table ot contents/* This arrangement serves pretty well the purpose of an Index. One could wish (perhaps) that the editors had Indicated more fully and systematically where the work of the original German authorities gives place to that of the revisers. Except for a few chapters credited beneath the title to the writer, you must refer for information or this sort to the general preface at the beginning of the first volume, a proceeding which is Inconvenient, to say the least of It. However, as before remarked, the book is a work of reference, and seeks to present rather Information than authorities for Information, to supply the wants of the many who are not critical rather than to meet the demands of the few who are. Not that the form is what is called “ popular.” The pages bristle with facts and dutes and such hard and useful matters-
