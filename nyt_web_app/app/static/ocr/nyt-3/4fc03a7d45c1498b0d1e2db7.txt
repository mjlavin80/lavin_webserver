A new and cheaper edition of Mrs.. J Sarah Austen’s translation from the Ger- I man of the six " books ” of “ The History of the Reformation in Germany," by Leopold von Ranke, is brought out in America this week by E. P. Dutton & Co. The new work, in one volume, is edited by Robert A. Johnson, who has provided an introduction and some notes and a short bibliography of the more Important histories that have appeared since Ranke's work.
Mr. Johnson points out in his introduction that this is not a complete work. Mrs. Austeri gives*only three out of the original five volumes, taking the reader down to the end only of the second of the three periods Into which the historian divided his work. He also touches upon the writings and aims and characteristics of Ranke. In his present volume, he writes, " ttje historian deals with the relations of Church, and State in Germany. r His purpose is to show that just is the \inediaeval history of Germany had ttwned upon the contest between the Empire and. the Papacy, so, that of the sixteenth century centred around the struggle between Catholicism and Protestantism. Though he does not deny the influence of personal character bn the development of the plot, he insists more especially on the effect of the German Constitution and of the Empire, both the "''products of past history, upon the course of the Reformation in that country. According to his method he seeks for the interpretation of events chiefly in the dispatches of Ambassadors and in the political correspondence o"f contemporary statesmen, while somewhat neglecting the faiths and aspirations expressed in the general literature of the age.’’ The book presents a somewhat external picture of the times.
It is divided into six sections and deals with the attempt to reform the Constitu* tion of the German Empire, the early history of Luther and of Charles V., the endeavors to render the Reformation national and complete, the foreign relations—the foundation of the National Churches of Germany, tne formation of a Catholic majority, and th<» origin and progress of the League of Schmalkald.
