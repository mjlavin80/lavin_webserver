X>K. HARPER'S BOOK.
The University Considered as the “ Prophet of Democracy.”*
R. HARPER of the University of Chicago calls the university the " prophet of democracy." His new book Is made up of various addresses and magazine articles, most of which have been talked aooui ana written about already; the j value of the book and the chief Interest | of it consists in the total effect of the assembled material. It makes possible the formation of something like a general | r idea of what the newest and most elaborate and most expensive modern educa- i tional machinery rsivans. It presents also i something like a complete official interpretation of the ideals and aims of the new thing. It is quite useless to deny lhat after all lhis new thing, as Dr. Harper conceives it, is simply the University of Chicago. This, notwithstanding his cleverness in making his statements general. Among <>ther things Dr. Harper savs-and this Is in a manner hia lext:
The three marks of a university are self-governing. freedom from ecclesiastical control, and the right of free utterance.
Here i? another significant passage; ,
What is a university to-day? A self-governing association of men for the purpose oi study; an institution privileged by the State for guidance of the people; an agency reorganized by the people for resolving the problems of civilization which present themselves in the development of civilization.	~
]t is the last part of this definition upon which Dr. Harper especially insists. Therein lies the office of prophet, or as he expands the idea, borrowing the Biblical conception, the Messiahship. The university (the modern university be it un-derstoodi is the Messiah of democracy— its prophet, priest, sage, salvation. The notion is interesting, and will excite in many vehement contradiction. On the other hand many will see in it » grain of truth. since. as Dr. Harper explains, every body’s teacher or the teacher's teacher or the teachers teacher's teacher is or was a university man. Dr. Harper remarks that “ the State has no more right than the Church lo interfere with the search for truth, or with its promulgation when found.'’
The State and Church alike may have their own schools and colleges for the training of youthful mind?, for the propagation of special kinds of intelligence, and in these it may choose what special coloring shall be given to the instruction. This is proper, for example, in the military schools of the State, and in the theological schools of the Church. But such schools are not universities. They do not represent the people, they do not come out of the people. * * * The university, 1 maintain, is the prophetic interpreter of democracy; the prophet Of her past in all its vicissitudes', the prophet of her present in all its complexity; the prophet of her future in all its possibilities.
Of his democracy President Harper says '• I is Cod is mankind, humanity; its altar homo; its temple country. The one doctrine of democracy's creed is the . brotherhood, and consequently the equality, of man." Nevertheless, he says also this:
Iu a monarchy or aristocracy there is a place for men of wealth. How is it in a democracy? Here, too. there must be a place for such; but what shall it he and by what determined'1 What, too, shall democracy finally determine concerning the great business corporations which to a great extent now control the commercial life of the nation? These are not survivals from an aristocracy. They ai>* the product of democracy. Democrat herself is responsible for them. llo\'v will she a J just herself to them and them to herse))
I >r. Carper floes not enierlain the supposition that these corporations may be the beginnings of a new aristocracy. Hut otln-ry inclme to lintt ihrory.

AU Ihese ; points have been much diSGUSSOd Since, Another valuable paper deals with that very ticklish subject of exactly, how -far a university may go in the matter of furnishing schools devoted to lnvestlga- ! tion and instruction in religious matterB without ceasing to be free and there- I fore (by Dr, Harper's definition) losing its title to be a university at all. The prophet of democracy must, of course, investigate and try to interpret everything.
Another paper deals with co-educatior. of the sexes, which Dr. Harper declares to be a " step forward," though somehow he seems to have an opening to the admission that it is one of those steps forward which are taken when one is feel- 1 ing for the pathway in the dark—a step which must be taken, but may possibly have to be retraced. When it comes to . enlargement upon what a modern university plant should be Dr. Harper is, of course, magnificent. One can imagine the feelings of a professor in a small college—starved of so many books and appliances he longs for and needs—as he reads the Doctor's magnificent specifications for libraries, laboratories, and departmental equipment.
There are chapters on the " Civic Relation of the Theological Seminary,”
** The Theological Curriculum,” " University Training for a Business Career,” "The Situation of the Small College.” This last subject is one of vast interest to many people, and one on which a wide diversity of opinion exists. The remaining papers must be lumped in the general statement that they <Ul help more or less in understanding the new or Western idea of education as Dr. Harper sees it.
The Work at Chicago.
THE DECENNIAL PUBLICATIONS OF
THE UNIVERSITY OP CHICAGO.
First series, -(to. Ten volumes. Chicago:
The University of Chicago Press. $40.
In the nature of things the contents of these handsome volumes admit of little more in this place than enumeration. The first of thP series of ten quartos, bound substantially in red cloth, contains the President’s report for the first ten years of the life of that very lusty infant giant the University of Chicago. These ten years are counted from July 3,	1802,
(marking the beginning of actual work thereA to July. 1902, though the report embraces also preliminary matter from the announcement of Mr. Rockefeller’s foundation in 1S&>. Tho same volume includes, as well, reports of other officers of the university for the same period—reports of the Deans of the several colleges and schools, reports of the Directors of the library, of the university press, of university extension, of athletics, of the laboratories. A historical sketch fills out the complement of 574 pages. The second volume, much thinner than the first, (containing only 1K.1 pages,) is a catalogue of publications of the members of the university during the ten years mentioned, these publications including books, arti-’ cles, and reviews.
The titles are here duly classified by subjects and frequently accompanied by explanatory paragraphs, it is a very imposing list and runs, of course, to scientific and academic, aspects. The volumes from HI. to X.. inclusive, arc made up of contributions of original investigation represent ing the various university departments. Vol. HI. (Pp. I.m) contains of such matter the groups under the following heads:	Pan	f.. systematic theology,
church history, practical theology, and Part II.. philosophy and education. Several of the articles printed hcre-as, for instance, one entitled, “ Have We the Likeness of Christ*.’"—are illustrated. Vol. IV. (pp. is devoted to theses on political economy, political science, history, .sociology, and anthropology, a more homogenoojs group than the last, though it includes titles as widely different as *■ The rse of Koan Credit in Modern Business " and ‘ The Relation of the Medicine Alan to the (.bi^in of the Professional Occupations." Vol. V, d‘p.	invades the
province of the Semiiic languages and tin ratines, and deals also with Patristic Greek. Kive < oiunbuthms (some of them elaborately ilListraied with plates) take up the whole space. Vol. VI. (Pp. ^86) passes to classical Creek and l>atln subjects, co’np;ii‘a;h c philology, and classical archaeology, the first of the eleven papers being upon " A Creek Hand Mirror in the Ait Institute of Chicago." and the last entitled The Introduction of Com^ edy lmo the ciiy of 1 lionysia."
Volume VII.. a ^ t-ry thick fellow, though It carries only pap-s. is devoted to the Romance lan-’uc^es. the Cermanic languages, the Knm..m e ;)nd (Jermanie literatures, and to Knplish. The eight con-
11ibulions iia-kUr ; ]i investigation into the text of Chaucer's ■■ Partement of Foules,”
“ Stories in popular Poetry," and a learned disquisition upon the niceties of the use of tin- C< :man relatives "das” and " was."
Volume V111 il’p 11J) is concerned in elaborate scientific and mathematical detail with astronomy and astro-physics— measurements of double stars at the Yerkes Observatory, problems *’ in celestial mechanics," radial \elocities of stars, 1
spectra of stars, astronomical photography, &c. There are seven papers on these subjects, Volume IX.. contains in 206 pages thirteen, articles on chemistry, physics. geology, and mathematics, the first of the series dealing with the velocity of light and the last being a " Contribution to the Theory of Glacial Motion.” This is elaborately illustrated with photographic plates. Volume X„ with 3ftG pages, (besides many plates,) is the last of the series. The subjects to which its space is given are 'zoology, anatomy, physiology, neurology, botany, pathology, and bacteriology-seventeen papers, distributed among the sciences named.
Enough has been said to hint at the j nature of the work and its vastness. It may be added that it is » mass ot fragments, but the readers for whom the books are intended do not need to be told that. A second series to follow and to 1 consist of seventeen volumes will include t “ more elaborate contributions,” ranging | rrom a morality play, ** The Life and Repentance of Mary Magdalene,” to the " Study of Stellar Evolution,” and a “History of Greenbacks.”
