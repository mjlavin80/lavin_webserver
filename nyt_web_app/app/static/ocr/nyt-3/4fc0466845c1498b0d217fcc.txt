“An Act In a Backwater " Treats of Lite in n Quiet English Town.*
X ACT IN A KACKWATKK ” is in Mr. Hanson's lighter vein. but written with : < 11 his
ncMismmed cleverness mimI
humor, and it forms a delightful ('immfHUiry on hu-m;m nature in general as w<*ll as on il particular manifestations in (in* quiet, not to say dull. KhKlish mwii of Wi'uxinn. That if' to say. Wi'ir;-tnn was und'Miln*dly dull w» tin*' casual, unnbs^rva nt eye of Hny but its most de-v<ded inhabitants, but a quit** different st;ite of affairs is revealed when Mr. Henson begins to examine il for literary purposes and discovers the possibililies for I'Uici■utinm<-nt in the vanities and pom- i positifs id Colonel Raymond, in the pa t 1km ion I! y innocent enthusiasm nf the elderly Miss Cliffords, the strenuous but irritating virtue nf Mrs. Canon < ’olling-wood. the doings of the l.adi*-*s' Literarv I ‘ni• 11f. wln-rc very improving and r-omei iinf’s amusing pieces were reud.'' nnd in tho contrasting uncon vent iona lit y at n fiolum Street, whither the exigencies of fortune had brought a son and daue;h-tf,r of ihe late t-ord Avesham to live while tin* son was initiated into the vulgar hut lucrative mysteries of brewing beer.
In 111*' nyes of WroxtOll the intrusion ! of beer did not at all detract from the brilliance of a noble name, and for all smts and conditions of Wrnxtonitos a in w interest w.is added to life by the selling iti their midst or 'hose two youthful hut exceedingly wideawake members 'd lb*' bouse O! Avesham. Kven on the day they n:o\ed into Bolton Street a consuming curiosity kept the younger j Miss Clifford wobbling back and forth | pa si the house on her bicycle. from which ‘die had to dismount wiienever she needed to turn round, whfle *>n the same occasion Colonel Raymond happened onee at least to be n^ar enough to lend a hand > with an abnormally heavy bookcase. Colon' ! Kivnmnls interest in the new- , comer*; was more painful than pleasurable, as lie had ;tll his life been shining in the much-diluted glory of having a wife whose brother-m-law's sist*-r was . the kite Kady Avesham. and if some nf j his mueh-bonsted noble relatives, who did ; no' know him from Adam, were actually comirm to live in Wrox ton In' had an irritating cons -iuusneFR that his habitual \ cor versHtion would have to be curtailed nr, «t'H worse, corrected. It therefore behooved th" Colonel to obtain a suit-abty familiar f miing in Poitou Street at the earliest povsible moment, and he* hovered in the vicinity like the traditional mot it nemd the ranOle. His experiences In this process of inti odiiei ion, and even at t< i ward, were of a variMy calculated to pierce even his thick-skinned egotism, and in l';»ct the exposure of th“ Colonel's character in nil its d*\ ious ramifical ions fjoitr* Ihe h.-st tiling ill the hook. :ii<d
iimusins: enough by itself to pay for ns i ending.
Mrs. Col 1 in grrnod. whose horizon was bounded hy Ihe Cathedral Close. ;tnd who vvag*d fierce warfare upon the use of stimulants and modern fiction, adds unin- j terruptedly to the gayety of the story, and is unhide in her narrow British bigo'rv, as is the Colonel in his unblushing pr~-t''ns.-s The Miss Cliffords are delightful tvpes of the kind of maiden lady who never grows old in her tastes. Miss Clara was forty-two. her sister. Phoebe, a year or two older; but (Mara rode her biey.de nnd wrote lyrics, while Phoebe accompanied sentimental ditties on her mandolin
with exactly the same flow of youthful i spirits as in iheir teens. They were happy and satisfied and foil no tragedy in their lives, but it was there all the same as they float rd slowly around in a backwater of life, while the adventure and romance of living swept by them.
Nothing has oeen said so far of the heroine and hero of Mr. Benson's charming'
little story, but it has both of those indispensable adjuncts, anti naturally they bear no small part in tho proceedings. Mr. iien-son has been known to draw smart English society in terms hartHy complimentary to either its brains or its heart, but the aristocrats in this book are of the true-blue variety. There was not a drop of snobbish blood in Jeannte or Arthur Avesham. or in their wonderful Aunt Km-ma. and all that was sincere, natural, and worth while in Wroxton was accepted by them with a simplicity quite disarming; things like the Colonel and Mrs. Colling-wood were, as simply, kept at arm's length and made game of, greatly to the reader s satisfaction.
An epidemic of typhoid fever in the village gives the Aveshams an opportunity altogether to win the hearts of their neighbors by nursing thora. regardless of weariness or danger, and it also conv inces Mr, Jack Collingwood, an artist, and therefore the black sheep of the Canon's family, ihni Jeannle Avesham's safety is of Infinite importance to himself. Strangely enough, that was exactly what Jeannie ' had unconsciously been waiting for him

As an example, not of Mr. Benson's power. l.M it of his wit, cleverness, ami ( knowledge of human nature. An Act [ in a [{firkwii i *-i- 1 is a delightful hit of work.
