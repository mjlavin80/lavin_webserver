New York Times Book Review:	^
If ever, very rarely, and not in later days, have I had at the same lime a handy pencil and the impulse to *' .spontaneous applause ” to which KL G. W. attributes the marking of books. But being without sin myself, I have not grown harsh to sinners, and on the whole find a book enhanced by the markings of others. I remember of a dull afternoon, at a junction in Maine, finding on the marble top table of the *' hotel ’* a book by p.n authoress known for the quantity rather than quality of her novels—a novel of the heart, Its marking by a passionate reader (I suspected the wife of mine host) left it not only readable, but a thrilling record of the tastes, the aspirations, the heart throbs of its marker. There was one who has gone, an inveterate marker of books, and in no way can 1 comc so close to her, do I feel her keen appreciation, her joy In life and beauty, her sympathy and humor, as when I take up one of her books. An essay, a poem, a biography, a novel; her Shakespeare, a cheap edition of thin, badly printed pages (n one volume, her I^amb, her Swinburne or
Shaw, how illuminated the text by the dear comment, the quoted verse, the twin lines along the side, meant to be but which never arc parallel, one always a shade blacker than the other, done with a stub of a pencil by slender, nervous fingers!
No! For myself I do not mark books. I like clean, white margins; and then I am too lazy and sclf-conscious and am afraid of being found out.	R.	D.	W.
