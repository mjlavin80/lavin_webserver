The Reign of Terror.
IX XIIK NAME or* LIBERTY:	A Story
of the Terror. By Owen Johnson. One volume. Hp. 40U. New York; The Century Company.
! Though the title of Mr. Owen Johnson's i book, "In the Name of Liberty: a Story i of the Terror," may cause regret that the i author of so promising a beginning as ! '* Arrows of the Almighty ” should so j soon resort to that thrice hackneyed source of the French Revolution for story-building material, his readers will later be agreeably relieved to find themselves treated to a fresh and interesting view of a subject that would seem to have been exhausted of all novelty. Running over the long list of tales that have relied on the harrowing events of this social upheaval to carry their quota of admirable or villainous or picturesque characters brilliantly through three or four hundred l»ages to some sort of a finish and to i earn thereby the magic title of " historical novel," not many will be recalled in which the familiar horrors are pictured with so vivid a reality as by Mr. Johnson, or in i which the people who take part in tho great upheaval are so manifestly of another nation and time than our own.
The background of the story is the violent days of the Revolution, and the shadow of that event is cast over its ; pages, but the author, has a drama of his own imagining to work out amid these ! grim surroundings, and one can but ad-1 mire the cleverness with which he has made reality and fiction supplement and sustain each other whilo keeping the reader's (attention wholly engrossed by the very simple and pathetic love story of Nicole and Barabant. The centre of interest is not Marat or Robespierre or any other of the sinister figures of the period, but Nicole, a youthful seller of cockades, who is caught in the whirl of events, and, through the purifying influence of her first sincere affection rises to great spiritual heights of devotion and self-sacrifice. “ In the Name of Liberty *' differs from most novels of its kind in being a story of the common people of Paris .as affected by the Revolution. Lords and ladies are conspicuously absent from view, and the reader threads his way among mean streets, enters doubtful cabarets, climbs steep and rickoty stairways, listens to rough and ribald talk as ho follows Nicole's fortunes from bad to worse, but the all-essential qualities of human nature are there, and the interest never flags from beginning to end. I^icole at first is a poor little waif of the streets, learned enough by necessity in the ways of evil to protect herself from the thousand dangers that stalfcecTabroad in the Paris of those days, but through her love for Barabant she blossoms into a womanhood as beautiful and strong as could have been found in the length and breadth of the Faubourg St. Germafn.
Nicole- Is very real, very attractive, and very pathetic in her whole-souled devotion to a lover who appreciated as little as ho understood the heart that ho had won ^without an effort. Her story is a tragedy, bat there is plenty of humor in the book and plenty of diversion in the way of curious and fantastic characters. One of these Is Loulson, a companion of Nicole, who exhibits the strangest insensibility to the dally suffering which she sees and an uncanny deligjit In the horrors of the guillotine—all explained when she turns* out to be a daughter of the public executioner and the descendant of a long line of executioners,
Mr. Johnson Is said to have spent two years in Paris while gathering material for this story, and It bears the stamp of such careful writing as that would imply —a vivid and vigorous handling of a subject that has been used to the point of threadbareness.
