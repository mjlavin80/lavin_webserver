DR; THORPE*S HISTORY
The Constitution of the United States and Those of the Various States of the Union.*
ROF. Thorpes	present word
differs	from	his	previous
writings on American i on st'tutional history in breadth of scope and absence of detail. Within the narrow confines	of	350 pages	he attempts	to write
the	history of	State	and	Federal
Constitutions, their origins, principles, ; evolution, and the interpretation of them by tae courts. Hence only the salient facts can be noted. As an appendix, the Constitution of the United States, with citation of cases, is printed. 1'here is a special index to the Constitution, giving article, section, and page, as well as a general index to the work at large. There is no bibliography, but we are told that the works consulted by the author in the preparation of his larger books form
the material used here.
After a rapid survey of the early Colonial unions and congresses, and of the Articles of Confederation and their defects, there is a short chapter on the making uf the Constitution, followed by an analysis of The Federalist to show what we.-e a.ni are the fundamental principles of the Constitution. Dr. Thorpe's conclusions about State Sovereignty \s. Nationality are so sane as to deserve quotation.
“ Without attempting to declare the truth or falsity of the doctrine that the States were sovereign, we must conclude that it was unquestionably the ruM,ng “j*;** in ITiSS. Time might prove the doctrine impracticable as a working principle, but The strength of the argument lay with the state sovereignty school at tne time the National Government was formed, it dominated the ratifying conventions, it had been freely expressed in the 1-tdiral convention. The National idfea as it ^ now understood had to be worked out b> the harsh tests of administration It was not conceived at the time the constitution WHS made.” Equally good are his remarks on the great debate of between
Webster and Hayne. He ^two n«t spoke of the Union as it w'as in 1830, not as it existed in its infancy and during its rarly struggles. The Nation was no longer a mere compact, but a living, breathing, sentient organism. •	*	* The strict let-
ter of the law and the history of the country were largely on Hayne s side. He knew his ground and had made the most of it*; opportunities. V rbster. equally familiar with our history, knew the woak-niw! of the South Carolina doctrine as a^ fixed National policy. He knew that no. Government can be administered solel> on Its historv.** Hayne was looking back.
Webster 'forward.. The working elements of secession, sa>s li. Thorp*., '•were- State sovereignty, tree V * * slavery extension, and conlederai >.
Down'to 18ir, the ultras among e Sta sovereignty par tv complained that tne Government of the United States was con-soIidated. Then unti 1 18*’. the	nt
ran thyr the Government had ^opted a protective policy destructive to L outhc rn interest?. From this time until ist>n urn Federal Government was accused of seeking to exclude slavery from n<w soil.
The great problems resulting from the civil war, which we group under the term reconstruction.” are related with a full understanding of their importance. " The problem was nothing less than an adjustment of popular Government to the moral
order.''	,
Somehow w- have grown accustomed
since the civil war to neglect the history of the Commonwealths in the study of constitutional history. The triumph of the National idea in politics seems to have been reacted on the writing of history, lint in a dual system of Government like ours it is impossible to trace the constitutional life of the people without paying some attention to one of the two sets of Governmental instruments. Therefore it is with great pleasure that we comment on this feature of Dr. Thorpe's book. He shows the significance of State Constitutions as reflecting changes and growth in the body politic. State Constitutions are far more sensitive to .-hang* s in public opinion than the United States Constitution. The great number of State Constitutions adopted and the numerous amendments proposed indicate the existence of immense political ^activity among the oeople.
*	Tn the last chapter Dr. Thorpe summarizes his work and makes some general observations on the nature of civil government. The written Constitution, he s;iys, has been given the flexibility of an unwritten Constitution. It has been modi-1 ied t>y intrrprf'tation and amendment.
lie believe.6; it is possible lo interpret the data of history so as to account fully for the evolution of government. The most we can do is to discern tendencies. On Page .';4U occur!? a statement that would have given pain to the late Henry Thomas Buckle:	“	History	is	not and cannot be
^oiontific.' Dr. Thorpe means by thin that we cannot get all the facts, and can never be sure tnat our conclusions would hold good if more facts were found out.
