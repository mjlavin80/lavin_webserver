Sicily as a country of sunshine and color and the abiding place of many reminders of Greek* Roman, Saracen, and Norman civilizations, is not the least interesting of the corners of the earth. The present volume, therefore, made up o£ an llshwoman*s observations of the island and" its people as they now are Is one which provides in a very informal and personal way both information and entertainment. Mrs. Alec-Tweedle has followed no set plan or itinerary. She describes the journey from Paris to Palermo by train de luxe, the quaint customs of Sicilian rustics, the unpicturesaue changes which modem conditions are working in those customs. She tells of the carnival, of the infernal nature of the *' scirocco; of a tailors’ ball she attended, (where the gentlemen were most gorgeously attired in Old World garments and the dancing was gracefully and decorously done,) of street scenes, of the crowds in the mar-feet places, of a real Sicilian eating house, of Sicilian smart society gathered at its great functions. Incidentally the author relates a true story of brigandage, of an Englishman of her acquaintance who was captured, taken off into the mountains, and held for ransom exactly in the fashion familiar in less veridical narratives. The , victim had to pay some £5,000 ransom, and did not enjoy his captivity or find his captors gay.	•	--	.	i
There's much, too, about the various
famous ruins lime the Greek temple at Segesta, of which an excellent photographic plate is provided, and of course lotteries, the Mafia, and the superstitions of the gettatura, or evil eye, come in for curious mention. Of the last it is said: Some vears ago a man M Messina who hld they ^l lye died mjddenJy as he itARBPd down the Corso Garibaldi. The c£mSon belief is that he died because he looked in a mirror and was powerle^ to save himself from the evil influence of his
own eye. ’
One day this spectacle offered itself at
the Palermo market:
At each restaurant a string of people was marching up to the counter, every customer carrying a large roll of toeaji in his hand. The salesman	r?,“’
split it through the centre almost to the end, but not quite, so that it an oyster shell. Seizing a spoon, he It with white curds made from goat s
milk, which he jabbed d07^^tAhech£Se part; another spoonful of grated cheese was plumped on the top of that, is)lice of liver came next, _^^tl.*ken most strange of all—a ladle of boiling °*1 spread over the whole to amalgamate the Ingredients; the top and bottom of the roll were then squeezed together, and the savory morsel was ready for consumption.
Then it appears tha.t the SlciliaJi theatre
managers have a very convenient custom;
An ordinary play, neither very good nor very - baa, has an ordinary playbill and an ordinary audience. A representation which is fit for the eyes and ears of young ladies is called a white night, and all the girls and boys of the town are taken to see it; but a black night is an entertainment considered, unfit for the youthful or virginal mind. Those black nights are, of course, the most popular; men literally clamor for seats.
Such nights are indicated by having the playbills bordered with black—and " sometimes the black border is merely a bait to attract a good house ”—the play Isn't I realty bad at all. You never can tell till
you get there.
Among other matters in the book the author has included a sort of sketch of Sicilian history—a most picturesque and romantic field—and she describes also a visit to the estate of Bronte, which was conferred upon Lord Nelson along with the title of Duke. The present Duke of Bronte is the Hon. Alexander Nelson Wood, whose father, the late Lord Bird-port, inherited it " through his mother, Lady Charlotte Nelson, sole heiress and direct lineal descendant of the Admiral."
