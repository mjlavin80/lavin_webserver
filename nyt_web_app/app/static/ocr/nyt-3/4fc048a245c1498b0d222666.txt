S	SYDNEY SMITH also among the prophets V Are we to count the wit of the Whig drawing rooms, the journalistic professor of moral philosophy, the forgotten composer of obsolete pamphlets, among the coryphei of English literature? This is the question which is raised by the title page of Mr. Russell's hook, and is scarcely answered in its last sentences. Mr. Russell indeed appears to be skirting it throughout his treatment, but he never faces it manfully, and is content to lay stress on the highly moral and beneficent activities of his hero.
In fact, the fame, such as it is, of Sydney Smith is a remarkable testimony not so much to his own merits even as wit and diner-out as to the importance of the salon in determining reputation in English circles, almost up to the present day. Men owed name and fame, and often preferment, not alone to their particular merits, but to the partiality of that domineering patroness of letters, Lady Holland. People laugh, even to the present day, at Disraeli’s dandyism, but he knew what he was about in seeking reputation at the mouths of canons and other dignitaries of society. In a similar manner Sydney Smith was shrewd enough to know that his future in the Church depended as much upon his social charms as upon his erudition, which was slight, or his piety, of which he made but little profession. Both in Church and in letters he owed his position to society.
For this he had a remarkable facility and power of repartee. With Theodore Hook and Douglas Jer-rold he is perhaps the best-known English wit of the nineteenth century. Curiously enough, his power Is shown more in impromptu repartee than in written disputation. It was he who said, " Let us put* our heads together and the thing is done " when it was suggested to the canons of St. Paul that a wooden pavement should be made around the sacrcd building. His was the immortal response " Whose'/ " when recommended to take a walk upon an empty stomach. He it was who when he felt heated at a clerical dinner called the footman and asked him to open a window at the "back of some curate* It was Sydney Smith who declared that for the first time in his life he understood the meaning of the word grotesque when he saw Mrs. Grote ^ecorated with
one of the turbans of the period.
If we can accept Aristotle’s definition of wit as well-bred insolence, Sydney Smith afforded typical examples of it, though, as Mr. Russell points but, and as is shown by the examples given above, none of which is reported by Mr. Russell, the good-breeding was sometimes absent.
All, or nearly all, of this, however, disappears when Sydney Smith takes his pen in hand. He writes with fatal facility, but has the commonest ot common sense, he is on the right side in most discussions of the period, he Is, like a good Whig, for liberty, retrenchment, and reform, he aided in getting Catholic emancipation, and in the reforming of the House of Commons. But all these highly creditable qualities do not save his literary soul or canonize him among English men of letters.
Mr. Russell in an obscure way feels thte and attempts ,to justify the position of his hero by more copious quotations than have yet been included in any volume of the series. In fact, his volume may serve a useful purpose by bringing together almost all of Sydney Stnith that any one nowadays would care to read, including his one great success, the simile of Mrs. Partington and the mop, given hero in full, and rather poor reading it makes:	.
I do not mean to be disrespectful, but fcie attempt of the Lords to stop the progress of Reform reminds me very forcibly of the great storm at Sld-mouth and of the conduct of the excellent Mrs. Partington on that' occasion. In the Winter of I8*<24 there set in a great flood upon that town—the tide rose to* an incredible height—the waves rushed in upon the houses, and everything was threatened • with destruction. In the midst of this sublime and terrible storm, Dame Partington, who lived upon the beach, was seen at the„doOr of her house with mop and pattens, trundling her mop, squeezing, out . the sea water, -and vigorously ~ pushing away thi - .• ... - ► ■ • '-ti'

; A..antic Ocean* The Atlantic was roused. Mrs. Partington's spirit was up; but I need not tell you that the contest was un-epual. The Atlantic Ocean beat Mrs. Partington. She was excellent at a slop or a puddle, but she sh^u^u not have meddled with a tempest. Gentlemen, be at your ease—be quiet and steady. You will beat Mrs. Partington.
Indeed, it is a grave question whether it was not John Tenniel’s resuscitation of the simile in one of his Punch cartoons that gave it renewed vitality. Or, let us take Smith at bis best in a more colloquial mood; your wit generally turns out best when encountered • in a dressing gown. Here is a passage developing the sort of joke that Sydney Smith almost made a specialty of, hitting off a heap of foibles in a good'humored way:
Luttrell came over for a day, from whence I know not, but I thoueht not from good pastures, at least he had not his usual soup-and-pattia look. Tfc-eca was a forced smile upon his countenance which seemed iO indicate plain roast and boiled; and a sort of apple-pudding depression. as if he had been staying with a clergyman. s * * He was very agreeable, but spoke too lightly, I thought, of veal soup, I took him aside and reason&d the matter with him, but In vain; to speak the truth, Luttrell is not steady fn his judgment on dishes. Individual failures with him soon degenerate into generic objections, till, by some fortunate accident, he eats himself into better opinions. A person of more calm reflection thinks not only of what he ij censum-ing at the moment, but of the soups of the same kind he has met with in a long course of dining, and which have gradually and justly elevated the species. I am perhaps making too much of this; but the failures of a man of sense are always painful.
Is stuff like this sufficient to qualify a man to a place among the English immortals? If so, the slopes of the English Parnassus are very gentle, and the ascent to the house of fame can be achieved without much acceleration of the pulse. Finally let us quote a passage which has some pertinence at the present moment, and was originally addressed to the Inhabitants of the United States;
We can inform Jonathan what are the inevitable consequences of being too fond of giory: Taxes upon every article which enters into the mouth or covers the back or is placed under the foot—taxes upon everything which it is pleasant to see. hear, feel, smell, or taste—taxes upon warmth, light and locomotion— taxes on everything on earth and the waters under the earth, on everything that comes from abroad or is grown at home—taxes on the , raw material—taxes on every fresh value that is added to it by the industry of man •—taxes on the sauce which pampers man’s appetite, and the drug that restores him to health—on the ermine which decorates i the Judge, and the rope which hangs I the eriminftl—on the poor'man’s salt, and the rich man's spicc—on the brass nails of the coffin, and the ribands of the bride. At bed or board, couchant or levant, we j biust pay—the schoolboy whips his taxed top—the bearmess youth manages his I taxed horse with a taxed bridle on a j taxed roaa—and the dying Englishman, ; pouring out his medicine which has paid I 7 per cent, into a spoon that has paid per cent., flings himself hack upon hfs chintz bed which has paid 21! per cent.. And expires in the arms of an apothecary Jwho has raid a license of £100 for the privilege of putting him to death. H:s whole property is then immediately taxed from 1! to 10 per cent. Resides the probate, large fees are demanded for burying him fn the chancel: his virtues are handed 1 down to posterity on taxed marble, and ! lie is then gathered to his fathers—to be taxed no more.—Review of Seybert’s ■r America *’ in the Collected Works.
: This is good fooling enough in its way, fr>ut i doubt if the editor of The Oshkosh Times would admit the whole of it without fre** use of the blue pencil. Rut, argues the heaven's advocate^ for I confess I have hitherto been representing the other quarter of the universe—was not Sydney Smith the projector of The Edinburgh R eview, and thus fn a measure the father of- periodical literature? Even to .this It might be relied that The Speeta ‘"tor and The Guardian existed before The Edinburgh Review, and that if Sydney Smith proposed it, it was Lord Jeffreys who carried it out. But after all it cannot be claimed that reviews art literature, though occasionally the literature of Macaulay, Pater, Morley, and Myers appears in re\*iews.
There can be little doubt that Sydney Smith does not deserve the niche they have here given him in the temple of literary fame. That after all is scarcely Mr. Russed's fault. It was Mr. Morley’s choice as editor of the series that gives Smith his undeserved position. And if ■Mr. Alorley made a misi?Jce in selecting his subject he has shown his editorial wisdom in his choice of author. No one is better suited to treat of the great Yv nig wit than such a representative of the groat Whig family, the Russells. Having something of a conscience, Mr. Russel doe? not say much about Smith s literary qualities and capacities. He owns his absence of classical and theological erudition, Smith once attributed the Nunc r>imittis to the author of the Psalms, end Mr. Russell owns that in most questions of taste and art Smith was the veriest Philistine. It is true that Mr. Russell give^ a very elaborate analysis Of Peter Plyml^'s letters, the only production of Sydney Smith's which can be dignified by ihe name of a work, but apart from that he gives more the social and political environment of Sydney Smith's life, and by so doinc makes the volume by no means uninteresting or unsuitable for general reading. Rut when he comes to what he calls the conclusion of the whole matter he practically says not a word of Sydney Smith as a man of letters. Let us hear his summing up:
It is, in my judgment that Svdney Smith was a patriot of the noblest and
purest type; a genuinely religious man according to his light and opportunity, and the happy possessor of a rich and singular talent which he employed through a long life in the willing servlc* of the helpless, the persecuted, and the poor.
To all thfs the devil's advocate mus5 reply that there are many men even iri the numerous family to which Sydney Smith belongs who have had the same qualities and yet did not thereby deserve a separate monograph in the series of
English Men of Letters.”
