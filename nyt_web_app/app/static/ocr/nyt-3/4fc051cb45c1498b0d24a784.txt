“ Love's I.aborts Lost ” is generally con-coded to be the least Interesting of Shakespeare's plays, in spite of the mans of criticism that has been bestowed upon it; but Dr. Furness gives a fillip of interest to his recent variorum edition of H by his introductory remarks as to the state of Shakespeare’s text in general. The often repeated statement that it is pitiably corrupt he absolutely disproves.
This whole question of texts, with their varying degrees of excellence, which has endlessly vexed the Shakespearean world, has gradually subsided until now it is fairly lulled to a sleep as grateful as it is deep. • *	• The number of lines in
Shakespeare’s dramas and poems, as given in the Globe Edition, has been computed to be one hundred and fourteen thousand four hundred and two. n 14.40-.) The editors of that edition were prudent In their use nf the obelus, and wisely preferred to prefix too many rather than too few. Indeed, there are not wanting critics who maintain that in many instances lines were thus condemned that admit of satisfactory explanation. The number of obeli gits, therefore, if at all. on the side of fullness. And yet, in all these hundred and fourteen thousand and odd lines, we find that those marked with an obelus, as hopelessly corrupt, number about one hundred 'and thirtv. which means lhat there is only one obstinately refractory line of passage in every eight hundred and *>ightv. * * * The sun is set, 1 believe, on the day when emendations of Shake-sprati-'h text will be generally accepted.
In conclusion, Dr. Furness quotes from Dr. W. Aldis Wright. " our best living Shakespeare scholar,” who, in his preface to his edition of Milton, remarks: “After a considerable experience, I feel justified in saying that in most cases ignorance and conceit are the fruitful parents of conjectural emendations.**
■SViih regard to Shakespeare's stage management, however, the practical aesthetics of the Elizabethan stage, the ignorance and impertinence of the editors are as yet unrebuked, In this very play (Act IV., scene :i> the stage direction “ He <i. p. Berowne) stands aside ” has in most editions been altered (quite unwarrantably. of course.) to “ He gets up into a tree.” The reason for this emendation is lhat Berowne subsequently speaks as if from above. To discredit the emendation, Furness cites HalliwelTs remark that on the rude Elizabethan stage “ practicable ” trees did not exist. Falsehood was never more patently used in support of truth. To cite only one of innumerable instances proving the use of solid set pieces, Mars-ton's " Fawn," printed in 1G0t>, has the stage direction (Act V., scene 1,) " Tiber io (limbs the tree and is revived above by Dulcimel."
The fact is that Shakespeare's stage was a skillfully adapted instrument of the poetic drama — far better than tlu- modern stage, and unexcelled by any in the history of the drama, not excepting the lireek stage, which it closely resembled in all particulars except size, and even here H may be questioned whfiher its very smallness and compactness were not :in advantage. The day is at hand when Shakespeare's text will have due prominence; and it cannot be many #*cades before his dram tUirgy will receive equally reverent atU niton. It is well worthy of it; for here us elsewhere n<- was a ctm-suninwti' master, and was working with tacili’Hs in all respects adinuat**.
