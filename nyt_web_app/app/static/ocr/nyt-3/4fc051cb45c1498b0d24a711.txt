Sir Henry Burdett’s ** Hospitals and Charities, 1905,** well deserves its subtitle,
«• a Tear Book of Philanthropy and Hos-pltal Annual."' It contains In a form which a copious indie* makes convenient of reference a wonderfully complete . record of hospitals and charitable undertakings not only in the United Kingdom, India, and the British colonies, but in the United States as well—the title, address, officials, details of staff, number of pa- . tlents, Income of each Institution, and in many cases much information besides. Certain chapters, besides, reviews of what has been done in different departments of relief—as the free dispensaries—during the past ten years; others deal with hospital administration, others with military hospitals, and so on. The whole Is contained in a small but rather fat 12mo. of over 00(7 pages.
