The hew edition of this book fortunately retains the introduction for the first edition by Sir W. B. Richmond, in the course of which the writer touches on the “enjoyment of art’’:
; Enjoyment, to be complete, must combine the senses and the intellect—in the nature of things a rare combination. To have enjoyed a work of art to the full , implies that the aesthetic sense has been satisfied in conjunction with the faculties of reason. Jt is by patience, prolonged study of a few works of art, either literary, plastic, or musical, that the whole nature is satisfied.
The thirty-eight tinted half-tones in the book include reproductions of the work of Raphael, Botticelli, Fra Angelico, Bellini, Titian, Michelangelo, Luca and Andrea della Robbia, Orvietto, Bargello, Tintoretto, Donatello, Mantegna, and others, principally presenting Biblical subjects. The book Is printed on handmade paper, in clear modern English type, wiU* deckle and uncut edges.
