Margaret Potter’s New Novel of American Social Life, “ The Fires of Spring.1"
N “The Fires of Spring" Margaret Potter. without much doubt, hap attained the Mecca of the popularity seeker—she has produced, that Ip, " a strong novel '*— though why, In the act xof dcing so, she should drop the Horton out of her name is not divulged. Perhaps it was for the purpose of making her own identity as vague as the title ot her book, for who would suspect that such a poetic, airy combination of words is intended to describe a lurid sermon upon the unwisdom of worldly mothers, Who, regardless of the sleeping fires of youth, urge on their daughters to make loveless marriages for the sake of money or social position, and then stand helplessly aghast at the unpleasant consequences worked out by Dame Nature.
In the beginning- Miss Potter manufactures a particularly dangerous state of affairs by marrying Virginia Merrill, a refined young maiden hardly out of school, to a slout, elderly millionaire of rather smudgy reputation and absorbed in the unromantic business of making plows, and then adding to their manage, as a. daily contrast to the commonplace husband, his notoriously fascinating and polished cousin. Naturally there follows a tale that might very well be bound in yellow covers and called by that once
shocking phrase—a French novel. At any rate there are few eU.ments of the conventional French novel lacking in it, with the exception of the admirable grace of slyle that so frequently palliates the unsavory mutter in Gallic production of the same tenor, Virginia has never thought of loving thn millionaire, but enjoys the attention she receives as his prospective bride. She enjoys the lavish preparations for her wedding, and is not at all annoyed, during the few weeks of her engagement. by manifestations of her fi-ancfi's tenderness for herself. Her mother, who has engineered the whole affair witlw admirable skill and for the avowed pur! pose of insuring her daughter’s escape |
1	from the family impoverishment and the agony of trying to keep up elegant api pearances upon little or no income, is j really a woman of some heart ajid is ! represented as tortured by misgivings, though not to the extent of breaking off I the marriage. So, for three months, Yir-glnia revelea in thj childish joy of being suddenly a perron of great importance, ' is married with the proper amount of gorgeousness, embarked for her tour on the Lake Shore Limited—eastward bound I —and before dinner is over regards her newly acciuired husband with a well-developed feeling of disgust. She had never realized his part in the proceedings until she had an opportunity to see him audibly eating soup.
A veil is drawn over the honeymoon of the ill-fated pair, and the second act of the drama opens in the dull little Chicago suburb, where Is situated Mr. Van Stud-diford's plow faetory and his country home. Cousin Philip appears on the scene, artfully practices his very much- I worn wiles upon the Inexperienced, bored, and neglected wife, and the “ great situation ' of the book develops with alarming rapidity—to the reader, though the actors themselves are represented as wasting ; several months in coming to a realizing sense of what has happened to them. Philip, having passed unscathed through something less than a thousand heart episodes, to which he hud contributed nothing worthy of the name of love, and having meant to play the same selfish game with Virginia, is particularly loath to assume ttie rOle which Miss Potter has marked out for him, viz., to take his place among such lovers as Paris, Launcelot, Paolo. Dante, and the few others whom history has elected to call fit subjects for heroic tragedies.
It is perhaps this high-flown view of her caddish villain (one can hardly get rid of the feeling that he is the hero in her eyes) that puts the reader out of all sympathy with Miss Potter's latest portrayal of human frailties. Virginia and her mother do retain to the story’s end some pretense to the ordinary decencies of life, but the men are both too brutally commonplace to dignify their all too apparent moral obliquities. Leniency of judgment has sometimes been the tribute paid by the world at large to superb instances of unlawful passion, but Miss Potter is mistaken in supposing that any of her characters are to such extent either grand or tragic. They are just commonly guilty, and their mode of life fs, to say the least, too un- : pleasant to make enjoyable reading, though It may be granted that the author of " The Fire of Spring ** is mistress of -an interesting, forceful style and has a rather unusual skill in the delineation of character. No one could call this story dull or badly written; but, recognizing what will inevitably be called its strength,
