“ Idyls of the King.”
A'tftr York Timr# Itook Rrriew:
Potonius—What do you read, my lord! Hamlet—Words, words, words.
These lines are the first that spring1 into the mind upon commencing the perusal of an article entitled “ Lancelot, Guinevere, and Arthur." by Julia Ma-gruder in the March number of The North American Iteview. Before the article is concluded, however, other feelings are bound to pi - iominate. Stripped of verbiage, the article undertakes to justify the guilty passion of Lancelot and the Queen and to place the soul of Lancelot, because " his honor rooted in dishonor stood," upon a higher plane than that of the blameless King. It is state<U;hat as Guinevere felt drawn to Lancelot previous to he]' marriage, that marriage was as nothing compared to the quasi-marriage with her lover. Divorce being prevalent today, it should have stepped in to free Guinevere. The obligations of marriage are as straw compared to the iron hands of passion, The one tiling omitted that might have been expected in this glorification of illicit love is the song of Tristram in the I^ast Tournament":
Free love—free field—we love but while we may.
The words are hushed, their music is no more.
The leaf is dead, the yearning past away. New leaf, new life—the days of frost are o'er;
New life, new love, to suit the newer day; New loves are sweet as those that Uent before.
Free love—free field—we iove but while we may!
Were it not for the high standing of the periodical in which the article appears
the superficiality of the writer's acquaintance with the “ Idvi*s " would render comment unnecessary. Of the allegory (or, Lis Van Dyke prefers to name it. parable) contained in the "Idylls” there is not one word. Of the apparent intention ot Tennyson in drawing Arthur to write an *' Imitation of Christ " there is no glimmering. The passage in the epilogue commencing
*	* * accept the old imperfect tale New-old, and shadowing Sense at war with Soul
may or may not have been read by the writer, but at least it is passed over with a wonderful blindness. She quotes Guiner
vert's ci-y—
He is all fault who has no fault at all as representative of the Queen’s mlhtl-a
mind which at that time, acording to the creator of the character, was obscured; for later, she says, (which of course Miss Magruder does not quote;)
The shadow of another cleaves to me
And makes me one pollution. *	*. •
Th9 months will add themselves and
make the years The years will roll into the centuries,
And mine will ever be a n:iine of scorn, j Further, her one hope is what Miss Ma! grudef laughs at, when suggested by the King—the hope that she might purify herself and in the great hereafter meet him and be his wife. Had space permit’ ted. we might also have had a sneer at
j Arthur's statement.
I love thee still.
Let no man dream but that I iove thee still.
Vet the Quoen. after the King has gone, blesses him for the hope that he has left her that
In mine own heart 1 can live down sin And be his mate hereafter in the heavens.
,	Ah, my God!
What might I not have made of thy fair world
Had I but loved thy fairest creature here'* It was my doty to have loved the highest; It surely was my profit had I known; ’ Tt would have been my pleasure had I seen.
We needs must love the highest when we see it.
Not I«incelot, nor another • • *
I must not scorn myself; he loves me Still.
Let no one dream but that he loves me st HI.
After the scales had dropped from her eyes, evidently Guinevere would not have agreed with her latest apologist: Lancelot certainly would not, for if in Arthur we have a picture of tho Sinless One, in
Lancelot we have a picture of a great sinner perpetually warring against his flesh.
Miss Magruder, as a novelist, should know that characters must be held to believe the statements that their creators put into tbeir mouths. Arthur's lo^u came suddenly as riding past he
Kelt the light of her eyes into his life Smite on the sudden,
and knew he could not finish his wurK unless ’'joined to her." Lancelot’s lovt? was particularly guilty: in addition to his obligation to his liege lord and sovereign there was his obligation to the man who trusted him and called him friend. Gu-wain's betrayal of Pelleas, compared to Lancelot's betrayal of the King, was "as

water unto wine.’’ Guinevere’s Jove fer I^ancelot wap not, as Miss Magruder states, the supremo love of her life. According to the passages quoted above it was tho most violent passion, but suc-cf.rdcd by a lo\c so serene, so confident thiit looking for no return in this wui Id
it whs content to await its full realization jn the next,
“The Idyls of lIk- King.” in reality an epic in twelve book*'', are frequently misunderstood on aeount of the haphazard way in which they are frequently both read and. printed. Ka^-h separate book is so wonderful that its relation to the others is often overlooked. The pictures are so vivid, the colorings are so perfect, the charactcrs stand out with such marvelous distinctness, that the parable is overlooked.
Dante has immortalized Paola and
Francesca; yet Francesca's love, even if
guilty, survived death, while Guinevere’s
passion vanished in the white light of
Arthur's forgiveness. Which was greater,
Arthur or Giovanni? Tristram’s sin is usually either minimized by a. magic potion
or condemned. The conclusion Is almost in notable that Miss Magruder half sympathizes with Tristram:
The ptarmigan that whitens ere his hour Woos his own end; we are not ungels here Nor shall be * * *
•	* * my soul—we love but while we may ; And therefore is my love so large for thee Seeing it is not bounded save by love.
How much sweeter was it when Arthur's knighthood sang before the
King:
Blow trumpet! He will lift us from the dust.
Blow trumpet! Live the strength and die the lust!
Clang, battle axe, and clash brand1 L^et the King reign.
1^1 every one who wishes to obtain a true knowledge of the ^Idyls" at least read the review in The Contemporary Review for May, 187*1, which the present Ijord Tennyson states was inspired and approved by the poet himself.
