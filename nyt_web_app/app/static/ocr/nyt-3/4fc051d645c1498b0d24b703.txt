Although the exquisite poetic quality of Mr. Yeats’s “ The Countess Cathleen ’* would hardly be entirely manifest in the theatre, under even the best conditions, it is not impossible that this play, if presented by a company of actors all equally skillful, would gain an impressiveness which it lacked at the Madison Square Theatre yesterday afternoon.
Miss Wycherly is to be commended for a painstaking effort in a direction which i does not involve a mere seeking after no! toriety in prurient, morbid, and decadent ! drama. But she is an actress who up to the present has developed no great breadth of expression, and who is, there-1 fore, only mildly interesting even at her best. She has a pleasing and sympathetic voice, but no such variety of expression as is needed to convey the melodious color of Mr. Yeats’s richly imaginative verse.
The drifting vagaries of Celtic superstition are again revealed in this play, although Mr. Yeats, we believe, admits that he first found the tale in a volume of French folk tales. -It is a time of starvation in Ireland. The opening scene is the interior of a small inn, and here come two demons, disguised as merchants, to buy for gold the souls of the poor folk who are dying of starvation. In this quest they encounter little opposition until thej-meet the Countess Cathleen, who in the drama typifies the perfection of womanhood. She stands between the demons and the people, giving food and help to all who come to her. Finally, however, the demons steal ali her money, leaving her helpless to face the needs of the suffering people who press about her, crying aloud for help.
In the last act the demons are again
seen engaged in their traffic of souls, and
the Countess Cathleen, moved by the
misery about, her, comes to bargain like the rest. But she demands more than gold. Her price is nothing less than the freedom of all the souls that have been bought and enough gold to end the famine. The bargain is made.
“ Sign with this quill,” says one of the demons, “ plucked from the^ cock that crowed when Peter denied his Master." As the Countess Cathleen affixes her name to the paper there is a flash of lightning, and from afar off come the cries of lost souls. Then the demons disappear, and Cathleen falls dying, while the groans of her people rend the air.
When the final curtain rises the Count-
ess Cathleen, carried to the throne of God, lies at the feet of an Angel of Mercy, who announces that the Almighty “ heeds the motive, and the deed regards not.”
This picture, as arranged by Miss Wycherly, is extremely beautiful, and, Indeed, her production throughout reveals genuine artistic feeling. Her company, however, does not meet requirements which would, tax any but the most sympathetic and gifted players. Of the supporting players Adelaide Alexander as the Angel, Caroline Newcombe as Teig, and Charles Gibney as a Demon were the least disappointing.
