That lower left-hand corner of Illinois, where the Ohio and the Mississippi meet, is a land whose capital is Cairo and whose name therefore is Egypt. It is geographically and ethnologically different from, the rest of the great commonwealth, the pride and glory whereof is Chicago. Mr. PeaKe’s book is made up of scenes from this western Ilgypt strung together upon a rather slight (not to say trite> thread of story. The house of Hawley is the pillared and porlicoed foursquare u*ar.sion of Major Elias of that ilk, represented as a Virginian, who, for conscience’ sake, left his native land in the days before the war, manumitted his slaves and settled in a free State, but otherwise retained the habits and manners of life of his ancestors—especially the haughty and tempestuous temper, the free hand, the lavish hospitality, and inveterate clannishness which are regarded as the hall marks of the rural Virginian. To be sure the Major fought for his convictions in the Union Army, nevertheless he hated Republicans. For which reason he frowned hard upon Norman Colfax, a young lawyer of tint political persuasion, who was a suitor for the hand of a pretty granddaughter, the very apple of the patriarch’s eye. This young Colfax is a young gentleman of sterling virtue, courage, devotion, but notoriously careless about dress and (though the author does not seem to observe that point) somewhat lacking in good manners. Which does not prevent the pr«tty granddaughter from inclining a gracious pearly ear to his wooing. There then is the irreconcilable to be reconciled: It is done in the usual and natural fashion; youth must have its way, old age must stand aside.
However, the interest of (lie book lies not in the story, but in descriptive passages—one of a chase with bloodhounds after a negro housebreaker, twho has subsequently to be protected - from eager would-bo lynchers.) ore of a negro barn dance, rather boldly realistic; one of an electioneering expedition with politicians from Chicago in high hats intr. the very blackest hear^ cf Egypt. Mr. Colfax is in command; fhe driver is an obliging Democrat wh> knows ihe roads and is handy with a pur.. For the atmosphere is distinctly like that ol the brimstony region south of the Ohio, conducive to the quick ignition of gunpowder. You might almost (except for a telltale touch or two, as where the canvassing party takes a meal in a nr>Rrro eating house) think you were in Mississippi, Many of the little sketches and pictures, by th** ‘ way, are in fact as Southern as possible, and the ways and manners of the young women, the means they take for the proper goven mrnt of their elders, might be those current in any little Southern town just a bit to westward,
, where as yet machine-made modern wo-R men arc unknown. Of the eharacU rs,
I many—the old Major and his lazy, fat y eldest^son, (also a father,) and the Ma-jbr’s submissive and devoted wife—liave obviously been taken from life at pretty close range. And for the story, if it shows no particular art or invention, it , remains true that it la about the serf of thing which would have been likely to happen In the place* where the author"has chosen to plant it.
