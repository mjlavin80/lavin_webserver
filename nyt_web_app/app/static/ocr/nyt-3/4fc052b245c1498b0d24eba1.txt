A volume of criticism and poems is to appear immediately with the imprint of John Lane, entitled ** Otis.’* It is by the late Armine Thomas Kent, and was compiled by Harold Hodge. A memoir has been written for it by Arthur A. Baumann, in which the writer says of Kent’s literary productiveness:
Several causes co-operated against Mr. 1 Kent's living a strenuous and regular life. In the first place, he was a slave to that verbal fastidiousness which is common to all scholars and to those fn whom a sense of langiiage is abnormally developed. Had you offered him the salary of'-a Judge, I do not thinft that Kenticouia have written regularly or to order Tho journeyman work of literature was for him impossibly. Kent would. only Write when he had ""something to say,” as he put it.
