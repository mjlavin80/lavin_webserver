Besides Henry James's Autumn impressions of a New England revisited after many years, mention of which was made two weeks ago, The North American Review for April is rich in articles of vital interest. The Right Rev. Bishop of Albany, Dr. Doane, discusses *' Remarriage After Divorce:	Catholic Theory and
Practice ”; Karl Blind has a paper on*
The Comins Crash in Russia," and Willard French one on “ The Public School System in the Philippines.” The second article in the list or contents in Hannis Taylor's “ The American Law of Impeachment," and the seventh an exposition of " Germany’s Real Aim in Foreign Politics,” by Arnold White. Naturally the Schiller centenary is not forgotten. Wolf von Sehierbrand contributes the article upon that subject. Other important papers are two on " The New Monroe Doctrine,** one on the " Common Sense of the Railroad Question,” by Senator P. G. Newlands, and “ The Call of Lord Kitchener,” which is sfened “ Anglo-Indian '* merely.
