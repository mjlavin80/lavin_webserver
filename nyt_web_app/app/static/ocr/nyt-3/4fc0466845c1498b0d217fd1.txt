" Paolo Veronese ” and '* Burne-Jones ” are the latest additions to Newnes's Art Library (square Svo., boards, linen hack, half-tone illustrations, tinted frontispiece on Japanese vellum. New York:	Fred-
erick Warne & Co., $1.75). The volume devoted to Paolo Veronese has a sketch of Paolo Caliari, called Verenese, and his works by Mrs. Arthur Bell. Following this is a list of his paintings and their present locations. Then come the slxty-fotir illustrations in half-tone, reproduced from photographs. They include “ The Annunciation/’ ** The Crucifixion," ** The Queen of Sheba before Solomon," " The Conquest of Smyrna," " The Triumph of Venice,” " Adam and Eve,” “ The Resurrection,” *' The Baptism of Christ,” ** Christ Bearing the Cross,” '* Cupid," “ Finding of Moses,’’ ** The Magdalen," '* The Martyrdom of St. George," " The Battle of Lepanto," and others.
Mrs. Bell writes in her opening paragraph that Paolo Veronese, the last of the great group of Venetian painters, rivalled even Titian in the grandeur of his individual forms, and Tintoretto in the magnificence of his compositions.
“ In his work were gapiered up, as it Jgiire, all the manifold qualities which gave to the Venetian School its preeminence, as an interpreter of the sensual and emotional, rather than the intellectual or ascetic side of human nature, and his decorative pictures will ever remain among the most admirable illustrations that have Deen preserved of aristocratic Italian society in the middle of the sixteenth century."
Malcolm Bell provides the introductory essay for the book on Sir Edward Burne-Jones. He describes the pictures in the volume and tolls about the artist’s struggles for public recognition. Special attention Is paid to " The Mirror of Venus," ** The Depths of the Sea," "The Mill," “ King Cophetua and the Beggar Maid," “ Love Among the Ruins,’’ and several others in which Burne-Jones's " imagination soars to its highest culmination." It is impossible, Mr. Bell writes in conclusion, to judge of the merits of these paintings in black and white. " The fertility of invention, the truly passionate love of beauty, and the grace and refinement of design contained between these two covers might well have been left to speak for themselves, but on those, be they many or few, who have not as yet had the good fortune to meet with the actual handiwork of the painter it is not altogether h relevant to impress the fact that Sir Edward Burne-Jones was. if possible, even more commanding as a colorist, while there are technical subtleties, in his later work, at any rate, which no mechanical process can ever succoed in reflecting." This book contains, besides the tinted half-tone frontispiece " The Baleful Head,” fifty-six black and whites, including ** The Flowrr of God," "Morgan le Fay," "The Dream of Lancelot," " Love Disguised as Reason.’’
" The Days of Creation," “ The Seasons,*’ in four parts, " The Blessed Damosel," " The Wine of Circe.” &c.
