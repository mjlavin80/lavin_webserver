J Capt. Mayne Reid.
Xnxo York Times Booh Rev fete;	^
The communications of **. El Soltero " and William M. Sweeny relating to Mayne Reid and the popularity of his books wore read by me with much Interest. Mr. Sweeny, however, has been misinformed on two important points, which I hasten to correct.
He says that Mayne Heid “ lost his right arm at Churubusco, on the 20th of August," IS47. On this day Mayne Reid, then a Lieutenant commanding Company
B,	(the Grenadiers,) of the New York' Volunteers, led his bravo men in a charge on the Mexican Lancers, who were soon put to flight. The only mishap that befell him in this charge (or during the war, with one exception, soon to be mentioned.) is thus related by him in an un! finished autobiography which he left at [ his death:
“A broad ditch intervened between the ; highway and the field across which we j were charging. Thinking this was not very deep, as it was covered with a green scum. I plunged into it. It took me nearly up to the armpits, and I struggled out ail covered with slime and mud. The men avoided my mishap, coming to the road by a dryer but more roundabout path.’*
A newspaper correspondent and. eye witness says, in describing this amusing Incident: “ As Reid struggled out, covered with slime and mud, he was a sight for gods and men! ”
The other misstatement is that Mayne Heid himself said, speaking of the storming of Chapultepee, he " was the first man over the walls.*' Again quoting from the autobiography, the author says, speaking of the above attack on the castle:	'
“ The volley was almost as one sound, and I avoided it by throwing myself flat along the earth, only getting touched on one of the fingers of my sword hand, [proof that both of his arms were in their natural place,] another shot passing through the loose cloth of my overalls. Instantly on my feet again, I made for
tUe wail, which I was sccULngT when a. bullet from an escopette went tearing through my thigh, and I fell into the ditch.” *
Mayne Reid's Lieutenant, a young Frenchman named Hypolite Dordonville. was the first man " over " the walls, and he it was who raised the American flag over Chapultepec. The old castle was taken soon after this incident, and the next day the City of Mexico was triumphantly entered.
Mayne Reid was confined for many weeks in one of the hospitals of the city. The wound which he received in his thigh gave him much trouble, at intervals, throughout the latter years of his life.
The great popularity of the author's books is attested by the fact that nearly all of his forty volumes are in print today in England and other European countries, and many of them in this country.
Mayne Reid was eminently qualified for writing such books. He was an ardent lover of nature and a born naturalist. He made two trading expeditions up the Red River of the South, also one or more up the Missouri and Platte Rivers. With the red men he spent many months, trading his wares for their furs and skins, learning somewhat of their language and knowledge of woodcraft, sometimes lodging under their shelters, and eating by their campfires. With them and the White hunter for his tcachers, he hunted the buffalo and grizzly bear, trapped the ! beaver and otter, and lassoed the wild horse or mustang. On one of his hunting expeditions from St. Louis he was aecom-panied by Audubon, among others.
Little wonder, then, that a man of Mayne Kcid's powers of observation and experience in forest and prairie life should afterward take delight in writing for his ** boy public," as he often called his youthful readers, or that his books maj still be purchased (in many cases ha.If a century after their first appearance) In every large city.
