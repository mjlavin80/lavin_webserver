James Huneker’s new book, “ Iconoclasts:	A	Book,	of	Dramatists/’	which
Charles Scribner’s Sons are issuing today, opens with a 138-paged review of Henrik Ibsen’s work. It is followed by impressions and criticisms of the dramas of August Strindberg, Henry Becque, Gerhart ,^Hauptmann, Paul Hervieu, “The Quintessence ’* of Shaw, Maxim Gorky's ** Nachtasyl,” Hermann Sudermann, Princess Mathilda's play, Duse, and D’Annunzio, Villiers del Isle Adam, and Maurice Maeterlinck* Although most of the papers have appeared elsewhere, they are now recast and revised in such a manner as to give them a bid for permanent value.
He calls Strindberg " a man of genius, a crazy one at times, fascinating as a writer and interesting as a psychiatric study.” Becque is, “ as a rule, without charm"; but, whatever may be his deficiencies in the purely spiritual, he " will ever remain a commanding figure in the battalion of brilliant French dramatists.” “In the fis'ure of Gerhart Hauptmann,” writes the author in his chapter on that dramatist, *■* we encounter a man of genius, a man of European significance,
and more than the standard-bearer of
young Germany." Paul Hervieu is " a true Frenchman," a man “ with too large a head for his frame," and " a finely attuned intellect, a plentiful sympathy with suffering, a special sensitiveness to the soul feminine, combined with real artistry —though he despises mere technical dex-; terity—have all made Paul Hervieu the 1 present master-psychologist of the French stage.” George Bernard Shaw is called ** the Celtic superman, critic, novelist, Socialist, and preface writer." Sudermann is “too photographic,” he is more cerebral than emotional, more of a philosopher than a dramatic psychologist*" Eleanora Duse ^Huneker calls an “ extraordinary woman." But her “ art,” he says later, ” covers a multitude of D’Annunzio’s morbidities." He speaks of the Italian dramatist as " the Swinburne of I Italy." Villiers ** Is a mystic, a spiritual romantic, and only a realist in his sar- ; donic pictures of Paris life, tiny cabinet pictures, etchings, bitten out with the ‘ aqua fortis * of his ghastly irony. * * * The irony that withers, that blasts." The chapter on Maurice Maeterlinck closes the book, and. writing of his art, the author says that it " reveals the evolution [ of a mystic, the creation of a dream the- J atre, the master of a mystic positivism.” j His taste in creeds and cultures is ** eclec- ! tic,” and in this Maeterlinck " is the true man of the twentieth century, summing up in himself the depths and shallows, virtues and defects of cultured eclectic
