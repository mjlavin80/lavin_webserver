We arc glad Lhat the author of " Mod- j ern Industrial Progress" affords ua a , photographic chance to see what he Is 1 like, and still more glad that his auto- j graph reads:	“ Yours for Progression, ;
Charles H. Cochrane." We should prefer “ progress " to 14 progression," but that of course is a matter of taste. A man who can compile such a book as Mr. Cochrane has done ought not to be taken up because his views do not agree with yours.
Mr. Cochrane’s subject is large, and he has pretty well covered it. His book is as full of meat as an egg: and good meat it seems to be, too. He tells of the electrical marvels of the last decade, of Marconi's 11 victory over the ether,” of the conquest of the air—meaning, however, the first successful skirmish with the air ; by modern aeronauts; the evolution of the automobile; the development of naval vessels, and three baker's dozen of other things. What he omits can hardly be worth telling about. Do you wish to learn of the development of cold storage? There is a chapter on Modern Foods and Food preservation. Is it the method of making pictures for newspapers that bothers you? Turn to Mr. Cochrane's chapter on The Making of Newspapers and Periodicals, and ease your mind* Are you on a club committee that is debating the question of street cleaning; do you want to know what has been done? You’ll find lots about the subject in the chapter on Garbage and Waste Material. Anything else you want information onl ; Consult the index; you'll find something1 about it, if it stands for progress, In Mr. Cochrane’s book.
