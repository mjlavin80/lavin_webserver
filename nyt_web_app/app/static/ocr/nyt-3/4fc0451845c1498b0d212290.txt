A man worthy of the utmost rfspect was ill*' late Dean of the General Theological Seminary. Dr. Riley, Professor of Pastoral Theology and Rector of St. Mary's, gives in two volumes a " Memorial Biography " of this well-known clergyman. l)r. Hoffman, he says, was endowed with a simple and strong snul, and was a good youth, a good priest, a good ruler, a good husband, a good father, and good friend, and a good and wise master-builder. The founder of the American family of Hoffmans was from Revel, on the Gulf of Finland, and emigrated to America in 1057. Thf< Dean's grandfather was Harman us Hoffman of Kingston, who was a Captain during the Revolution. His grandson, Eugene Augustus Hoffman, was born in New York on March 21. 1820.
The boy's school days began in 1834. In 1R-J2, accompanied by his parents, he visited Europe and kept a diary. In 1843 he entered Rutgers College and was graduated in 1847. Home of his letters of the , time have been preserved, and they show " his Scandinavian nature, to be always i silent and unexpressive,” but to hide emotions does not mean that there is not abundance of human sympathy. After I graduation he sought further education and entered Harvard, as a member of the J senior class. Having a decided taste for scientific study, Hoffman accompanied Prof. Agassiz beyond Mackinaw. At Harvard Hoffman determined on the career of a priest. Then he entered into seminary life. He attended the General Theological Seminary in New York in 1848, becoming at the same time a candidate for holy orders in the Diocese of New Jersey.
His first rectorship was at Christ Church, Elizabeth. He was married in 1850.
In 1863, at the request of Dr. Odenhei-mer, the Bishop of the diocese, Dr, Hoffman accepted the position of rector I of St- Mary's, Burlington. In 1S6S he took the rectorship of Grace Church, in Brooklyn. Pour years later he entered upon tlie rectorship of St. Mark’s, Philadelphia. In 1876 a chime of four bells was placed on the tower of the church and the next year four hells were added. The ringing of these bells brought about much controversy, people living in Locust Street and the vicinity complaining of the noise made by the bells. The case was brought into court. The decree of the court was for the plaintiffs, but there was an appeal, which decrees that under certain restrictions the bells might be tolled. Under date of Feb. 27, 1877, Mr. Hoffman addressed a letter to The New York Tiiies defending the usage of the bells of St.
Mark’s.
In June, 1879; Mr. Hoffman resigned and made a trip abroad, visiting Egypt and the Holy Land. In October the Trustees of the General Theological Seminary of New York asked him to take the important position of Dean. His letter of acceptance bears the date of Nov. 15, 1878,
Short of the Episcopate there is no post of equal dignity in the American Church.
Dr, Hoffman was then in his fiftieth year. Humanity had been his book for many years, perhaps his chief book. For while Dr. Hoffman was always a reader, he never became a " booky " personage.
The author of the memoirs gives the history of the seminary, and tells how it grow and prospered under the management of the Dean. In April, 1902, on the occasion of the golden wedding of Dean Hoffman, there were many pleasing demonstrations of respect and affection. He died in June of that year.
