Comparative Architecture.
Architecture has been described very truly as the printing press of all ages, and it appears probable tbat in these days of enlightenment the study of architectural history will soon take its proper place as part- of a liberal education. It is 'surely remarkable that it should for so long have been neglected, for is It not the art with which every' one Is brought^ into daily contact, which shelters us from the elements and gives us “liome,'* which enshrines and illuminates the most sacretf -of onr thoughts, which is the outcome of conditions Intimately bound up with' the history of the human race, and,-finally, is It not the mother :of all * other a^ts, since from it sprang sculpture, painting, and the decorative crafts of the succeeding ages? The tim& spent in the study of the architecture of -the past will, therefore, nevep be, regretted, for every rutn tells of the history of other days, and enables the character and conditions* of. men of past periods to’be conjured up, thus opening wide vto, all, ptudents and lovers of old buildings the enjoyment of contemplating forms -tfhfeti will then have for them a meaning and charm. -
