RED GROSS I3SJ JAPAN.
Miss Ethel McCaul's Book About Hospitals and Sanitary Arrangements.	'
III I AX HAMILTON, who certainly knows what he talks about, says " that a new force has come to light in the world—that ot tho Jap-ancsp Infantry." Mis.s Ethel McCauI's " I’nder the Care of tho Japanese War Office.” following I>r. Seaman’s book, shows what mar- j velous process Japan has made in caring ! for the sick and wounded.	'
With the sanction of the Queen of England and permission from the Japanese 1 Ciovernment Miss McCaul, accompanied by Miss Elaine St. Aubyn, left England in March, l‘K>4. to inspect the work done by the Red Cross Society of Japan. Says she:
All I was privileged to see far surpassed my expectations. The Japanese are a. marvelously clever people, and their powers of organization extraordinary. Among their most distinguishing traits are economy and exactness; an economy without stint, and an exactness which involves the manifest attention to the smallest details. Their chief characteristic is patriotism, which Is carried out almost to fanaticism, and is, without doubt, the ruling spirit of their lives, every other feeling being willingly sacrificed.
At Tokio the first visit was paid to a Shinto temple, It was a day of festivity, and the author wonders at seeing such light-hearted people. In spite of the terrible character of the conflict with Russia. To the Japanese Minister of War the idea of two women going to the front seemed preposterous; nevertheless the thing was permitted by the Secretary, and the fullest preparations made for the safety and coiufort of the two English represonta* t'vt s of the Red Cross. A Japanese lady. Mme. Kuroda, was appointed as a companion, and showed herself wonderfully intelligent and useful. She acted as mI terpreter. for she spoke fluent English,
" but with a slightly American accent." Honors were lavished on the foreign representatives of the Red Cross. On one occasion Miss McOaul offered her congratulations on a recent Japanese victory. This wa-5 the reply:
We hope to be able to rejoice, but we must not do so over much yet; we must hide our thoughts and feelings for the present; our nation is still very young, and we are taught from our earliest childhood nt-ver to g-ive way to excessive feelings.
This lesson of self-control, the lady writes, may “ account for the quiet and unemotional way in which the troops take their departure for the front.”
At the Hod Cross Hospital the appointments surpassed in many ways European standards. Everything was neat ana orderly. There was a nurses’ training school, where sewing was taught. Here was a nation prepared to furnish ;;,00u fully trained army nurses, ready to supply all the bandages required for civil o*- military work, and all of them hand made. A visit pa'd the prisons revealed . not only humanity, but good common E s?r>“e.
Presently the three ladies left Tokio for Korea. At Hiroshima they met the first evidences of the war. Down the narrow streets wcro long strings of wagons and 1 rikishas bearing the wounded. Here is ! an instance of the reticence of the Japan- j esc officers about war movements; Two Japanese officers were leaving Hiroshima, whei an Englishman asked their destina- 1 tioi- Both refused to give any answer. : Then the senior officer said with marked politeness that they were under oath never to reveal their movements, adding:
“ This brother officer who is with mo, and a great friend, has no idea of my destination, nor I of his.” At Ujina, the Red Cross steamer, the Hakual Yaru, was ready to receive th^ ^nrty. Landing at Antong, in Korea, i. found that placs terribly filthy; from the author's accounts the Koreans live like pigs. The Japanese were doing their best to clean up the tilth of centuries. Miss McCaul writes:
In this quagmire I first became acquainted with what must always remain on my mind a vivid picture of marvelous endurance, cheerfulness, and herculean strength—that of the Japanese hand transport, for hundreds of heavily laden tittle carts were being drawn toward Feng-Hweng-Cheng by men taken principally from the coolie class, who could draw their burdens at least fifteen to twenty miles a day. To each cart were roped tvro men, while two more were free to push from behind. Tho carts were lightly hut strongly built, and on them were carried rice, tinned meats, prepared vegetables, dried fish, for the troops in the field.	‘
There were many wounded Russians, and the lady was impressed " by the medical officers* kind manners toward them.” The biscuits supplied the Japanese were made of rice flour, with a certain amount of wheat, and a few grains of millet seed, which helped to keep them moist. They were kept in well-sealed, tough paper packets, so as to protect them from flies and vermin. Eight of these biscuits, a measured portion of rice, " varied with

| pickled vegetables, salt fish, or tinned meat, form the soldier's daily ration." That most distinguished officer Gen. Ku-roki received the English ladies w'ith the utmost courtesy, and invited them to dinner. After the dinner tho guests went into what looked like a gxirden. all illuminated with lanterns. Here were shrubs, bearing beautifiil flowers, and notably chrysanthemums. By what magic had a waste pluce been converted into a lovely garden? The shrubs were cut brush and the flowers were of paper. To conclude the festivities there was an exhibition of Juggling, top spinning, and fan dancing. How could such a performance have been managed? in the army were to be found all tmdes and professions.
The hospital at headquarters was perfect. Every precaution was used to prevent the propagation of infectious maladies. There were sinks and boilers for sterilizing water. The doctor in charge explained everything. There were many craftsmen in the service who brought their ingenuity into play. Kettles, basins, and pails were made in quantity from the emptied biscuit tins. An order forbade the throwing away of such tins. All the ordinary utensils then cost nothirg. Everywhere were flowers, wild ones, arranged in vases, and the author was told that the flowers gave the soldiers more pleasure than books. Miss McCaul is not inclined to use any exaggerated phrases, but declares her aston-islj^nent at seeing such admirable work. Baflly fitting boots have often inflicted unnecessary torture and retarded rapid movements. The Japanese foot soldier has sandals given him which may replace the boots if they hurt his feet.
Even when on the march soldiers use wa{'*r which has been boded. To each regiment there are so many boilers allotted, and there is a stringent discipline about troops being- found drinking or filling a water bottle at a river. If a man is caught disobeying the order a mark is put against him, and at a convenient time punishment is meted out;
also it is noted as a serious crime at headquarters. At parting with her English friends Mme. Kuroda explained that demonstrations of affection were unknown in Japan, and added that " kissing was imported, you know; we have only recently learned it fiom foreigners.” The practical advantages to be derived from a study of the volume under review cannot be questioned. Is our own military hospital system as perfect?
