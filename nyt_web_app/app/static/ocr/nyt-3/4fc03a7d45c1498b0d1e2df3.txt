T MAY not be novel to the careful students of American history to be told that as early as May 1G, 1771, in North Carolina, the first armed resistance took place and the battle for Independence began, In a contest between the forces of the King and the Republicans at Alamance. Mr. William Edwards Fitch ^ in his volume, “ Some Neglected History ; of North Carolina." presents all the facts obtainable. The author calls the Battle of Alamance the first effort on the part of the Colonists to throw off the yoke of British oppression. This action, “ a momentous event in the great drama,” led up to tho signing of the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence." The date of the Battle of Lexington is April 10, t-775. The reason for both the contests was that the Colonists determined to oppose the Stamp act of 17GT». Personal dislikes had, however, much to do with the organization of the party called the Regulators, for the GoverAor of th£ Province, Ti-yon. was cordially hated. In November, liu«>, the man-of-war Diligence, accompanied by the sloop-of-war Viper, arrived at Brunswick with the stamps, for the Home Government had been informed that there would be resistance on the part of the Colonists. William Houston had been appointed as the distributor of the stamp papers, but he declined the task. The North Carolina Gazette of Nov. 20, 170u, describes some of the incidents of the time. In Wilmington, “ near Five Hundred People assembled in this town, and exhibited the effigy of a * Certain Honorable Gentleman,' and after letting it hang by the Nock for some Time, near the Court House, they made a large Bonfire, with a Number of the Barrels, and committed it to the flames.” Next all hands 'assembled and drank to " Liberty, Property, and no Stamp Duty.” It having been- learned that Dr. William Houston. Esq.. had declined to become “ tho Distributor of Stamps, * * * they placed him in an Arm Chair and carried him around the Court House.” There were open acts of resistance directed _toward the two men-of-war. It ma> oe tnat the stories of "the days are somewhat colored, but Mr. Fitch writes, “ The amazed Governor sought to conciliate the enraged Colonists by an ostentatious parade of hospitality. He caused three oxen to be roasted whole, a load of bread and several barrels of beer to be .provided as a feast for the common people.” But the common people threw into the Cape Fear River the roasted meats and the beer. A duel followed between one of the English naval officers and a Colonist. In which the latter v as killed. It was eight years afier this that the famous Boston Tea Party took place. William Tryon had held a position in the British Army prior to his appointment as Lieutenant Governor of the Province of North Carolina, in 1764. Mr. Fitch writes: iphfl Governor’s tastes and desires for luxurv were gratified in 11^1, lie carrjiijg out his scheme of taxing the co ony to erect a palace, and to accomplish his plans, he devoted all the intrigue of the politi-niHn and the boldness of the soldier bj taxing the Colonists £20,000 ($100,000) to buHd hi! palace at Newberne, the capital To a neople in an embryonic state of society, with but few resources and less money, this bold determination-on the	of	J;!|®

The abuse of power, the extortions of the petty officers brought about protests oa the part of the people. -The first advertisements of Regulators appeared in August. 1700. Their organization was of seme months before. Endeavoring to set their grievances before the Governor, he treated them with signal contempt. Then1 the Regulators, determined to offer armed resistance to the Governor and his followers. the ■* outrageous Judges, unscrupulous attorneys, dishonest Sheriffs, and 'thieving, villainous county officers, all . confederatesof the tyrannical Tryon; Governor'of the Province of North Carolina.” Finally the Regulators assembled at Alamance Camp# and once more sent a deputation to the Governor. Tryon would not give them a hearing, and what is worse is said to, have fired upon them “ with his own hands," killing Mr. Robert Thompson, ah unarmed gentleman, who was in camp Interceding for^the Regulators. Tryon’s order hook sttowsTihat he had made the fullest preparations for the reception of the Regulators,, for he-had cavalry and art!Uery. 1 Totally unprepared the Regulators were defeated. It is not easy to tell the ^precise number of men on either side. The Regulators .are supposed to have numbered 2,000,., the English 1,200. Nine Regulators were killed
. and twenty-seven of^the Royalists. As to the Regulators, the author writes:
By a few historians the war of the. Regulators has been .unjustly termed a re-

sistance to law and order, and not a fight against oppression; it has also been maliciously claimed that the Regulators were a band of outlaws, illiterate, common people. and that the better class of the colonists had nothing to do with them, and did not countenance their organization or the purpose for which they existed, all of which is utterly false and witTTout ihe slightest foundation.
Mr. Fitch accepts what is so often ignored, that-when the battle of Lexington was fought, the Colonists had no wish for a total separation from the mother country, nor was it thought of until 1776, but he adds:
Wg feel in duty bound, as a true North Carolinian, to do the Regulators and cheir cause justice, and the Colony of Massachusetts. with the glories of her Lexington, must j'ield precedence to the Old North State and her " Alamance,” where
the first patriots defied an army flying the British flag and gave up their lifeblood for American liberty and independence.
