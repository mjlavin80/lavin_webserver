■	The Smoke-Eaters-V * ;
HE Smoke-Eaters,” by Harvey J. O’Higgins, is one of those rare good treats that fall to the reviewer's lot just about often enough to present him from becoming a full-fledged pessimist. In it there is enough humor and pathos of a grim and rugged sort, enough tense life and excitement and thrilling heroism to make a dozen, more 01* less, of the ordinary run of hooks, and it is all told with a straightforward simplicity that well accords with the single-hearted devotion to duty of the men who, in their own parlance, " eat smoke and spit black buttons in other words, the New York City firemen.
New Yorkers are spasmodically proud of their firemen, they surmise that there are no better in the world, they know that it is a dangerous occupation, and they often wonder vaguely just why it is that men can always be found so reckless of their own lives that they will thus pass by the ordinary, comfortable ways of earning a living and voluntarily stand ready day and night to fight fire for others. But if they read these ten short stories in which Mr. O’Higgins has pictured the way life moved for Hook and Ladder Company No, 0, Captain Meaghan. they will have such a vivid, inspiring knowledge of the kind of men who make up the little army of “ blue-shirted jigr ger jumpers ” that their admiration will be no longer either vague or stinted. One reads this book with the double tribute of tears and smiles, mingled as naturally as Captain Meaghan’S men cracked their irresistible Irish jokes in the face of direst perils, and so thoroughly is the author in touch with his characters and with their unexcitable point Of View that the reader has to make a determined effort all along in order to rate Truck No. 0’s deeds at their true value. The “ Smoke-Eaters.” with the exception of a probationer now and then, spend very little time in looking at their work from other than the business standpoint, and ticklish situations and hairbreadth escapes develop too frequently fn their daiiy experience to receive the attention which singly they might command.
For instance, in the story called " The Red-Ink Squad," a little company of Capt. Meaghan’s men—four of them probationers at that—when trapped on the sixth floor of a burning drug factory came to a realizing sense of their position with ** We're up a tree," said soberly by Gallagher, and actually laughed at Sergt. Pim’s I got holes in my stockings,'* when they were told to get their boots off and form a line to crawl along a three-inch ledge to the next building. The Only one who couldn't laugh was an Italian probationer who in another moment went crazy with " fire fright " and dived headlong out into the street to his death. Even then the desperate remainder made ready In any but a tragic mood for their trying venture on the three-inch ledge. We read:
Gallagher tried to encourage tho others.
" And there was no need for it.” he said.
“ There’s no danger about getting out of here—not a bit. The same thing’s been done before. There was Rush did it. for the matter of that, at the Manhattan Bank fire. * * * Get your wind, now. There’s no hurry.'*
“No, what’s the use of hurryin*?" Plm said, grimly. “ Jordan's beat us down al! ready.”
:	That	is	about	the spirit in which all of
1 Mr. O’Higgins's heroes face death, hang | : all their hope of escape on one chance In ! spite of awful odds, and lead apparently j lost causes to victory. The one and only ! thing they never do is to give up, and no 1 soldier on the battle field fears the brand 1 of coward more. They may be rough, unlettered men. fond of rude play in off hours at the truck house, and past masters in the use of profanity, but at their wcrk they rise without exception to a courage and self-forgetfulness that are nothing icss than sublime. These stoiies show them in many guises, subject, iiki other men, to love, jealousy, hatred, malice, and all the other human attributes, and they all bear witness that their nuthor knows whereof he speaks. It is not too much to say that he has written the epic of the New York firemen, and not only arc they the best sort of stories abnut firemen, but some of them would stand as models of all that any short story should be—so compact, so restrained, and yet pcs.tessed of a vigor and’force that keep expectation keyed to the highest tension.
