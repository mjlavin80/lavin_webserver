Under this title Louis Windmttller will have a paper in the issue of The Collector and Art Critic of March 35. Mr. Wind-miiller speaks of the happy change in American interiors since the Centennial, and urges the removal of the present tariff duties on objects of art imported from abroad. “ Foreign artists,’’ he remarks, "are not excluded; their work is not taxed when it is produced here. Why Should we tax it when it comes from abroad? ” He calls attention, too, to America’s isolation in this matter of '* protecting1 ” home-made art.
