The editor of The New York Times Book Review has been asked for a list of the literary societies, associations, and clubs in the United States. There are many such societies In every larfje city- It is a poor town which has not one or two. But, so far as we know, there is no authentic list of American literary societies in existence. We should be glad to help in the compilation of such a list. To this end the Secretary of every literary society, club, or association In this country is requested to send a postal' card to The Nbw York Times book Review inscribed with hia 01* her name anfl address and the name of the society he or | she represents. Compliance with this re-i quest will be £rreatly appreciated.
