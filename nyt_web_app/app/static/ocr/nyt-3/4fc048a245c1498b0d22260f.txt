A LONG LIFE.
The Autobiography of G. T. Bromley, Whose Career Has Been Varied and Useful.
. GEORGE TISDALE BROMLEY'S ” The Long Ago and the Later On ** is ftill of high spirits. It is an
autobiography, and in it there are " Recollections of Eighty Years." Mr. Brom-I ley seems to have had a good time and laughed at the tricks of fortune. He was j born at Norwich, Conn., in 1817. When j he was a boy, shoes were not made in i rights and lefts: the youthful wearer was in fact admonished to shift his shoes every day, *' In order that they should retain their shape until the end." At school lie paid some attention to his studies, though he writes. ** my school hours were full of stirring events in my efforts to avoid the sciiooinouse during school hours.” At the age of ten, he was put to work in his father’s ropewalk turning the wheels. Since then Mr. Bromley has plied many callings, but his real start in life was as a whaler. In 1831 a fleet of sperm whalers returned to New London after a three years’ cruise. The lad offered his services as a cabin boy, and shipped on a seventy-five-ton schooner for the southwest coast of Africa, bound on a sealing voyage. After a successful trip he went before the mast as one of the crew of a London and New York packet ship. He remembers having heard an old wiseacre, a passenger on the packet, explaining why a steamer never could cross the ocean, the reason being that ** no engine could be so firmly secured in the bull of a vessel as to stand the strain of the heavy seas she won Id encounter in crossing the Atlantic.” The Oracle's hearers were of the same opinion.
Tired of service in sailing ships, the young man became a wood passer on the steamboat De Witt Clinton, plying between New York and Albany. “ A grand old boat she was for those days," writes Mr. Bromley; “having four tooilers, two on each guard, and four towering smokestacks, she was the pride of the North River.” Next followed a voyage to Vera Cruz. Jn 1837 he sailed out of New York on a cotton ship for Liverpool, Captain and mate were cruel tyrants, and when the chance came Bromley and a number of the crew deserted the vessel, and subsequently shipped on a small vessel bound for Providence. At home again the author took once more to steamboating, and presently to his surprise received a position in the San Francisco Custom House.
He made his first acquaintance with California in 1853. His experiences on the Pacific Coast were m^ny and diverse. Hf had to do with railroads, steamboats, politics, and he kept a hotel. At one time he was at the head of the Street Cleaning Department in San Francisco. He was a leading member of the Bohemian Club of San Francisco and made an acquaintance I Tvltli all the theatrical people. In politics ! he gained a reputation as a speaker on the Republican side. With the election of George C. Perkins as Governor Mr. Bromley was appointed Consul at Tien-Tsin.
! On his way thither he stopped in Japan. At Yokohama he had his first ride in a j jinrikSsha. Next he partook of a repast 1 composed entirely of eels, the pleasure j ! of the banquet being enhanced by the j fact that the eels were caught and skinned in the presence of the party.
Mr. Bromley found everything in TienTsin to his liking. There were plenty^of pleasant Europeans, who soon found out the amiable character of the newcomer. A visit of the Seventh Prince of China is well described. That royalty was on his way to Port Arthur. On the occasion of a reception held in honor of the Prince the American Consul made a bright speech, whicli pleased the Chinese. With the Viceroy, Li-Hung-Chang. Mr. Bromley was well acquainted, and this important personage was under lasting obligations to the American official, as this incident will explain.	«
I went with my Vice Consul to dine with the viceroy. In speaking of my being five years older than he, he in-qulred Into my habits and wanted to know If I drank much champagne. I said: “Not when I can get whisky, which I much prefer/’ This statement- seemed to make a great impression, on the Viceroy. Two years later I received a letter from my Vice Consul, who had remained there, i- saying that Li-Hung-Chang had taken to i drinking.whisky. I’think"that helped him make his lust trip round the world. He never could have done It^ bn champagne.
Mr. Bromley quotes an experienced missionary, who sgid that during fifteen years’ experience *' lie had never yet in all that time seen a Chinaman that was truly converted to Christianity,” and adds his own opinion, thus:
It Is my firm belief tnat this people will continue right on living hi tho religion that thcv have lived In for two thousand five hundred, years, t;ven .if the whole evangelical church, oi hjuvope and America !s turned adrift Into the empire and told to wade In. Nor do l jkeli&vctliatall th*: conversion- that could be pumped 'into
a Chinaman would any better prepare him for heaven than docs his unwavering devotion to Buddha.	j
During his second yen* in China the author went to Peking, and mei there John Russell Young, the American Minister. He also met Sir Robert Hart. With the change of Administration Mr. Bromley was recalled. Returning to the Unit- i ed States, he soon was at home in the city of his choice, £an Francisco. One incident shows Mr. Bromley's happy-go-
lucky character. He writes:
A quart er of a century ago I was sitting in my dining room alter breakfast, and wondering where I coufd borrow the money to pay my rent, when the doorbell was rung. My wife went to the door, and I heard her in conference with some man. Presently she came in and said it was a canvasser for names for the directory, and he wanted to know v/bat was my business.
“ Oh,” said I, “ tell him I am a capitalist.” He so recorded it, and it is that which keeps me in countenance to-day.
We fancy that Mr. Bromley Is also something of a humorist.
In hia eighty-eighth year Mr. Bromlev Is still hale and hearty.
