According1 to the sub-title of the little polume on ** Broadway,” (in the Temple Topographies, long foolscap Svo, cloth, extra, pp. 91. New York: E. P. Dutton & Co., 50 cents net,) Algernon Gissing has described a little village of that name In Middle England, which is the residence of some distinguished writers. He tells about Broadway Hill, the homes, the church, the roads, and the parish bounds, the roads, and the parish bounds.
Prom the hill can be seen thirteen or fourteen English counties. Broadway “is the heart and soul of England.” The houses are 'built of brick—oolite. The larger part of the village dates from Shakespeare’s days. The manor, from which Broadas sprung, was granted to the Bei*.-------tie Abbey of St. Mary
at Fershore by King Edgar in 967. The name of the village, Mr. Gissing writes, "originated in one of the ancient trackways* this point of which perhaps was of particular importance as the neck between the desolate woods and the fertile vale which formed the Welsh marches on this side Severn; As you look to. the hill . from the .village jjTcen at the western extremity the place still.eminently justifies ita n&irie^ but In. connection with this; the structure" of - the. village^ suggests a prob-. lem to ’those- curt bus hr ttHjelucid&tlon of ancient Itineraries.” • In King Edgar.'s iehSirtet- the : name appears as Bradan-: wege^v	•••••„. ■ v - ■'	~	'	•
