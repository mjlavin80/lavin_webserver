Mr. Oscar Fay Adams's “ Dictionary of American Authors " has come to us with the legend, “ Fifth Edition, Revised and Enlarged," stamped on wrapper and title page. The “ revision " consists of inserting the date of death of those authors who since 1807 have occupied the main part of the book and who have died since the fourth edition, and the augmentation of facts concerning the authors who since the first edition have been added to the “Supplement,” which now covers 147 pages. The "enlargement" means that the “Supplement !* has been extended lo Include a number of names whose bearers have in the past eight years become sufficiently well known to deserve a paragraph in “ A Dictionary of American Authors.” The names in the ** Supplement **' now number over 2,800, which speaks well for American literary activity. But what have those authors whose
names appeared, in the first edition been doing since 385)7? Apparently nothing except to .die. Deaths are made note of, but no new books. This places Howells, James, Twain, Wissln, Deland & Co. in a very unfortunate position. For all one ! may learn- to the contrary from ** A Dic-i tionary of American Authors *’ their pens for the last eight years have been absolutely idle.	-•
Mr. Adanist who is possibly as well known as some of the authors in his .books, modestly excludes his own name from thfc-collectlon. There is a great deal Jof him, however, in the brief bits of criticism which he drops here and there among well-known writers.. These criticisms suggest a far higher Ideal than the -selection of names. The preacher with
his single volume of sermons and the
writer of ~verse have evidently been care-.-fully searched for and found. Few havo escaped! Writers of ephemeral fiction have.not been; more-fortunate; V	,
