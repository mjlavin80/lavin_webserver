The title has nothing whatever to do with the story, and several of the pictures are excellent. .	.

Without doubt the motor car is the most picturesque, energetic, and altogether fascinating stage property of mod-odn fiction. Mr. and Mrs. 'Williamson, <whosc very delightful and successful “Lightning Conductor" is just reissued with illustrations.) have written another story after much the same pattern as tlie other. There are, however, variations. In the new story not only motors but mules and donkeys serve the ends of J the little Tjod, and the Dolly and Jack of the " Lightning ConductorM are transformed into matchmakers. Being safely married, what else is left for them? It’s this way. Montagu Lane, who is by way of being a belted Earl, though not opulent, has been most outrageously jilted by a girl who isn’t nice at all— though he thinks so. Dolly has a friend, an American girl, disgustingly rich, who is in the lowest possible spirits beeauSG i she thinks nobody will ever love her for herself alone. She hates men, and is touring Switzerland with donkeys. Wherefore Dolly snatches up Lord Lane, stows j him in her motor car, whisks him across France with fearful celerity, and sets him down also in Switzerland, ostensibly to climb mountains with only a pack mule and a muleteer for company.
Pursuing this programme (after a douc<? of a time finding a mule) Lord Lane has adventures. Particularly he finds at the inn called " Au Dejeuner de Napoleon because the great Emperor once break- I fasted there—a table spread with “ food I fit for the gods, and only a boy to eat it.” However, it*s not an ordinary boy. It’s pretty enough to toe a girl, and is accompanied by a female guide and two donkeys. Lord Lane and the boy becomo companions and friends in the wilderness*./.
