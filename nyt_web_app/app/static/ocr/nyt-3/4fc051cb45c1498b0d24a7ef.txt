Prof. Osier's humorous remark about the comparative uselessness of men older than forty years
has been taken up seriously in England, where that : distinguished man of science, wit, and letters will ]
labor and jest the remainder of his days. The Eng' j lish are really surprised to learn, from “ Who’s WhoV " that Prof. Osier has written half a dozen books since his fortieth year. One student of lit- ! erature has takeu the trouble to note that Rous- ! seau wrote the “ Nouvelle Heloise ” and the Con- 1 trat Social ” after he had completed his fortieth ; year; that Cervantes wrote “Don Quixote” after fifty, and Swift " Gulliver s Travels ” after fifty-eight. Goethe, Browning, and Tennyson all wrote ! notable works late in life; so did Adam Smith, Bacon, and Thomas Hobbes. But Prof. Osier's joke ! was a good one, and it was not all a joke, either.
