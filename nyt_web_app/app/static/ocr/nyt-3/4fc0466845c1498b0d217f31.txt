THfl CLOCK AND THE KEY. By Arthur Henry Veaey, author of a '' Cheque for Three Thousand," '1 A Pedigree in Pawn." Ac. 12 mo. Pp. 303. New York:

As a matter of fact the clock is tbtr key—the bey to a wonderful hidden treasure of the baser sort, the key also to the heart of a lovely young woman. It is a vei*y old and intricate clock, with quaint automata that pop out when the hours strike, and ft has lain idle for centuries, and many of the foolish figures have been lost or broken. Yet the secret which a mad artist cunningly put into it is still there for the patient and ingenious to read. The author therefore has inspired the young woman of the piece, who is modern and American, but a bit romantic, with a fantastic notion cf testing’her two lovers by giving them, after the old cus- ■ tom of chivalry, a quest; that quest the finding of a hidden casket, whose secret (though she knows it not) is kept by the ancient clock. One lover is fellow-man. an American, the other is an Italian, a Duke of most imposing exterior. To equalize matters the first has as helper a quaint dealer in antiques. Together these two study the clock, together they thread the waterways, and creep into the ancient palaces of Venice, now professing themselves illustrious architects " in search of the beautiful line, now disguised as carnival guests in mask and domino; together also they encounter and parry the unscrupulous tricks of the Duke, using to that end otiier tricks quite as unscrupulous. For the young American has been an idler and waster of golden hours in that Venetian land of lotus eaters, his
task is to convince a distrustful lady that he is a tail man of his hands, a man of, patience, persistence, and iron will. It 1 really makes a very good mystery story— one that keeps you straining forward for the outcome, eager to know what is the secret of the clock, where the casket is, whether tho lady will bestow her favor, after Jill, upon the winner. There’s not much love making, though it is Venice; and there’s no ugly work with knives. But hired spies in specious guise of gondoliers do shadow the hero, and the Du&e is bound and gagged on one midnight occasion (he had made felonious entrance into the hero's rooms) and once in broad daylight threatened and cowed with his own pistol.	.
