versica] forms which bear the same relation to poetry as the effeminacy Of anaemia, bears to glowing health. And it is verse that these poets of the " symposium ” are writing to-day, although their gravity would betoken a belief otherwise.
AH of which is irrespective of the question a« to whether poetry is read as much as before.” Is it not, however, very reasonable to concludc that the conditions which depress poetical production would atso depress poetical consumption? Nor is it at all likely that even real poetry would be read to-day if by some appalling anachronism it were to be written. An age bred upon I^aura Jean Libby and carmine *' extras ” is in no mood

Poetry vs. Civilization.
A’cic York Times Book Rciutc:
In tne current number of one of the mngnzines then* is a symposium of dc-
Urtable publishers and poets on the great and vexing subject, " The Dcciinc of Poetry.” Nothing coutd be more amusing or absurd than most of Hie opinions expressed. Of course it is manifestly silly, in the first plae--, to ask a " poet ” whether poetry is going back or not. As well ask your shoemaker whether custom or hand-made shoes wear longer. Do" you think the poor poet is going to snap anil marl nt the hand which feeds? Or docs any one imagine that the bump of conccit that mak^s phrenological freaks of each poit. great or small, known or unknown, would permit the faintest insinuation that poetry is no longer dai'y and divinely distilled and ravenously devoured?
None of the symposers ” seems to have read the observations on this subject by Macaulay. This person happened to scribble off an immortal essay oil Milton, in which he said in an immortal manner the first and last word on the point of debate. As " every schoolboy exccptmg of course the symposistic philosophers referred to—must have read Macaulay's remarks, it seems idle to quote them. In essence they are. that poetry declines as civilization advances, as arts and sciences crowd upon us; because the intnds of men—and some women—become more scientific, more practical, more unimaginative, therefore less poetical. Poetry ’.s the expression of those only who are, or who have first become, as little children. We are all wonderful poets at five, when we roam in a world of goblins and fairies, when the commonest incidents have all a strange and puzzling guise, when tho very ordinary house in which we live becomes a castle built by Aladdin's lamp.
No simile could be truer or indeed more fascinating than this, and amplification only adds strength to the conclU' sions warranted. "Were Macaulay living now he would find vast new arguments to support his views—views perhaps not wholly original in his pages. It was the particular glory of Milton, as the essayist says, that in a modem age he was able to write a great imaginative poem, defying conditions completely unfavorable to such poetry. Such rare instances " prove the rule.’* How can the imaginative faculty even smolder in these days, when cartloads of useless newspaper and magazine literature additionally conspire to ruin the mental tone, the very vitality of the brain, and kill all desire for reflection or contemplation, in which soil—and which alone—poetry flourishes.
Nor did Macaulay fail to note the perfectly natural paradox which marks the
improvement in verse while imaginative poetry declines. By a pathetic Inconsistency the writers of our age, while they lose all the power of deep epic grandeur, excel in those lighter, more correct, more mechanical, and more graceful
