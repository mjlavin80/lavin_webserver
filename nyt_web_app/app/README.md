# Review Type

I'm beginning with two categories: single_focus and other. Single focus reviews are meant to represent a typical book review. A single book is discussed, and some mix of summary and evaluation is present. Under 'other', I'm seeing things like: very brief notices, news articles about rare editions selling for great prices, letters from readers, columns on 'this month's issue of the Century', review of several recent books about X, etc.
